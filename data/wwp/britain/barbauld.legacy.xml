        <p rend="first-indent(0)"><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> late <persName>Mrs. Barbauld</persName> was one of the
<lb/>best friends of youth. In her <title rend="pre(“)post(”)">Early Les­
<lb/>sons,</title> and <title rend="pre(“)post(”)">Prose Hymns,</title> she has con­
<lb/>descended to apply her admirable genius
<lb/>to the instruction even of infant minds. Se­
<lb/>veral excellent pieces, adapted to children
<lb/>of different ages, she contributed to <persName>Dr.
<lb/>Aikin's</persName> <title rend="pre(“)post(”)">Evenings at Home.</title> That elegant
<lb/>volume of verse and prose <title rend="pre(“)post(”)">The Female
<lb/>Speaker,</title> was compiled by her for the use
<lb/>of young ladies, for whom she also made
<lb/>a selection from the Tatlers, Spectators,
<lb/>and Guardians, prefixing to it an instruc­
<lb/>tive and beautiful Essay. In other of her
<lb/>productions she has given valuable advice
<pb n="iv"/>
<milestone n="A2v" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">iv</mw>
<lb/>to parents on the subject of instruction; and
<lb/>her <title rend="pre(“)post(”)">Poems</title> contain many pieces worthy
<lb/>to be early reposited among the choicest
<lb/>stores of an elegant and ingenuous mind.</p>
        <p>Many young persons of both sexes par­
<lb/>took, during the course of her long life,
<lb/>of the benefit of her personal instructions;
<lb/>and in the present volume she may be re­
<lb/>garded as continuing even from the grave
<lb/>to delight and improve the rising genera­
<lb/>tion.</p>
        <p>These pieces were found among her pa­
<lb/>pers by the members of her own family.
<lb/>Some of them enforce moral truths; others
<lb/>contain instruction in history and other
<lb/>branches of the graver studies of youth;
<lb/>but the greater number are of a light and
<lb/>elegant cast, adapted to exercise the inge­
<lb/>nuity and amuse the fancy while they re­
<lb/>fine the taste. Those in the form of letters
<pb n="v"/>
<milestone n="A3r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">v</mw>
<lb/>were all addressed to different ladies whom
<lb/>she favoured with her friendship.</p>
        <p>Had she herself presented these pieces
<lb/>to the public, it is probable that she would
<lb/>in some instances have extended them by
<lb/>additions which, from her own pen, would
<lb/>have enhanced their value, but which it
<lb/>would have been presumption in any other
<lb/>to attempt. None of them, however, can
<lb/>properly be called fragments: and it was
<lb/>so natural to her to express herself with
<lb/>the highest beauty and perfection of style,
<lb/>that in this respect little difference would
<lb/>be found either in verse or prose, be­
<lb/>tween the slightest sketch she ever traced
<lb/>and the most finished of her admired pro­
<lb/>ductions.</p>

        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">I have</hi> often reflected, since I left you, on
<lb/>the wonderful powers of magic exhibited
<lb/>by you and your sister. The dim obscu­
<lb/>rity of that grotto hollowed out by your
<lb/>hands under the laurel hedge, where you
<lb/>used to mix the ingredients of your incan­
<lb/>tations, struck us with awe and terror; and
<lb/>the broom which you so often brandished

<lb/>in your hands made you look very like
<lb/>witches indeed. I must confess, however,
<lb/>that some doubts have now and then arisen
<lb/>in my mind, whether or no you were truly
<lb/>initiated in the secrets of your art; and
<lb/>these suspicions gathered strength after
<lb/>you had suffered us and yourself to be so
<lb/>drenched as we all were on that rainy
<lb/><name>Tuesday</name>; which to say the least was a very
<lb/>odd circumstance, considering you had the
<lb/>command of the weather.—As I was pon­
<lb/>dering these matters alone in the chaise
<lb/>between <placeName>Epsom</placeName> and <placeName>London</placeName>, I fell asleep
<lb/>and had the following dream.
</p>
        <p>I thought I had been travelling through
<lb/>an unknown country, and came at last to
<lb/>a thick wood cut out into several groves
<lb/>and avenues, the gloom of which inspired
<lb/>thoughtfulness, and a certain mysterious
<lb/>dread of unknown powers came upon me.
<lb/>I entered however one of the avenues, and
<lb/>found it terminated in a magnificent por­
<lb/>tal, through which I could discern con­
<lb/>fusedly among thick foliage, cloistered
<pb n="3"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">3</mw>
<lb/>arches and Grecian porticoes, and people
<lb/>walking and conversing amongst the trees.
<lb/>Over the portal was the following inscrip­
<lb/>tion: <quote rend="slant(italic)">Here dwell the true magicians. Na­
<lb/>ture is our servant. Man is our pupil. We
<lb/>change, we conquer, we create.</quote></p>
        <p>As I was hesitating whether or no I
<lb/>should presume to enter, a pilgrim who
<lb/>was sitting under the shade offered to be
<lb/>my guide, assuring me that these magicians
<lb/>would do me no harm, and that so far from
<lb/>having any objection to be observed in
<lb/>their operations, they were pleased with
<lb/>any opportunity of exhibiting them to the
<lb/>curious. In therefore I went, and ad­
<lb/>dressed the first of the magicians I met
<lb/>with, who asked me whether I liked pan­
<lb/>oramas. On replying that I thought them
<lb/>very entertaining, she took me to a little
<lb/>eminence and bade me look round. I did
<lb/>so, and beheld the representation of the
<lb/>beautiful vale of <placeName>Dorking</placeName>, with <placeName>Norbury­
<lb/>park</placeName> and <placeName>Box-hill</placeName> to the north, <placeName>Riegate</placeName>
<lb/>to the east, and <placeName>Leith</placeName> tower with the

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">4</mw>
<lb/><placeName>Surry</placeName> hills to the south. After I had
<lb/>admired for some time the beauty and
<lb/>accuracy of the painting, a vast curtain
<lb/>seemed to be drawn gradually up, and my
<lb/>view extended on all sides. On one hand
<lb/>I traced the windings of the <placeName>Thames</placeName> up
<lb/>to <placeName>Oxford</placeName>, and stretched my eye westward
<lb/>over <placeName>Salisbury Plain</placeName>, and across the <placeName>Bri­
<lb/>stol Channel</placeName> into the romantic country of
<lb/><placeName>South Wales</placeName>; northward the view ex­
<lb/>tended to <placeName>Lincoln cathedral</placeName>, and <placeName>York
<lb/>minster</placeName> towering over the rest of the
<lb/>churches. Across the <placeName>Sussex downs</placeName> I had
<lb/>a clear view of the <placeName>British Channel</placeName>, and
<lb/>the opposite coast of <placeName>France</placeName>, with its
<lb/>ports blockaded by our fleets. As the
<lb/>horizon of the panorama still extended, I
<lb/>spied the towers of <placeName>Notre Dame</placeName>, and the
<lb/><placeName>Tuilleries</placeName>, and my eye wandered at large
<lb/>over <quote>The vine-covered hills and gay re­
<lb/>gions of <placeName>France</placeName>,</quote> quite down to the source
<lb/>of the <placeName>Loire</placeName>. At the same time the great
<lb/><placeName>Atlantic ocean</placeName> opened to my view; and on
<lb/>the other hand I saw the <placeName>lake of Geneva</placeName>,
<pb n="5"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">5</mw>
<lb/>and the dark ridge of <placeName>mount Jura</placeName>, and
<lb/>discovered the summits of <placeName>the Alps</placeName> covered
<lb/>with snow; and beyond, the orange groves
<lb/>of <placeName>Italy</placeName>, the majestic dome of <placeName>St. Peter's</placeName>,
<lb/>and the smoking crater of <placeName>Vesuvius</placeName>. As
<lb/>the curtain still rose, I stretched my view
<lb/>over the <placeName>Mediterranean</placeName>, the scene of an­
<lb/>cient glory, the Archipelago studded with
<lb/>islands, the shores of the <placeName>Bosphorus</placeName>, and
<lb/>the gilded minarets and cypress groves of
<lb/><placeName>Constantinople</placeName>. Throwing back a look
<lb/>to the less attractive north, I saw pictured
<lb/>the rugged, broken coast of <placeName>Norway</placeName>, the
<lb/>cheerless moors of <placeName>Lapland</placeName>, and the in­
<lb/>terminable desolation of the plains of <placeName>Si­
<lb/>beria</placeName>. Turning my eye again southward,
<lb/>the landscape extended to the plains of
<lb/><placeName>Barbary</placeName>, covered with date-trees; and I
<lb/>discerned the points of pyramids appear­
<lb/>ing above the horizon, and saw the Delta
<lb/>and the seven-mouthed <placeName>Nile</placeName>. In short,
<lb/>the curtain still rose, and the view ex­
<lb/>tended further and further till the pan­
<lb/>orama took in the whole globe. I cannot

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">6</mw>
<lb/>express to you the pleasure I felt as I saw
<lb/>mountains, seas, and islands, spread out
<lb/>before me. Sometimes my eye wandered
<lb/>over the vast plains of <placeName>Tartary</placeName>, sometimes
<lb/>it expatiated in the savannahs of <placeName>America</placeName>.
<lb/>I saw men with dark skins, white cotton
<lb/>turbans wreathed about their heads, and
<lb/>long flowing robes of silk; others almost
<lb/>naked under a vertical sun. I saw whales
<lb/>sporting in the northern seas, and ele­
<lb/>phants trampling amidst fields of maize
<lb/>and forests of palm-trees. I seemed to
<lb/>have put a girdle about the earth, and was
<lb/>gratified with an infinite variety of objects
<lb/>which I thought I never could be weary of
<lb/>contemplating. At length, turning to­
<lb/>wards the magician who had entertained
<lb/>me with such an agreeable exhibition, and
<lb/>asking her name, she informed me it was
<lb/><persName rend="slant(italic)">Geography</persName>.</p>
        <p>My attention was next arrested by a
<lb/>sorceress, who, I was told, possessed the
<lb/>power of calling up from the dead whom­
<lb/>soever she pleased, man or woman, in their
<pb xml:id="pg7" n="7"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">7</mw>
<lb/>proper habits and figures, and obliging
<lb/>them to converse and answer questions.
<lb/>She held a roll of parchment in her hand,
<lb/>and had an air of great dignity. I confess
<lb/>that I felt a little afraid; but having been
<lb/>somewhat encouraged by the former ex­
<lb/>hibition, I ventured to ask her to give me
<lb/>a specimen of her power, in case there was
<lb/>nothing unlawful in it. <said xml:id="Cli1">Whom,</said> said
<lb/>she, <said xml:id="Cli2">do you wish to behold?</said> After
<lb/>considering some time, I desired to see
<lb/><persName>Cicero</persName> the Roman orator. She made
<lb/>some talismanic figures on the sand, and
<lb/>presently he rose to my view, his neck
<lb/>and head bare, the rest of his body in a
<lb/>flowing toga, which he gathered round
<lb/>him with one hand, and stretching out the
<lb/>other very gracefully, he recited to me one
<lb/>of his orations against <persName>Catiline</persName>. He also
<lb/>read to me, which was more than I could
<lb/>in reason have expected, several of his
<lb/>familiar letters to his most intimate friends.
<lb/>I next desired that <persName>Julius Cæsar</persName> might be
<lb/>called up: on which he appeared, his hair
<pb n="8"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">8</mw>
<lb/>nicely arranged, and the fore part of his
<lb/>head, which was bald, covered with wreaths
<lb/>of laurel; and he very obligingly gave me
<lb/>a particular account of his expedition into
<lb/><placeName>Gaul</placeName>. I wished to see the youth of <placeName>Mace­
<lb/>don</placeName>, but was a little disappointed in his
<lb/>figure, for he was low in stature and held
<lb/>his head awry; but I saw him manage
<lb/><persName>Bucephalus</persName> with admirable courage and
<lb/>address, and was afterwards introduced
<lb/>with him into the tent of <persName>Darius</persName>, where I
<lb/>was greatly pleased with the generosity
<lb/>and politeness of his behaviour. I after­
<lb/>wards expressed some curiosity to see a
<lb/>battle, if I might do it with safety, and was
<lb/>gratified with the sea-fight of <placeName>Actium</placeName>. I
<lb/>saw, after the first onset, the galleys of
<lb/><persName>Cleopatra</persName> turning their prows and flying
<lb/>from the battle, and <persName>Antony</persName>, to his eter­
<lb/>nal shame, quitting the engagement and
<lb/>making sail after her. I then wished to
<lb/>call up all the kings of <placeName>England</placeName>, and they
<lb/>appeared in order one after the other, with
<lb/>their crowns and the insignia of their dig­
<pb n="9"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">9</mw>
<lb/>nity, and walked over the stage for my
<lb/>amusement, much like the descendants of
<lb/><persName>Banquo</persName> in <title>Macbeth</title>. Their queens ac­
<lb/>companied them, trailing their robes upon
<lb/>the ground, and the bishops with their
<lb/>mitres, and judges, and generals, and
<lb/>eminent persons of every class. I asked
<lb/>many questions as they passed, and re­
<lb/>ceived a great deal of information relative
<lb/>to the laws, manners, and transactions of
<lb/>past times. I did not, however, always
<lb/>meet with direct answers to my questions.
<lb/>For instance, when I called up <persName>Homer</persName>,
<lb/>and after some other conversation asked
<lb/>him where he was born, he only said,
<lb/><said>Guess!</said> And when I asked <persName>Louis the
<lb/>Fourteenth</persName> who was the man in the iron
<lb/>mask, he frowned and would not tell me.
<lb/>I took a great deal of pleasure in calling
<lb/>up the shades of distinguished people in
<lb/>different ages and countries, making them
<lb/>stand close by one another, and comparing
<lb/>their manners and costume. Thus I mea­
<lb/>sured <persName>Catherine</persName> of <placeName>Russia</placeName> against <persName>Semi­
<lb/>ramis</persName>, and <persName>Aristotle</persName> against <persName>Lord Bacon</persName>.

<lb/>I could have spent whole years in conver­
<lb/>sation with so many celebrated persons,
<lb/>and promised myself that I would often
<lb/>frequent this obliging magician. Her
<lb/>name, I found, was in <placeName>heaven</placeName> <persName rend="slant(italic)">Clio</persName>, on
<lb/><placeName>earth</placeName> <persName rend="slant(italic)">History</persName>.</p>
        <p>I saw another who was making a charm
<lb/>for two friends, one of whom was going to
<lb/>the <placeName>East Indies</placeName>: they were bitterly la­
<lb/>menting that when they were parted at so
<lb/>great a distance from each other they could
<lb/>no longer communicate their thoughts, but
<lb/>must be cut off from each other's society.
<lb/>Presenting them with a talisman inscribed
<lb/>with four-and-twenty black marks, <said xml:id="Ab1">Take
<lb/>this,</said> she said; <said xml:id="Ab2">I have breathed a voice
<lb/>upon it: by means of this talisman you
<lb/>shall still converse, and hear one another
<lb/>as distinctly when half the globe is be­
<lb/>tween you, as if you were talking together
<lb/>in the same room.</said> The two friends
<lb/>thanked her for such an invaluable pre­
<lb/>sent, and retired. Her name was <persName rend="slant(italic)">Abra­
<lb/>cadabra</persName>.</p>
        <p>I was next invited to see a whispering-
<pb n="11"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">11</mw>
<lb/>gallery of a most curious and uncommon
<lb/>structure. To make the experiment of
<lb/>its powers, a young poet of a very modest
<lb/>appearance, who was stealing along in a
<lb/>retired walk, was desired to repeat a verse
<lb/>in it. He applied his lips to the wall, and
<lb/>whispered in a low voice, <said xml:lang="la">Rura mihi et
<lb/>rigui placeant in vallibus amnes.</said> The
<lb/>sound ran along the walls for some time
<lb/>in a kind of low whisper; but every minute
<lb/>it grew louder and louder, till at length it
<lb/>was echoed and re-echoed from every part
<lb/>of the gallery, and seemed to be pro­
<lb/>nounced by a multitude of voices at once,
<lb/>in different languages, till the whole dome
<lb/>was filled with the sound. There was a
<lb/>strong smell of incense. The gallery was
<lb/>constructed by <name type="person" rend="slant(italic)">Fame</name>.</p>
        <p>The good pilgrim next conducted me
<lb/>to a cave where several sorceresses, very
<lb/>black and grim, were amusing themselves
<lb/>with making lightning, thunder, and earth­
<lb/>quakes. I saw two vials of cold liquor
<lb/>mixed together, and flames burst forth
<pb n="12"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B6v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">12</mw>
<lb/>from them. I saw some insignificant-look­
<lb/>ing black grains, which would throw pa­
<lb/>laces and castles into the air. I saw—and
<lb/>it made my hair stand on end—a headless
<lb/>man who lifted up his arm and grasped a
<lb/>sword. I saw men flying through the air,
<lb/>without wings, over the tops of towns and
<lb/>castles, and come down unhurt. The ca­
<lb/>vern was very black, and the smoke and
<lb/>fires and mephitic blasts and sulphureous
<lb/>vapours that issued from it gave the whole
<lb/>a very tremendous appearance. I did not
<lb/>stay long, but as I retired I saw <mentioned rend="slant(italic)">Chemistry</mentioned>
<lb/>written on the walls in letters of flame,
<lb/>with several other names which I do not
<lb/>now remember.</p>
        <p>My companion whispered me that some
<lb/>of these were suspected of communication
<lb/>with the evil genii, and that the demon of
<lb/>War had been seen to resort to the cave.
<lb/><said xml:id="Pil1">But now,</said> said the pilgrim, <said xml:id="Pil2">I will lead
<lb/>you to enchanters who deserve all your ve­
<lb/>neration, and are even more beneficent than
<lb/>those you have already seen.</said> He then
<pb n="13"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B7r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">13</mw>
<lb/>led me to a cavern that opened upon the
<lb/>sea shore: it blew a terrible storm, the
<lb/>waves ran mountains high, the wind
<lb/>roared, and vessels were driven against
<lb/>each other with a terrible shock. A fe­
<lb/>male figure advanced and threw a little
<lb/>oil upon the waves; they immediately sub­
<lb/>sided, the winds were still, the storm was
<lb/>laid, and the vessels pursued their course
<lb/>in safety. <said>By what magic is this per­
<lb/>formed?</said> exclaimed I. <said xml:id="Pil3">The magician is
<lb/><persName rend="slant(italic)">Meekness</persName>,</said> replied my conductor: <said xml:id="Pil4">she
<lb/>can smooth the roughest sea, and allay the
<lb/>wildest storm.</said></p>
        <p>My view was next directed to a poor
<lb/>wretch who lay groaning in a most piteous
<lb/>manner, and crushed to the earth with a
<lb/>mountain on his breast: he uttered pierc­
<lb/>ing shrieks, and seemed totally unable to
<lb/>rise or help himself. One of these good
<lb/>magicians, whose name I found was <persName rend="slant(italic)">Pa­
<lb/>tience</persName>, advanced and struck the mountain
<lb/>with a wand; on which, to my great
<lb/>surprise, it diminished to a size not more
<pb n="14"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B7v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">14</mw>
<lb/>than the load of an ordinary porter,
<lb/>which the man threw over his shoulders
<lb/>with something very like a smile, and
<lb/>marched off with a firm step and very
<lb/>composed air.</p>
        <p>I must not pass over a charmer of a
<lb/>very pleasing appearance and lively aspect.
<lb/>She possessed the power (a very useful
<lb/>one in a country so subject to fogs and
<lb/>rains as this is) of gilding a landscape

<lb/>you all danced.</p>
        <p>I was next struck, on ascending an emi­
<lb/>nence, with a most dreary landscape. All
<lb/>the flat country was one stagnant marsh.
<lb/>Amidst the rushy grass lay the fiend <persName>Ague</persName>,
<lb/>listless and shivering: on the bare and
<lb/>bleak hills sat <persName>Famine</persName>, with a few shells
<lb/>of acorns before her, of which she had

<lb/>eaten the fruit. The woods were tangled
<lb/>and pathless; the howl of wolves was
<lb/>heard. A few smoky huts, or caves not
<lb/>much better than the dens of wild beasts,
<lb/>were all the habitations of men that pre­
<lb/>sented themselves. <said xml:id="B1">Miserable country!</said>
<lb/>I exclaimed; <said xml:id="B2">step-child of nature!</said>
<lb/><said xml:id="Pil5">This,</said> said my conductor, <said xml:id="Pil6">is <placeName>Britain</placeName>
<lb/>as our ancestors possessed it.</said> <said xml:id="B3">And by

<lb/>has been the work of one of our most
<lb/>powerful magicians. Her name is <persName rend="slant(italic)">In­
<lb/>dustry</persName>.</said> At the word she advanced and
<lb/>waved her wand over the scene. Gra­
<lb/>dually the waters ran off into separate
<lb/>channels, and left rich meadows covered
<lb/>with innumerable flocks and herds. The
<lb/>woods disappeared, except what waved
<lb/>gracefully on the tops of the hills, or filled
<lb/>up the unsightly hollows. Wherever she
<lb/>moved her wand, roads, bridges, and
<lb/>canals laid open and improved the face

<lb/>of the country. A numerous population,
<lb/>spread abroad in the fields, were gathering
<lb/>in the harvest. Smoke from warm cot­
<lb/>tages ascended through the trees, pleasant
<lb/>towns and villages marked the several
<lb/>points of distance. Last, the <placeName>Thames</placeName> was
<lb/>filled with forests of masts, and proud
<lb/><placeName>London</placeName> appeared with all its display of
<lb/>wealth and grandeur.</p>
        <p>I do not know whether it was the plea­
<lb/>sure I received from this exhilarating

<lb/>the pavement, which awakened me; but I
<lb/>determined to write out my dream, and

<lb/>Words.</head>
        <p rend="first-indent(0)"><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">My</hi> dear mamma, who worked you this
<lb/>scarf? it is excessively pretty.</p>
        <p>I am sorry for it, my dear.</p>
        <p>Sorry, mamma! are you sorry it is
<lb/>pretty?</p>
        <p>No, but I am sorry if it is <emph>excessively</emph>
<lb/>pretty.</p>
        <p>Why so?—a thing cannot be too pretty,
<lb/>can it?</p>
        <p>If so, it cannot be excessively pretty. Pray
<lb/>what do you mean by excessively pretty?</p>
        <p>Why excessively pretty means—it means
<lb/>very pretty.</p>
        <p>What does the word excessively come
<lb/>from? What part of speech is it? You
<lb/>know your grammar?</p>
        <p>It is an adverb: the words that end in
<lb/><emph>ly</emph> are adverbs.</p>
        <pb n="18"/>
        <milestone unit="sig" n="B9v"/>
        <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">18</mw>
        <p>Adverbs are derived from adjectives by
<lb/>adding <emph>ly</emph>, you should have said;—exces­
<lb/>sive, excessively. And what is the noun
<lb/>from which they are both derived?</p>
        <p>Excess.</p>
        <p>And what does excess mean?</p>
        <p>It means too much of any thing.</p>
        <p>You see then that it implies a fault, and
<lb/>therefore cannot be applied as a commen­
<lb/>dation. We say a man is excessively
<lb/>greedy, excessively liberal; a woman ex­
<lb/>cessively fine: but not that a man is ex­
<lb/>cessively wise, a woman excessively faith­
<lb/>ful to her husband; because in these there
<lb/>is no excess: nor is there in beauty, that
<lb/>being the true and just proportion which
<lb/>gives pleasure.</p>
        <p>But we say excessively kind.</p>
        <p>We do, because kindness has its limits.
<lb/>A person may be too kind to us, who ex­
<lb/>poses himself to a great and serious incon­
<lb/>venience to give us a slight pleasure: we
<lb/>also may mean by it exceeding that kind­
<lb/>ness which we have a claim to expect. But
<pb n="19"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B10r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">19</mw>
<lb/>when people use it, as they often do, on the
<lb/>slightest occasion, it is certainly as wrong
<lb/>as excessively pretty.</p>
        <p>But, mamma, must we always consider so
<lb/>much the exact meaning of words? Every
<lb/>body says excessively pretty, and exces­
<lb/>sively tall, and infinitely obliged to you.—
<lb/>What harm can it do?</p>
        <p>That every body does it I deny; that
<lb/>the generality do it is very true; but it is
<lb/>likewise true, that the generality are not
<lb/>to be taken as a pattern in any thing. As
<lb/>to the harm it does,—in the first place it
<lb/>hurts our sincerity.</p>
        <p>Why, it is not telling a lie sure?</p>
        <p>Certainly I do not mean to say it is;
<lb/>but it tends to sap and undermine the
<lb/>foundations of our integrity, by making us
<lb/>careless, if not in the facts we assert, yet
<lb/>in the measure and degree in which we
<lb/>assert them. If we do not pretend to love
<lb/>those we have no affection for, or to ad­
<lb/>mire those we despise, at least we lead
<lb/>them to think we admire them more and
<pb n="20"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B10v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">20</mw>
<lb/>love them better than we really do; and
<lb/>this prepares the way for some serious de­
<lb/>viations from truth. So much for its con­
<lb/>cern with morality:—but it has likewise a
<lb/>very bad effect on our taste. What, think
<lb/>you, is the reason that young people, espe­
<lb/>cially, run into these vague and exag­
<lb/>gerated expressions?</p>
        <p>What is vague, mamma?</p>
        <p>It means what has no precise, definite
<lb/>signification. Young people run into these,
<lb/>sometimes indeed from having more feel­
<lb/>ing than judgement, but more commonly
<lb/>from not knowing how to separate their
<lb/>ideas and tell what it is they are pleased
<lb/>with. They either do not know, or will
<lb/>not give themselves the trouble to mark,
<lb/>the qualities, or to describe the scenes
<lb/>which disgust or please them, and hope to
<lb/>cover their deficiency by these overwhelm­
<lb/>ing expressions; as if your dress-maker,
<lb/>not knowing your shape, should make a
<lb/>large loose frock that would cover you over
<lb/>were you twice as tall as you are. Now

<lb/>you would have shown your taste if in
<lb/>commending my scarf you had said that
<lb/>the pattern was light, or it was rich, or that
<lb/>the work was neat and true; but by say­
<lb/>ing it was excessively pretty, you showed
<lb/>you had not considered what it was you
<lb/>admired in it. Did you never hear of the
<lb/>countryman who said <said>there will be mon­
<lb/>strous few apples this year, and those few
<lb/>will be huge little.</said> Poets run into this
<lb/>fault when they give unmeaning epithets
<lb/>instead of appropriate description;—young
<lb/>ladies, when in their letters they run into
<lb/>exaggerated expressions of friendship.</p>
        <p>You have often admired in this painting
<lb/>the variety of tints shaded into one an­
<lb/>other. Well! what would you think of a
<lb/>painter who should spread one deep blue
<lb/>over all the sky, and one deep green over
<lb/>the grass and trees?—would not you say
<lb/>he was a dauber? and made near objects
<lb/>and distant objects, and objects in the sun
<lb/>and objects in the shade, all alike? I

<lb/>sciousness of his own worth, took a solitary
<lb/>walk; and straying amongst the groves of
<lb/>Academus, he sat down between an Olive
<lb/>and a Pine tree. His attention was soon ex­
<lb/>cited by a murmur which he heard among
<lb/>the leaves. The whispers increased; and
<lb/>listening attentively, he plainly heard the
<lb/>Pine say to the Olive as follows: <said>Poor
<lb/>tree! I pity thee; thou now spreadest thy
<lb/>green leaves and exultest in all the pride
<lb/>of youth and spring; but how soon will
<lb/>thy beauty be tarnished! The fruit which
<lb/>thou exhaustest thyself to bear, shall hard­
<lb/>ly be shaken from thy boughs before thou
<lb/>shalt grow dry and withered; thy green
<lb/>veins, now so full of juice, shall be frozen;

<lb/>all the storms of winter, whilst my firmer
<lb/>leaf shall resist the change of the seasons.
<lb/><emph>Unchangeable</emph> is my motto, and through
<lb/>the various vicissitudes of the year I shall
<lb/>continue equally green and vigorous as I
<lb/>am at present.</said></p>
        <p>The olive, with a graceful wave of her
<lb/>boughs, replied: <said>It is true thou wilt al­
<lb/>ways continue as thou art at present. Thy
<lb/>leaves will keep that sullen and gloomy
<lb/>green in which they are now arrayed, and
<lb/>the stiff regularity of thy branches will not
<lb/>yield to those storms which will bow down
<lb/>many of the feebler tenants of the grove.
<lb/>Yet I wish not to be like thee. I rejoice
<lb/>when nature rejoices; and when I am deso­
<lb/>late, nature mourns with me. I fully enjoy
<lb/>pleasure in its season, and I am contented
<lb/>to be subject to the influences of those sea­
<lb/>sons and that economy of nature by which
<lb/>I flourish. When the spring approaches, I
<lb/>feel the kindly warmth; my branches swell
<lb/>with young buds, and my leaves unfold;

<lb/>contented not to stand a single exemption
<lb/>to the mournful desolation I see every­

        <salute>My Dear Young Friends,</salute>
        <p rend="first-indent(0)"><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">I presume</hi> you are now all come home
<lb/>for the holidays, and that the brothers and
<lb/>sisters and cousins, papas and mammas,
<lb/>uncles and aunts, are all met cheerfully
<lb/>round a Christmas fire, enjoying the com­
<lb/>pany of their friends and relations, and
<lb/>eating plum pudding and mince pie. These
<lb/>are very good things; but one cannot al­
<lb/>ways be eating plum pudding and mince
<lb/>pie: the days are short, and the weather
<lb/>bad, so that you cannot be much abroad;
<lb/>and I think you must want something to
<lb/>amuse you. Besides, if you have been em­
<lb/>ployed as you ought to be at school, and if
<lb/>you are quick and clever, as I hope you
<lb/>are, you will want some employment for
<lb/>that part of you which thinks, as well as

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">27</mw>
<lb/>that part of you which eats; and you will
<lb/>like better to solve a riddle than to crack
<lb/>a nut or a walnut. Finding out riddles is
<lb/>the same kind of exercise to the mind
<lb/>which running and leaping and wrestling
<lb/>in sport are to the body. They are of no
<lb/>use in themselves,—they are not work, but
<lb/>play; but they prepare the body, and make
<lb/>it alert and active for any thing it may be
<lb/>called to perform in labour or war. So
<lb/>does the finding out of riddles, if they are
<lb/>good especially, give quickness of thought,
<lb/>and a facility of turning about a problem
<lb/>every way, and viewing it in every possible
<lb/>light. When <persName>Archimedes</persName> coming out of
<lb/>the bath cried in transport, <said rend="slant(italic)">Eureka!</said> (I
<lb/>have found it!) he had been exercising his
<lb/>mind precisely in the same manner as you
<lb/>will do when you are searching about for
<lb/>the solution of a riddle.</p>
        <p>And pray, when you are got together,
<lb/>do not let any little Miss or Master say,
<lb/>with an affected air, <said>O! do not ask me;

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">28</mw>
<lb/>do not mean you should think them stupid
<lb/>and dull; they mean to imply that these
<lb/>things are too trifling to engage their at­
<lb/>tention. If they are employed better, it
<lb/>is very well; but if not, say, <said>I am very
<lb/>sorry indeed you are so dull, but we that
<lb/>are clever and quick will exercise our wits
<lb/>upon these; and as our arms grow stronger
<lb/>by exercise, so will our wits.</said></p>
        <p>Riddles are of high antiquity, and were
<lb/>the employment of grave men formerly.
<lb/>The first riddle that we have on record was
<lb/>proposed by <persName>Sampson</persName> at a wedding feast to
<lb/>the young men of the <name>Philistines</name>, who were
<lb/>invited upon the occasion. The feast lasted
<lb/>seven days; and if they found it out within
<lb/>the seven days, <persName>Sampson</persName> was to give them
<lb/>thirty suits of clothes and thirty sheets;
<lb/>and if they could not guess it, they were to
<lb/>forfeit the same to him. The riddle was;
<lb/><quote>Out of the eater came forth meat, and
<lb/>out of the strong came forth sweetness.</quote>
<lb/>He had killed a lion, and left its carcase:
<lb/>on returning soon after, he found a swarm
<pb n="29"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="C3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">29</mw>
<lb/>of bees had made use of the skeleton as a
<lb/>hive, and it was full of honeycomb. Struck
<lb/>with the oddness of the circumstance, he
<lb/>made a riddle of it. They puzzled about it
<lb/>the whole seven days, and would not have
<lb/>found it out at last if his wife had not told
<lb/>them.</p>
        <p>The <name>Sphinx</name> was a great riddle-maker.
<lb/>According to the fable, she was half a wo­
<lb/>man and half a lion. She lived near <placeName>Thebes</placeName>,
<lb/>and to every body that came she proposed
<lb/>a riddle; and if they did not find it out,
<lb/>she devoured them. At length <persName>Œdipus</persName>
<lb/>came, and she asked him, <said>What is that
<lb/>animal which walks on four legs in the
<lb/>morning, two at noon, and three at night?</said>
<lb/><persName>Œdipus</persName> answered, Man:—in childhood,
<lb/>which is the morning of life, he crawls on
<lb/>his hands and feet; in middle age, which is
<lb/>noon, he walks erect on two; in old age
<lb/>he leans on a crutch, which serves for a
<lb/>supplementary third foot.</p>
        <p>The famous wise men of <placeName>Greece</placeName> did not
<lb/>disdain to send puzzles to each other. They
<pb n="30"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="C3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">30</mw>
<lb/>are also fond of riddles in the East. There
<lb/>is a pretty one in some of their tales.—
<lb/><quote>What is that tree which has twelve
<lb/>branches, and each branch thirty leaves,
<lb/>which are all black on one side and white
<lb/>on the other?</quote>—The tree is the year; the
<lb/>branches the months; the leaves black on
<lb/>one side and white on the other signify
<lb/>day and night. Our Anglo-Saxon ances­
<lb/>tors also had riddles, some of which are
<lb/>still preserved in a very ancient manuscript.</p>
        <p>A riddle is a description of a thing
<lb/>without the name; but as it is meant to
<lb/>puzzle, it appears to belong to something
<lb/>else than what it really does, and often
<lb/>seems contradictory; but when you have
<lb/>guessed it, it appears quite clear. It is a
<lb/>bad riddle if you are at all in doubt when
<lb/>you have found it out whether you are
<lb/>right or no. A riddle is not verbal, as
<lb/>charades, conundrums, and rebuses are:
<lb/>it may be translated into any language,
<lb/>which the others cannot. <persName>Addison</persName> would
<lb/>put them all in the class of false wit: but

<lb/><persName>Swift</persName>, who was as great a genius, amused
<lb/>himself with making all sorts of puzzles;
<lb/>and therefore I think you need not be
<lb/>ashamed of reading them. It would be
<lb/>pretty entertainment for you to make a
<lb/>collection of the better ones,—for many
<lb/>are so dull that they are not worth spend­

        <p rend="first-indent(0)"><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">Have</hi> you made out who the four Sisters
<lb/>are<anchor xml:id="an1" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#nt1"/>? If you have, I will tell you another
<lb/>story. It is about a monarch who lives in
<lb/>a sumptuous castle, raised high above the
<lb/>ground and built with exquisite art. He
<lb/>takes a great deal of state upon him, and,
<lb/>like Eastern monarchs, transacts every
<lb/>thing by means of his ministers; for he
<lb/>never appears himself, and indeed lives in
<lb/>so retired a manner, that though it has
<lb/>often excited the curiosity of his subjects,
<lb/>his residence is hidden from them with as
<lb/>much jealous care as that of <persName>Pygmalion</persName>
<lb/>was from the <name>Tyrians</name>; and it has never
<lb/>been discovered with any certainty which
<lb/>of the chambers of the castle he actually
<pb n="37"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="C7r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">37</mw>
<lb/>inhabits, though by means of his numerous
<lb/>spies he is acquainted with what passes in
<lb/>every one of them.</p>
        <p>But I must proceed to give you some
<lb/>account of his chief ministers; and I will
<lb/>begin with two who are mutes. Their office
<lb/>is to bring him quick and faithful intelli­
<lb/>gence of all that is going forward; this
<lb/>they perform in a very ingenious manner.
<lb/>You have heard of the <name>Mexicans</name>, who, not
<lb/>having the art of writing, supplied the de­
<lb/>ficiency by painting every thing they have
<lb/>a mind to communicate; so that when the
<lb/><name>Spaniards</name> came amongst them, they sent
<lb/>regular accounts to the king of their land­
<lb/>ing and all their proceedings, in very in­
<lb/>telligible language, without writing a single
<lb/>word. Now this is just the method of
<lb/>these two mutes; they are continually em­
<lb/>ployed in making pictures of every thing
<lb/>that passes, which they do with wonderful
<lb/>quickness and accuracy, all in miniature,
<lb/>but in exact proportion, and coloured after
<lb/>life. These pictures they bring every mo­
<pb n="38"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="C7v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">38</mw>
<lb/>ment to a great gate of the palace, where
<lb/>the king receives them.</p>
        <p>The next I shall mention are two drum­
<lb/>mers. These have each a great drum, on
<lb/>which they beat soft or loud, quick or slow,
<lb/>according to the occasion. They often
<lb/>entertain the king with music; besides
<lb/>which they are arrived at such wonderful
<lb/>perfection upon their instrument, and make
<lb/>the strokes with such precision, that by the
<lb/>different beats accompanied by proper
<lb/>pauses and intervals, they can express any
<lb/>thing they wish to tell;—and the king relies
<lb/>upon them as much as upon his mutes.
<lb/>There is a sort of covered way made in
<lb/>the form of a labyrinth from the station of
<lb/>the drummers to the inner rooms of the
<lb/>palace.</p>
        <p>There is a pair of officers,—for you must
<lb/>know, the offices go mightily by pairs,—
<lb/>whose department it is to keep all nuisances
<lb/>from the palace. They are lodged for that
<lb/>purpose under a shed or penthouse built
<lb/>with that view before the front of the pa­
<pb n="39"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="C8r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">39</mw>
<lb/>lace: they likewise gather and present to
<lb/>the monarch sweet odours, essences and
<lb/>perfumes, with which he regales himself:
<lb/>they likewise inspect the dishes that are
<lb/>served up at his table; and if any of them
<lb/>are not fit to be eaten, they give notice
<lb/>for their removal; and sometimes, if any
<lb/>thing offensive is about to enter the palace,
<lb/>they order the agents to shut two little
<lb/>doors which are in their keeping, and by
<lb/>that means prevent its entrance.</p>
        <p>The agents are two very active officers
<lb/>of long reach and quick execution. The
<lb/>executive part of government is chiefly in­
<lb/>trusted to them; they obey the king's
<lb/>commands with a readiness and vigour
<lb/>truly admirable; they defend the castle
<lb/>from all assaults, and are vigilant in keep­
<lb/>ing at a distance every annoyance. Their
<lb/>office is branched out into ten subordinate
<lb/>ones, but in cases which require great ex­
<lb/>ertion they act together.</p>
        <p>I must not omit the beef-eaters. These
<lb/>stand in rows at the great front gate of the
<pb n="40"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="C8v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">40</mw>
<lb/>palace, much as they do at <placeName>St. James's</placeName>,
<lb/>only that they are dressed in white.
<lb/>Their office is to prepare the viands for
<lb/>the king, who is so very lazy and so much
<lb/>accustomed to have every thing done for
<lb/>him, that, like the king of <placeName>Bantam</placeName> and
<lb/>some other Eastern monarchs, he requires
<lb/>his meat to be chewed before it is present­
<lb/>ed to him.</p>
        <p>Close by the beef-eaters lives the king's
<lb/>orator, a fat portly gentleman, of something
<lb/>a Dutch make, but remarkably voluble and
<lb/>nimble in his motions notwithstanding.
<lb/>He delivers the king's orders and explains
<lb/>his will. This gentleman is a good deal of
<lb/>an epicure, which I suppose is the reason
<lb/>he has his station so near the beef-eaters.
<lb/>He is a perfect connoisseur in good eat­
<lb/>ing, and assumes a right of tasting all the
<lb/>dishes; and the king pays the greatest
<lb/>regard to his opinion. Justice obliges me
<lb/>to confess that this orator is one of the
<lb/>most flippant and ungovernable of the
<lb/>king's subjects.</p>
        <pb n="41"/>
        <milestone unit="sig" n="C9r"/>
        <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">41</mw>
        <p>Among the inferior officers are the
<lb/>porters, two stout lusty fellows who carry
<lb/>the king about from place to place (for
<lb/>I am sure you are by this time too well ac­
<lb/>quainted with his disposition to suppose he
<lb/>performs that office for himself); but as most
<lb/>great men's officers have their deputies, so
<lb/>these lazy porters are very apt to get their
<lb/>business done by deputy, and to have peo­
<lb/>ple to carry <emph>them</emph> about.</p>
        <p>I should never have done if I were to
<lb/>mention all the particulars of the domestic
<lb/>establishment and internal œconomy of the
<lb/>castle, which is all arranged with wonder­
<lb/>ful art and order; how the outgoings are
<lb/>proportioned to the income, and what a
<lb/>fellow-feeling there is between all the mem­
<lb/>bers of the family from the greatest to the
<lb/>meanest. The king, from his high birth,
<lb/>on which he values himself much,—being
<lb/>of a race and lineage quite different from
<lb/>any of his subjects,—and from his superior
<lb/>capacity, claims the most absolute obedi­
<lb/>ence; though, as is frequently the case with
<pb n="42"/>

<lb/>kings, he is in fact most commonly go­

<lb/>some little reluctance in addressing me

<lb/>the correspondence between us; for I
<lb/>am at present ignorant of your particu­
<lb/>lar pursuits: I cannot guess whether
<lb/>you are climbing the hill of science, or
<lb/>wandering among the flowers of fancy;
<lb/>whether you are stretching your powers
<lb/>to embrace the planetary system, or ex­
<lb/>amining with a curious eye the delicate
<lb/>veinings of a green leaf, and the minute
<lb/>ramifications of a sea-weed; or whether
<lb/>you are toiling through the intricate and

<lb/>your general aim no doubt is the improve­
<lb/>ment of your mind; and we will therefore
<lb/>spend some time in considering what kind
<lb/>and degree of literary attainments sit grace­
<lb/>fully upon the female character.</p>
          <p>Every woman should consider herself as
<lb/>sustaining the general character of a ra­
<lb/>tional being, as well as the more confined
<lb/>one belonging to the female sex; and there­
<lb/>fore the motives for acquiring general
<lb/>knowledge and cultivating the taste are
<lb/>nearly the same to both sexes. The line of
<lb/>separation between the studies of a young
<lb/>man and a young woman appears to me to
<lb/>be chiefly fixed by this,—that a woman is
<lb/>excused from all professional knowledge.
<lb/>Professional knowledge means all that is
<lb/>necessary to fit a man for a peculiar pro­
<lb/>fession or business. Thus men study in or­
<lb/>der to qualify themselves for the law, for
<lb/>physic, for various departments in political
<lb/>life, for instructing others from the pulpit
<lb/>or the professor's chair. These all require
<lb/>a great deal of severe study and technical
<pb n="45"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="C11r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">45</mw>
<lb/>knowledge; much of which is nowise
<lb/>valuable in itself, but as a means to that
<lb/>particular profession. Now as a woman
<lb/>can never be called to any of these pro­
<lb/>fessions, it is evident you have nothing to
<lb/>do with such studies. A woman is not
<lb/>expected to understand the mysteries of
<lb/>politics, because she is not called to go­
<lb/>vern; she is not required to know ana­
<lb/>tomy, because she is not to perform sur­
<lb/>gical operations; she need not embarrass
<lb/>herself with theological disputes, because
<lb/>she will neither be called upon to make
<lb/>nor to explain creeds.</p>
          <p>Men have various departments in ac­
<lb/>tive life; women have but one, and all
<lb/>women have the same, differently modi­
<lb/>fied indeed by their rank in life and other
<lb/>incidental circumstances. It is, to be a
<lb/>wife, a mother, a mistress of a family.
<lb/>The knowledge belonging to these duties
<lb/>is your professional knowledge, the want
<lb/>of which nothing will excuse. Literary
<lb/>knowledge therefore, in men, is often an
<pb n="46"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="C11v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">46</mw>
<lb/>indispensable duty; in women it can be
<lb/>only a desirable accomplishment. In wo­
<lb/>men it is more immediately applied to the
<lb/>purposes of adorning and improving the
<lb/>mind, of refining the sentiments, and sup­
<lb/>plying proper stores for conversation. For
<lb/>general knowledge women have in some
<lb/>respects more advantages than men. Their
<lb/>avocations often allow them more leisure;
<lb/>their sedentary way of life disposes them to
<lb/>the domestic quiet amusement of reading;
<lb/>the share they take in the education of
<lb/>their children throws them in the way of
<lb/>books. The uniform tenor and confined
<lb/>circle of their lives makes them eager to
<lb/>diversify the scene by descriptions which
<lb/>open to them a new world; and they are
<lb/>eager to gain an idea of scenes on the
<lb/>busy stage of life from which they are
<lb/>shut out by their sex. It is likewise par­
<lb/>ticularly desirable for women to be able to
<lb/>give spirit and variety to conversation by
<lb/>topics drawn from the stores of literature,
<lb/>as the broader mirth and more boisterous
<pb n="47"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="C12r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">47</mw>
<lb/>gaiety of the other sex are to them prohi­
<lb/>bited. As their parties must be innocent,
<lb/>care should be taken that they do not
<lb/>stagnate into insipidity. I will venture to
<lb/>add, that the purity and simplicity of heart
<lb/>which a woman ought never, in her freest
<lb/>commerce with the world, to wear off; her
<lb/>very seclusion from the jarring interests and
<lb/>coarser amusements of society,—fit her in
<lb/>a peculiar manner for the worlds of fancy
<lb/>and sentiment, and dispose her to the
<lb/>quickest relish of what is pathetic, sublime,
<lb/>or tender. To you, therefore, the beauties
<lb/>of poetry, of moral painting, and all in ge­
<lb/>neral that is comprised under the term of
<lb/>polite literature, lie particularly open, and
<lb/>you cannot neglect them without neglect­
<lb/>ing a very copious source of enjoyment.</p>
          <p>Languages are on some accounts particu­
<lb/>larly adapted to female study, as they may
<lb/>be learnt at home without experiments or
<lb/>apparatus, and without interfering with the
<lb/>habits of domestic life; as they form the
<lb/>style, and as they are the immediate inlet
<pb n="48"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="C12v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">48</mw>
<lb/>to works of taste. But the learned lan­
<lb/>guages, the <name>Greek</name> especially, require a
<lb/>great deal more time than a young woman
<lb/>can conveniently spare. To the <name>Latin</name>
<lb/>there is not an equal objection; and if a
<lb/>young person has leisure, has an oppor­
<lb/>tunity of learning it at home by being con­
<lb/>nected with literary people, and is placed
<lb/>in a circle of society sufficiently liberal to
<lb/>allow her such an accomplishment, I do
<lb/>not see, if she has a strong inclination,
<lb/>why she should not make herself mistress
<lb/>of so rich a store of original entertain­
<lb/>ment:—it will not in the present state of
<lb/>things excite either a smile or a stare in
<lb/>fashionable company. To those who do
<lb/>not intend to learn the language, I would
<lb/>strongly recommend the learning so much
<lb/>of the grammar of it as will explain the
<lb/>name and nature of cases, genders, in­
<lb/>flexion of verbs, &amp;c.; of which, having only
<lb/>the imperfect rudiments in our own lan­
<lb/>guage, a mere English scholar can with
<lb/>difficulty form a clear idea. This is the
<pb n="49"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="D1r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">49</mw>
<lb/>more necessary, as all our grammars, being
<lb/>written by men whose early studies had
<lb/>given them a partiality for the learned lan­
<lb/>guages, are formed more upon those than
<lb/>upon the real genius of our own tongue.</p>
          <p>I was going now to mention <name>French</name>, but
<lb/>perceive I have written a letter long enough

<lb/>completely, includes reading, writing, and
<lb/>speaking it. But here I must take the li­
<lb/>berty to offer my ideas, which differ some­

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">50</mw>
<lb/>thing from those generally entertained, and
<lb/>you will give them what weight you think
<lb/>they deserve. It seems to me that the
<lb/>efforts of young ladies in learning <name>French</name>
<lb/>are generally directed to what is unattain­
<lb/>able; and if attained, not very useful,—
<lb/>the speaking it. It is utterly impossible,
<lb/>without such advantages as few enjoy,
<lb/>to speak a foreign language with fluency
<lb/>and a proper accent; and if even by being
<lb/>in a French family some degree of both
<lb/>is attained, it is soon lost by mixing with
<lb/>the world at large. As to the <name>French</name> which
<lb/>girls are obliged to speak at boarding-
<lb/>schools, it does very well to speak in <placeName>Eng­
<lb/>land</placeName>, but at <placeName>Paris</placeName> it would probably be
<lb/>less understood than <name>English</name> itself.</p>
          <p>I do not mean by this to say that the
<lb/>speaking of <name>French</name> is not a very elegant
<lb/>accomplishment; and to those who mean to
<lb/>spend some time in <placeName>France</placeName>, or who being
<lb/>in very high life often see foreigners of
<lb/>distinction, it may be necessary; but in
<lb/>common life it is very little so: and for
<pb n="51"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="D2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">51</mw>
<lb/>English people to meet together to talk a
<lb/>foreign language is truly absurd. There
<lb/>is a sarcasm against this practice as old
<lb/>as <persName>Chaucer's</persName> time—
<quote rend="break(yes)indent(1)"><lg type="indeterminate"><l>……<name>Frenche</name> she spake ful fayre and fetisely,</l><l>After the schole of <placeName>Stratford atte Bowe</placeName>,</l><l>For <name>Frenche</name> of <placeName>Paris</placeName> was to her unknowe.</l></lg></quote>
<lb/>But with regard to reading <name>French</name>, the
<lb/>many charming publications in that lan­
<lb/>guage, particularly in polite literature, of
<lb/>which you can have no adequate idea by
<lb/>translation, render it a very desirable ac­
<lb/>quisition. Writing it is not more useful
<lb/>in itself than speaking, except a person has
<lb/>foreign letters to write; but it is necessary
<lb/>for understanding the language gramma­
<lb/>tically and fixing the rules in the mind.
<lb/>A young person who reads <name>French</name> with
<lb/>ease and is so well grounded as to write it
<lb/>grammatically, and has what I should call
<lb/>a good English pronunciation of it, will
<lb/>by a short residence in <placeName>France</placeName> gain flu­
<lb/>ency and the accent; whereas one not
<lb/>grounded would soon forget all she had

<lb/>learned, though she had acquired some
<lb/>fluency in speaking. For speaking, there­
<lb/>fore, love and cultivate your own: know
<lb/>all its elegancies, its force, its happy turns
<lb/>of expression, and possess yourself of all
<lb/>its riches. In foreign languages you have
<lb/>only to learn; but with regard to your own,
<lb/>you have probably to unlearn, and to avoid
<lb/>vulgarisms and provincial barbarisms.</p>
          <p>If after you have learned <name>French</name> you
<lb/>should wish to add <name>Italian</name>, the acquisition
<lb/>will not be difficult. It is valuable on ac­
<lb/>count of its poetry, in which it far excels
<lb/>the <name>French</name>,—and its music. The other mo­
<lb/>dern languages you will hardly attempt,
<lb/>except led to them by some peculiar bent.</p>
          <p>History affords a wide field of enter­
<lb/>taining and useful reading. The chief
<lb/>thing to be attended to in studying it, is
<lb/>to gain a clear well-arranged idea of facts
<lb/>in chronological order, and illustrated by
<lb/>a knowledge of the places where such facts
<lb/>happened. Never read without tables and
<lb/>maps: make abstracts of what you read.
<pb n="53"/>

<lb/>Before you embarrass yourself in the de­
<lb/>tail of this, endeavour to fix well in your
<lb/>mind the arrangement of some leading
<lb/>facts, which may serve as landmarks to
<lb/>which to refer the rest. Connect the his­
<lb/>tory of different countries together. In
<lb/>the study of history the different genius of
<lb/>a woman I imagine will show itself. The
<lb/>detail of battles, the art of sieges, will not
<lb/>interest her so much as manners and sen­
<lb/>timent; this is the food she assimilates to
<lb/>herself.</p>
          <p>The great laws of the universe, the na­
<lb/>ture and properties of those objects which
<lb/>surround us, it is unpardonable not to
<lb/>know: it is more unpardonable to know,
<lb/>and not to feel the mind struck with lively
<lb/>gratitude. Under this head are compre­
<lb/>hended natural history, astronomy, botany,
<lb/>experimental philosophy, chemistry, phy­
<lb/>sics. In these you will rather take what
<lb/>belongs to sentiment and to utility than
<lb/>abstract calculations or difficult problems.
<lb/>You must often be content to know a thing
<pb n="54"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">54</mw>
<lb/>is so, without understanding the proof.
<lb/>It belongs to a <persName>Newton</persName> to prove his sub­
<lb/>lime problems, but we may all be made
<lb/>acquainted with the result. You cannot
<lb/>investigate; you may remember. This will
<lb/>teach you not to despise common things,
<lb/>will give you an interest in every thing you
<lb/>see. If you are feeding your poultry, or
<lb/>tending your bees, or extracting the juice
<lb/>of herbs, with an intelligent mind you are
<lb/>gaining real knowledge; it will open to
<lb/>you an inexhaustible fund of wonder and
<lb/>delight, and effectually prevent you from
<lb/>depending for your entertainment on the
<lb/>poor novelties of fashion and expense.</p>
          <p>But of all reading, what most ought to
<lb/>engage your attention are works of senti­
<lb/>ment and morals. Morals is that study
<lb/>in which alone both sexes have an equal
<lb/>interest; and in sentiment yours has even
<lb/>the advantage. The works of this kind
<lb/>often appear under the seducing form of
<lb/>novel and romance: here great care, and
<lb/>the advice of your older friends is requisite
<pb n="55"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="D4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">55</mw>
<lb/>in the selection. Whatever is true, how­
<lb/>ever uncouth in the manner or dry in the
<lb/>subject, has a value from being true: but
<lb/>fiction in order to recommend itself must
<lb/>give us <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="slant(italic)">la belle Nature</foreign>. You will find fewer
<lb/>plays fit for your perusal than novels, and
<lb/>fewer comedies than tragedies.</p>
          <p>What particular share any one of the
<lb/>studies I have mentioned may engage
<lb/>of your attention will be determined by
<lb/>your peculiar turn and bent of mind. But
<lb/>I shall conclude with observing, that a
<lb/>woman ought to have that general tincture
<lb/>of them all which marks the cultivated
<lb/>mind. She ought to have enough of them
<lb/>to engage gracefully in general conversa­
<lb/>tion. In no subject is she required to be
<lb/>deep,—of none ought she to be ignorant.
<lb/>If she knows not enough to speak well, she
<lb/>should know enough to keep her from
<lb/>speaking at all; enough to feel her ground
<lb/>and prevent her from exposing her igno­
<lb/>rance; enough to hear with intelligence, to
<lb/>ask questions with propriety, and to receive
<pb n="56"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="D4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">56</mw>
<lb/>information where she is not qualified to
<lb/>give it. A woman who to a cultivated
<lb/>mind joins that quickness of intelligence
<lb/>and delicacy of taste which such a woman
<lb/>often possesses in a superior degree, with
<lb/>that nice sense of propriety which resutls
<lb/>from the whole, will have a kind of <emph>tact</emph>
<lb/>by which she will be able on all occasions
<lb/>to discern between pretenders to science
<lb/>and men of real merit. On subjects upon
<lb/>which she cannot talk herself, she will
<lb/>know whether a man talks with knowledge
<lb/>of his subject. She will not judge of sy­
<lb/>stems, but by their systems she will be
<lb/>able to judge of men. She will distinguish
<lb/>the modest, the dogmatical, the affected,
<lb/>the over-refined, and give her esteem and
<lb/>confidence accordingly. She will know
<lb/>with whom to confide the education of her
<lb/>children, and how to judge of their pro­
<lb/>gress and the methods used to improve
<lb/>them. From books, from conversation,
<lb/>from learned instructors, she will gather
<lb/>the flower of every science; and her mind,
<pb n="57"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="D5r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">57</mw>
<lb/>in assimilating every thing to itself, will
<lb/>adorn it with new graces. She will give
<lb/>the tone to the conversation even when she
<lb/>chooses to bear but an inconsiderable part
<lb/>in it. The modesty which prevents her
<lb/>from an unnecessary display of what she
<lb/>knows, will cause it to be supposed that
<lb/>her knowledge is deeper than in reality it
<lb/>is:—as when the landscape is seen through
<lb/>the veil of a mist, the bounds of the hori­
<lb/>zon are hid. As she will never obtrude
<lb/>her knowledge, none will ever be sensible
<lb/>of any deficiency in it, and her silence will
<lb/>seem to proceed from discretion rather
<lb/>than a want of information. She will
<lb/>seem to know every thing by leading every
<lb/>one to speak of what he knows; and when
<lb/>she is with those to whom she can give no
<lb/>real information, she will yet delight
<lb/>them by the original turns of thought
<lb/>and sprightly elegance which will attend
<lb/>her manner of speaking on any subject.
<lb/>Such is the character to whom profest
<lb/>scholars will delight to give information,

        <head type="sub">A Dialogue.</head>
        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">Mamma</hi>! said <persName>Harriet Beechwood</persName>, I have
<lb/>just heard such a proud speech of a poor
<lb/>man! you would wonder if you heard it.</p>
        <p>Not much, <persName>Harriet</persName>; for pride and po­
<lb/>verty can very well agree together:—but
<lb/>what was it?</p>
        <p>Why, mamma, you know the charity-
<lb/>school that <persName>Lady Mary</persName> has set up, and
<lb/>how neat the girls look in their brown
<lb/>stuff gowns and little straw bonnets.</p>
        <p>Yes, I think it is a very good institution;
<lb/>the poor girls are taught to read and
<lb/>spell and sew, and what is better still, to
<lb/>be good.</p>
        <p>Well, mamma, <persName>Lady Mary's</persName> gardener, a
<lb/>poor man who lives in a cottage just by the
<lb/>great house, has a little girl; and so, because
<lb/>she was a pretty little girl, <persName>Lady Mary</persName>
<pb n="60"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="D6v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">60</mw>
<lb/>offered to put her into this school;—and do
<lb/>you know he would not let her go!</p>
        <p>Indeed!</p>
        <p>Yes; he thanked her, and said, <said>I have
<lb/>only one little girl, and I love her dearly;
<lb/>but though I am a poor man, I had rather
<lb/>work my fingers to the bone than she
<lb/>should wear a charity dress.</said></p>
        <p>I do not doubt, my dear <persName>Harriet</persName>, that a
<lb/>great many people will have the same
<lb/>idea of this poor man's behaviour which
<lb/>you have; but for my own part, I am in­
<lb/>clined to think it indicates something of a
<lb/>noble and generous spirit.</p>
        <p>Was it not proud to say she should not
<lb/>wear a charity dress?</p>
        <p>Why should she?—would you wear a
<lb/>charity dress?</p>
        <p>O, mamma, but this is a poor man!</p>
        <p>He is able to pay for her learning, I
<lb/>suppose; otherwise he would certainly do
<lb/>wrong to refuse his child the advantage
<lb/>of instruction because his feelings were
<lb/>hurt by it.</p>
        <pb n="61"/>
        <milestone unit="sig" n="D7r"/>
        <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">61</mw>
        <p>Yes, he is going to put her to <persName>Dame
<lb/>Primmer's</persName> across the Green; she will have
<lb/>half a mile to walk.</p>
        <p>That will do her no hurt.</p>
        <p>But he is throwing his money away; for
<lb/>he might have his little girl taught for no­
<lb/>thing; and as he is a poor man he ought
<lb/>to be thankful for it.</p>
        <p>Pray what do you mean by a poor
<lb/>man?</p>
        <p>O, a man—those men that live in poor
<lb/>houses, and work all day, and are hired
<lb/>for it.</p>
        <p>I cannot tell exactly how you define a
<lb/>poor house: but as to working, your papa is
<lb/>in a public office, and works all day long,
<lb/>and more hours certainly than the labourer
<lb/>does; and he is hired to it, for he would
<lb/>not do the work but for the salary they
<lb/>give him.</p>
        <p>But you do not live like those poor peo­
<lb/>ple, and you do not wear a check apron
<lb/>like the gardener's wife.</p>
        <p>Neither am I covered with lace and
<pb n="62"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="D7v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">62</mw>
<lb/>jewels like a duchess; there is as much
<lb/>difference between our manner of living
<lb/>and that of many people above us in for­
<lb/>tune, as between ours and this gardener's
<lb/>whom you call poor.</p>
        <p>What is being poor then? is there no
<lb/>such thing?</p>
        <p>Indeed I hardly know how to answer
<lb/>your question: rich and poor are compa­
<lb/>rative terms; and provided a man is in no
<lb/>want of the necessaries of life and is not
<lb/>in debt, he can only be said to be poor
<lb/>comparatively with others, of whom the
<lb/>same might be affirmed by those who are
<lb/>still richer. But to whatever degree of
<lb/>indigence you apply the term, you must
<lb/>take care not to confound a <emph>poor man</emph> with
<lb/>a <emph>pauper</emph>.</p>
        <p>What is a pauper? I thought they had
<lb/>been the same thing?</p>
        <p>A pauper is one who cannot maintain
<lb/>himself, and who is maintained by the
<lb/>charity of the community. Your gardener
<lb/>was not a pauper; he worked for what he
<pb n="63"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="D8r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">63</mw>
<lb/>had, and he paid for what he had; and
<lb/>therefore he had a right to expect that his
<lb/>child should not be confounded with the
<lb/>children of the idle, the profligate, and the
<lb/>dissolute, who are maintained upon charity.
<lb/>I wish the lower classes had more of this
<lb/>honourable pride.</p>
        <p>Is it a crime to be a pauper?</p>
        <p>To be a pauper is often the consequence
<lb/>of vice; and where it is not, it justly de­
<lb/>grades a man from his rank in society.
<lb/>If the gardener's daughter were to wear a
<lb/>kind of charity badge, the little girls she
<lb/>plays with would consider her as having
<lb/>lost her rank in society. You would not
<lb/>like to lose your rank, and to be thrust
<lb/>down lower than your proper place in so­
<lb/>ciety. There are several things it would
<lb/>not at all hurt you to do, which you would
<lb/>not choose to do on this account. For
<lb/>instance, to carry a bandbox through
<lb/>the street;—yet it would not hurt you to
<lb/>carry a bandbox, you would carry a greater
<lb/>weight in your garden for pleasure.</p>
        <pb n="64"/>
        <milestone unit="sig" n="D8v"/>
        <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">64</mw>
        <p>But I thought gardeners and such sort
<lb/>of people had no rank?</p>
        <p>That is a very great mistake. Every
<lb/>one has his rank, his place in society; and
<lb/>so far as rank is a source of honourable
<lb/>pride, there is less difference in rank be­
<lb/>tween you and the gardener, than between
<lb/>the gardener and a pauper. Between the
<lb/>greater part of those we call different
<lb/>classes, there is only the difference of less
<lb/>and more; the spending a hundred, or five
<lb/>hundred, or five thousand a year; the eat­
<lb/>ing off earthenware, or china, or plate:
<lb/>but there is a real and essential difference
<lb/>between the man who provides for his fa­
<lb/>mily by his own exertions, and him who
<lb/>is supported by charity. The gardener
<lb/>has a right to stretch out his nervous arm
<lb/>and to say, <said>This right hand, under Pro­
<lb/>vidence, provides for myself and my family;
<lb/>I earn what I eat, I am a burthen to no
<lb/>one, and therefore if I have any superfluity
<lb/>I have a right to spend it as I please, and
<lb/>to dress my little girl to my own fancy.</said></p>
        <pb n="65"/>
        <milestone unit="sig" n="D9r"/>
        <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">65</mw>
        <p>But do you not think, mamma, that a
<lb/>brown stuff gown and a straw bonnet
<lb/>would be a much properer dress for the
<lb/>lower sort of people than any thing gaudy?
<lb/>If they are much dressed, you know, we al­
<lb/>ways laugh at their vulgar finery.</p>
        <p>They care very little for your laughing
<lb/>at them; they do not dress to please you.</p>
        <p>Whom do they dress to please?</p>
        <p>Whom do you dress to please?</p>
        <p>You, my dear mamma, and papa.</p>
        <p>Not entirely, I fancy;—you tell me the
<lb/>truth, but not the whole truth. Well, they
<lb/>dress to please their papas and mammas,
<lb/>their young companions, and their sweet­
<lb/>hearts.</p>
        <p>I have often heard <persName>Lady Selina</persName> say,
<lb/>that if all the lower orders were to have a
<lb/>plain uniform dress, it would be much
<lb/>better; and that if a poor person is neat
<lb/>and clean, it is quite enough.</p>
        <p>Better for whom?—enough for whom?
<lb/>for themselves, or for us? They have a
<lb/>natural love of ornament as well as we
<pb n="66"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="D9v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">66</mw>
<lb/>have. It is true they can do our work as
<lb/>well in a plainer dress; but when the
<lb/>work is done and the time of enjoyment
<lb/>comes,—in the dance on the green, or the
<lb/>tea-party among their friends,—who shall
<lb/>hinder them from indulging their taste and
<lb/>fancy, and laying out the money they have
<lb/>so fairly earned in what best pleases them?</p>
        <p>But they are not content without follow­
<lb/>ing our fashions; and they are so ridicu­
<lb/>lous in their imitations of them. I was
<lb/>quite diverted to see <persName>Molly</persName> the pastry-
<lb/>cook's girl tossing her head about in a hat
<lb/>and ribbon which I dare say she thought
<lb/>very fashionable; but such a caricature of
<lb/>the mode—I was so diverted.</p>
        <p>You may be diverted with a safer con­
<lb/>science when I assure you that the laugh
<lb/>goes round. <placeName>London</placeName> laughs at the coun­
<lb/>try, the court laughs at the city, and I
<lb/>dare say your pastry-cook's girl laughs at
<lb/>somebody who is distanced by herself in
<lb/>the race of fashion.</p>
        <p>But every body says, and I have heard
<pb n="67"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="D10r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">67</mw>
<lb/>you say, mamma, that the kind of people
<lb/>I mean, and servants particularly, are very
<lb/>extravagant in dress.</p>
        <p>That unfortunately is true: they very
<lb/>often are so, and when they marry they
<lb/>suffer for it severely;—but do not you think
<lb/>many young ladies are equally so? Did
<lb/>you not see at your last dancing-school
<lb/>ball many a girl whose father cannot give
<lb/>her a thousand pounds, covered with lace
<lb/>and ornaments?</p>
        <p>It is very true.</p>
        <p>Are not duchesses driven by extrava­
<lb/>gance to pawn their plate and jewels?</p>
        <p>I have heard so.</p>
        <p>The only security against improper ex­
<lb/>pense is dignity of mind, and moderation:
<lb/>these are not common in any rank; and I
<lb/>do not know why we should expect them
<lb/>to be more common among the lower and
<lb/>uneducated classes than among the higher.
<lb/>—To return to your gardener. He has cer­
<lb/>tainly a right to dress his girl as he pleases
<lb/>without asking you or me: but I shall
<pb n="68"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="D10v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">68</mw>
<lb/>think he does not make a wise use of that
<lb/>right if he lays out his money in finery,
<lb/>instead of providing the more substantial
<lb/>comforts and enjoyments of life. And I
<lb/>should think exactly the same of my neigh­
<lb/>bour in the great house in the park.</p>
        <p>Have servants a rank?</p>
        <p>Certainly; and you will find them very
<lb/>tenacious of it. A gentleman's butler will
<lb/>not go behind a coach; a lady's maid will
<lb/>not go on an errand.</p>
        <p>Are they not very saucy to refuse doing
<lb/>it, if they are ordered?</p>
        <p>No; if they refuse civilly. They are
<lb/>hired to do certain things, not to obey
<lb/>you in every thin<choice><sic>k</sic><corr>g</corr></choice>. There are many ranks
<lb/>above, but there are also many ranks be­
<lb/>low them; and they have both the right
<lb/>and the inclination to support their place
<lb/>in society.</p>
        <p>But their masters would respect them
<lb/>the more if they did not stand upon these
<lb/>punctilios.</p>
        <p>But I have told you it is not our appro­
<pb n="69"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="D11r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">69</mw>
<lb/>bation they seek. When the lower orders
<lb/>mix with the higher, it is to maintain
<lb/>themselves and get money; and if they
<lb/>are honest, they will do their work faith­
<lb/>fully: but it is amongst their equals that
<lb/>they seek for affection, applause, and ad­
<lb/>miration; and there they meet with it. It
<lb/>matters very little in what rank a man is,
<lb/>provided he is esteemed and reckoned a
<lb/>man of consequence there. The feel­
<lb/>ings of vanity are exactly the same in
<lb/>a countess's daughter dancing at court,
<lb/>and a milkwoman figuring at a country
<lb/>hop.</p>
        <p>But surely, mamma, the countess's
<lb/>daughter will be more really elegant?</p>
        <p>That will depend very much upon in­
<lb/>dividual taste. However, the higher ranks
<lb/>have so many advantages for cultivating
<lb/>taste, so much money to lay out in deco­
<lb/>ration, and are so early taught the graces
<lb/>of air and manner to set off those decora­
<lb/>tions, that it would be absurd to deny
<pb n="70"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="D11v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">70</mw>
<lb/>their superiority in this particular. But
<lb/>Taste has one great enemy to contend with.</p>
        <p>What is that?</p>
        <p>Fashion,—an arbitrary and capricious
<lb/>tyrant, who reigns with the most despotic
<lb/>sway over that department which Taste
<lb/>alone ought to regulate. It is Fashion
<lb/>that imprisons the slender nymph in the
<lb/>vast rotunda of the hoop, and loads her
<lb/>with heavy ornaments, when she is con­
<lb/>scious, if she dared rebel, she should dance
<lb/>lighter and look better in a dress of one
<lb/>tenth part of the price. Fashion some­
<lb/>times orders her to cut off her beautiful
<lb/>tresses, and present the appearance of a
<lb/>cropped school-boy; and though this is a
<lb/>sacrifice which a nun going to be profest
<lb/>looks upon as one of the severest she is to
<lb/>make, she obeys without a murmur. The
<lb/>winter arrives, and she is cold; but Fashion
<lb/>orders her to leave off half her clothes,
<lb/>and be abroad half the night. She com­
<lb/>plies, though at the risk of her life. A

<lb/>its fore feet, makes a chattering noise,
<lb/>climbs, leaps and runs, and has a spring
<lb/>in its muscles equal to an antelope; has a

<lb/>it can twist into various attitudes, all sur­

<lb/>except when basking by the fire, of which
<lb/>it is very fond in winter. Will often
<lb/>shake its hair over the whole face, which
<lb/>gives it a look of peculiar wildness. Is
<lb/>very good-natured and playful, caress­
<lb/>ing to its keeper and every one who takes
<lb/>notice of it. Is however easily put in a
<lb/>passion, and when angry makes a threaten­
<lb/>ing noise, but is soon put to flight by the

<lb/>foundation of all that is excellent in mo­

<lb/>that a person of a cultivated mind cannot
<lb/>easily be content without obtaining some
<lb/>knowledge of them, even though he should
<lb/>not be able to read them in their original

<lb/>together with a sketch of the character of
<lb/>their several productions, for the use of
<lb/>those who have either none or a very su­
<lb/>perficial knowledge of the languages they

          <p>In the larger sense of the word, an
<lb/>author is called a Classic when his work
<lb/>has stood the test of time long enough to
<lb/>become a permanent part of the literature
<lb/>of his country. Of the number of writings
<lb/>which in their day have attained a portion
<lb/>of fame, very few in any age have survived
<lb/>to claim this honourable distinction. Every
<lb/>circumstance which gave temporary cele­
<lb/>brity must be forgotten; party must have
<lb/>subsided; the voice of friends and of ene­
<lb/>mies must be silent; and the writer himself
<lb/>must have long mouldered in the dust,
<lb/>before the gates of immortality are opened
<lb/>to him. It is in vain that he attempts to
<lb/>flatter or to soothe his contemporaries, they
<lb/>are not called to the decision; his merits
<lb/>are to be determined by a race he has
<lb/>never seen; the judges are not yet born
<lb/>who are to pronounce on the claims of
<lb/><persName>Darwin</persName> and of <persName>Cowper</persName>. The severe im­
<lb/>partiality of Posterity stands aloof from
<lb/>every consideration but that of excellence,
<lb/>and from her verdict there is no appeal.</p>

          <p>It is true, indeed, that amidst the revo­
<lb/>lutions of ages, particularly before the
<lb/>invention of printing, accidental circum­
<lb/>stances must often have had great influence
<lb/>in the preservation of particular writings:
<lb/>and we know and lament that many are
<lb/>lost which the learned world would give
<lb/>treasures of gold to recover. But it cannot
<lb/>easily happen that a work should be pre­
<lb/>served without superior merit; and indeed
<lb/>we know from the testimony of antiquity,
<lb/>that the works which have come down to
<lb/>us, and which we read and admire, are in
<lb/>general the very works which by the
<lb/><name>Greeks</name> and <name>Romans</name> themselves were es­
<lb/>teemed most excellent.</p>
          <p>It is impossible to contemplate without
<lb/>a sentiment of reverence and enthusiasm,
<lb/>these venerable writings which have sur­
<lb/>vived the wreck of empires; and, what is
<lb/>more, of languages; which have received the
<lb/>awful stamp of immortality, and are crowned
<lb/>with the applause of so many successive ages.
<lb/>It is wonderful that words should live so

<lb/>much longer than marble temples;—words,
<lb/>which at first are only uttered breath; and,
<lb/>when afterwards enshrined and fixed in a
<lb/>visible form by the admirable invention of
<lb/>writing, committed to such frail and perish­
<lb/>able materials: yet the light paper bark
<lb/>floats down the stream of time, and lives
<lb/>through the storms which have sunk so
<lb/>many stronger built vessels. <persName>Homer</persName> is

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">79</mw>
<lb/>books of the kind we are speaking of, that
<lb/>at the revival of letters the world had not
<lb/>to go back to the very beginnings of
<lb/>science. When the storm of barbaric
<lb/>rage had past over and spent itself, they
<lb/>were drawn from the mould of ruins and
<lb/>dust of convents, and were of essential
<lb/>service in forming our taste and giving a
<lb/>direction to the recovered energies of the
<lb/>human mind. Oral instruction can benefit
<lb/>but one age and one set of hearers; but
<lb/>these silent teachers address all ages and
<lb/>all nations. They may sleep for a while
<lb/>and be neglected; but whenever the desire
<lb/>of information springs up in the human
<lb/>breast, there they are with their mild wis­
<lb/>dom ready to instruct and please us. The
<lb/>Philosopher opens again his school; his
<lb/>maxims have lost nothing of their truth:
<lb/>the harmony of the Poet's numbers,
<lb/>though locked up for a time, becomes
<lb/>again vocal; and we find that what was
<lb/>nature and passion two thousand years
<lb/>ago, is nature and passion still.</p>

          <p>Books are a kind of perpetual censors on
<lb/>men and manners; they judge without par­
<lb/>tiality, and reprove without fear or affection.
<lb/>There are times when the flame of virtue
<lb/>and liberty seems almost to be extinguish­
<lb/>ed amongst the existing generation; but
<lb/>their animated pages are always at hand
<lb/>to rekindle it. The Despot trembles on his
<lb/>throne, and the bold bad man turns pale
<lb/>in his closet at the sentence pronounced
<lb/>against him ages before he was born.</p>
          <p>In addition to their intrinsic value, there
<lb/>is much incidental entertainment in consult­
<lb/>ing authors who flourished at so remote a
<lb/>period. Every little circumstance becomes
<lb/>curious as we discover allusions to customs
<lb/>now obsolete, or draw indications of the
<lb/>temper of the times from the various slight
<lb/>hints and casual pieces of information
<lb/>which may be gathered up by the inge­
<lb/>nious critic. Sometimes we have the plea­
<lb/>sure of being admitted into the cabinet of
<lb/>a great man, and leaning as it were over
<lb/>his shoulder while he is pouring himself
<pb n="81"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="E5r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">81</mw>
<lb/>out in the freedom of a confidential inter­
<lb/>course which was never meant to meet the
<lb/>eye even of his contemporaries. At another
<lb/>time we are delighted to witness the con­
<lb/>scious triumph of a genius who, with a ge­
<lb/>nerous confidence in his powers, prophesies
<lb/>his own immortality, and to feel as we read
<lb/>that his proud boast has not been too pre­
<lb/>sumptuous. Another advantage of reading
<lb/>the ancients is, that we trace the stream of
<lb/>ideas to their spring. It is always best to
<lb/>go to the fountain head. We can never have
<lb/>a just idea of the comparative merit of the
<lb/>moderns, without knowing how much they
<lb/>have derived from imitation. It is amus­
<lb/>ing to follow an idea from century to cen­
<lb/>tury, and observe the gradual accession of
<lb/>thought and sentiment; to see the jewels
<lb/>of the ancients new set, and the wit of
<lb/><persName>Horace</persName> sparkling with additional lustre in
<lb/>the lines of <persName>Pope</persName>.</p>
          <p>The real sources of History can only be
<lb/>known by some acquaintance with the ori­
<lb/>ginal authors. This indeed will often be
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">E5</mw>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">82</mw>
<lb/>found to betray the deficiency of our do­
<lb/>cuments, and the difficulty of reconciling
<lb/>jarring accounts. It will sometimes unclothe
<lb/>and exhibit in its original bareness what the
<lb/>art of the moderns has drest up and round­
<lb/>ed into form. It will show the unsight­
<lb/>ly chasms and breaks which the modern
<lb/>compiler passes over with a light foot; and
<lb/>perhaps make us sceptical with regard to
<lb/>many particulars of which we formerly
<lb/>thought we had authentic information. But
<lb/>it is always good to know the real measure
<lb/>of our knowledge. That knowledge would
<lb/>be greater, if the treasures of antiquity had
<lb/>come to us undiminished: but this is not
<lb/>the case. Besides the loss of many mention­
<lb/>ed with honour by their contemporaries,
<lb/>few authors are come down to us entire;
<lb/>and of some exquisite productions only
<lb/>fragments are extant. The full stream of
<lb/>narration is sometimes suddenly checked
<lb/>at the most interesting period, and the
<lb/>sense of a brilliant passage is clouded by
<lb/>the obscurity of a single word. The lite­
<pb n="83"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="E6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">83</mw>
<lb/>rary productions are come to us in a simi­
<lb/>lar state with the fine statues of antiquity:
<lb/>of which some have lost an arm, others a
<lb/>leg; some a little finger only: scarce any
<lb/>have escaped some degree of mutilation;
<lb/>and sometimes a trunk is dug up so shorn
<lb/>of its limbs, that the antiquaries are puz­
<lb/>zled to make out to what god or hero it
<lb/>originally belonged. To the frequent loss
<lb/>of part of an author must be added the
<lb/>difficulty of deciphering what remains.</p>
          <p>Ancient manuscripts are by no means
<lb/>easy to read. You are not to imagine, when
<lb/>you see a fair edition of <persName>Virgil</persName>, or <persName>Horace</persName>,
<lb/>divided into verses and accurately pointed,
<lb/>that you see it in any thing like its ori­
<lb/>ginal state. The oldest manuscripts are
<lb/>written wholly in capitals, and without any
<lb/>separation of letters into words. Pass­
<lb/>ing through many hands, they have suffer­
<lb/>ed from the mistakes or carelessness of
<lb/>transcribers; by which so great an obscu­
<lb/>rity is thrown on many passages, that very
<lb/>often he who makes the happiest guess is
<pb n="84"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">84</mw>
<lb/>the best commentator. But this very ob­
<lb/>scurity has usefully exercised the powers
<lb/>of the human mind. It became a great
<lb/>object, at the revival of letters, to compare
<lb/>different readings; to elucidate a text by
<lb/>parallel passages; to supply by probable
<lb/>conjecture what was necessary to make an
<lb/>author speak sense; and by every possible
<lb/>assistance of learning and sound criticism,
<lb/>together with typographical advantages,
<lb/>to restore the beauty and splendour of the
<lb/>classic page. Verbal criticism was at
<lb/>that time of great and real use; and those
<lb/>who are apt to undervalue it, are little
<lb/>aware how much labour was requisite to
<lb/>reduce the confused or mutilated work of a
<lb/>thousand years back to form and order.</p>
          <p>This task was well fitted for an age re­
<lb/>cently emerged out of barbarism. The en­
<lb/>thusiastic admiration with which men were
<lb/>struck on viewing the master-pieces of
<lb/>human genius, and even the superstitious
<lb/>veneration with which they regarded every
<lb/>thing belonging to them, tended to form
<pb n="85"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="E7r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">85</mw>
<lb/>their taste by a quicker process than if
<lb/>they had been left to make the most of their
<lb/>own abilities. By degrees the moderns felt
<lb/>their own powers; they learned to imitate,
<lb/>and perhaps to excell what before they ido­
<lb/>lized. But a considerable period had passed
<lb/>before any of the modern languages were
<lb/>thought worthy of being the vehicle of the
<lb/>discoveries of science or even of the effu­
<lb/>sions of fancy. <name>Christianity</name> did not as
<lb/>might have been expected, bring into dis­
<lb/>credit the pagan philosophy. <persName>Aristotle</persName>
<lb/>reigned in the schools, where he was regard­
<lb/>ed with a veneration fully equal to what
<lb/>was expressed for the sainted fathers of
<lb/>the church; and as to the mythology of
<lb/>the ancients, it is so beautiful that all our
<lb/>earlier poetry has been modeled upon it.
<lb/>Even yet, the predilection for the Latin
<lb/>language is apparent in our inscriptions,
<lb/>in the public exercises of our schools and
<lb/>universities, and the general bent of the
<lb/>studies of youth. In short, all our know­
<lb/>ledge and all our taste has been built upon

<lb/>the foundation of the ancients; and without
<lb/>knowing what they have done, we cannot
<lb/>estimate rightly the merit of our own au­
<lb/>thors.</p>
          <p>It may naturally be asked why the
<lb/>Greek and Roman writers alone are called
<lb/>by the name of Classics. It is true the
<lb/><name>Hebrew</name> might be esteemed so, if we did
<lb/>not receive them upon a higher ground of
<lb/>merit. As to the <name>Persian</name> and <name>Arabic</name>
<lb/>with other languages of countries once
<lb/>highly cultivated, their authors are not
<lb/>taken into the account, partly because they
<lb/>are understood by so few, and partly be­
<lb/>cause their idioms and modes of expres­
<lb/>sion, if not of feeling, are so remote from
<lb/>ours that we can scarcely enter into their
<lb/>merits. Their writings are comprehended
<lb/>under the name of Oriental literature. It
<lb/>has been more cultivated of late, particular­
<lb/>ly by <persName>Sir William Jones</persName>; and our <placeName>East In­
<lb/>dia</placeName> possessions will continue to draw our
<lb/>attention that way: but curiosity is gratified
<lb/>rather than taste. We are pleased indeed

<lb/>with occasional beauties, sometimes a pure
<lb/>maxim of morality and sometimes a glow­
<lb/>ing figure of speech; but they do not enter
<lb/>into the substance of the mind, which ever
<lb/>must be fed and nourished by the classic
<lb/>literature of <placeName>Greece</placeName> and <placeName>Rome</placeName>.</p>

<lb/>men proposed themselves, and lost their
<lb/>lives; for the conditions were, that if they
<lb/>were overcome in the race they should be
<lb/>put to death. At length she was chal­
<lb/>lenged by <persName>Hippomenes</persName>, a brave and hand­

<lb/>cells me in swiftness, and that you must be

<lb/>and win you too.</said></p>
          <p>So the ground was marked out and the
<lb/>day appointed, and a great number of
<lb/>spectators gathered together; and <persName>Atalanta</persName>
<lb/>stood with her garments tucked up, and
<lb/><persName>Hippomenes</persName> by her, waiting impatiently for
<lb/>the signal. At length it was given; and im­

<lb/>so, <persName>Hippomenes</persName> passed her, and the spec­

<lb/>tators shouted for joy. However, <persName>Atalanta</persName>
<lb/>redoubled her speed, soon overtook <persName>Hip­
<lb/>pomenes</persName>, and again got before him. Up­
<lb/>on this, <persName>Hippomenes</persName> produced another
<lb/>golden apple, and threw it as before. It
<lb/>rolled a great way out of the course, and
<lb/>the virgin was thrown very far behind by
<lb/>picking it up. She had great difficulty this
<lb/>time to recover her lost ground, and the
<lb/>spectators shouted <said><persName>Hippomenes</persName> will win!
<lb/><persName>Hippomenes</persName> will win!</said> but <persName>Atalanta</persName> was
<lb/>so light, so nimble, and exerted herself so
<lb/>much, that at length she passed him as be­
<lb/>fore, and flew as if she had wings towards
<lb/>the goal. And now she had but a little way
<lb/>to run; and the people said, <said>Poor <persName>Hip­
<lb/>pomenes</persName>! he will lose after all, and be put to
<lb/>death like the rest;—see, see how she gains
<lb/>ground of him! how near the goal she is!
<lb/><persName>Atalanta</persName> will win the race.</said> Then <persName>Hippo­
<lb/>menes</persName> took another golden apple,—it was
<lb/>the last he had, and prayed to <persName>Venus</persName> to
<lb/>give him success, and threw it behind him.
<lb/><persName>Atalanta</persName> saw it, and considered a moment

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">90</mw>
<lb/>whether she should venture to delay her­
<lb/>self again by picking it up. She knew she
<lb/>ran the risk of losing the race, but she
<lb/>could not withstand the beautiful glittering
<lb/>of the apple as it rolled along; and she
<lb/>said to herself, <said>I shall easily overtake
<lb/><persName>Hippomenes</persName>, as I did before.</said> But she
<lb/>was mistaken; for they had now so little a
<lb/>way to run, that though she skimmed along
<lb/>the plain like a bird, and exerted all her
<lb/>strength, she was too late. <persName>Hippomenes</persName>
<lb/>reached the goal before her: she was obliged
<lb/>to own herself conquered, and to marry

<lb/>tempted by the wealth which he had on

<lb/>should return from their voyage, and he
<lb/>would do him justice. When the ship re­

<lb/>But <persName>Adonis</persName> would not listen to her. He
<lb/>loved to rise early in the morning while the
<lb/>dew was upon the grass, and to beat the
<lb/>thickets with his well-trained hounds, whose
<lb/>ears swept the ground. With his darts
<lb/>he pierced the nimble fawns and the kids
<lb/>with budding horns, and brought home the
<lb/>spoil upon his shoulders. But one day he
<lb/>wounded a fierce bristly boar; the arrow
<lb/>stuck in his side, and made the animal mad
<lb/>with pain: he rushed upon <persName>Adonis</persName>, and
<lb/>gored his thigh with his sharp tusks. Beau­

<lb/>tiful <persName>Adonis</persName> fell to the ground like a lily
<lb/>that is rooted up by a sudden storm: his
<lb/>blood flowed in crimson streams down his
<lb/>fair side; and his eyelids closed, and the
<lb/>shades of death hovered over his pale brow.</p>
          <p>In the mean time the evening came on,
<lb/>and <persName>Venus</persName> had prepared a garland of fresh
<lb/>leaves and flowers to bind around the glow­
<lb/>ing temples of <persName>Adonis</persName> when he should come
<lb/>hot and tired from the chase, and a couch
<lb/>of rose-leaves to rest his weary limbs: and
<lb/>she said, <said>Why does not <persName>Adonis</persName> come!
<lb/>Return, <persName>Adonis</persName>! let me hear the sound of
<lb/>your feet! let me hear the voice of your
<lb/>dogs! let them lick my hands, and make
<lb/>me understand that their master is ap­
<lb/>proaching!</said>—But <persName>Adonis</persName> did not return;
<lb/>and the dark night came, and the rosy
<lb/>morning appeared again, and still he did
<lb/>not appear. Then <persName>Venus</persName> sought him in
<lb/>the plains and through the thickets, and
<lb/>amidst the rough brakes; and her veil was
<lb/>torn with the thorns, and her feet bruised
<lb/>and bleeding with the sharp pebbles; for
<pb n="95"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">95</mw>
<lb/>she ran hither and thither like a distracted
<lb/>person. And at length upon the moun­
<lb/>tain she found him whom she loved so dear­
<lb/>ly: but she found him cold and dead, with
<lb/>his faithful dogs beside him.</p>
          <p>Then <persName>Venus</persName> rent her beautiful tresses,
<lb/>and beat her breast, and pierced the air with
<lb/>her loud lamentations; and the little <name>Cupids</name>
<lb/>that accompany her broke their ivory bows
<lb/>for grief, and scattered upon the ground the
<lb/>arrows of their golden quivers: and they
<lb/>said, <said>We mourn <persName>Adonis</persName>; <persName>Venus</persName> mourns
<lb/>for beautiful <persName>Adonis</persName>; the Loves mourn along
<lb/>with her. Beautiful <persName>Adonis</persName> lies dead upon
<lb/>the ground, his side gored with the tooth
<lb/>of a boar,—his white thigh with a white
<lb/>tooth. <persName>Venus</persName> kisses the cold lips of <persName>Ado­
<lb/>nis</persName>; but <persName>Adonis</persName> does not know that he is
<lb/>kissed, and she cannot revive him with her
<lb/>warm breath.</said></p>
          <p>Then <persName>Venus</persName> said, <said>You shall not quite
<lb/>die, my <persName>Adonis</persName>! I will change you into
<lb/>a flower.</said> And she shed nectar on the
<lb/>ground, which mixed with the blood, and

<lb/>presently a crimson flower sprung up in
<lb/>the room of <persName>Adonis</persName>; and also the river was
<lb/>tinged with his blood and became red.</p>
          <p>And every year, on the day that <persName>Adonis</persName>
<lb/>died, the nymphs mourned and lamented
<lb/>for him, and ran up and down shrieking,
<lb/>and crying <said>Beautiful <persName>Adonis</persName> is dead!</said></p>

        <salute>Madam,</salute>
        <p rend="first-indent(0)"><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">Amidst</hi> the mutual compliments and kind
<lb/>wishes which are universally circulated at
<lb/>this season, I hope mine will not be the
<lb/>least acceptable; and I have thought proper
<lb/>to give you this early assurance of my
<lb/>kind intentions towards you, and the bene­
<lb/>fits I have in store for you: for though I
<lb/>am appointed your sovereign; though your
<lb/>fates and fortune, your life and death, are
<lb/>at my disposal; yet I am fully sensible that I
<lb/>was created for my subjects, not my sub­
<lb/>jects for me; and that the end of my very
<lb/>existence is to diffuse blessings on my
<lb/>people.</p>
        <p>My predecessor departed this life last
<lb/>night precisely at twelve o'clock. He died of
<lb/>a universal decay; nature was exhausted in
<lb/>him, and there was not vital heat sufficient

<lb/>to carry on the functions of life; his hair
<lb/>was fallen, and discovered his smooth,
<lb/>white, bald head; his voice was hoarse and
<lb/>broken, and his blood froze in his veins:
<lb/>in short, his time was come. And to say
<lb/>truth he will not be much regretted;
<lb/>for of late he had been gloomy and va­
<lb/>pourish, and the sudden gusts of passion
<lb/>he had long been subject to were worked
<lb/>up into such storms it was impossible to
<lb/>live under him with comfort.</p>
        <p>With regard to myself, I am sensible
<lb/>the joy expressed at my accession is sincere,
<lb/>and that no young monarch has ever been
<lb/>welcomed with warmer demonstrations of
<lb/>affection. Some have ardently longed for
<lb/>my coming, and all view my approach
<lb/>with pleasure and cheerfulness; yet such is
<lb/>the uncertainty of popular favour, that I well
<lb/>know that those who are most eager and
<lb/>sanguine in expressing their joy will soon­
<lb/>est be tired of my company. You yourself,
<lb/>madam, though I know that at present
<lb/>you regard me with kindness, as one from
<pb n="99"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">99</mw>
<lb/>whom you expect more happiness than
<lb/>you have yet enjoyed, will probably after
<lb/>a short time wish as much to part with
<lb/>me, and transfer the same fond hopes and
<lb/>wishes to my successor. But though your
<lb/>impatience may make me a very trouble­
<lb/>some companion, it will not in the least
<lb/>hasten my departure; nor can all the powers
<lb/>of earth oblige me to resign a moment be­
<lb/>fore my time. In order, therefore, that you
<lb/>may form proper expectations concerning
<lb/>me, I shall give you a little sketch of my
<lb/>temper and manners, and I will acknow­
<lb/>ledge that my aspect at present is some­
<lb/>what stern and rough; but there is a latent
<lb/>warmth in my temper which you will per­
<lb/>ceive as we grow better acquainted, and I
<lb/>shall every day put on a milder and more
<lb/>smiling look: indeed I have so much fire,
<lb/>that I may chance sometimes to make the
<lb/>house too hot for you; but in recompense
<lb/>for this inequality of temper I am kind
<lb/>and bountiful as a giving God: I come
<lb/>full-handed, and my very business is to
<lb/>dispense blessings;—blessings of the basket

<lb/>and the store; blessings of the field and of
<lb/>the vineyard; blessings for time and for
<lb/>eternity. There is not an inhabitant of the
<lb/>globe who will not experience my bounty;
<lb/>yet such is the ingratitude of mankind,
<lb/>that there is scarcely one whom I shall
<lb/>not leave in some degree discontented.</p>
        <p>Whimsical and various are the petitions
<lb/>which are daily put up to me from all
<lb/>parts; and very few of the petitioners
<lb/>will be satisfied; because they reject and
<lb/>despise the gifts I offer them with open
<lb/>hand, and set their minds on others which
<lb/>certainly will not fall to their share. <persName>Celia</persName>
<lb/>has begged me on her knees to find her a
<lb/>lover: I shall do what I can; I shall bring
<lb/>her the most magnificent shawl that has
<lb/>appeared in <placeName>Europe</placeName>. For <persName>Dorinda</persName>, who
<lb/>has made the same petition, I have two
<lb/>gifts,—wisdom and grey hairs; the former
<lb/>I know she will reject, nor can I force her
<lb/>to wear it; but the grey hairs I shall leave
<lb/>on her toilette whether she will or no.
<lb/>The curate <persName>Sophron</persName> expects I shall bring
<lb/>him a living: I shall present him with
<pb n="101"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">101</mw>
<lb/>twins as round and rosy as an apple. Nor
<lb/>can I listen to the entreaty of <persName>Dorimant</persName>,
<lb/>whose good father being a little asthmatic,
<lb/>he has desired me to push him into his
<lb/>grave as we walk up May hill together:
<lb/>but I shall marry him to a handsome
<lb/>lively girl, who will make a very pretty
<lb/>stepmother to the young gentleman. It is
<lb/>in vain for poor <persName>Sylvia</persName> to weary me as she
<lb/>does with prayers to restore to her her
<lb/>faithless lover: but I shall give her the
<lb/>choice of two, to replace him. <persName>Codrus</persName> has
<lb/>asked me if he may bespeak a suit of black:
<lb/>but I can tell him his little wife will out­
<lb/>live me and him too: I have offered the
<lb/>old man a double portion of patience, which
<lb/>he has thrown away very pettishly. <persName>Stre­
<lb/>phon</persName> has entreated me to take him to <placeName>Scot­
<lb/>land</placeName> with his mistress: I shall do it; and
<lb/>he will hate my very name all his life after.</p>
        <p>The wishes of some are very moderate;
<lb/>—<persName>Fanny</persName> begs two inches of height, and
<lb/><persName>Chloe</persName> that I would take away her awk­
<lb/>ward plumpness; <persName>Carus</persName> a new equipage,
<lb/>and <persName>Philida</persName> a new ball-dress. A mother
<pb n="102"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">102</mw>
<lb/>brought me her son the other day, made
<lb/>me many compliments, and desired me to
<lb/>teach him every thing; at the same time
<lb/>begging the youth to throw away his
<lb/>marbles, which he had often promised to
<lb/>part with as soon as he saw me:—but the
<lb/>boy held them fast, and I shall teach him
<lb/>nothing but to play at taw. Many ladies
<lb/>have come to me with their daughters in
<lb/>their hands, telling me they hope their
<lb/>girls, under me, will learn prudence: but
<lb/>the young ladies have as constantly desired
<lb/>me to teach prudence to their grand­
<lb/>mothers, whom it would better become,
<lb/>and to bring them new dances and new
<lb/>fashions. In short, I have scarcely seen any
<lb/>one with whom I am likely entirely to
<lb/>agree, but a stout old farmer who rents
<lb/>a small cottage on the green. He was
<lb/>leaning on his spade when I approach­
<lb/>ed him. As his neighbour told him I was
<lb/>coming, he welcomed me with a cheerful
<lb/>countenance; but at the same time bluntly
<lb/>told me he had not expected me so soon,
<lb/>being too busy to pay much attention to
<pb n="103"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">103</mw>
<lb/>my approach. I asked him if I could do
<lb/>any thing for him. He said he did not be­
<lb/>lieve me better or worse than those who
<lb/>had preceded me, and therefore should
<lb/>not expect much from me; that he was
<lb/>happy before he saw me, and should be
<lb/>very well contented after I left him: he
<lb/>was glad to see me, however, and only
<lb/>begged I would not take his wife from him,
<lb/>a thin withered old woman who was eat­
<lb/>ing a mess of milk at the door. <said>And I
<lb/>shall be glad too,</said> said he, <said>if you will
<lb/>fill my cellar with potatoes.</said> As he ap­
<lb/>plied himself to his spade while he said
<lb/>these words, I shall certainly grant his re­
<lb/>quest.</p>
        <p>I shall now tell you, that great and ex­
<lb/>tensive as my power is, I shall possess it
<lb/>but a short time. However the predictions
<lb/>of astrologers are now laughed at, nothing
<lb/>is more certain than what I am going to
<lb/>tell you. A scheme of my nativity has
<lb/>been cast by the most eminent astrono­
<lb/>mers, who have found, on consulting the
<lb/>stars and the aspect of the heavenly bodies,
<pb n="104"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">104</mw>
<lb/>that <persName>Capricornus</persName> will be fatal to me: I
<lb/>know that all the physicians in the world
<lb/>cannot protract my life beyond that fatal
<lb/>period. I do not tell you this to excite
<lb/>your sensibility,—for I would have you
<lb/>meet me without fondness and part with
<lb/>me without regret; but to quicken you to
<lb/>lay hold on those advantages I am able to
<lb/>procure you; for it will be your own fault
<lb/>if you are not both wiser and better for my
<lb/>company. I have likewise another request
<lb/>to make to you,—that you will write my
<lb/>epitaph: I may make you happy, but it
<lb/>depends on you to make me famous. If,
<lb/>after I am departed, you can say my reign
<lb/>was distinguished by good actions and
<lb/>wise conversations, and that I have left
<lb/>you happier than I found you, I shall not
<lb/>have lived in vain. My sincere wishes
<lb/>are, that you may long outlive me, but
<lb/>always remember me with pleasure. I am,

        <p rend="first-indent(0)"><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">Plants</hi> stand next to animals in the scale
<lb/>of existence: they are, like them, organized
<lb/>bodies; like them, increase by nutrition,
<lb/>which is conveyed through a system of
<lb/>tubes and fine vessels, and assimilated to
<lb/>their substance; like them, they propagate
<lb/>their race from a parent, and each seed
<lb/>produces its own plant; like them, they
<lb/>grow by insensible degrees from an infant
<lb/>state to full vigour, and after a certain term
<lb/>of maturity decay and die. In short, ex­
<lb/>cept the powers of speech and locomotion,
<lb/>they seem to possess every characteristic of
<lb/>sentient life.</p>
        <p>A plant consists of a root, a stem, leaves,
<lb/>and a flower or blossom.</p>
        <p>The root is bulbous, as the onion; long,
<lb/>like the parsnip or carrot; or branched out
<pb n="108"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F6v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">108</mw>
<lb/>into threads, as the greater number are,
<lb/>and particularly all the large ones;—a bul­
<lb/>bous root could not support a large tree.</p>
        <p>The stem is single or branched, cling­
<lb/>ing for support or upright, clothed with
<lb/>a skin or bark.</p>
        <p>The flower contains the principle of re­
<lb/>production, as the root does of individu­
<lb/>ality. This is the most precious part of
<lb/>the plant, to which every thing contributes.
<lb/>The root nourishes it, the stem supports,
<lb/>the leaves defend and shelter it: it comes
<lb/>forth but when Nature has prepared for it
<lb/>by showers and sun and gentle soothing
<lb/>warmth;—colour, beauty, scent adorn it;
<lb/>and when it is complete, the end of the
<lb/>plant's existence is answered. It fades and
<lb/>dies; or, if capable by its perennial nature
<lb/>of repeating the process, it hides in its in­
<lb/>most folds the precious germ of new being,
<lb/>and itself almost retires from existence till
<lb/>a new year.</p>
        <p>A tree is one of the most stately and
<lb/>beautiful objects in God's visible creation.
<pb n="109"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F7r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">109</mw>
<lb/>It does not admit of an exact definition, but
<lb/>is distinguished from the humbler plant by
<lb/>its size, the strength of its stem, which be­
<lb/>comes a trunk, and the comparative small­
<lb/>ness of the blossom. In the fruit-trees,
<lb/>indeed, the number of blossoms compen­
<lb/>sates for their want of size; but in the
<lb/>forest-trees the flower is scarcely visible.
<lb/>Production seems not to be so important
<lb/>a process where the parent tree lives for
<lb/>centuries.</p>
        <p>Every part of vegetables is useful. Of
<lb/>many the roots are edible, and the seeds are
<lb/>generally so; of many the leaves, as of the
<lb/>cabbage, spinach; the buds, as of the as­
<lb/>paragus, cauliflower; the bark is often em­
<lb/>ployed medicinally, as the quinquina and
<lb/>cinnamon.</p>
        <p>The trunk of a tree determines the man­
<lb/>ner of its growth, and gives firmness: the
<lb/>foliage serves to form one mass of a num­
<lb/>ber of trees; while the distinct lines are
<lb/>partly seen, partly hidden. The leaves
<lb/>throw over the branches a rich mantle, like
<pb n="110"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F7v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">110</mw>
<lb/>flowing tresses; they wave in the wind with
<lb/>an undulatory motion, catch the glow of
<lb/>the evening sun, or glitter with the rain;
<lb/>they shelter innumerable birds and ani­
<lb/>mals, and afford variety in colours, from
<lb/>the bright green of spring to the varied
<lb/>tints of autumn. In winter, however, the
<lb/>form of each tree and its elegant ramifica­
<lb/>tions are discerned, which were lost under
<lb/>the flowing robe of verdure.</p>
        <p>Trees are beautiful in all combinations;
<lb/>the single tree is so; the clump, the grove,
<lb/>rising like an amphitheatre; the flowing
<lb/>line that marks the skirts of wood and the
<lb/>dark, deep, boundless shade of the forest;
<lb/>the green line of the hedge-row, the more
<lb/>artificial avenue, the Gothic arch of ver­
<lb/>dure, the tangled thicket.</p>
        <p>Young trees are distinguished by beauty,
<lb/>in maturity their characteristic is strength.
<lb/>The ruin of a tree is venerable even when
<lb/>fallen: we are then more sensible of its
<lb/>towering height: we also observe the root,
<lb/>the deep fangs which held it against so
<pb n="111"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F8r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">111</mw>
<lb/>many storms, and the firmness of the wood;
<lb/>a sentiment of pity mixes too with our ad­
<lb/>miration. The trees in groves and woods
<lb/>shed a brown religious horror, which fa­
<lb/>voured the religion of the ancient world.
<lb/>Trees shelter from cutting winds and sea
<lb/>air; they preserve moisture: but if too
<lb/>many, in their thick and heavy mass lazy
<lb/>vapours stagnate; their profuse perspira­
<lb/>tion is unwholesome; they shut out the
<lb/>golden sun and ventilating breeze.</p>
        <p>It should seem as if the number of trees
<lb/>must have been diminishing for ages, for
<lb/>in no cultivated country does the growth
<lb/>of trees equal the waste of them. A few
<lb/>gentlemen raise plantations, but many
<lb/>more cut down; and the farmer thinks
<lb/>not of so lofty a thing as the growth of
<lb/>ages. Trees are too lofty to want the
<lb/>hand of man. The florist may mingle

<lb/>behold have by the earliest philosophers
<lb/>been resolved into four elements,—<emph>Earth,

        <p>Earth is the element which on many ac­
<lb/>counts claims our chief notice. It forms
<lb/>the bulk of that vast body of matter which
<lb/>composes our globe; and, like the bones to
<lb/>the human body, it gives firmness, shape,
<lb/>and solidity to the various productions of
<lb/>Nature. It is ponderous, dull, unanimated,
<lb/>ever seeking the lowest place; and, except
<lb/>moved by some external impulse, prone to
<lb/>rest in one sluggish mass. Yet when fer­

<lb/>mented into life by the quickening power
<lb/>of vegetation,—in how many forms of grace
<lb/>and beauty does it rise to the admiring eye!
<lb/>How gay, how vivid with colours! how fra­
<lb/>grant with smells! how rich with tastes,—
<lb/>luscious, poignant, sapid, mild, pungent, or
<lb/>saccharine! Into what delicate textures is
<lb/>it spread out in the thin leaf of the rose, or
<lb/>the light film of the floating gossamer!
<lb/>How curious in the elegant ramifications of
<lb/>trees and shrubs, or the light dust which
<lb/>the microscope discovers to contain the
<lb/>seed of future plants!</p>
        <p>Nor has Earth less of magnificence, in
<lb/>the various appearances with which upon
<lb/>a larger scale its broad surface is diver­
<lb/>sified;—whether we behold it stretched out
<lb/>into immense plains and vast savannahs,
<lb/>whose level green is only bounded by the
<lb/>horizon; or moulded into those gentle risings
<lb/>and easy declivities whose soft and undu­
<lb/>lating lines court the pencil of the land­
<lb/>scape-painter; or whether, swelled into bulk
<lb/>enormous, it astonishes the eye with vast

<lb/>bulwarks of stone. Such are the <placeName>Pyrenees</placeName>,
<lb/>the <placeName>Alps</placeName>, the <placeName>Andes</placeName>, which stand the ever­
<lb/>lasting boundaries of nations; and, while
<lb/>kingdoms rise and fall, and the lesser works
<lb/>of nature change their appearance all
<lb/>around them, immoveable on their broad
<lb/>basis, strike the mind with an idea of sta­
<lb/>bility little short of eternal duration.</p>
        <p>If from the mountains which possess the
<lb/>middle of Earth we bend our course to the
<lb/>green verge of her dominions, the utmost
<lb/>limits of her shores, where land and water,
<lb/>like two neighbouring potentates, wage eter­
<lb/>nal war,—with what steady majesty does she
<lb/>repel the encroachments of the ever-restless
<lb/>ocean, and dash the turbulence of waves
<lb/>from her strong-ribbed sides!</p>
        <p>Nor do thy praises end here:—With a
<lb/>kind of filial veneration I hail thee, O uni­
<lb/>versal mother of all the elements,—to man
<lb/>the most mild, the most beneficent, the

<lb/>when for a few years he has moved about
<lb/>upon thy surface, he is gathered again to
<lb/>thy peaceful bosom, at once his nurse, his
<lb/>cradle, and his grave.</p>
        <p>Who can reckon up the benefits supplied
<lb/>to us by this parent Earth,—ever service­
<lb/>able, ever indulgent! with how many pro­
<lb/>ductions does she reward the labour of the
<lb/>cultivator! how many more does she pour
<lb/>out spontaneously! How faithfully does she
<lb/>keep, with what large interest does she re­
<lb/>store, the seed committed to her by the hus­
<lb/>bandman! What an abundance does she
<lb/>yield, of food for the poor, of delicacies for
<lb/>the rich! Her wealth is inexhaustible; and
<lb/>all that is called riches amongst men consists
<lb/>in possessing a small portion of her surface.</p>
        <p>How patiently does she support the vari­
<lb/>ous burdens laid upon her! We tear her with

<lb/>are as abundant, her horn of plenty as
<lb/>overflowing, her robe as green, her un­
<lb/>shorn tresses (the waving foliage of brown
<lb/>forests) as luxuriant; and all her charms
<lb/>as blooming and full of vigour. Such she

          <p rend="first-indent(0)"><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">I was</hi> told the other day that you have not
<lb/>forgotten a promise of mine to correspond
<lb/>with you upon some subject which might be
<lb/>worth discussing, and relative to your pur­
<lb/>suits. I have often recollected it also; and
<lb/>as promises ought not only to be recollect­
<lb/>ed but fulfilled, I will without further pre­
<lb/>face throw together some thoughts on <emph>Hi­
<lb/>story</emph>, a study that I know you value as
<lb/>it deserves; and I trust it will not be dis­
<lb/>agreeable to you, if you should find some
<lb/>observations which your own mind may
<lb/>have suggested, or which you may recol­
<lb/>lect to have heard from me in some of those
<lb/>hours which we spent together with mu­
<lb/>tual pleasure.</p>
          <p>Much has been said of the uses of hi­
<pb n="120"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F12v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">120</mw>
<lb/>story. They are no doubt many, yet do not
<lb/>apply equally to all: but it is quite suffi­
<lb/>cient to make it a study worth our pains
<lb/>and time, that it satisfies the desire which
<lb/>naturally arises in every intelligent mind to
<lb/>know the transactions of the country, of
<lb/>the globe in which he lives. Facts, as facts,
<lb/>interest our curiosity and engage our at­
<lb/>tention.</p>
          <p>Suppose a person placed in a part
<lb/>of the country where he was a total
<lb/>stranger; he would naturally ask, who are
<lb/>the chief people of the place, what family
<lb/>they are of, whether any of their ancestors
<lb/>have been famous, and for what. If he see
<lb/>a ruined abbey, he will inquire what the
<lb/>building was used for; and if he be told it
<lb/>is a place where people got up at midnight
<lb/>to sing psalms, and scourged themselves in
<lb/>the day,—he will ask how there came to be
<lb/>such people, or why there are none now.
<lb/>If he observe a dilapidated castle which
<lb/>appears to have been battered by violence,
<lb/>he will ask in what quarrel it suffered, and
<pb n="121"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G1r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">121</mw>
<lb/>why they built formerly structures so diffe­
<lb/>rent from any we see now. If any part of
<lb/>the inhabitants should speak a different lan­
<lb/>guage from the rest, or have some singular
<lb/>customs among them, he would suppose
<lb/>they came originally from some remote part
<lb/>of the country, and would inform himself, if
<lb/>he could, of the cause of their peculiarities.</p>
          <p>If he were of a curious temper, he would
<lb/>not rest till he had informed himself whom
<lb/>every estate in the parish belonged to,
<lb/>what hands they had gone through; how
<lb/>one man got this field by marrying an
<lb/>heiress, and the other lost that meadow by
<lb/>a ruinous lawsuit. As a man of spirit, he
<lb/>would feel delighted on hearing the rela­
<lb/>tion of the opposition made by an honest
<lb/>yeoman to an overbearing rich man on the
<lb/>subject of an accustomed pathway or right
<lb/>of common. If he should find the town
<lb/>or village divided into parties, he would
<lb/>take some pains to trace the original
<lb/>cause of their dissension, and to find
<lb/>out, if possible, who had the right on his
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">G</mw>
<pb n="122"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G1v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">122</mw>
<lb/>side. Circumstances would often occur to
<lb/>excite his attention. If he saw a bridge, he
<lb/>would ask when and by whom it was built.
<lb/>If in digging in his garden he should find
<lb/>utensils of a singular form and construc­
<lb/>tion, or a pot of money with a stamp and
<lb/>legend quite different from the common
<lb/>coin, he would be led to inquire when they
<lb/>were in use, and to whom they had be­
<lb/>longed. His curiosity would extend itself
<lb/>by degrees. If a brook ran through the
<lb/>meadows, he would be pleased to trace it
<lb/>till it swelled into a river, and the river
<lb/>till it lost itself in the sea. He would be
<lb/>asking whose seat he saw upon the edge of
<lb/>a distant forest, and what sort of country
<lb/>lay behind the range of hills that bounded
<lb/>his utmost view. If any strangers came to
<lb/>visit or reside in the place where he lived,
<lb/>he would be questioning them about the
<lb/>country they came from, their connexions
<lb/>and alliances, and the remarkable trans­
<lb/>actions that had taken place within their
<lb/>memory or that of their parents. The
<pb n="123"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">123</mw>
<lb/>answers to these questions would insensi­
<lb/>bly grow up into <emph>History</emph>, which, as you
<lb/>see, does not originate in abstruse specula­
<lb/>tion, but grows naturally out of our situa­
<lb/>tion and relative connexions. It gratifies
<lb/>a curiosity which all feel in some degree,
<lb/>but which spreads and enlarges itself with
<lb/>the cultivation of our powers, till at length
<lb/>it embraces the whole globe which we in­
<lb/>habit. To know is as natural to the mind
<lb/>as to see is to the eye, and knowledge is
<lb/>itself an ultimate end. But though this may
<lb/>be esteemed an ultimate and sufficient end,
<lb/>the study of history is important to va­
<lb/>rious purposes. Few pursuits tend more to
<lb/>enlarge the mind. It gives us, and it only
<lb/>can give us, an extended knowledge of hu­
<lb/>man nature;—not human nature as it exists
<lb/>in one age or climate or particular spot of
<lb/>earth, but human nature under all the
<lb/>various circumstances by which it can be
<lb/>affected. It shows us what is radical and
<lb/>what is adventitious: it shows us that man
<lb/>is still man in <placeName>Turkey</placeName> and in <placeName>Lapland</placeName>, as
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">G2</mw>
<pb n="124"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">124</mw>
<lb/>a vassal in <placeName>Russia</placeName> or a member of a wan­
<lb/>dering tribe in <placeName>India</placeName>, in ancient <placeName>Athens</placeName> or
<lb/>modern <placeName>Rome</placeName>; yet that his character is
<lb/>susceptible of violent changes, and becomes
<lb/>moulded into infinite diversities by the in­
<lb/>fluence of government, climate, civilization,
<lb/>wealth, and poverty. By showing us how
<lb/>man has acted, it shows us to a certain de­
<lb/>gree how he will ever act in given circum­
<lb/>stances; and general rules and maxims are
<lb/>drawn from it for the service of the law­
<lb/>giver and the statesman.</p>
          <p>Here I must observe however, with
<lb/>regard to <emph>events</emph>, that a knowledge of hi­
<lb/>story does not seem to give us any great
<lb/>advantage in foreseeing and preparing
<lb/>for them. The deepest politician, with all
<lb/>his knowledge of the revolutions of past
<lb/>ages, could probably no more have pre­
<lb/>dicted the course and termination of the
<lb/>late French revolution, than a common
<lb/>man. The state of our own national debt
<lb/>has baffled calculation, the course of ages
<lb/>has presented nothing like it. Who could
<pb n="125"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">125</mw>
<lb/>have pronounced that the struggle of the
<lb/><name>Americans</name> would be successful—that of
<lb/>the <name>Poles</name> unsuccessful? Human characters
<lb/>indeed act always alike: but events depend
<lb/>upon circumstances as well as characters;
<lb/>and circumstances are infinitely various
<lb/>and changed by the slightest causes. A
<lb/>battle won or lost may decide the fate of an
<lb/>empire: but a battle may be won or lost
<lb/>by a shower of snow being blown to the
<lb/>east or the west; by a horse (the general's)
<lb/>losing his shoe; by a bullet or an arrow
<lb/>taking a direction a tenth part of an inch
<lb/>one way or the other.—The whole course
<lb/>of the French affairs might have been
<lb/>changed if the king had not stopped to
<lb/>breakfast, or if the post-master of <placeName>Va­
<lb/>rennes</placeName> had not happened to know him.
<lb/>These are particulars which no man can
<lb/>foresee; and therefore no man can with
<lb/>precision foresee events.</p>
          <p>The rising up of certain characters at
<lb/>particular periods ranks among those un­
<lb/>foreseen circumstances that powerfully in­
<pb n="126"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">126</mw>
<lb/>fluence events. Often does a single man, as
<lb/><persName>Epaminondas</persName>, illustrate his country, and
<lb/>leave a long track of light after him to future
<lb/>ages. And who can tell how much even
<lb/><placeName>America</placeName> owed to the <emph>accident</emph> of being served
<lb/>by such a man as <persName>Washington</persName>? There are
<lb/>always many probable events. All that
<lb/>history enables the politician to do, is to
<lb/>predict that one or other of them will take
<lb/>place. If so and so, it will be this; if so and
<lb/>so, it will be that: but which, he cannot
<lb/>tell. There are always combinations of
<lb/>circumstances which have never met before
<lb/>from the creation of the world, and which
<lb/>mock all power of calculation. But let
<lb/>the circumstances be known and the cha­
<lb/>racters upon the stage, and history will
<lb/>tell him what to expect from them. It
<lb/>will tell him with certainty, for instance,
<lb/>that a treaty extorted by force from dis­
<lb/>tress, will be broken when opportunity
<lb/>offers: that if the church and the mon­
<lb/>arch are united they will oppress, if at
<lb/>variance they will divide the people; that
<pb n="127"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">127</mw>
<lb/>a powerful nation will make its advantage
<lb/>of the divisions of a weaker which applies
<lb/>for its assistance.</p>
          <p>It is another advantage of history, that
<lb/>it stores the mind with facts that apply to
<lb/>most subjects which occur in conversation
<lb/>among enlightened people. Whether mo­
<lb/>rals, commerce, languages, polite literature
<lb/>be the object of discussion, it is history that
<lb/>must supply her large storehouse of proofs
<lb/>and illustrations. A man or a woman may
<lb/>decline without blame many subjects of
<lb/>literature, but to be ignorant of history is
<lb/>not permitted to any of a cultivated mind.
<lb/>It may be reckoned among its advantages,
<lb/>that this study naturally increases the love
<lb/>of every man to his country. We can only
<lb/>love what we know; it is by becoming
<lb/>acquainted with the long line of patriots,
<lb/>heroes, and distinguished men, that we
<lb/>learn to love the country which has pro­
<lb/>duced them.</p>

<lb/>village, that village is his country, and con­
<lb/>sequently all of it he can love. The man who
<lb/>mixes in the world, and has a large acquaint­

<lb/>himself upon the stage of it, has a wider
<lb/>range. His idea of a country extends to its
<lb/>civil polity, its military triumphs, the elo­

<lb/>of which he is a member. But how won­

<lb/>story conducts our retrospective view
<lb/>through past ages! How much more has

<lb/>with the fame and fortunes of the <name>Sidneys</name>

<lb/>who have illustrated her annals! Like a

<lb/>faithful meter would tell him how high the
<lb/>tide had once risen; he would not tread
<lb/>unconsciously the ground where the Muses
<lb/>and the Arts had once resided, like the
<lb/>goat that stupidly browses upon the fane
<lb/>of <persName>Minerva</persName>. Even the name of his country
<lb/>will be dear and venerable to him. He
<lb/>will muse over her fallen greatness, sit down
<lb/>under the shade of her never-dying laurels,
<lb/>build his little cottage amidst the ruins
<lb/>of her towers and temples, and contemplate
<lb/>with tenderness and respect the decaying
<lb/>age of his once illustrious parent.</p>

          <p>But if an acquaintance with history thus
<lb/>increases a rational love of our country, it
<lb/>also tends to check those low, illiberal, vul­
<lb/>gar prejudices which adhere to the unin­
<lb/>formed of every nation. Travelling will also
<lb/>cure them: but to travel is not within the
<lb/>power of every one. There is no use, but a
<lb/>great deal of harm in fostering a contempt
<lb/>for other nations; in an arrogant assump­
<lb/>tion of superiority, and the clownish sneer
<lb/>of ignorance at every thing in laws, govern­
<lb/>ment or manners which is not fashioned
<lb/>after our partial ideas and familiar usages.
<lb/>A well-informed person will not be apt to
<lb/>exclaim at every event out of the common
<lb/>way, that nothing like it has ever happened
<lb/>since the creation of the world, that such
<lb/>atrocities are totally unheard-of in any age
<lb/>or nation;—sentiments we have all of us so
<lb/>often heard of late on the subject of the
<lb/>French revolution: when in fact we can
<lb/>scarcely open a page of their history with­
<lb/>out being struck with similar and equal
<lb/>enormities. Indeed party spirit is very
<pb n="133"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G7r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">133</mw>
<lb/>much cooled and checked by an acquaint­
<lb/>ance with the events of past times.</p>
          <p>When we see the mixed and imper­
<lb/>fect virtue of the most distinguished cha­
<lb/>racters; the variety of motives, some pure
<lb/>and some impure, which influence political
<lb/>conduct; the partial success of the wisest
<lb/>schemes, and the frequent failure of the fair­
<lb/>est hopes;—we shall find it more difficult
<lb/>to choose a side, and to keep up an interest
<lb/>towards it in our minds, than to restrain
<lb/>our feelings and language within the bounds
<lb/>of good sense and moderation. This, by
<lb/>the way, makes it particularly proper that
<lb/><emph>ladies</emph> who interest themselves in the events
<lb/>of public life should have their minds cul­
<lb/>tivated by an acquaintance with history,
<lb/>without which, they are apt to let the whole
<lb/>warmth of their natures flow out, upon party
<lb/>matters, in an ardour more honest than
<lb/>wise, more zealous than candid.</p>
          <p>With regard to the moral uses of hi­
<lb/>story, what has just been mentioned may
<lb/>stand for one. It serves also by exercise
<pb n="134"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G7v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">134</mw>
<lb/>to strengthen the moral feelings. The
<lb/>traits of generosity, heroism, disinterested­
<lb/>ness, magnanimity, are scattered over it
<lb/>like sparkling gems, and arrest the atten­
<lb/>tion of the most common reader. It is
<lb/>wonderfully interesting to follow the re­
<lb/>volutions of a great state, particularly
<lb/>when they lead to the successful termina­
<lb/>tion of some glorious contest. Is it true?—
<lb/>a child asks, when you tell him a wonderful
<lb/>story that strikes his imagination. The
<lb/>writer of fiction has the unlimited com­
<lb/>mand of events and of characters; yet
<lb/>that single circumstance of truth, that the
<lb/>events related really came to pass, that
<lb/>the heroes brought upon the stage really
<lb/>existed,—counterbalances, with respect to
<lb/>interest, all the privileges of the former,
<lb/>and in a mind a little accustomed to exer­
<lb/>tion will throw the advantage on the side
<lb/>of the historian.</p>
          <p>The more History approaches to Bio­
<lb/>graphy the more interest it excites. Where
<lb/>the materials are meagre and scanty, the
<pb n="135"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G8r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">135</mw>
<lb/>antiquarian and the chronologer may
<lb/>dwell upon the page; but it will seldom
<lb/>excite the glow of admiration or draw
<lb/>the delicious tear of sensibility. I must
<lb/>acknowledge however, in order to be
<lb/>candid, that the emotions excited by the
<lb/>actions of our species are not always of so
<lb/>pleasing or so edifying a nature. The
<lb/>miseries and the vices of man form a
<lb/>large part of the picture of human society:
<lb/>the pure mind is disgusted by depravity,
<lb/>the existence of which it could not have
<lb/>imagined to itself; and the feeling heart is
<lb/>cruelly lacerated by the sad repetition of
<lb/>wrongs and oppression, chains and slaugh­
<lb/>ter, sack and massacre, which assail it in
<lb/>every page:—till the mind has gained
<lb/>some strength, so frightful a picture should
<lb/>hardly be presented to it. Chosen periods
<lb/>of history may be selected for youth, as the
<lb/>society of chosen characters precedes in
<lb/>well-regulated education a more indiscri­
<lb/>minate acquaintance with the world. In
<lb/>favour of a more extended view, I can
<lb/>only say that truth is truth,—man must be
<pb n="136"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G8v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">136</mw>
<lb/>shown as the being he really is, or no real
<lb/>knowledge is gained. If a young person
<lb/>were to read only the <title rend="slant(italic)">Beauties of History</title>,
<lb/>or, according to <persName>Madame Genlis's</persName> scheme,
<lb/>stories and characters in which all that was
<lb/>vicious should be left out, he might as well,
<lb/>for any real acquaintance with life he
<lb/>would gain, have been reading all the
<lb/>while <persName>Sir Charles Grandison</persName> or the <persName>Prin­
 <lb/>cess of <placeName>Cleves</placeName></persName>.</p>
          <p>One consoling idea will present itself
<lb/>with no small degree of probability on
<lb/>comparing the annals of past and present
<lb/>times,—that of a tendency to amelioration;
<lb/>at least it is evidently found in those coun­
<lb/>tries with which we are most connected.
<lb/>But the only balm that can be poured with
<lb/>full effect into the feeling mind which
<lb/>bleeds for the folly and wickedness of man,
<lb/>is the belief that all events are directed
<lb/>and controlled by supreme wisdom and
<lb/>goodness. Without this persuasion, the
<lb/>world becomes a desert, and its devastators
<lb/>the wolves and tigers that prowl over it.</p>
          <p>It is needless to insist on the uses of
<pb n="137"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G9r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">137</mw>
<lb/>history to those whose situation in life
<lb/>gives them room to expect that their
<lb/>actions may one day become the objects
<lb/>of it. Besides the immediate necessity to
<lb/>them of the knowledge it supplies, it af­
<lb/>fords the strongest motives for their con­
<lb/>duct of hope and fear. The solemn award,
<lb/>the incorruptible tribunal and the severe
<lb/>soul-searching inquisition of Posterity is
<lb/>calculated to strike an awe into their souls.
<lb/>They cannot take refuge in oblivion: it is
<lb/>not permitted them to die:—they may be
<lb/>the objects of gratitude or detestation as
<lb/>long as the world stands. They may flatter
<lb/>themselves that they have silenced the
<lb/>voice of truth; they may forbid newspapers
<lb/>and pamphlets and conversation;—an un­
<lb/>seen hand is all the while tracing out their
<lb/>history, and often their minutest actions, in
<lb/>indelible characters; and it will soon be held
<lb/>up for the judgement of the world at large.</p>
          <p>Lastly, this permanency of human cha­
<lb/>racters tends to cherish in the mind the
<lb/>hope and belief of an existence after death.

<lb/>If we had no notices from the page of hi­
<lb/>story of those races of men that have lived
<lb/>before us, they would seem to be com­
<lb/>pletely swept away; and we should no
<lb/>more think of inquiring what human
<lb/>beings filled our place upon the earth a
<lb/>thousand harvests ago, than we should
<lb/>think about the generations of cattle which
<lb/>at that time grazed the marshes of the
<lb/><placeName>Tiber</placeName>, or the venerable ancestors of the
<lb/>goats that are browsing upon <placeName>Mount Hy­
<lb/>mettus;</placeName>—no vestige would remain of one
<lb/>any more than of the other, and we might
<lb/>more pardonably fall into the opinion that
<lb/>they both had shared a similar fate. But
<lb/>when we see illustrious characters continu­
<lb/>ing to live on in the eye of posterity, their
<lb/>memories still fresh, and their noble actions
<lb/>shining with all the vivid colouring of truth
<lb/>and reality, ages after the very dust of
<lb/>their tombs is scattered, high conceptions
<lb/>kindle within us; and feeling one immorta­
<lb/>lity, we are led to hope for another. We
<lb/>find it hard to persuade ourselves that the
<pb n="139"/>

<lb/>man who, like <persName>Antoninus</persName> or <persName>Socrates</persName>, fills
<lb/>the world with the sweet perfume of his
<lb/>virtue, the martyr or the patriot to whom
<lb/>posterity is doing the justice which was
<lb/>denied him by his contemporaries, should
<lb/>all the while himself be blotted out of
<lb/>existence, that he should be benefiting
<lb/>mankind and doing good so long after he
<lb/>is capable of receiving any, that we should
<lb/>be so well acquainted with him, and that
<lb/>he should never know any thing of us.
<lb/>That one who is an active agent in the

<lb/>I would now direct your attention to those
<pb n="140"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G10v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">140</mw>
<lb/>collateral branches of science which are
<lb/>necessary for the profitable understanding
<lb/>of it. It is impossible to understand one
<lb/>thing well without understanding to a
<lb/>certain degree many other things; there is
<lb/>a mutual dependence between all parts of
<lb/>knowledge. This is the reason that a
<lb/>child never fully comprehends what he is
<lb/>taught: he receives an idea, but not the
<lb/>full idea, perhaps not the principal of what
<lb/>you want to teach him. But as his mind
<lb/>opens, this idea enlarges and receives ac­
<lb/>cessory ideas, till slowly and by degrees he
<lb/>is master of the whole. This is particularly
<lb/>the case in History. You may recollect
<lb/>probably that the mere <emph>adventure</emph> was all
<lb/>you entered into, in those portions of it
<lb/>which were presented to you at a very
<lb/>early age. You could understand nothing
<lb/>of the springs of action, nothing of the
<lb/>connexion of events with the intrigues of
<lb/>cabinets, with religion, with commerce; no­
<lb/>thing of the state of the world at different
<lb/>periods of society and improvement: and
<pb n="141"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G11r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">141</mw>
<lb/>as little could you grasp the measured
<lb/>distances of time and space which are set
<lb/>between them. This you could not do, not
<lb/>because the history was not related with
<lb/>clearness, but because you were destitute
<lb/>of other knowledge.</p>
          <p>The first studies which present them­
<lb/>selves as accessories in this light are <emph>Geo­
<lb/>graphy</emph> and <emph>Chronology</emph>, which have been
<lb/>called the two eyes of History. When was
<lb/>it done? Where was it done? are the two
<lb/>first questions you would ask concerning
<lb/>any fact that was related to you. Without
<lb/>these two particulars there can be no pre­
<lb/>cision or clearness.</p>
          <p>Geography is best learned along with
<lb/>history; for if the first explains history, the
<lb/>latter gives interest to geography, which
<lb/>without it is but a dry list of names. For
<lb/>this reason if a young person begin with
<lb/>ancient history, I should think it adviseable,
<lb/>after a slight general acquaintance with
<lb/>the globe, to confine his geography to the
<lb/>period and country of which he is read­
<lb/>ing; and it would be a desirable thing to
<pb n="142"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G11v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">142</mw>
<lb/>have maps adapted to each remarkable
<lb/>period in the great empires of the world.
<lb/>These should not contain any towns or be
<lb/>divided into any provinces which were
<lb/>not known at that period. A map of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>
<lb/>for instance, calculated for its ancient mon­
<lb/>archy, should have <placeName>Memphis</placeName> marked in
<lb/>it, but not <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, because the two
<lb/>capitals did not exist together. A map
<lb/>of <placeName>Judea</placeName> for the time of <persName>Solomon</persName>, or any
<lb/>period of its monarchy, should not exhibit
<lb/>the name of <placeName>Samaria</placeName>, nor the villages of
<lb/><placeName>Bethany</placeName> and <placeName>Nazareth</placeName>: but each country
<lb/>should have the towns and divisions, as
<lb/>far as they are known, calculated for
<lb/>the period the map was meant to illus­
<lb/>trate. Thus geography, civil geography,
<lb/>would be seen to grow out of history;
<lb/>and the mere view of the map would sug­
<lb/>gest the political state of the world at any
<lb/>period.</p>
          <p>It would be a pleasing speculation to see
<lb/>how the arbitrary divisions of kingdoms
<lb/>and provinces vary and become obsolete, and
<lb/>large towns flourish and fall again into ruins;
<pb n="143"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G12r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">143</mw>
<lb/>while the great natural features, the moun­
<lb/>tains, rivers, and seas remain unchanged,
<lb/>by whatever names we please to call them,
<lb/>whatever empire incloses them within its
<lb/>temporary boundaries. We have, it is
<lb/>true, ancient and modern maps; but the
<lb/>one set includes every period from the
<lb/>Flood to the provinciating the Roman em­
<lb/>pire under <persName>Trajan</persName>, and the other takes in
<lb/>all the rest. About half a dozen sets for
<lb/>the ancient states and empires, and as
<lb/>many for the modern, would be sufficient
<lb/>to exhibit the most important changes, and
<lb/>would be as many as we should be able
<lb/>to give with any clearness. The young
<lb/>student should make it an invariable rule
<lb/>never to read history without a map
<lb/>before him; to which should be added
<lb/>plans of towns, harbours, &amp;c. These
<lb/>should be conveniently placed under the
<lb/>eye, separate if possible from the book he
<lb/>is reading, that by frequent glancing upon
<lb/>them the image of the country may be
<lb/>indelibly impressed on his imagination.</p>

          <p>Besides the necessity of maps for under­
<lb/>standing history, the memory is wonder­
<lb/>fully assisted by the local association
<lb/>which they supply. The battles of <placeName>Issus</placeName>
<lb/>and the <placeName>Granicus</placeName> will not be confounded
<lb/>by those who have taken the pains to
<lb/>trace the rivers on whose banks they
<lb/>were fought: the exploits of <persName>Hannibal</persName> are
<lb/>connected with a view of the <placeName>Alps</placeName>, and
<lb/>the idea of <persName>Leonidas</persName> is inseparable from
<lb/>the straits of <placeName>Thermopylæ</placeName>. The greater
<lb/>accuracy of maps, and still more the faci­
<lb/>lity, from the arts of printing and engra­
<lb/>ving, of procuring them, is an advantage
<lb/>the moderns have over the ancients. They
<lb/>have been perfected by slow degrees. The
<lb/><name>Egyptians</name> and <name>Chaldeans</name> studied the science
<lb/>of mensuration; and the first map—rude
<lb/>enough no doubt—is said to have been made
<lb/>by order of <persName>Sesostris</persName> when he became master
<lb/>of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>. Commerce and war have been
<lb/>the two parents of this science. <persName>Pharaoh
<lb/>Necho</persName> ordered the <name>Phœnicians</name> whom he
<lb/>sent round <placeName>Africa</placeName>, to make a survey of the
<pb n="145"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="H1r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">145</mw>
<lb/>coast. This they finished in three years.
<lb/><persName>Darius</persName> caused the <placeName>Ethiopic Sea</placeName> and the
<lb/>mouth of the <placeName>Indus</placeName> to be surveyed. That
<lb/>maps were known in <placeName>Greece</placeName> you no doubt
<lb/>recollect from the pretty story of <persName>Socrates</persName>
<lb/>and <persName>Alcibiades</persName>. <persName>Anaximander</persName>, a disciple
<lb/>of <persName>Thales</persName>, is said to have made the first
<lb/>sphere, and first delineated what was then
<lb/>known of the countries of the earth. He
<lb/>flourished 547 years before <persName ref="p:jchrist.hjn">Christ</persName>. <persName>Hero­
<lb/>dotus</persName> mentions a map of brass or copper
<lb/>which was presented by <persName>Aristagoras</persName> tyrant
<lb/>of <placeName>Miletus</placeName> to <persName>Cleomenes</persName> king of <placeName>Sparta</placeName>,
<lb/>in which he had described the known
<lb/>world with its seas and rivers. <persName>Alexander
<lb/>the Great</persName> in his expedition into <placeName>Asia</placeName> took
<lb/>two geographers with him; and from their
<lb/>itineraries many things have been copied
<lb/>by succeeding writers.</p>
          <p>From <placeName>Greece</placeName> the science of geography
<lb/>passed to <placeName>Rome</placeName>. The enlightened policy of
<lb/>the <name>Romans</name> cultivated it as a powerful means
<lb/>of extending and securing their dominion.
<lb/>One of the first things they did was to make

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">146</mw>
<lb/>roads, for which it was necessary to have
<lb/>the country measured. They had a cus­
<lb/>tom when they had conquered a country
<lb/>to have a painted map of it always carried
<lb/>aloft in their triumphs. The great historian
<lb/><persName>Polybius</persName> reconnoitred under a commis­
<lb/>sion from <persName>Scipio Emilianus</persName> the coasts of
<lb/><placeName>Africa</placeName>, <placeName>Spain</placeName>, and <placeName>France</placeName>, and measured
<lb/>the distances of <persName>Hannibal's</persName> march over the
<lb/><placeName>Alps</placeName> and <placeName>Pyrenees</placeName>. <persName>Julius Cæsar</persName> employ­
<lb/>ed men of science to survey and measure
<lb/>the globe; and his own Commentaries show
<lb/>his attention to this part of knowledge.
<lb/><persName>Strabo</persName>, a great geographer whose works
<lb/>are extant, flourished under <persName>Augustus</persName>;
<lb/><persName>Pomponius Mela</persName> in the first century.</p>
          <p>Many of the Roman itineraries which are
<lb/>still extant, show the systematic care which
<lb/>they bestowed on a science so necessary
<lb/>for the orderly distribution and government
<lb/>of their large dominions. But still it was
<lb/>late before Geography was settled upon
<lb/>its true basis,—astronomical observations.
<lb/>The greater part of the early maps were
<pb n="147"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="H2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">147</mw>
<lb/>laid down in a very loose inaccurate man­
<lb/>ner; and where particular parts were done
<lb/>with the greatest care, yet if the longitude
<lb/>and latitude were wanting, their relative
<lb/>situation to the rest of the earth could not
<lb/>be known. Some attempts had indeed been
<lb/>made by <persName>Hipparchus</persName> and <persName>Possidonius</persName>,
<lb/>Greek philosophers, to settle the parallels
<lb/>of latitude by the length of the days; but
<lb/>the foundation they had laid was neglected
<lb/>till the time of <persName>Ptolemy</persName>, who flourished at
<lb/><placeName>Alexandria</placeName> about 150 years after <persName>Christ</persName>,
<lb/>under <persName>Adrian</persName> and <persName>Antoninus Pius</persName>. This is
<lb/>he from whom the Ptolemaic system took
<lb/>its name. He diligently compared and
<lb/>revised the ancient maps and charts, cor­
<lb/>recting their errors and supplying their
<lb/>defects by the reports of travellers and
<lb/>navigators, the measured or reputed di­
<lb/>stances of maps and itineraries, and astro­
<lb/>nomical calculations, all digested together;
<lb/>he reduced geography to a regular sy­
<lb/>stem, and laid down the situation of places
<lb/>according to minutes and degrees of longi­

<lb/>tude and latitude as we now have them. His
<lb/>maps were in general use till the last three
<lb/>or four centuries, in which time the pro­
<lb/>gress of the moderns in the knowledge of
<lb/>the globe we inhabit has thrown at a great
<lb/>distance all the ancient geographers.</p>
          <p>We are now, some few breaks and
<lb/>chasms excepted, pretty well acquainted
<lb/>with the outline of the globe, and with those
<lb/>parts of it with which we are connected by
<lb/>our commercial or political relations; but
<lb/>we are still profoundly ignorant of the inte­
<lb/>rior of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, and imperfectly acquainted
<lb/>with that of <placeName>South America</placeName>, and the west­
<lb/>ern part of <placeName>North America</placeName>. We know
<lb/>little of <placeName>Thibet</placeName> and the central parts of
<lb/><placeName>Asia</placeName>, and have as yet only touched upon
<lb/>the great continent of <placeName>New Holland</placeName>.</p>
          <p>The best ancient maps are those of
<lb/><persName>D'Anville</persName>. It has required great learning
<lb/>and proportionate skill to bring together the
<lb/>scattered notices which are found in various
<lb/>authors, and to fix the position of places
<lb/>which have been long ago destroyed; very
<pb n="149"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">149</mw>
<lb/>often the geographer has no other guide
<lb/>than the relation of the historian that such
<lb/>a place is within six or eight days journey
<lb/>from another place. In some instances
<lb/>the maps of <persName>Ptolemy</persName> are lately come into
<lb/>repute again,—as in his delineation of the
<lb/>course of the <placeName>Niger</placeName>, which is thought to be
<lb/>favoured by modern discoveries. <persName>Major
<lb/>Rennell</persName> has done much to improve the
<lb/>geography of <placeName>India</placeName>.</p>
          <p>There are many valuable maps scattered
<lb/>in voyages and travels, and many of the
<lb/>atlases contain a collection sufficient for all
<lb/>common purposes; but a complete collec­
<lb/>tion of the best maps and charts, with
<lb/>plans of harbours, towns, &amp;c., becomes an
<lb/>object of even princely expense. The
<lb/><name>French</name> took the lead in this, as in some
<lb/>other branches of science. The late em­
<lb/>press of <placeName>Russia</placeName> caused a geographical sur­
<lb/>vey to be taken of her dominions, which

<lb/>artificial thing, and the world had existed
<lb/>for a long course of centuries before men
<lb/>were aware of its use and necessity. <emph>When</emph>
<lb/>is a relative term; the most natural appli­
<lb/>cation of it is, how long ago, reckoning
<lb/>backwards from the present moment? Thus
<lb/>if you were to ask an <name>Indian</name> when such an
<pb n="151"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="H4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">151</mw>
<lb/>event happened, he would probably say—
<lb/>So many harvests ago, when I could but
<lb/>just reach the boughs of yonder tree;—in
<lb/>the time of my father, grandfather, great­
<lb/>grandfather; still making the time then
<lb/>present to him the date from which he sets
<lb/>out. Even where a different method is
<lb/>well understood, we use in more familiar
<lb/>life this natural kind of chronology—The
<lb/>year before I was married,—when <persName>Henry</persName>,
<lb/>who is now five years old, was born,—the
<lb/>winter of the hard frost. These are the
<lb/>epochs which mark the annals of domestic
<lb/>life more readily and with greater clear­
<lb/>ness, so far as the real idea of time is con­
<lb/>cerned, than the year of our Lord, as long
<lb/>as these are all within the circle of our per­
<lb/>sonal recollection. But when events are
<lb/>recorded, the relator may be forgotten, and
<lb/>the <emph>when</emph> again occurs: <said>When did the hi­
<lb/>storian live? I understand the relative
<lb/>chronology of his narration; I know how
<lb/>the events of it follow one another; but
<lb/>what is their relation to general chrono­

<lb/>logy, to time as it relates to me and to
<lb/>other events?</said></p>
          <p>To know the transactions of a particu­
<lb/>lar reign, that of <persName>Cyrus</persName> for instance, in
<lb/>the regular order in which they happened
<lb/>in that reign, but not to know where to
<lb/>place them with respect to the history of
<lb/>other times and nations, is as if we had
<lb/>a very accurate map of a small island
<lb/>existing somewhere in the boundless ocean,
<lb/>and could lay down all the bearings
<lb/>and distances of its several towns and vil­
<lb/>lages, but for want of its longitude and la­
<lb/>titude were ignorant of the relative position
<lb/>of the island itself. Chronology supplies
<lb/>this longitude and latitude, and fixes every
<lb/>event to its precise point in the chart of
<lb/>universal time. It supplies a common
<lb/>measure by which I may compare the re­
<lb/>lator of an event with myself, and his <emph>now</emph>
<lb/>or <emph>ten years ago</emph> with the present <emph>now</emph> or
<emph>ten years</emph>, reckoning from the time in which
<lb/>I live.</p>
          <p>In order to find such a common mea­
<pb n="153"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="H5r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">153</mw>
<lb/>sure, men have been led by degrees to fix
<lb/>upon some one known event, and to make
<lb/>that the center from which, by regular di­
<lb/>stances, the different periods of time are
<lb/>reckoned, instead of making the present
<lb/>time, which is always varying, and every
<lb/>man's own existence, the center.</p>
          <p>The first approach to such a mode of
<lb/>computing time is to date by the reigns of
<lb/>kings; which, being public objects of great
<lb/>notoriety, seem to offer themselves with
<lb/>great advantage for such a purpose. The
<lb/>scripture history, which is the earliest of
<lb/>histories, has no other than this kind of
<lb/>successive dates: <quote>Now it came to pass in
<lb/>the fifth year of the king <persName>Hezekiah</persName>.</quote> <quote>And
<lb/>the time that <persName>Solomon</persName> reigned in <placeName>Jerusa­
<lb/>lem</placeName> over all <placeName>Israel</placeName> was forty years: and
<lb/><persName>Solomon</persName> slept with his fathers; and <persName>Reho­
<lb/>boam</persName> his son reigned in his stead.</quote> From
<lb/>this method a regular chronology might
<lb/>certainly be deduced, if we had the whole
<lb/>unbroken series; but unfortunately there
<lb/>are many gaps and chasms in history; and
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">H5</mw>
<pb n="154"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G5v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">154</mw>
<lb/>you easily see that if any links of the chain
<lb/>are wanting, the whole computation is
<lb/>rendered imperfect. Besides, it requires a
<lb/>tedious calculation to bring it into compa­
<lb/>rison with other histories and events. To
<lb/>say that an event happened in the tenth
<lb/>year of the reign of <persName>king Solomon</persName>, gives
<lb/>you only an idea of the time relative to the
<lb/>histories of that king, but leaves you quite
<lb/>in the dark as to its relation with the time
<lb/>you live in, or with the events of the Ro­
<lb/>man history.</p>
          <p>We want therefore an universal date,
<lb/>like a lofty obelisk seen by all the country
<lb/>round, from and to which every distance
<lb/>should be measured. The most obvious
<lb/>that offers itself for this purpose is the
<lb/>creation of the world, an event equally in­
<lb/>teresting to all; to us the beginning of time,
<lb/>and from which therefore time would flow
<lb/>regularly down in an unbroken stream
<lb/>from the earliest to the latest generations
<lb/>of the human race. This would probably
<lb/>therefore have been made use of, if the
<pb n="155"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="H6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">155</mw>
<lb/>date of the creation itself could be ascer­
<lb/>tained with any exactness; but as chrono­
<lb/>logers differ by more than a thousand years
<lb/>as to the time of that event, it is necessary
<lb/>previously to mention what system is made
<lb/>use of; which renders this æra obscure and
<lb/>inconvenient. It has therefore been found
<lb/>more convenient, in fact, to take some
<lb/>known event within the limit of well-au­
<lb/>thenticated history, and to reckon from
<lb/>that fixed point backwards and forwards.
<lb/>As we cannot find the head of the river,
<lb/>and know not its termination, we must
<lb/>raise a pillar upon its banks, and measure
<lb/>our distances from that, both up and down
<lb/>the stream. This event ought to be im­
<lb/>portant, conspicuous, and as interesting as
<lb/>possible, that it may be generally received;
<lb/>for it would spare a great deal of trouble
<lb/>in computation if all the world would
<lb/>make use of the same date. This however
<lb/>has never been the case, chance and na­
<lb/>tional vanity having had their full share in
<lb/>settling them.</p>

<lb/>so as to carry us back to a period 764
<lb/>years before the creation of the world.
<lb/>This æra, standing out of all history, like

<lb/>of mistake, was a very grand idea; and in
<lb/>measuring every thing by itself, measured
<lb/>it by the eternal truth of the laws of the
<lb/>heavenly bodies. But it is not greatly em­
<lb/>ployed, the common æra serving all ordi­
<lb/>nary purposes. In modern histories the
<lb/>olympiads, Roman æras, and others, are
<lb/>reduced, in the margin, to the year of our
<lb/>Lord, or of the creation.</p>
          <p>Such is the nature of æras, now in such
<lb/>common use that we can with difficulty
<lb/>conceive the confusion in which, for the
<lb/>want of them, all the early part of history
<lb/>is involved, and the strenuous labours of
<lb/>the most learned men which have been
<lb/>employed in arranging them and reducing
<lb/>history to the order in which we now have
<lb/>it.</p>
          <p>The earliest history which we possess,
<lb/>as we have before observed, is that of the
<lb/>Jewish scriptures; these carry us from the
<lb/>creation to about the time of <persName>Herodotus</persName>:
<lb/>having no date, we are obliged to compute
<lb/>from generations, and to take the reigns
<pb n="159"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="H8r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">159</mw>
<lb/>of kings where they are given. But a
<lb/>great schism occurs at the very outset.
<lb/>The Septuagint translation of the Mosaic
<lb/>history into <name>Greek</name>, which was made by
<lb/>order of <persName>Ptolemy Philadelphus</persName>, differs
<lb/>from the Hebrew text by 1400 years from
<lb/>the creation to the birth of <persName>Abraham</persName>.</p>
          <p>The chronology of the Assyrian and
<lb/>Babylonish monarchies is involved in in­
<lb/>extricable difficulties; nor are we success­
<lb/>ful in harmonizing the <name>Greek</name> with the
<lb/>oriental writers of history. The Persian
<lb/>historians make no mention of the defeat
<lb/>of <persName>Xerxes</persName> by the <name>Greeks</name>, or that of <persName>Darius</persName>
<lb/>by <persName>Alexander</persName>. All nations have had the
<lb/>vanity to make their origin mount as high
<lb/>as possible; and they have often invented
<lb/>series of kings, or have reckoned the con­
<lb/>temporary individuals of different dyna­
<lb/>sties as following each other in regular suc­
<lb/>cession, as if one should take the kings of
<lb/>the <name>Heptarchy</name> singly instead of together.</p>
          <p>You will perhaps ask, if we have no æras,
<lb/>what have we to reckon by? We have
<pb n="160"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="H8v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">160</mw>
<lb/>generations and successions of kings. <persName>Sir
<lb/>Isaac Newton</persName>, who joined wonderful saga­
<lb/>city to profound learning and astronomical
<lb/>skill, made very great reforms in the an­
<lb/>cient chronology. He pointed out the dif­
<lb/>ference between generations and succes­
<lb/>sions of kings. A generation is not the
<lb/>life of man; it is the time that elapses be­
<lb/>fore a man sees his successor; and this,
<lb/>reckoning to the birth of the eldest son, is
<lb/>estimated at about thirty years. The suc­
<lb/>cession of kings would seem at first sight to
<lb/>be the same, and so it had been reckoned;
<lb/>but <persName>Newton</persName> corrected it, on the principle
<lb/>that kings are often cut off prematurely
<lb/>in turbulent times, or are succeeded either
<lb/>by their brothers, or by their uncles, or
<lb/>others older than themselves. The lines
<lb/>of kings of <placeName>France</placeName>, <placeName>England</placeName>, and other
<lb/>countries within the range of exact chro­
<lb/>nology, confirmed this principle. He there­
<lb/>fore rectified all the ancient chronology
<lb/>according to it; and with the assistance of
<lb/>astronomical observations he found reason
<pb n="161"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="H9r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">161</mw>
<lb/>to allow, as the average length of a reign,
<lb/>about eighteen or twenty years.</p>
          <p>But after all, great part of the chrono­
<lb/>logy of ancient history is founded upon
<lb/>conjecture and clouded with uncertainty.</p>
          <p>Although I recommend to you a con­
<lb/>stant attention to chronology, I do not think
<lb/>it desirable to load your memory with a
<lb/>great number of specific dates, both be­
<lb/>cause it would be too great a burthen on
<lb/>the retentive powers, and because it is,
<lb/>after all, not the best way of attaining clear
<lb/>ideas on the subjects of history. In order
<lb/>to do this, it is necessary to have in your
<lb/>mind the relative situation of other coun­
<lb/>tries at the time of any event recorded in
<lb/>one of them. For instance, if you have
<lb/>got by heart the dates of the accession of
<lb/>the kings of <placeName>Europe</placeName>, and want to know
<lb/>whether <persName>John</persName> lived at the time of the cru­
<lb/>sades, and in what state the Greek empire
<lb/>was, you cannot tell without an arithmeti­
<lb/>cal process, which perhaps you may not be
<lb/>quick enough to make. You cannot tell
<pb n="162"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="H9v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">162</mw>
<lb/>whether <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> had been taken by
<lb/>the <name>Turks</name> when the <name>Sicilian Vespers</name> hap­
<lb/>pened; for each fact is insulated in your
<lb/>mind; and indeed your dates give you
<lb/>only the dry catalogue of accessions. Nay,
<lb/>you may read separate histories, and yet
<lb/>not bring them together if the countries
<lb/>be remote. Each exists in your mind se­
<lb/>parately, and you have at no time the state
<lb/>of the world. But you ought to have an
<lb/>idea at once of the whole world, as far as
<lb/>history will give it. You do not see truly
<lb/>what the <name>Greeks</name> were, except you know
<lb/>that the <placeName>British Isles</placeName> were then barbarous.</p>
          <p>A few dates therefore, perfectly learned,
<lb/>may suffice, and will serve as landmarks
<lb/>to prevent your going far astray in the
<lb/>rest: but it will be highly useful to connect
<lb/>the histories you read in such a manner
<lb/>in your own mind, that you may be able
<lb/>to refer from one to the other, and to form
<lb/>them all into a whole. For this purpose,
<lb/>it is very desirable to observe and retain
<lb/>in your memory certain coincidences,
<pb n="163"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">163</mw>
<lb/>which may link, as it were, two nations
<lb/>together. Thus you may remember that
<lb/><persName>Haroun al Raschid</persName> sent to <persName>Charlemagne</persName>
<lb/>the first clock that was seen in <placeName>Europe</placeName>. If
<lb/>you are reading the history of <placeName>Greece</placeName> when
<lb/>it flourished most, and want to know what
<lb/>the <name>Romans</name> were doing at the same time,
<lb/>you may recollect that they sent to <placeName>Greece</placeName>
<lb/>for instruction when they wanted to draw
<lb/>up the laws of the <name>Twelve Tables</name>. <persName>Solon</persName>
<lb/>and <persName>Crœsus</persName> connect the history of <placeName>Lesser
<lb/>Asia</placeName> with that of <placeName>Greece</placeName>. <persName>Egbert</persName> was
<lb/>brought up in the court of <persName>Charlemagne</persName>;
<lb/><persName>Philip Augustus</persName> of <placeName>France</placeName> and <persName>Richard I</persName>.
<lb/>of <placeName>England</placeName> fought in the same crusade
<lb/>against <persName>Saladin</persName>. <persName>Queen Elizabeth</persName> received
<lb/>the French ambassador in deep mourning
<lb/>after the massacre of <persName>St. Bartholomew</persName>.</p>
          <p>It may be desirable to keep one kingdom
<lb/>as a meter for the rest. Take for this pur­
<lb/>pose first the <name>Jews</name>, then the <name>Greeks</name>, the
<lb/><name>Romans</name>, and, because it is so, our own
<lb/>country: then harmonize and connect all
<lb/>the other dates with these.</p>

          <p>That the literary history of a nation may
<lb/>be connected with the political, study also
<lb/>biography, and endeavour to link men of
<lb/>science and literature and artists with po­
<lb/>litical characters. Thus <persName>Hippocrates</persName> was
<lb/>sent for to the plague of <placeName>Athens</placeName>; <persName>Leonardo
 <lb/>da <placeName>Vinci</placeName></persName> died in the arms of <persName>Francis I</persName>.
<lb/>Often an anecdote, a smart saying, will in­
<lb/>dissolubly fix a date.</p>
          <p>Sometimes you may take a long reign,
<lb/>as that of <persName>Elizabeth</persName> or <persName>Louis XIV</persName>., and
<lb/>making that the center, mark all the con­
<lb/>temporary sovereigns, and also the men of
<lb/>letters. Another way is, to make a line of
<lb/>life, composed of distinguished characters
<lb/>who touch each other. It will be of great
<lb/>service to you in this view to study <persName>Dr.
<lb/>Priestley's</persName> biographical chart; and of still
<lb/>greater, to make one for yourself, and fill
<lb/>it by degrees as your acquaintance with hi­
<lb/>story extends. Marriages connect the hi­
<lb/>story of different kingdoms; as those of
<lb/><persName>Mary queen of <name>Scots</name></persName> and <persName>Francis II</persName>.,
  <lb/><persName>Philip II</persName>. and <persName>Mary of <placeName>England</placeName></persName>.</p>

          <p>These are the kind of dates which make
<lb/>every thing lie in the mind in its proper
<lb/>order; they also take fast hold of it. If
<lb/>you forget the exact date by years, you
<lb/>have nothing left; but of circumstances you
<lb/>never lose all idea. As we come nearer to
<lb/>our own times, dates must be more exact:
<lb/>a few years more or less signify little in the
<lb/>destruction of <placeName>Troy</placeName>, if we knew it exactly;
<lb/>but the conclusion of the American war
<lb/>should be accurately known, or it will
<lb/>throw other events near it into confusion.</p>
          <p>In so extensive a study no auxiliary is
<lb/>to be neglected: Poetry impresses both
<lb/>geography and history in a most agreeable
<lb/>manner upon those who are fond of it.

<lb/>indeed, copied pretty exactly from the
<lb/>chroniclers, but other dramatic writers
<lb/>have taken great liberties both with cha­
<lb/>racters and events.</p>
          <p>Painting is a good auxiliary; and though
<lb/>in this country history is generally read
<lb/>before we see pictures, they mutually illus­
<lb/>trate one another: painting also shows
<lb/>the costume. In <placeName>France</placeName>, where pictures
<lb/>are more accessible, there is more know­
<lb/>ledge generally diffused of common history.
<lb/>Many have learned scripture history from
<lb/>the rude figures on Dutch tiles.</p>
          <p>I will conclude with the remark, that
<lb/>though the beginner in history may and
<lb/>ought to study dates and epochas for his
<lb/>guidance, chronology can never be fully
<lb/>possessed till after history has been long

        <p>My attention, however, was soon called
<lb/>off from the scenes of inanimate life, by
<lb/>the view of the inhabitants, whose form
<lb/>and appearance were so very preposterous,
<lb/>and, indeed, so unlike any thing human,
<lb/>that I fanc<choice><sic/><corr>i</corr></choice>ed myself transported to the
<lb/>country of

<lb/>for the heads of many of these people were
<lb/>swelled to an astonishing size, and seemed
<lb/>to be placed in the middle of their bodies.
<lb/>Of some, the ears were distended till they
<lb/>hung upon the shoulders; and of others,
<lb/>the shoulders were raised till they met the
<lb/>ears: there was not one free from some de­
<lb/>formity, or monstrous swelling, in one part
<lb/>or other; either it was before, or behind,
<lb/>or about the hips, or the arms were puffed
<lb/>up to an unusual thickness, or the throat
<lb/>was increased to the same size with the
<lb/>poor objects once exhibited under the
<lb/>name of the monstrous Craws: some had
<lb/>no necks; others had necks that reached

<lb/>almost to their waists; the bodies of some
<lb/>were bloated up to such a size, that they
<lb/>could scarcely enter a pair of folding doors;
<lb/>and others had suddenly sprouted up to
<lb/>such a disproportionate height, that they
<lb/>could not sit upright in their loftiest car­
<lb/>riages.</p>
        <p>Many shocked me with the appearance
<lb/>of being nearly cut in two, like a wasp;
<lb/>and I was alarmed at the sight of a few,
<lb/>in whose faces, otherwise very fair and
<lb/>healthy, I discovered an eruption of black
<lb/>spots, which I feared was the fatal sign of
<lb/>some pestilential disorder.</p>
        <p>The sight of these various and uncouth
<lb/>deformities inspired me with much pity;
<lb/>which however was soon changed into dis­
<lb/>gust, when I perceived, with great surprise,
<lb/>that every one of these unfortunate men
<lb/>and women was exceeding proud of his
<lb/>own peculiar deformity, and endeavoured
<lb/>to attract my notice to it as much as pos­
<lb/>sible. A lady, in particular, who had a
<lb/>swelling under her throat, larger than any

<lb/>goitre in the <placeName>Valais</placeName>, and which, I am sure,
<lb/>by its enormous projection, prevented her
<lb/>from seeing the path she walked in, brush­
<lb/>ed by me with an air of the greatest self-
<lb/>complacency, and asked me if she was
<lb/>not a charming creature?</p>
        <p>But by this time I found myself sur­
<lb/>rounded by an immense crowd, who were
<lb/>all pressing along in one direction; and I
<lb/>perceived that I was drawn along with
<lb/>them by an irresistible impulse, which
<lb/>grew stronger every moment. I asked
<lb/>whither we were hurrying with such eager
<lb/>steps? and was told that we were going
<lb/>to the court of Queen Fashion, the great
<lb/><persName>Diana</persName> whom all the world worshippeth.
<lb/>I would have retired, but felt myself im­
<lb/>pelled to go on, though without being sen­
<lb/>sible of any outward force.</p>
        <p>When I came to the royal presence, I
<lb/>was astonished at the magnificence I saw
<lb/>around me. The queen was sitting on a
<lb/>throne, elegantly fashioned in the form of
<lb/>a shell, and inlaid with gems and mother-

<lb/>of-pearl. It was supported by a cameleon,
<lb/>formed of a single emerald. She was
<lb/>dressed in a light robe of changeable silk,
<lb/>which fluttered about her in a profusion of
<lb/>fantastic folds, that imitated the form of
<lb/>clouds, and like them were continually
<lb/>changing their appearance. In one hand
<lb/>she held a rouge-box, and in the other
<lb/>one of those optical glasses which distort
<lb/>figures in length or in breadth according
<lb/>to the position in which they are held. At
<lb/>the foot of the throne was displayed a pro­
<lb/>fusion of the richest productions of every
<lb/>quarter of the globe, tributes from land
<lb/>and sea, from every animal and plant;
<lb/>perfumes, sparkling stones, drops of pearl,
<lb/>chains of gold, webs of the finest linen;
<lb/>wreaths of flowers, the produce of art,
<lb/>which vied with the most delicate produc­
<lb/>tions of nature; forests of feathers waving
<lb/>their brilliant colours in the air and ca­
<lb/>nopying the throne; glossy silks, net-work
<lb/>of lace, silvery ermine, soft folds of vegeta­
<lb/>ble wool, rustling paper, and shining span­

<lb/>gles;—the whole intermixed with pendants
<lb/>and streamers of the gayest tinctured
<lb/>ribbon.</p>
        <p>All these together made so brilliant an
<lb/>appearance that my eyes were at first daz­
<lb/>zled, and it was some time before I reco­
<lb/>vered myself enough to observe the cere­
<lb/>monial of the court. Near the throne, and
<lb/>its chief supports, stood the queen's two
<lb/>prime ministers, Caprice on one side, and
<lb/>Vanity on the other. Two officers seemed
<lb/>chiefly busy among the attendants. One
<lb/>of them was a man with a pair of shears
<lb/>in his hand and a goose by his side,—a
<lb/>mysterious emblem, of which I could not
<lb/>fathom the meaning: he sat cross-legged,
<lb/>like the great lama of the <name>Tartars</name>. He
<lb/>was busily employed in cutting out coats
<lb/>and garments; not, however, like <persName>Dorcas</persName>,
<lb/>for the poor—nor, indeed, did they seem
<lb/>intended for any mortal whatever, so ill
<lb/>were they adapted to the shape of the hu­
<lb/>man body. Some of the garments were ex­
<lb/>travagantly large, others as preposterously
<pb n="174"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="I3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">174</mw>
<lb/>small: of others, it was difficult to guess to
<lb/>what part of the person they were meant
<lb/>to be applied. Here were coverings, which
<lb/>did not cover; ornaments, which disfi­
<lb/>gured; and defences against the weather,
<lb/>more slight and delicate than what they
<lb/>were meant to defend; but all were eagerly
<lb/>caught up, without distinction, by the
<lb/>crowd of votaries who were waiting to
<lb/>receive them.</p>
        <p>The other officer was dressed in a white
<lb/>succinct linen garment, like a priest of the
<lb/>lower order. He moved in a cloud of in­
<lb/>cense more highly scented than the breezes
<lb/>of <placeName>Arabia</placeName>; he carried a tuft of the whitest
<lb/>down of the swan in one hand, and in the
<lb/>other a small iron instrument, heated red-
<lb/>hot, which he brandished in the air. It
<lb/>was with infinite concern I beheld the
<lb/>Graces bound at the foot of the throne,
<lb/>and obliged to officiate, as handmaids, un­
<lb/>der the direction of these two officers.</p>
        <p>I now began to inquire by what laws
<lb/>this queen governed her subjects, but soon
<pb n="175"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="I4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">175</mw>
<lb/>found her administration was that of the
<lb/>most arbitrary tyrant ever known. Her
<lb/>laws are exactly the reverse of those of the
<lb/><name>Medes</name> and <name>Persians</name>; for they are changed
<lb/>every day, and every hour: and what
<lb/>makes the matter still more perplexing,
<lb/>they are in no written code, nor even made
<lb/>public by proclamation: they are only pro­
<lb/>mulgated by whispers, an obscure sign,
<lb/>or turn of the eye, which those only who
<lb/>have the happiness to stand near the queen
<lb/>can catch with any degree of precision: yet
<lb/>the smallest transgression of the laws is
<lb/>severely punished; not indeed by fines or
<lb/>imprisonment, but by a sort of interdict
<lb/>similar to that which in superstitious
<lb/>times was laid by the Pope on disobedient
<lb/>princes, and which operated in such a
<lb/>manner that no one would eat, drink, or
<lb/>associate with the forlorn culprit, and he
<lb/>was almost deprived of the use of fire and
<lb/>water.</p>
        <p>This difficulty of discovering the will of
<lb/>the goddess occasioned so much crowding
<pb n="176"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="I4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">176</mw>
<lb/>to be near the throne, such jostling and
<lb/>elbowing of one another, that I was glad to
<lb/>retire and observe what I could among the
<lb/>scattered crowd: and the first thing I took
<lb/>noticed of was various instruments of tor­
<lb/>ture which every where met my eyes.
<lb/>Torture has, in most other governments
<lb/>of <placeName>Europe</placeName>, been abolished by the mild
<lb/>spirit of the times; but it reigns here in
<lb/>full force and terror. I saw officers of
<lb/>this cruel court employed in boring holes
<lb/>with red-hot wires, in the ears, nose, and
<lb/>various parts of the body, and then distend­
<lb/>ing them with the weight of metal chains,
<lb/>or stones, cut into a variety of shapes:
<lb/>some had invented a contrivance for cramp­
<lb/>ing the feet in such a manner that many
<lb/>are lamed by it for their whole lives.
<lb/>Others I saw, slender and delicate in their
<lb/>form and naturally nimble as the young
<lb/>antelope, who were obliged to carry con­
<lb/>stantly about with them a cumbrous un­
<lb/>wieldy machine, of a pyramidal form, se­
<lb/>veral ells in circumference.</p>
        <pb n="177"/>
        <milestone unit="sig" n="I5r"/>
        <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">177</mw>
        <p>But the most uncommon and one of the
<lb/>worst instruments of torture, was a small
<lb/>machine armed with fish-bone and ribs
<lb/>of steel, wide at top but extremely small
<lb/>at bottom. In this detestable invention
<lb/>the queen orders the bodies of her female
<lb/>subjects to be inclosed: it is then, by means
<lb/>of silk cords, till the unhappy victim can scarce­
<lb/>ly breathe; and they have found the exact
<lb/>point that can be borne without fainting,
<lb/>which, however, not unfrequently happens.
<lb/>The flesh is often excoriated, and the very
<lb/>ribs bent, by this cruel process. Yet what
<lb/>astonished me more than all the rest,
<lb/>these sufferings are borne with a degree of
<lb/>fortitude, which in a better cause, would
<lb/>immortalize a hero or canonize a saint.
<lb/>The <name>Spartan</name> who suffered the fox to eat
<lb/>into his vitals, did not bear pain with great­
<lb/>er resolution: and as the Spartan mothers
<lb/>brought their children to be scourged at
<lb/>the altar of <persName>Diana</persName>, so do the mothers
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">I5</mw>
<pb n="178"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="I5v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">178</mw>
<lb/>here bring their children,—and chiefly
<lb/>those whose tender sex one would suppose
<lb/>excused them from such exertions,—and
<lb/>early inure them to this cruel discipline.
<lb/>But neither <name>Spartan</name>, nor <name>Dervise</name>, nor
<lb/><name>Bonze</name>, nor Carthusian monk, ever exer­
<lb/>cised more unrelenting severities over their
<lb/>bodies, than these young zealots: indeed
<lb/>the first lesson they are taught, is a sur­
<lb/>render of their own inclinations and an
<lb/>implicit obedience to the commands of the
<lb/>Goddess.</p>
        <p>But they have, besides a more solemn
<lb/>kind of dedication, something similar to
<lb/>the rite of confirmation. When a young
<lb/>woman approaches the marriageable age,
<lb/>she is led to the altar: her hair, which
<lb/>before fell loosely about her shoulders, is
<lb/>tied up in a tress, sweet oils drawn from
<lb/>roses and spices are poured upon it; she
<lb/>is involved in a cloud of scented dust, and
<lb/>invested with ornaments under which she
<lb/>can scarcely move. After this solemn cere­
<pb n="179"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="I6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">179</mw>
<lb/>mony, which is generally concluded by a
<lb/>dance round the altar, the damsel is obliged
<lb/>to a still stricter conformity than before to
<lb/>the laws and customs of the court, and
<lb/>any deviation from them is severely pu­
<lb/>nished.</p>
        <p>The courtiers of <persName>Alexander</persName>, it is said,
<lb/>flattered him by carrying their heads on
<lb/>one side, because he had the misfortune to
<lb/>have a wry neck; but all adulation is poor,
<lb/>compared to what is practised in this
<lb/>court. Sometimes the queen will lisp and
<lb/>stammer,—and then none of her attendants
<lb/>can speak plain; sometimes she chooses
<lb/>to totter as she walks,—and then they are
<lb/>seized with sudden lameness: according
<lb/>as she appears half undressed, or veiled
<lb/>from head to foot, her subjects become a
<lb/>procession of nuns, or a troop of Baccha­
<lb/>nalian nymphs. I could not help observ­
<lb/>ing, however, that those who stood at the
<lb/>greatest distance from the throne were
<lb/>the most extravagant in their imitation.</p>
        <pb n="180"/>
        <milestone unit="sig" n="I6v"/>
        <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">180</mw>
        <p>I was by this time thoroughly disgusted
<lb/>with the character of a sovereign at once
<lb/>so light and so cruel, so fickle and so
<lb/>arbitrary, when one who stood next me
<lb/>bade me attend to still greater contradic­
<lb/>tions in her character, and such as might
<lb/>serve to soften the indignation I had con­
<lb/>ceived. He took me to the back of the
<lb/>throne, and made me take notice of a
<lb/>number of industrious poor, to whom the
<lb/>queen was secretly distributing bread. I
<lb/>saw the Genius of Commerce doing her ho­
<lb/>mage, and discovered the British cross
<lb/>woven into the insignia of her dignity.</p>
        <p>While I was musing on these things,
<lb/>a murmur arose among the crowd, and I
<lb/>was told that a young votary was approach­
<lb/>ing. I turned my head, and saw a light
<lb/>figure, the folds of whose garment showed
<lb/>the elegant turn of the limbs they covered,
<lb/>tripping along with the step of a nymph.
<lb/>I soon knew it to be yourself:—I saw you
<lb/>led up to the altar,—I saw your beautiful
<pb n="181"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="I7r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">181</mw>
<lb/>hair tied in artificial tresses, and its bright
<lb/>gloss stained with coloured dust,—I even
<lb/>fancied I beheld produced the dreadful
<lb/>instruments of torture;—my emotions in­
<lb/>creased:—I cried out, <said>O spare her!
<lb/>spare my <persName>Flora</persName>!</said> with so much vehemence
<lb/>that I awaked.</p>

        <head>Description
<lb/>of
<lb/>Two Sisters.</head>
        <salute>Dear Cousin,</salute>
        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">Our</hi> conversation last night upon beauties,
<lb/>put me in mind of two charming sisters,
<lb/>with whom I think you must be acquainted
<lb/>as well as I, though they were not in your
<lb/>list of belles. Their charms are very dif­
<lb/>ferent however; the youngest is generally
<lb/>thought the handsomest, and yet other
<lb/>beauties shine more in her company than
<lb/>in her sister's; whether it be that her gay
<lb/>looks diffuse a lustre on all around, while
<lb/>her sister's beauty has an air of majesty
<lb/>which strikes with awe, or that the younger
<lb/>sets every one she is with in the fairest
<lb/>light, and discovers perfections which were
<lb/>before concealed, whilst the elder seems
<pb n="188"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="I10v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">188</mw>
<lb/>only solicitous to set off her own person
<lb/>and throw a shade upon every one else:
<lb/>yet, what you will think strange, it is she
<lb/>who is generally preferred for a confidant;
<lb/>for her sister, with all her amiable qualities,
<lb/>cannot keep a secret.</p>
        <p>O! what an eye the younger has, as if
<lb/>she could look a person through; yet
<lb/>modest is her countenance, even and
<lb/>composed her pace, and she treads so
<lb/>softly—<quote>Smooth sliding without step,</quote> as
<lb/><persName>Milton</persName> says. She seldom meets you with­
<lb/>out blushing,—her sister cannot blush,—
<lb/>she dresses very gaily, sometimes in cloud­
<lb/>ed silks, which indeed she first brought
<lb/>into fashion, but blue is her most be­
<lb/>coming colour, and she generally appears
<lb/>in it. Now and then, she wears a very rich
<lb/>scarf, or sash, braided with all manner of
<lb/>colours.</p>
        <p>The elder, like the Spanish ladies, dresses
<lb/>in black in order to set off her jewels, of
<lb/>which she has a greater quantity than Lady
<lb/>――, and, if I might judge, much finer.
<pb n="189"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">189</mw>
<lb/>I cannot pretend to give you a catalogue
<lb/>of them; they are of all sizes, and set in all
<lb/>figures: her enemies say she does well
<lb/>to adorn her dusky brow with brilliants,
<lb/>and that without them, she would be but
<lb/>little taken notice of; but certain it is,
<lb/>she has inspired more serious and enthu­
<lb/>siastic passions than her sister, whose ad­
<lb/>mirers are often fops more in love with
<lb/>themselves than with her. A learned
<lb/>clergyman some time ago fell deeply in
<lb/>love with her, and wrote a fine copy of
<lb/>verses on her; and what was worst, her
<lb/>sister could not go into company without
<lb/>hearing them.</p>
        <p>One thing they quite agree in,—not to
<lb/>go out of their way or alter their pace for
<lb/>any body. Once or twice indeed I have
<lb/>heard that the younger……, but it was a
<lb/>great while ago, and she was not so old
<lb/>then, and so was more complaisant. She
<lb/>is generally waked with a fine concert of
<lb/>music, the other prefers a good solo....</p>
        <p>But see, the younger beauty looks pale
<pb n="190"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="I11v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">190</mw>
<lb/>and sick,—she faints,—she is certainly
<lb/>dying,—a slight blush still upon her cheek,
<lb/>—it fades, fast, fast.—She is gone, yet a
<lb/>sweet smile overspreads her countenance.
<lb/>Will she revive? Shall <mcr>I</mcr> ever see her
<lb/>again? Who can tell me?</p>

<lb/>was not coined in <persName>Johnson's</persName> time; and if
<lb/>it had, I believe he would have disdained to
<lb/>insert it among the legitimate words of the
<lb/>language. I cannot tell you the derivation
<lb/>of the phrase; I believe pic-nic is originally
<lb/>a cant word, and was first applied to a
<lb/>supper or other meal in which the enter­
<lb/>tainment is not provided by any one person,
<lb/>but each of the guests furnishes his dish.
<lb/>In a pic-nic supper one supplies the fowls,
<lb/>another the fish, another the wine and fruit,
<lb/>&amp;c.; and they all sit down together and
<lb/>enjoy it.</said>

<lb/>tainment.</said>
        </p>
        <p>
          <said rend="pre()post()">Yes, and I would have you observe that
<lb/>the principle of it may be extended to many
<lb/>other things. No one has a right to be
<lb/>entertained gratis in society; he must ex­
<lb/>pend if he wishes to enjoy.—Conversation,
<lb/>particularly, is a pic-nic feast, where every
<lb/>one is to contribute something, according
<lb/>to his genius and ability. Different talents
<lb/>and acquirements compose the different
<lb/>dishes of the entertainment, and the greater
<lb/>variety the better; but every one must
<lb/>bring something, for society will not tole­
<lb/>rate any one long who lives wholly at the
<lb/>expense of his neighbours. Did not you
<lb/>observe how agreeably we were entertained
<lb/>at <persName>Lady Isabella's</persName> party last night?</said>
        </p>
        <p>
          <said rend="pre()post()">Yes: one of the young ladies sung, and
<lb/>another exhibited her drawings; and a
<lb/>gentleman told some very good stories.</said>
        </p>
        <p>
          <said rend="pre()post()">True: another lady who is very much in
<lb/>the fashionable world gave us a great deal
<lb/>of anecdote; <persName>Dr. R.</persName>, who is just returned

<lb/>from the continent, gave us an interesting
<lb/>account of the state of <placeName>Germany</placeName>; and in
<lb/>another part of the room a cluster was
<lb/>gathered round an <placeName>Edinburgh</placeName> student and
<lb/>a young <name>Oxonian</name>, who were holding a
<lb/>lively debate on the power of galvanism.
<lb/>But <persName>Lady Isabella</persName> herself was the charm of
<lb/>the party.</said>
        </p>
        <p>
          <said rend="pre()post()">I think she talked very little; and I do
<lb/>not recollect any thing she said which was
<lb/>particularly striking.</said>
        </p>
        <p>
          <said rend="pre()post()">That is true. But it was owing to her
<lb/>address and attention to her company that
<lb/>others talked and were heard by turns;
<lb/>that the modest were encouraged and
<lb/>drawn out, and those inclined to be noisy
<lb/>restrained and kept in order. She blended
<lb/>and harmonized the talents of each; brought
<lb/>those together who were likely to be agree­
<lb/>able to each other, and gave us no more of
<lb/>herself than was necessary to set off others.
<lb/>I noticed particularly her good offices to
<lb/>an accomplished but very bashful lady and
<lb/>a reserved man of science, who wished
<pb n="195"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="K2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">195</mw>
<lb/>much to be known to one another, but
<lb/>who would never have been so without
<lb/>her introduction. As soon as she had
<lb/>fairly engaged them in an interesting con­
<lb/>versation she left them, regardless of her
<lb/>own entertainment, and seated herself by
<lb/>poor Mr.――, purely because he was
<lb/>sitting in a corner and no one attended to
<lb/>him. You know that in chemical prepara­
<lb/>tions two substances often require a third,
<lb/>to enable them to mix and unite together.
<lb/><persName>Lady Isabella</persName> possesses this amalgamating
<lb/>power:—this is what she brings to the
<lb/>pic-nic. I should add, that two or three
<lb/>times I observed she dexterously changed
<lb/>topics, and suppressed stories which were
<lb/>likely to bear hard on the profession or
<lb/>connexions of some of the company. In
<lb/>short, the party which was so agreeable
<lb/>under her harmonizing influence, would
<lb/>have had quite a different aspect without
<lb/>her. These merits, however, might easily
<lb/>escape a young observer. But I dare say
<lb/>you did not fail to notice <persName>Sir Henry B――'s</persName>

<lb/>enthusiasm, in the midst of a circle of gen­
<lb/>tlemen which she had drawn round her,
<lb/>upon the <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="slant(italic)">beau ideal</foreign>.</said>
        </p>
        <p>
          <said rend="pre()post()">No: indeed, mamma; I never heard so
<lb/>much fire and feeling:—and what a flow of

<lb/>eloquence was so much admired.</said>
        </p>
        <p>
          <said rend="pre()post()">She has a great deal of eloquence and
<lb/>taste; she has travelled, and is acquainted
<lb/>with the best works of art. I am not sure,
<lb/>however, whether the gentlemen were ad­
<lb/>miring most her declamation or the fine
<lb/>turn of her hands and arms. She has a dif­
<lb/>ferent attitude for every sentiment. Some
<lb/>observations which she made upon the
<lb/>beauty of statues seemed to me to go to
<lb/>the verge of what a modest female will
<lb/>allow herself to say upon such subjects,—
<lb/>but she has travelled. She was sensible
<lb/>that she could not fail to gain by the con­
<lb/>versation while beauty of form was the
<lb/>subject of it.</said>

<lb/>from
<lb/><persName>Grimalkin</persName> to <persName>Selima</persName>.</head>
        <salute>My Dear <persName>Selima</persName>,</salute>
        <p>As you are now going to quit the fostering
<lb/>cares of a mother, to enter, young as you
<lb/>are, into the wide world, and conduct your­
<lb/>self by your own prudence, I cannot for­
<lb/>bear giving you some parting advice in
<lb/>this important æra of your life.</p>
        <p>Your extreme youth, and permit me to
<lb/>add, the giddiness incident to that period,
<lb/>make me particularly anxious for your
<lb/>welfare. In the first place then, let me beg
<lb/>you to remember that life is not to be spent
<lb/>in running after your own tail. Remember
<lb/>you were sent into the world to catch rats
<lb/>and mice. It is for this you are furnished
<lb/>with sharp claws, whiskers to improve your
<lb/>scent, and with such an elasticity and
<lb/>spring in your limbs. Never lose sight
<pb n="199"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="K4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">199</mw>
<lb/>of this great end of your existence. When
<lb/>you and your sister are jumping over my
<lb/>back, and kicking and scratching one
<lb/>another's noses, you are indulging the pro­
<lb/>pensities of your nature, and perfecting
<lb/>yourselves in agility and dexterity. But
<lb/>remember that these frolics are only pre­
<lb/>paratory to the grand scene of action. Life
<lb/>is long, but youth is short. The gaiety of
<lb/>the kitten will most assuredly go off. In
<lb/>a few months, nay even weeks, those spirits
<lb/>and that playfulness, which now exhilarate
<lb/>all who behold you, will subside; and I beg
<lb/>you to reflect how contemptible you will
<lb/>be, if you should have the gravity of an old
<lb/>cat without that usefulness which alone
<lb/>can ensure respect and protection for your
<lb/>maturer years.</p>
        <p>In the first place, my dear child, obtain
<lb/>a command over your appetites, and take
<lb/>care that no tempting opportunity ever in­
<lb/>duces you to make free with the pantry or
<lb/>larder of your mistress. You may possibly
<lb/>slip in and out without observation; you
<pb n="200"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="K4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">200</mw>
<lb/>may lap a little cream, or run away with
<lb/>a chop without its being missed: but depend
<lb/>upon it, such practices sooner or later will
<lb/>be found out; and if in a single instance
<lb/>you are discovered, every thing which is
<lb/>missing will be charged upon you. If
<lb/><persName>Mrs. Betty</persName> or <persName>Mrs. Susan</persName> chooses to re­
<lb/>gale herself with a cold breast of chicken
<lb/>which was set by for supper,—you will have
<lb/>clawed it; or a raspberry cream,—you will
<lb/>have lapped it. Nor is this all. If you have
<lb/>once thrown down a single cup in your
<lb/>eagerness to get out of the storeroom,
<lb/>every china plate and dish that is ever
<lb/>broken in the house, you will have broken
<lb/>it; and though your back promises to be
<lb/>pretty broad, it will not be broad enough
<lb/>for all the mischief that will be laid upon
<lb/>it. Honesty you will find is the best policy.</p>
        <p>Remember that the true pleasures of life
<lb/>consist in the exertion of our own powers.
<lb/>If you were to feast every day upon roasted
<lb/>partridges from off <placeName>Dresden</placeName> china, and dip
<lb/>your whiskers in syllabubs and creams, it
<pb n="201"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="K5r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">201</mw>
<lb/>could never give you such true enjoyment
<lb/>as the commonest food procured by the
<lb/>labour of your own paws. When you have
<lb/>once tasted the exquisite pleasure of catch­
<lb/>ing and playing with a mouse, you will de­
<lb/>spise the gratification of artificial dainties.</p>
        <p>I do not with some moralists call clean­
<lb/>liness a half virtue only. Remember it is
<lb/>one of the most essential to your sex and
<lb/>station; and if ever you should fail in it, I
<lb/>sincerely hope <persName>Mrs. Susan</persName> will bestow
<lb/>upon you a good whipping.</p>
        <p>Pray do not spit at strangers who do you
<lb/>the honour to take notice of you. It is very
<lb/>uncivil behaviour, and I have often won­
<lb/>dered that kittens of any breeding should
<lb/>be guilty of it.</p>
        <p>Avoid thrusting your nose into every
<lb/>closet and cupboard,—unless indeed you
<lb/>smell mice; in which case it is very be­
<lb/>coming.</p>
        <p>Should you live, as I hope you will, to
<lb/>see the children of your patroness, you
<lb/>must prepare yourself to exercise that
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">K5</mw>
<pb n="202"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="K5v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">202</mw>
<lb/>branch of fortitude which consists in
<lb/>patient endurance: for you must expect
<lb/>to be lugged about, pinched and pulled
<lb/>by the tail, and played a thousand tricks
<lb/>with; all which you must bear without
<lb/>putting out a claw: for you may depend
<lb/>upon it, if you attempt the least retaliation
<lb/>you will for ever lose the favour of your
<lb/>mistress.</p>
        <p>Should there be favourites in the house,
<lb/>such as tame birds, dormice, or a squirrel,
<lb/>great will be your temptations. In such a
<lb/>circumstance, if the cage hangs low and
<lb/>the door happens to be left open,—to govern
<lb/>your appetite I know will be a difficult
<lb/>task. But remember that nothing is im­
<lb/>possible to the governing mind; and that
<lb/>there are instances upon record of cats
<lb/>who, in the exercise of self-government,
<lb/>have overcome the strongest propensities
<lb/>of their nature.</p>
        <p>If you would make yourself agreeable
<lb/>to your mistress, you must observe times
<lb/>and seasons. You must not startle her by
<pb n="203"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="K6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">203</mw>
<lb/>jumping upon her in a rude manner: and
<lb/>above all, be sure to sheathe your claws
<lb/>when you lay your paw upon her lap.</p>
        <p>You have like myself been brought up
<lb/>in the country, and I fear you may regret
<lb/>the amusements it affords; such as catch­
<lb/>ing butterflies, climbing trees, and watch­
<lb/>ing birds from the windows, which I have
<lb/>done with great delight for a whole morn­
<lb/>ing together. But these pleasures are not
<lb/>essential. A town life has also its gratifica­
<lb/>tions. You may make many pleasant ac­
<lb/>quaintances in the neighbouring courts and
<lb/>alleys. A concert upon the tiles in a fine
<lb/>moonlight summer's evening may at once
<lb/>gratify your ear and your social feelings.
<lb/>Rats and mice are to be met with every­
<lb/>where: and at any rate you have reason to
<lb/>be thankful that so creditable a situation
<lb/>has been found for you; without which you
<lb/>must have followed the fate of your poor
<lb/>brothers, and with a stone about your neck
<lb/>have been drowned in the next pond.</p>
        <p>It is only when you have kittens your­
<pb n="204"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="K6v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">204</mw>
<lb/>self, that you will be able to appreciate the
<lb/>cares of a mother. How unruly have you
<lb/>been when I wanted to wash your face!
<lb/>how undutiful in galloping about the room
<lb/>instead of coming immediately when I
<lb/>called you! But nothing can subdue the
<lb/>affections of a parent. Being grave and
<lb/>thoughtful in my nature, and having the
<lb/>advantage of residing in a literary family,
<lb/>I have mused deeply on the subject of
<lb/>education; I have pored by moonlight over
<lb/><persName>Locke</persName>, and <persName>Edgeworth</persName>, and <persName>Mrs. Hamil­
<lb/>ton</persName>, and the laws of association: but after
<lb/>much cogitation I am only convinced of
<lb/>this, that kittens will be kittens, and old
<lb/>cats old cats. May you, my dear child, be
<lb/>an honour to all your relations and to the
<lb/>whole feline race. May you see your de­
<lb/>scendants of the fiftieth generation. And
<lb/>when you depart this life, may the lamen­
<lb/>tations of your kindred exceed in pathos
<lb/>the melody of an Irish howl.</p>

        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">There</hi> was once a River which was very
<lb/>large, and flowed through a great extent
<lb/>of country which it rendered fruitful and
<lb/>pleasant. It was some miles broad at its
<lb/>mouth; it was navigable for a long way up
<lb/>the stream, and ships of large burthen float­
<lb/>ed on its bosom. The River, elated with
<lb/>its own consequence, despised all the little
<lb/>brooks and streams which fell into it; and
<lb/>swelling above its banks with pride, said
<lb/>to them—<said>Ye petty and inconsiderable
<lb/>streams, that hasten to lose your names
<lb/>and your being in my flood, how little
<lb/>does your feeble tribute increase my great­
<lb/>ness! whether you withhold or bring it
<lb/>I feel no increase and shall p<choice><sic>re</sic><corr>er</corr></choice>ceive no

<lb/>which lifted up its head and murmured

<lb/>despisest?</said></p>
        <p>The River, mindless of this reproof, in
<lb/>wanton pride overflowed its banks. But
<lb/>the next summer proving a very hot one,
<lb/>all the little streams were dried up, and
<lb/>the River was so far dried that men and
<lb/>cattle could wade over it; and a strong
<lb/>wind bringing a heap of dust across its
<lb/>stream, it was lost in the sands and never

<lb/>friends, your most sprightly and once-

<lb/>him. And when at length he has left you,

<lb/>the trees, the silence and solitude of the
<lb/>place, and the luxurious softness of every

        <p>And, let me ask you, what can you find
<lb/>in the company of him with whom you are
<lb/>thus enamoured, to make you amends for
<lb/>all that you give up for his sake? Does
<lb/>he entertain you with any thing but the
<lb/>most incoherent rhapsodies, the most ro­
<lb/>mantic and visionary tales? To believe
<lb/>the strange, improbable and contradictory
<lb/>things he tells you, requires a credulity
<lb/>beyond that of an infant. If he has ever
<lb/>spoken truth, it is mixed with so much
<lb/>falsehood and obscurity, that it is esteemed
<lb/>the certain sign of a weak mind to be much
<lb/>affected with what he says.</p>
        <p>As I wish to draw a true portrait, I will
<lb/>by no means disguise his good qualities; and
<lb/>shall therefore allow that he is a friend to the
<lb/>unhappy and the friendless, that his breast
<lb/>is the only pillow for misfortune to repose
<lb/>on, and that his approaches are so gentle
<lb/>and insinuating as in some moments to be
<lb/>almost irresistible. If he is at all disposed
<lb/>to partiality, it is in favour of the poor and
<lb/>mean, with whom he is generally thought
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">L</mw>
<pb n="218"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L1v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">218</mw>
<lb/>to associate more readily than with the
<lb/>rich. Yet he dispenses favours to all: and
<lb/>those who are most disposed to rebel
<lb/>against his power and treat him with con­
<lb/>tempt, could never render themselves quite
<lb/>independent of him.</p>
        <p>He is of a very ancient family, and came
<lb/>in long before the Conquest. He has a
<lb/>half-brother, somewhat younger than him­
<lb/>self, who has made his name very famous
<lb/>in the world: he is a tall meagre figure,
<lb/>with a ghastly air and a most forbidding
<lb/>countenance; he delights in slaughter, and
<lb/>has destroyed more men than <persName>Cæsar</persName> or
<lb/><persName>Alexander</persName>.</p>
        <p>He who is the subject of my letter is
<lb/>fond of peace, sleek and corpulent, with a
<lb/>mild heavy eye and a physiognomy per­
<lb/>fectly placid; yet with all this opposition
<lb/>of feature and character, there is such a
<lb/>resemblance between them (as often hap­
<lb/>pens in family likenesses), that in some
<lb/>lights and attitudes you can scarce distin­
<lb/>guish the one from the other.</p>

        <p>To finish the description of your lover,—
<lb/>he is generally crowned with flowers, but
<lb/>of the most languid kind, such as poppies
<lb/>and cowslips; and he is attended by a num­
<lb/>ber of servants, thin and light-footed, to
<lb/>whom he does not give the same livery;
<lb/>for some are dressed in the gayest, others
<lb/>in the most gloomy habits imaginable, but
<lb/>all fantastic.</p>
        <p>He is subject to many strange antipa­
<lb/>thies, and as strange likings. The war­
<lb/>bling of the lark, to others so agreeable, is
<lb/>to him the harshest discord, and <persName>Peter</persName>
<lb/>could not start more at the crowing of a
<lb/>cock. The slightest accident, the cry of
<lb/>an infant, a mouse behind the wainscot,
<lb/>will oftentimes totally disconcert and put
<lb/>him to flight, and at other times he will not
<lb/>regard the loudest thunder. His favourite
<lb/>animal is the dormouse, and his music the
<lb/>dropping of water, the low tinkling of a
<lb/>distant bell, the humming of bees, and the
<lb/>hollow sound of the wind rustling through
<lb/>the trees.</p>

        <p>But I have now said enough to let you
<lb/>into the true character of this powerful en­
<lb/>chanter. You will answer, I know, to all
<lb/>this, that he begins by enslaving every fa­
<lb/>culty that might resist him, and that his
<lb/>power must be already broken before Rea­
<lb/>son can exert herself. You will perhaps
<lb/>likewise tell me (and I must acknowledge
<lb/>the justice of the retort), that I myself,
<lb/>though my situation affords a thousand
<lb/>reasons to resist him which do not take
<lb/>place with you, have been but too sen­
<lb/>sible of his attractions.</p>

        <head>On Friendship.</head>
        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">Friendship</hi> is that warm, tender, lively,
<lb/>attachment which takes place between per­
<lb/>sons in whom a similarity of tastes and
<lb/>manners, joined to frequent intercourse,
<lb/>has produced an habitual fondness for each
<lb/>other. It is not among our duties, for it
<lb/>does not flow from any of the necessary
<lb/>relations of society; but it has its duties
<lb/>when voluntarily entered into. In its
<lb/>highest perfection it can only, I believe,
<lb/>subsist between two; for that unlimited
<lb/>confidence and perfect conformity of in­
<lb/>clinations which it requires, cannot well
<lb/>be found in a larger number: besides, one
<lb/>such friendship fills the heart, and leaves
<lb/>no want or desire after another.</p>
        <p>Friendship, where it is quite sincere and
<lb/>affectionate, free from affectation or inter­
<lb/>ested views, is one of the greatest blessings
<pb n="227"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">227</mw>
<lb/>of life. It doubles our joys, and it lessens
<lb/>our sorrows when we are able to pour both
<lb/>into the bosom of one who takes the ten­
<lb/>derest part in all our interests, who is to us
<lb/>as another self. We love to communicate all
<lb/>our feelings; and it is in the highest degree
<lb/>grateful where we can do it to one who
<lb/>will enter into them all; who takes an in­
<lb/>terest in every thing that befalls us; before
<lb/>whom we can freely indulge even our little
<lb/>weaknesses and foibles, and show our minds
<lb/>as it were undrest; who will take part in
<lb/>all our schemes, advise us in any emer­
<lb/>gency; who rejoices in our company, and
<lb/>who, we are sure, thinks of us in our ab­
<lb/>sence.</p>
        <p>With regard to the choice of friends,
<lb/>there is little to say; for a friend was never
<lb/>chosen. A secret sympathy, the attraction
<lb/>of a thousand nameless qualities; a charm
<lb/>in the expression of the countenance, even
<lb/>in the voice, or the manner, a similarity of
<lb/>circumstances,—these are the things that
<lb/>begin attachment, which is fostered by
<pb n="228"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L6v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">228</mw>
<lb/>being in a situation which gives occasion
<lb/>for frequent intercourse; and this depends
<lb/>upon chance. Reason and prudence have,
<lb/>however, much to do in restraining our
<lb/>choice of improper or dangerous friends.
<lb/>They are improper if our line of life and
<lb/>pursuits are so totally different as to make
<lb/>it improbable we shall long keep up an in­
<lb/>timacy, at least without sacrificing to it
<lb/>connexions of duty; they are dangerous if
<lb/>they are in any respect vicious.</p>
        <p>It has been made a question whether
<lb/>friendship can subsist amongst the vicious.
<lb/>If by vicious be meant those who are void
<lb/>of the social, generous, and affectionate
<lb/>feelings, it is most certain it cannot; be­
<lb/>cause these make the very essence of it.
<lb/>But it is very possible for persons to possess
<lb/>fine feelings, without that steady principle
<lb/>which alone constitutes virtue; and it does
<lb/>not appear why such may not feel a real
<lb/>friendship. It will not indeed be so likely
<lb/>to be lasting, and is often succeeded by
<lb/>bitter enmities.</p>
        <pb n="229"/>
        <milestone unit="sig" n="L7r"/>
        <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">229</mw>
        <p>The duties of friendship are, first, sin­
<lb/>cere and disinterested affection. This seems
<lb/>self-evident: and yet there are many who
<lb/>pretend to love their friends, when at the
<lb/>same time they only take delight in them,
<lb/>as we delight in a fine voice or a good pic­
<lb/>ture. If you love your friend, you will love
<lb/>him when his powers of pleasing and enter­
<lb/>taining you have given way to malady or
<lb/>depression of spirits; you will study <emph>his</emph>
<lb/>interest and satisfaction, you will be ready
<lb/>to resign his company, to promote his ad­
<lb/>vantageous settlement at a distant resi­
<lb/>dence, to favour his connexion with other
<lb/>friends;—these are the tests of true affec­
<lb/>tion: without such a disposition, you may
<lb/>enjoy your friend, but you do not love him.</p>
        <p>Next, friendship requires pure sincerity
<lb/>and the most unreserved confidence. Sin­
<lb/>cerity every man has a right to expect from
<lb/>us, but every man has not a right to our
<lb/>confidence: this is the sacred and peculiar
<lb/>privilege of friendship; and so essential is
<lb/>it to the very idea of this connexion, that
<pb n="230"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L7v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">230</mw>
<lb/>even to serve a friend without giving him
<lb/>our confidence, is but going half way;—it
<lb/>may command gratitude, but will not pro­
<lb/>duce love. Above all things, the general
<lb/>tenour of our thoughts and feelings must
<lb/>be shown to our friends exactly as they are;
<lb/>without any of those glosses, colourings,
<lb/>and disguises which we do, and partly
<lb/>must, put on in our commerce with the
<lb/>world.</p>
        <p>Another duty resulting from this confi­
<lb/>dence is inviolable secrecy in what has
<lb/>been entrusted to us. To every one indeed
<lb/>we owe secrecy in what we are formally
<lb/>entrusted with; but with regard to a friend,
<lb/>this extends to the concealing every thing
<lb/>which in the fullness of his heart and in the
<lb/>freedom of unguarded conversation he has
<lb/>let drop, if you have the least idea it may
<lb/>in any manner injure or offend him. In
<lb/>short, you are to consider youself as al­
<lb/>ways, to him, under an implied promise
<lb/>of secrecy; and should even the friendship
<lb/>dissolve, it would be in the highest degree
<pb n="231"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L8r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">231</mw>
<lb/>ungenerous to consider this obligation as
<lb/>dissolved with it.
</p>
        <p>In the next place, a friend has a right to
<lb/>our best advice on every emergency; and
<lb/>this, even though we run the risk of of­
<lb/>fending him by our frankness. Friends
<lb/>should consider themselves as the sacred
<lb/>guardians of each other's virtue; and the
<lb/>noblest testimony they can give of their affec­
<lb/>tion is the correction of the faults of those
<lb/>they love. But this generous solicitude must
<lb/>be distinguished from a teazing, captious,
<lb/>or too officious notice of all the little de­
<lb/>fects and frailties which their close inter­
<lb/>course with each other brings continually
<lb/>into view: these must be overlooked or
<lb/>borne with; for as we are not perfect our­
<lb/>selves, we have no right to expect our
<lb/>friends should be so.</p>
        <p>Friends are most easily acquired in
<lb/>youth, but they are likewise most easily
<lb/>lost: the petulance and impetuosity of
<lb/>that age, the eager competitions and ri­
<lb/>valships of an active life, and more espe­
<pb n="232"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L8v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">232</mw>
<lb/>cially the various changes in rank and for­
<lb/>tune, connexions, party, opinions, or local
<lb/>situation, burst asunder or silently untwist
<lb/>the far greater part of those friendships
<lb/>which, in the warmth of youthful attach­
<lb/>ment, we had fondly promised ourselves
<lb/>should be indissoluble.</p>
        <p>Happy is he to whom, in the maturer
<lb/>season of life, there remains one tried and
<lb/>constant friend: their affection, mellowed
<lb/>by the hand of time, endeared by the re­
<lb/>collection of enjoyments, toils and even
<lb/>sufferings shared together, becomes the
<lb/>balm, the consolation, and the treasure of
<lb/>life. Such a friendship is inestimable, and
<lb/>should be preserved with the utmost care;
<lb/>for it is utterly impossible for any art ever
<lb/>to transfer to another the effect of all those
<lb/>accumulated associations which endear to
<lb/>us the friend of our early years.</p>
        <p>These considerations should likewise in­
<lb/>duce us to show a tender indulgence to our
<lb/>friends, even for those faults which most
<lb/>sensibly wound the feeling heart,—a grow­
<pb n="233"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L9r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">233</mw>
<lb/>ing coolness and indifference. These may
<lb/>be brought on by many circumstances,
<lb/>which do not imply a bad heart; and pro­
<lb/>vided we do not by bitter complaints and
<lb/>an open rupture preclude the possibility of
<lb/>a return, in a more favourable conjuncture
<lb/>the friendships of our youth may knit
<lb/>again, and be cultivated with more genuine
<lb/>tenderness than ever.</p>
        <p>I must here take occasion to observe,
<lb/>that there is nothing young people ought
<lb/>to guard against with more care than a
<lb/>parade of feeling, and a profusion of ex­
<lb/>aggerated protestations. These may some­
<lb/>times proceed from the amiable warmth of
<lb/>a youthful heart; but they much oftener
<lb/>flow from the affectation of sentiment,
<lb/>which is both contemptible and morally
<lb/>wrong.</p>
        <p>All that has been said of the duties or
<lb/>of the pleasures of friendship in its most
<lb/>exalted sense, is applicable in a propor­
<lb/>tionate degree to every connexion in which
<lb/>there exists any portion of this generous
<pb n="234"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L9v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">234</mw>
<lb/>affection:  so far as it does exist in the va­
<lb/>rious relations of life, so far it renders
<lb/>them interesting and valuable; and were
<lb/>the capacity for it taken away from the hu­
<lb/>man heart, it would find a dreary void,
<lb/>and starve amidst all the means of enjoy­
<lb/>ment the world could pour out before it.</p>

        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">When</hi> the Gods, knowing it to be for the
<lb/>benefit of mortals that the few should lead
<lb/>and that the many should follow, sent
<lb/>down into this lower world Ignorance and
<lb/>Wisdom, they decreed to each of them an
<lb/>attendant and guide, to conduct their steps
<lb/>and facilitate their introduction. To Wis­
<lb/>dom they gave Confidence, and Ignorance
<lb/>they placed under the guidance of Mo­
<lb/>desty. Thus paired, the parties travelled
<lb/>about the world for some time with mutual
<lb/>satisfaction.</p>
        <p>Wisdom, whose eye was clear and pierc­
<lb/>ing, and commanded a long reach of coun­
<lb/>try, followed her conductor with pleasure
<lb/>and alacrity. She saw the windings of the
<lb/>road at a great distance; her foot was firm,
<lb/>her ardour was unbroken, and she ascended
<pb n="236"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L10v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">236</mw>
<lb/>the hill or traversed the plain with speed
<lb/>and safety.</p>
        <p>Ignorance, on the other hand, was short­
<lb/>sighted and timid. When she came to a
<lb/>spot where the road branched out in dif­
<lb/>ferent directions, or was obliged to pick her
<lb/>way through the obscurity of the tangled
<lb/>thicket, she was frequently at a loss, and
<lb/>was accustomed to stop till some one ap­
<lb/>peared, to give her the necessary informa­
<lb/>tion, which the interesting countenance of
<lb/>her companion seldom failed to procure
<lb/>her.</p>
        <p>Wisdom in the mean time, led by a na­
<lb/>tural instinct, advanced towards the tem­
<lb/>ple of Science and Eternal Truth. For
<lb/>some time the way lay plain before her,
<lb/>and she followed her guide with unhesita­
<lb/>ting steps: but she had not proceeded far
<lb/>before the paths grew intricate and entan­
<lb/>gled; the meeting branches of the trees
<lb/>spread darkness over her head, and steep
<lb/>mountains barred her way, whose sum­
<lb/>mits, lost in clouds, ascended beyond the
<pb n="237"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L11r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">237</mw>
<lb/>reach of mortal vision. At every new turn
<lb/>of the road her guide urged her to pro­
<lb/>ceed; but after advancing a little way, she
<lb/>was often obliged to measure back her
<lb/>steps, and often found herself involved in
<lb/>the mazes of a labyrinth which after ex­
<lb/>ercising her patience and her strength,
<lb/>ended but where it began.</p>
        <p>In the mean time Ignorance, who was
<lb/>naturally impatient, could but ill bear the
<lb/>continual doubts and hesitation of her com­
<lb/>panion. She hated deliberation, and could
<lb/>not submit to delay. At length it so hap­
<lb/>pened that she found herself on a spot
<lb/>where three ways met, and no indication
<lb/>was to be found which might direct her to
<lb/>the right road. Modesty advised her to
<lb/>wait; and she had waited till her patience
<lb/>was exhausted.—At that moment Confi­
<lb/>dence, who was in disgrace with Wisdom
<lb/>for some false steps he had led her into,
<lb/>and who had just been discarded from her
<lb/>presence, came up, and offered himself to
<lb/>be her guide. He was accepted. Under

<milestone unit="sig" n="L11v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">238</mw>
<lb/>his auspices Ignorance, naturally swift of
<lb/>foot, and who could at any time have
<lb/>outrun Wisdom, boldly pressed forward,
<lb/>pleased and satisfied with her new com­
<lb/>panion. He knocked at every door, vi­
<lb/>sited castle and convent, and introduced
<lb/>his charge to many a society whence Wis­
<lb/>dom found herself excluded.</p>
        <p>Modesty, in the mean time, finding she
<lb/>could be of no further use to her charge,
<lb/>offered her services to Wisdom. They
<lb/>were mutually pleased with each other,
<lb/>and soon agreed never to separate. And
<lb/>ever since that time Ignorance has been
<lb/>led by Confidence, and Modesty has been
<lb/>found in the society of Wisdom.</p>

        <p>A grown person even cannot walk

<lb/>us hear the particular subject of your ad­

        <p>No, papa; but I was wondering how you

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">252</mw>
<lb/>things: I am sure if I had money I could
<lb/>not help spending it all.</p>
        <p>As you never have a great deal of money,
<lb/>and it is given you only to please your
<lb/>fancy with, there is no harm in your spend­
<lb/>ing it in any thing you have a mind to; but
<lb/>it is very well for you and me too that the
<lb/>money does not <emph>burn</emph> in my pocket as it
<lb/>does in yours.</p>
        <p>No, to be sure you would not spend all
<lb/>your money in those shops, because you
<lb/>must buy bread and meat, but you might
<lb/>spend a good deal. But you walk past
<lb/>just as if you did not see them: you never

        <p>For all! Would you have me wish for all
<lb/>of them? But I will answer you seriously.
<lb/>I do walk by these tempting shops without
<lb/>wishing for any thing, and indeed in ge­

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">253</mw>
<lb/>and you do not care for what I admire so

        <p>No, there you are mistaken; for though
<lb/>I may not admire them so very much as
<lb/>you say you do, there a vast number
<lb/>of things sold in <placeName>London</placeName> which it would
<lb/>give me great pleasure to have in my
<lb/>possession. I should greatly like one of

<lb/>by no means be indifferent to the fine fruit

<lb/>just taken from the tree, the luscious hot­

<lb/>apples. Believe me, I could eat these
<lb/>things with as good a relish as you could.</p>
        <p>Then how can you help buying them,

<lb/>cure a person of extravagance, and even of
<lb/>extravagant wishes. I see so many costly
<lb/>things here which I know I could not buy,
<lb/>even if I were to lay out all the money
<lb/>I have in the world, that I never think of
<lb/>buying any thing which I do not really
<lb/>want. Our furniture, you know, is old and
<lb/>plain. Perhaps if there were only a little
<lb/>better furniture to be had, I might be
<lb/>tempted to change it; but when I see houses
<lb/>where a whole fortune is laid out in deco­
<lb/>rating a set of apartments, I am content
<lb/>with chairs whose only use is to sit down
<lb/>upon, and tables that were in fashion half
<lb/>a century ago. In short, I have formed
<lb/>the habit of <emph>self-government</emph>, one of the
<lb/>most useful powers a man can be possessed
<lb/>of. Self-government belongs only to civi­
<lb/>lized man,—a savage has no idea of it. A
<lb/>North-American Indian is temperate when
<lb/>he has no liquor; but as soon as liquor is
<lb/>within his reach, he invariably drinks till
<lb/>he is first furious and then insensible. He
<lb/>possesses no power over himself, and he
<pb n="255"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="M8r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">255</mw>
<lb/>literally can no more help it, than iron can
<lb/>help being drawn by the loadstone.</p>
        <p>But he seldom gets liquor, so he has not
<lb/>a habit of drinking.</p>
        <p>You are right; he has not the habit of
<lb/>drinking, but he wants the habit of self-
<lb/>control; this can only be gained by being
<lb/>often in the midst of temptations, and re­
<lb/>sisting them. This is the wholesome dis­
<lb/>cipline of the mind. The first time a
<lb/>man denies himself any thing he likes and
<lb/>which it is in his power to procure, there
<lb/>is a great struggle within him, and uneasy
<lb/>wishes will disturb for some time the tran­
<lb/>quillity of his mind. He has gained the
<lb/>victory, but the enemy dies hard. The
<lb/>next time he does not wish so much, but
<lb/>he still thinks about it. After a while he
<lb/>does not think of it; he does not even see
<lb/>it. A person of moderate fortune, like
<lb/>myself, who lives in a gay and splendid
<lb/>metropolis, is accustomed to see every day
<lb/>a hundred things which it would be mad­
<lb/>ness to think of buying.</p>

        <p>Yes; but if you were very rich, papa—if
<lb/>you were a lord?</p>
        <p>No man is so rich as to buy every thing
<lb/>his unrestrained fancy might prompt him
<lb/>to desire. Hounds and horses, pictures
<lb/>and statues and buildings, will exhaust any
<lb/>fortune. There is hardly any one taste so
<lb/>simple or innocent, but what a man might
<lb/>spend his whole estate in it, if he were re­
<lb/>solved to gratify it to the utmost. A no­
<lb/>bleman may just as easily ruin himself by
<lb/>extravagance as a private man, and indeed
<lb/>many do so.</p>
        <p>But if you were a king?</p>
        <p>If I were a king, the mischief would be
<lb/>much greater; for I should ruin not only
<lb/>myself, but my subjects.</p>
        <p>A king could not hurt his subjects, how­
<lb/>ever, with buying toys or things to eat.</p>
        <p>Indeed but he might. What is a dia­
<lb/>mond but a mere toy? but a large diamond
<lb/>is an object of princely expense. That

<lb/>The dress of the late queen of <placeName>France</placeName> was

<lb/>errand from <placeName>Yassy</placeName> to <placeName>Petersburg</placeName>, a distance
<lb/>of nearly 700 miles, to fetch him a tureen
<lb/>of it. He once bought all the cherries of
<lb/>a tree in a green-house at about half-a-
<lb/>crown a piece. The Roman empire was
<lb/>far richer than the Russian, and in the
<lb/>time of the Emperors was all under the
<lb/>power of one man. Yet when they had such

<lb/>gluttons as <persName>Vitellius</persName> and <persName>Heliogabalus</persName>, the
<lb/>revenue of whole provinces was hardly suf­
<lb/>ficient to give them a dinner: they had
<lb/>tongues of nightingales, and such kind of
<lb/>dishes, the value of which was merely in
<lb/>the expense.</p>
        <p>I think the throat of the poor little
<lb/>nightingales might have given them much
<lb/>more pleasure than the tongue.</p>
        <p>True: but the proverb says, <said>The belly
<lb/>has no ears.</said> In modern <placeName>Rome</placeName>, <persName>Pope
<lb/>Adrian</persName>, a frugal <name>Dutchman</name>, complained
<lb/>of the expense his predecessor <persName>Leo X</persName>.
<lb/>was at in peacock sausages. The ex­
<lb/>penses of <persName>Louis XIV</persName>. were of a more ele­
<lb/>gant kind;—he was fond of fine tapestry,
<lb/>mirrors, gardens, statues, magnificent pa­
<lb/>laces. These tastes were becoming in a
<lb/>great king, and would have been service­
<lb/>able to his kingdom if kept within proper
<lb/>limits: but he could not deny himself any
<lb/>thing, however extravagant, that it came
<lb/>into his mind to wish for; and indeed
<lb/>would have imagined it beneath him to
<pb n="259"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="M10r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">259</mw>
<lb/>think at all about the expense: and there­
<lb/>fore while he was throwing up water fifty
<lb/>feet high at his palaces of <placeName>Versailles</placeName> and
<lb/><placeName>Marli</placeName>, and spouting it out of the mouths
<lb/>of dolphins and tritons, thousands of his
<lb/>people in the distant provinces were want­
<lb/>ing bread.</p>
        <p>I am sure I would not have done so to
<lb/>please my fancy.</p>
        <p>Nor he neither perhaps, if he had seen
<lb/>them; but these poor men and their fami­
<lb/>lies were a great way off, and all the peo­
<lb/>ple about him looked pleased and happy,
<lb/>and said he was the most generous prince
<lb/>the world had ever seen.</p>
        <p>Well, but if I had <persName>Aladdin's</persName> lamp I
<lb/>might have every thing I wished for.</p>
        <p>I am glad at least I have driven you
<lb/>to fairyland. You might no doubt with the
<lb/>lamp of <persName>Aladdin</persName>, or <persName>Fortunatus's</persName> purse,
<lb/>have every thing you wished for; but do you
<lb/>know what the consequences would be?</p>
        <p>Very pleasant, I should think.</p>
        <p>On the contrary; you would become
<pb n="260"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="M10v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">260</mw>
<lb/>whimsical and capricious, and would soon
<lb/>grow tired of every thing. We do not re­
<lb/>ceive pleasure long from any thing that is
<lb/>not bought with our own labour: this is
<lb/>one of those permanent laws of nature
<lb/>which man cannot change; and therefore
<lb/>pleasure and exertion will never be sepa­
<lb/>rated even in imagination in a well-regu­
<lb/>lated mind. I could tell you of a couple
<lb/>who received more true enjoyment of their
<lb/>fortune than <persName>Aladdin</persName> himself.</p>
        <p>Pray do.</p>
        <p>The couple I am thinking of lived about
<lb/>a century ago in one of our rich trading
<lb/>towns, which was just then beginning to
<lb/>rise by manufacturing tapes and inkle.
<lb/>They had married because they loved
<lb/>one another; they had very little to begin
<lb/>with, but they were not afraid, because
<lb/>they were industrious. When the husband
<lb/>had come to be the richest merchant in the
<lb/>place, he took great pleasure in talking
<lb/>over his small beginnings; but he used al­
<lb/>ways to add, that poor as he was when he
<pb n="261"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="M11r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">261</mw>
<lb/>married, he would not have taken a thou­
<lb/>sand pounds for the table his dame and he
<lb/>ate their dinner from.</p>
        <p>What had he so costly a table before
<lb/>he was grown rich?</p>
        <p>On the contrary, he had no table at all;
<lb/>and his wife and he used to sit close to­
<lb/>gether, and place their dish of pottage
<lb/>upon their knees;—their knees were the
<lb/>table. They soon got forward in the world,
<lb/>as industrious people generally do, and
<lb/>were enabled to purchase one thing after
<lb/>another: first perhaps a deal table; after
<lb/>a while a mahogany one; then a sumptuous
<lb/>sideboard. At first they sat on wooden
<lb/>benches; then they had two or three rush-
<lb/>bottomed chairs; and when they were rich
<lb/>enough to have an arm-chair for the hus­
<lb/>band, and another for a friend, to smoke
<lb/>their pipes in, how magnificent they would
<lb/>think themselves! At first they would treat
<lb/>a neighbour with a slice of bread and
<lb/>cheese and a draught of beer; by degrees
<lb/>with a good joint and a pudding; and at
<pb n="262"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="M11v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">262</mw>
<lb/>length with all the delicacies of a fashion­
<lb/>able entertainment: and all along they
<lb/>would be able to say, <said>The blessing of
<lb/>God upon our own industry has procured
<lb/>us these things.</said> By this means they would
<lb/>relish every gradation and increase of their
<lb/>enjoyments: whereas the man born to a
<lb/>fortune swallows his pleasures <emph>whole</emph>, he
<lb/>does not <emph>taste</emph> them. Another inconve­
<lb/>nience that attends the man who is born
<lb/>rich is, that he has not early learned to
<lb/>deny himself. If I were a nobleman,
<lb/>though I could not buy every thing I
<lb/>might fancy for myself, yet playthings for
<lb/>you would not easily ruin me, and you
<lb/>would probably have a great deal of pocket-
<lb/>money; and you would grow up with a
<lb/>confirmed habit of expense and no inge­
<lb/>nuity, for you would never try to make
<lb/>any thing, or to find out some substitute
<lb/>if you could not get just the thing you
<lb/>wanted. That is a very fine cabinet of
<lb/>shells which the young heiress showed
<lb/>you the other day: it is perfectly arranged
<pb n="263"/>

<lb/>and mounted with the utmost elegance,
<lb/>and yet I am sure she has not half the
<lb/>pleasure in it, which you have had with
<lb/>those little drawers of shells of your own
<lb/>collecting, aided by the occasional contri­
<lb/>butions of friends, which you have arranged
<lb/>for yourself and display with such triumph.
<lb/>And now, to show you that I do some­
<lb/>times think of the pleasures of my dear
<lb/>girl, here is a plaything for you which I
<lb/>bought while you were chatting at the
<lb/>door of a shop with one of your young
<lb/>friends.</p>
        <p>A magic-lantern!—how delightful! O,
<lb/>thank you, papa! <persName>Edward</persName>, come and look
<lb/>at my charming magic-lantern.</p>
