<p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> object of this little work is the same
<lb/>as that of its predecessors, to obtain an
<lb/>audience for its Divine Master.</p>
<p>The book of <persName>Job</persName>, especially the didactic
<lb/>parts, contains many difficulties, which might
<lb/>discourage a child from reading it—yet, if
<lb/>these were removed, even a child might find 
<lb/>much in it to interest the mind and heart. 
<lb/>For children are born into a world of trouble,
<lb/>and should be early made acquainted with
<lb/>the highest human example of patience, and
<lb/>the most wonderful instance of God's re­
<lb/>storing mercy to a mere man. Those, indeed,
<lb/>whose minds have been debilitated by read­

<lb/>ing fairy tales and infantine novels, may be
<lb/>indifferent to a history at once so simple and
<lb/>so solemn. But there are others, who,
<lb/>nursed in the lap of a praying mother, early
<lb/>taught to kneel beside her, accustomed to
<lb/>listen to her pious remarks, and to behold
<lb/>her holy example—will accept with pleasure
<lb/>from her hand this little gift,—read it, while
<lb/>seated by her side, with attention, and after­
<lb/>wards commit it to the nursery, or school­
<lb/>room shelf—entreating to be allowed to look
<lb/>at that sacred original, of which this work is
<lb/>a feeble outline.</p>
<p>Such are the hopes with which this im­
<lb/>perfect production is presented to the pa­
<lb/>rents of the rising generation—a generation,
<lb/>on which the eyes of the present are fixed,
<lb/>expecting to behold in it, when sinking
<lb/>themselves into the grave, the first-fruits of
<lb/>their humble labours.</p>

<p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">I am</hi> now going to relate the history of a 
<lb/>man named <persName>Job</persName>, who lived a long while ago.
<lb/>I am sure that he lived after <persName>Noah</persName>, and I
<lb/>think he lived after <persName>Abraham</persName>, but not long
<lb/>after. He did not live in the land of <placeName>Ca­
<lb/>naan</placeName>; he lived in a land called <placeName>Uz</placeName>, which
<lb/>is somewhere near the great river called
<lb/><placeName>Euphrates</placeName>.</p>
<p><persName>Job</persName> was the richest man in the land of
<lb/><placeName>Uz</placeName>. In those days rich men had a great
<lb/>many animals: <persName>Job</persName> had seven thousand

<mw type="sig" rend="align(right)indent(2)">B 3</mw>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">10</mw>

<lb/>sheep, three thousand camels, <seg xml:id="a001" corresp="#n001" rend="post(*)">five hundred
<lb/>yoke of oxen, (that is one thousand, for two
<lb/>oxen go in one yoke,) and five hundred
<lb/>asses.</seg></p>
<p><persName>Job</persName> was not only the richest man in <placeName>Uz</placeName>, he
<lb/>was something much better than rich; he was
<lb/>good. Rich people often do not think of
<lb/>God; but <persName>Job</persName> feared him, and hated sin.
<lb/>He was upright in his behaviour to man,
<lb/>and his heart was sincere in God's sight.</p>
<p>He had also a wife, seven sons, and
<lb/>three daughters. I believe his children were
<lb/>grown up, for his sons had houses of their
<lb/>own. There was a custom among <persName>Job's</persName>
<lb/>sons which showed that they loved each
<lb/>other. They used each to give a feast to
<lb/>the others by turns, on particular days that
<lb/>they fixed upon; and they always invited
<lb/>their sisters to come and dine with them.
<lb/>I do not know whether they invited their
<lb/>friends to come also, but I suppose they
<lb/>did. I think that <persName>Job</persName> did not go to these
<lb/>feasts, for he was a man that spent his time

<pb n="11"/><milestone unit="sig" n="B4vr"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">11</mw>

<lb/>chiefly in doing good to the poor, and in
<lb/>judging the people, and in prayer; and he
<lb/>had not much time for feasting. It is not
<lb/>wrong to go to some kinds of feasts, for the
<lb/><persName>Lord Jesus</persName> went to feasts sometimes. <persName>Job</persName>  
<lb/>wished very much for his children to be
<lb/>good. He was afraid lest, when they were
<lb/>at their feasts, they should commit sin, even
<lb/>in their hearts, by not thanking God for his
<lb/>goodness: so this was what <persName>Job</persName> did. After
<lb/>they had each given a feast, he rose up
<lb/>early in the morning and sent for his chil­
<lb/>dren, and prepared them for offering sacri­
<lb/>fices for their sins. <seg xml:id="a002" corresp="#n002" rend="post(*)">I suppose he spoke to
<lb/>them of their sins, and of their need of
<lb/>God's pardon.</seg> Then he offered ten sacri­
<lb/>fices of sheep, and some other animal, and
<lb/>prayed to God for his children. What a 
<lb/>good father he was! He loved his chil­
<lb/>dren's souls: he feared lest they should be
<lb/>lost for ever. Perhaps, my dear children,
<lb/>your parents pray with you sometimes, and
<lb/>often pray for you with many tears when
<lb/>they are alone.</p>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">12</mw>

<p>Do you not think that such a good man 
<lb/>as <persName>Job</persName> must have been very happy? And
<lb/>so he was. <seg xml:id="a003" corresp="#n003" rend="post(*)">He knew that God loved him,</seg>
<lb/><seg xml:id="a004" corresp="#n004" rend="post(†)">and he thought that he should always be
<lb/>happy.</seg> But O what sad afflictions came
<lb/>upon him! You shall hear why <persName>Job</persName> was
<lb/>at last so much afflicted.</p>
<p>Now there was a day when the sons of
<lb/>God came to present themselves before the
<lb/>Lord. Do you wish to know who the sons
<lb/>of God were? I think they were the angels,
<lb/><seg xml:id="a005" corresp="#n005" rend="post(‡)">for angels are called the sons of God.</seg>
<lb/>But now you will be surprised at what I am 
<lb/>going to tell you. Among the angels <persName>Satan</persName>
<lb/>came. He is an angel too, a wicked angel.
<lb/>But might <persName>Satan</persName> come into heaven? No
<lb/>—he can never go there, but God is 
<lb/>everywhere; and <persName>Satan</persName> might come before

<lb/>God without going into heaven. And the
<lb/>Lord spoke to <persName>Satan</persName> and said, <said>Where do
<lb/>you come from?</said> Then <persName>Satan</persName> answered,
<lb/><said>From going to and fro in the earth, and
<lb/>from walking up and down in it.</said></p>
<p><seg xml:id="a006" corresp="#n006" rend="post(*)">You know why <persName>Satan</persName> walks up and down
<lb/>on the earth. To tempt men, and bring
<lb/>them, if he can, to be with him in hell.</seg>
<lb/>And the Lord asked <persName>Satan</persName> whether he had
<lb/>seen <persName>Job</persName>, and whether there were any man as
<lb/>good as <persName>Job</persName> in all the earth? <persName>Satan</persName> does 
<lb/>not like people to be good. He does not
<lb/>like God to love people. He is envious of
<lb/>good people. <seg xml:id="a007" corresp="#n007" rend="post(†)"><persName>Satan</persName> could not bear to hear
<lb/>God praise <persName>Job</persName>,</seg> and he said that <persName>Job</persName>
<lb/>obeyed God only for what he could get.
<lb/><said>Have you not taken so much care of him
<lb/>and of his things? but only just hurt his
<lb/>things, and he will curse thee to thy face.</said>
<lb/><persName>Satan</persName> said that <persName>Job</persName> was a hypocrite, but we
<lb/>know that he was not; for God said that he
<lb/>was the best man in all the earth.</p>

<pb n="14"/><milestone unit="sig" n="B5v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">14</mw>

<p>Would God let <persName>Job</persName> be hurt? Yes, he would,
<lb/>that <persName>Satan</persName> might see, and that all people
<lb/>might see, that <persName>Job</persName> really loved him. So
<lb/>God allowed <persName>Satan</persName> to hurt all the things
<lb/>that <persName>Job</persName> had; but not at first to hurt <persName>Job</persName>
<lb/>himself.</p>
<p>How glad <persName>Satan</persName> must have been when
<lb/>God allowed him to afflict <persName>Job</persName>, for <persName>Satan</persName> is
<lb/>full of hatred and malice!</p>
<p>Now we shall hear what <persName>Satan</persName> did. One
<lb/>of those joyful days came when <persName>Job's</persName> chil­
<lb/>dren feasted together. This time they were
<lb/>all in the house of their eldest brother. <persName>Job</persName>
<lb/>had not gone to the feast. But even when 
<lb/>fathers are at home, and their children are
<lb/>out, they are pleased to think their children
<lb/>are happy. <persName>Job</persName> little thought what sorrow
<lb/>he was going soon to feel.</p>
<p>A messenger came suddenly to <persName>Job</persName> and
<lb/>said, <said>The oxen were ploughing, and the
<lb/>asses were feeding near, when the <name>Sabeans</name>
<lb/>came and took them all away, and killed all
<lb/>the servants with the sword, and I only am
<lb/>escaped alone to tell thee.</said></p>
<p>The <name>Sabeans</name> were robbers, who went

<pb n="15"/><milestone unit="sig" n="B6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">15</mw>

<lb/>about the country stealing cattle. <persName>Job</persName> must
<lb/>have been sorry to hear his cattle were
<lb/>stolen, but much more to hear that the poor
<lb/>ploughmen were all murdered. But before
<lb/>that messenger had done speaking, another
<lb/>came, and brought still worse news. He
<lb/>said, <said>The fire of God is fallen from heaven,
<lb/>and has burned up the sheep and the ser­
<lb/>vants, and I only am escaped alone to tell 
<lb/>thee.</said></p>
<p>This fire, I suppose, was a thunderbolt
<lb/>that sometimes comes from heaven, when
<lb/>there is a terrible storm. What a storm this
<lb/>must have been! The oxen and the asses
<lb/>had not only been stolen, but the sheep had
<lb/>been burned, and the poor shepherds with
<lb/>them.</p>
<p>Was there anything left to <persName>Job</persName>? Yes.

<lb/>came in three bands, (a little army of sol­

<p>Now <persName>Job</persName> had no animals left. He still
<lb/>had a house, but he was not a rich man any
<lb/>longer. His ploughmen, his shepherds, and
<lb/>his camel-drivers, were all dead. But there
<lb/>was greater trouble still to come. While 
<lb/>the third messenger was yet speaking, a 
<lb/>fourth arrived, and said, <said>Thy sons and
<lb/>thy daughters were eating and drinking
<lb/>wine in their eldest brother's house, when
<lb/>there came a great wind from the wilder­
<lb/>ness, and smote the four corners of the
<lb/>house, and it fell upon the young men, and
<lb/>I alone am escaped to tell thee.</said></p>
<p>Now everything dreadful had happened
<lb/>to <persName>Job</persName>. His daughters were dead, as well
<lb/>as his sons, and only his wife was left him.
<lb/>Will <persName>Job</persName> now curse God, as <persName>Satan</persName> had said?
<lb/>Listen, and I will tell you what <persName>Job</persName> did.</p>
<p>He rose up and he tore his cloak that he
<lb/>wore, and shaved his head, and he threw
<lb/>himself down upon the ground, and wor­
<lb/>shipped, and said <said>I had no clothes, and
<lb/>nothing at all when I was first born, and I
<lb/>shall take nothing with me when I die. The 
<lb/>Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away;

<lb/>blessed be the name of the Lord.</said> Thus,
<lb/>you see, <persName>Job</persName> blessed God instead of cursing
<lb/>him. He was, indeed, very, very unhappy;
<lb/>and he showed his unhappiness (as people
<lb/>did in those days) by tearing his cloak and
<lb/>shaving his head. But he did not say that
<lb/>God was unkind. He did not know <emph rend="slant(italic)">why</emph>
<lb/>God had let these troubles come upon him,
<lb/>yet he knew that God might do what He
<lb/>pleased; for God gave him everything at
<lb/>first, and might take them all back again
<lb/>when He saw fit. Ah! my dear children,
<lb/>when your parents punish you, do you be­
<lb/>have in this way? Are you not sometimes
<lb/>angry with them, because they will not let
<lb/>you have what you want? Grown-up people
<lb/>sometimes feel displeased with what God
<lb/>does to them. There is one thing which we
<lb/>ought to remember in all our troubles. It
<lb/>is this short sentence, <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">God is love.</quote></p>
<p><persName>Job</persName> knew this, and he loved God even
<lb/>when God afflicted him.</p>

<p>And the Lord allowed <persName>Satan</persName> to hurt him;

<p>Would not <persName>Satan</persName> be much pleased to be

<p>He sent <persName>Job</persName> a very dreadful disease.
<lb/>Boils covered his whole body from the top

<lb/>boils give a great deal of pain. They also
<lb/>make a person look very frightful, and seem
<lb/>very unpleasant.</p>
<p>How unhappy poor <persName>Job</persName> now felt! He
<lb/>could not be comfortable for one moment;

<lb/>There was no part of him that was

<lb/>by doing so he made his sore places worse
<lb/>than they were before.</p>
<p>Now, while he was sitting there, his wife

<lb/>man; for she asked <persName>Job</persName> to curse God, and
<lb/>die. I suppose she thought that if he cursed
<lb/>God, he would be struck dead by God.
<lb/>What wicked advice this was! I am not
<lb/>surprised that she was unhappy, for she had
<lb/>lost her riches and children (though she
<lb/>was not sick,) but I am surprised she could
<lb/>advise <persName>Job</persName> to be so wicked.</p>
<p>But <persName>Job</persName> would not mind what she said.
<lb/>He answered, <said>You speak like a foolish
<lb/>(a wicked) woman. Shall we recieve good
<lb/>at the hand of the Lord, and shall we not
<lb/>recieve evil?</said> O how grateful <persName>Job</persName> was to
<lb/>God! He remembered how many things
<lb/>God had once given him, and how well he
<lb/>had felt day after day; and though now he
<lb/>was in such pain, he still loved God.</p>
<p>I asked you before, my dear children,
<lb/>whether you do not sometimes think your
<lb/>parents unkind when they punish you? Do
<lb/>you not forget how many kind things they
<lb/>have done to you? If you were grateful, you

<lb/>earth. Most children know that the earth

<lb/>beasts of the forest are alarmed at the sound
<lb/>of his roaring when he is hungry. He lives
<lb/>upon the flesh of animals, and he prefers

<lb/>that no horse can overtake them; indeed
<lb/>they will sometimes stop to let a man on
<lb/>horseback get almost up to them, and then
<lb/>set off with more swiftness than before. If
<lb/>any one does come near a wild ass, the 
<lb/>animal begins to bite and kick in such a 
<lb/>furious manner than he is soon killed. It is
<lb/>therefore very difficult to catch wild asses.
<lb/>Sometimes, however, they are caught either
<lb/>by many hunters, who come round them on all

<lb/>How glad they must have been to think

<p>All <persName>Job's</persName> friends and relations came to see

<lb/>camels and asses, and God made the flocks
<lb/>and herds to grow larger and larger, till at
<lb/>last <persName>Job</persName> had twice as many animals as he
<lb/>had before his afflictions.</p>
<p>But <persName>Job</persName> had lost his children. God gave
<lb/>him as many children as he had before. He 
<lb/>had seven sons and three daughters. The

<lb/>These daughters were the fairest in all the

<lb/><persName>Job</persName> lived long enough to see his children

<p>My little children, if you live you will

<lb/>perhaps you will have troubles of all sorts.
<lb/>You may, perhaps, lose your things, as <persName>Job</persName>

<p>Perhaps you may lose your health. You
<lb/>may be obliged to lie upon a sofa, or in a

<lb/>young.</p>
<p>Perhaps you may lose your character.
<lb/>Unkind people may think you have done
<lb/>wicked things, which you have not done,
<lb/>and may speak against you, and laugh at you.</p>
<p>I have read of people who have had many
<lb/>afflictions come upon them quite suddenly.
