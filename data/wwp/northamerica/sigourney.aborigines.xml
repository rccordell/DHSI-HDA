            <l>His simple meal, his lowly couch of skins</l>
            <l>Were hospitably shared. Rude were his toils,</l>

          <p>The custom which prevails among the aboriginal <name>Americans</name>, of adopt­
          <lb/>ing a captive foe in the place of some near relative, who has fallen in
          <lb/>battle, is well known. The affection thus transferred, is said to be sin­
          <lb/>cere and ardent, and extinguished only with life. They have been styled
          <lb/>the most revengeful, the most implacable of savage nations. Yet this
          <lb/>practice, peculiar to themselves, seems rather to prove, that the habits
          <lb/>arising from natural affection are stronger than the suggestions of revenge.
          <lb/>Among civilized nations, in every age, the adoption of children has pre­
          <lb/>vailed; but it has been circumscribed either by the limits of affinity, the
          <lb/>predilection of friendship, or the excitment of compassion. When was
          <lb/>it known to be extended to mortal foes, even by <name>Christians</name>, who are
          <lb/>bound to requite enmity with love? Where, among the followers of

          <lb/>Him, with whose death-pang was mingled a prayer for his murderers, has
          <lb/>the shelter of paternal kindness been the portion of the enemy, whose
          <lb/>sword had drank the blood of the lost son? or the offices of fraternal
          <lb/>brother? Among the ancient <name>Egyptians</name>, <name>Assyrians</name>, and 
          <name>Grecians</name>,
          <lb/>adoption by those who were childless, was a frequent usage. The <name>Ro­
          <lb/>mans</name> enacted laws for its regulation. The <name>Lacedemonians</name> required that
          <lb/>it should be performed in the presence of their kings. The <name>Turk</name>, accord­
          <lb/>ing to the appointed ceremonies of <name>Mahomet</name>, invests the adopted with his
          <lb/>inner garment, or with his girdle; and the <name>Gentoo</name> offers sacrifices to his
          <lb/>gods. But the <name>native American</name> being in this respect <quote>without law, is a
          <lb/>law unto himself;</quote> he adopts the foe who would have shed his blood,
          <lb/>without the pomp of prescribed ceremony, and with no sacrifice but that
          <lb/>which affection exacts of vengeance. In other instances, we behold this
          <lb/>race capable of degrees of virtue, as unexpected as they are unparalleled.
          <lb/>The natives of <ref xml:id="er16" target="#ec16" type="error"><placeName>Hascala</placeName></ref>, a 
          populous province, bordering upon <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, shock­
          <lb/>ed at the cruelties which marked the intrusion of the <name>Spaniards</name>, attacked
          <lb/>them with impetuous bravery and with vast superiority of numbers. But the
          <lb/>advantages arising from these circumstances, were entirely lost through their
          <lb/>solicitude to save the wounded and dying. To relieve the sufferers, and re­
          <lb/>move them from further barbarity, divided the attention of the warrior even
          <lb/>in the heat of battle; and a scene unknown among civilized nations was dis­
          <lb/>played, a sentiment of tenderness extinguishing victory. Afterwards, the
          <lb/><ref xml:id="er17" target="#ec17" type="error"><name>Hascalans</name></ref>, meditating another attack, 
          generously apprized the invaders
          <lb/>of their hostile intentions, and knowing that a scarcity of provisions ex­
          <lb/>sisted among them, sent to their camp a large supply of poultry and maize;
          <lb/><said>Eat plentifully,</said> said they, <said>for we scorn to attack enemies enfeebled
          <lb/>by hunger, and should blush to offer to our gods, famished and emaciated
          <lb/>victims.</said> Yet these sons of nature had never heard the command, <quote>If

          <lb/>by the effusion of human blood. This event, according to their traditions,
          <lb/>and the simple annals preserved by their hieroglyphical paintings, occurred
          <lb/>in the year <date when="1335">1335</date> of the Christian era. Following then through the va­
          <lb/>riations of their government, from its original form of aristocracy, to that
          <lb/>of elective monarchy, and ultimate despotism, combined with the feudal
          <lb/>spirit, we see the same stern religion preserving its sway unaltered, and
          <lb/>mingling with their civil institutions. Their political festivals were ex­
          <lb/>tended with the sacrifice of human beings, and in their expiatory offerings
          <lb/>to their deities, they believed that <quote>without shedding of blood was no re­
          <lb/>mission.</quote> During the reigns of <persName>Tizoc</persName>, and his brother 
          <persName>Ahuitzotl</persName>, a
          <lb/>temple was erected, which surpassed in magnificence all the structures of
          <lb/><placeName>Mexico</placeName>, and at its completion in <date when="1486">1486</date>, it was 
          consecrated with the blood
          <lb/>of more than 60,000 prisoners. <persName>Montezuma II</persName>, who was the ninth
          <lb/>Mexican sovereign, entered into a war with some neighbouring tribes, in
          <lb/>order to obtain victims for sacrifice at his coronation, and the cruel pa­
          <lb/>geantry of that scene was in accordance with the inclinations of his sub­
          <lb/>jects. The funeral rites of the <name>Mexicans</name> were sanguinary, particularly
          <lb/>at the death of any distinguished personage. At the decease of an em­
          <lb/>peror, they slew a number of his principal attendants, and buried them in
          <lb/>the same tomb; supposing, like the ancient <name>Scythians</name>, that he would
          <lb/>have need of their assistance and counsel. The rites of their religion
          <lb/>were reduced to a regular system; but their divinities were clothed in
          <lb/>vengeance, and their priests perpetuated a worship of gloom and terrour.</p>

          <lb/>The <name>Inca</name> appeared not only as a legislator, but a messenger from
          <lb/>Heaven. The superstitions on which he engrafted his pretensions to
          <lb/>high authority, were of a different character from those established
          <lb/>among the <name>Mexicans</name>. By directing their veneration to that glorious lu­
          <lb/>minary which by its universal and vivifying energy is the best emblem of
          <lb/>divine beneficence, the rites and observances which they deemed accepta­
          <lb/>ble to Him were innocent and humane. They offered to the Sun a part
          <lb/>of the production which his genial warmth had called forth from the
          <lb/>bosom of the earth, and fostered to maturity. They sacrificed, as an
          <lb/>oblation of gratitude, some of the animals who were indebted to his influ­
          <lb/>ence for nourishment. They presented to him choice specimens of those
          <lb/>works of ingenuity, which his light had guided the hand of man in form­
          <lb/>ing, but the <name>Incas</name> never stained his altars with human blood, nor con­
          <lb/>ceived that their beneficent father, the Sun, would be delighted with such
          <lb/>victims. Accordingly, the <name>Peruvians</name>, unacquainted with those barbarous
          <lb/>rites, which extinguish sensibility, and suppress the feelings of nature at
          <lb/>human sufferings, were formed by the spirit of the superstition they had
          <lb/>adopted, to a national character more gentle than that of any people in
          <lb/>America.</quote> The tribe of <persName>Chacmeheca's</persName> who succeeded the ancient

          <lb/>can</name> monarchy, which was situated in the neighbourhood of <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, also
          <lb/>paid homage to the Sun, as their tutelar divinity, and offered to him the
          <lb/>herbs and flowers which they found springing in the field. The Parent
          <lb/>of warmth and vegetation appeared to their untaught minds, as the Foun­
          <lb/>tain of existence and of hope; and how much more elevated was the
          <lb/>choice of their <name>Paganism</name>, than that of the polished <name>Egyptians</name>, who, in
          <lb/>their absurd worship of vegetables, noxious reptiles, and the lifeless for­

          <p>Such a marked diversity of customs, and religious rites, is found

          <lb/>their joys, and the supreme object of their adoration. Some of the eastern
          <lb/>tribes of <placeName>South America</placeName> preserve a tradition that their ancestors migrated
          <lb/>from the African continent. The <name>Toltecas</name>, originally bordering upon
          <lb/><placeName>Mexico</placeName>, and celebrated for their superiour knowledge, which comprised
          <lb/>some branches of agriculture, together with the art of cutting gems, and
          <lb/>casting gold and silver into various forms, possessed some ancient paint­
          <lb/>ings, which represented the passage of their ancestors through <placeName>Asia</placeName>, and
          <lb/>the north-western countries of <placeName>America</placeName>. The <name>Mexicans</name> who, in the
          <lb/>barbarity of their religious sacrifices, point to the blood-stained altars of
          <lb/><placeName>Carthage</placeName>, in the style of their architecture, the construction of pyramidal
          <lb/>edifices, the use of hieroglyphicks, and the mode of computing time, lead
          <lb/>us back to the institutions of ancient <placeName>Egypt</placeName>. This similarity has so for­
          <lb/>cibly impressed the minds of some learned writers, particularly <persName>Siguenza</persName>,
          <lb/>and <persName>Bishop Huet</persName>, that they have designated the <name>Mexicans</name> as the 
          descend­
          <lb/>ants of <persName>Naphtahim</persName>, the son of <persName>Mizraim</persName>, and nephew of 
          <persName>Ham</persName>. The <name>Es­
          <lb/>quimaux</name> recognizes his sires in the north of <placeName>Europe</placeName>, and by a variety of
          <lb/>customs proves his affinity. The <name>Mohawks</name>, from the peculiarity of their
          <lb/>language, composed entirely without labials, so that they never close their
          <lb/>lips in speaking, and from the superiority which they assumed over the
          <lb/>surrounding tribes, seem also to claim a distinct origin. The <persName>Abbe Cla­
          <lb/>vigero</persName> supposes that the ancestors of those nations who peopled the coun­
          <lb/>try of <placeName>Anahuac</placeName>, passed from the northeastern parts of <placeName>Asia</placeName>
          to the western
          <lb/>extremity of <placeName>America</placeName>. Amid the variety of customs which distinguish
          <lb/>the different tribes, some have been observed so similar to those of ancient
          <lb/><name>Israel</name>, that they have given rise to conjecture, that some of the ten tribes,
          <lb/>who, after the Assyrian invasion in <date when="0720">721, (B.C.)</date> were long in a wandering
          <lb/>state, might have been allured to pass, with other emigrants, the narrow strait
          <lb/>which separates the Old from the New World. This opinion received
          <lb/>strength from the circumstance, that among some of the natives, the name
          <lb/>of their Supreme Being was 
          <ref xml:id="er18" target="#ec18" type="error"><persName rend="pre(“)post(”)">Tchewah</persName></ref>, 
          evidently resembling the <name>He­

          <lb/>which is never suffered to touch the earth, and the mysteries of whose in­
          <lb/>terior they guard with the most jealous care. Traditions of the murder

          <lb/>building of a high place, which the pride of man contemplated should
          <lb/>reach the heavens, and many more, evidently derived from the <name>Scriptures</name>,
          <lb/>are preserved among them. Some of the early settlers, who had an oppor­
          <lb/>tunity of observing their character before its debasement, traced in their
          <lb/>religious offerings and festivals a similarity to the Jewish ritual. Intelli­
          <lb/>gent men, who have resided among them as traders, or surveyed them as
          <lb/>travellers and missionaries, have occasionally gathered traits of resemblance
          <lb/>to the peculiar people; and some learned men have been inclined to credit
          <lb/>this hypothesis, by a comparison of their language with the ancient <name>He­
          <lb/>brew</name>. <quote><persName>Dr. Buchanan</persName>,</quote> says a judicious writer,

          <p><choice><sic>“</sic><corr/></choice>Among some of our <name>aborigines</name>, the graves of departed 
          friends are
          <lb/>guarded with the most delicate and jealous affection. They suffer no
          <lb/>weeds to take root upon them, and frequently visit them with lamenta­
          <lb/>tions. This tender and sacred sentiment is expressed in an effusion of
          <lb/>simple eloquence, which bears the antiquity of nearly 200 years. In one
          <lb/>of the earliest records of the settlement of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, it is mentioned
          <lb/>that the Indian monuments of the dead had been defaced by the whites at
          <lb/><placeName>Passonagessit</placeName>, and the grave of the Sachem's Mother plundered of 
          some
          <lb/>skins that had decorated it. Gathering together his people, in the first
          <lb/>moments of his grief and indignation, he thus addressed them: <said>When
          <lb/>last the glorious light of this sky was underneath the globe, when the 
          <lb/>birds grew silent, I began to settle, as my custom is, to take my repose.
          <lb/>But ere my eyes were fast closed, I saw a vision at which my soul was
          <lb/>troubled. As I trembled at the fearful sight, a spirit uttered its voice:—
          <lb/><said rend="pre(‘)post(’)">Behold! my Son, whom I have cherished. See the hands
          that covered,
          <lb/>and fed thee oft. Wilt thou forget to take revenge of those wild people,
          <lb/>who have disturbed my ashes, disdaining our sacred customs? See now!
          <lb/>the Sachem's grave lies, like one of the common people's, defiled by an
          <lb/>ignoble race. Thy Mother doth complain. She implores thine aid
          <lb/>against this thievish people, newly intruding themselves into our land. If
          <lb/>this be suffered, can I rest quietly in my everlasting habitations?</said> Then 
          <lb/>the Spirit vanished, and I, trembling, and scarce able to speak, began to
          <lb/>get some strength, and recollect my thoughts that had fled, determining
          <lb/>to ask your counsel and assistance.</said></p>

          <p>It is generally admitted that the northern parts of <placeName>America</placeName> were settled
          <lb/>by the <name>Scandinavians</name>, several countries before the expedition of 
          <persName>Columbus</persName>.
          <lb/><persName>Ericke Raude</persName>, so named on account of his red hair, is considered as the
          <lb/>original discoverer of those inhospitable regions. Having past a winter
          <lb/>on the coast of <placeName>Greenland</placeName>, he returned to <placeName>Iceland</placeName>, and 
          persuaded many
          <lb/>of his countrymen to accompany him, and undertake the establishment of
          <lb/>a colony. He assured them that the country which he had found, abound­
          <lb/>ed in fish, and exhibited such a verdant appearance, that he had assigned 
          <lb/>it the name of <placeName>Groenland</placeName>, or <placeName>Greenland</placeName>. Twenty-five 
          ships, filled with
          <lb/><name>Icelanders</name> and <name>Norwegians</name>, attended him in consequence of these repre­
          <lb/>sentations; but it is said that only fourteen sustained the inclemencies of

          origin is traced
          <lb/>to the North East regions of <placeName>Tartary</placeName>. Driven from their country by
          <lb/>imperious and potent enemies, they crossed the straits of <placeName>Bherring</placeName>, and
          <lb/>gradually passing to the east and north, began their hostilities against the
          <lb/>Icelandic colony in the <date notBefore="1001" notAfter="1100">eleventh century</date>. They gained great ascendancy
          <lb/>over it about the year <date when="1350">1350</date>, when it had been enfeebled by the ravages
          <lb/>of pestilence; and in the course of two or three centuries nearly exter­
          <lb/>minated it. The small remnant of European settlers were driven from
          <lb/>the western toward the eastern shores, and compelled to incorporate them­
          <lb/>selves with their conquerors. Some of them, however, retreated to the
          <lb/>inlets between the mountains, and like the <name>Welch</name> still preserve the cha­

          <lb/>already dead with hunger. At length a man brought a fish from the sea,
          <lb/>and a girl snatched it, raw as it was, and tore it in pieces with her teeth,

          <lb/>of their friendly visitant, at length they see the white sails, the towering

          <lb/>wants are supplied. The active and pious housewife busies herself in
          <lb/>arranging the stores of the ensuing twelvemonth. There are letters too,
          <lb/>from friends, and from relations, and books, and newspapers; and banished
          <lb/>as they are, they live again in <placeName>Denmark</placeName>, in

          <lb/>the partner of his toils remain behind, solitary and forsaken. To this
          <lb/>season of sadness succeeds the gloom of the polar night. A few days
          <lb/>before the <date when="--11-26">26th of <name>November</name></date>, <persName>Saabye</persName> was 
          accustomed to climb the high

          <lb/>and pallid light; and then the sun sank, and he bade farewell to the eye
          <lb/>of creation with heaviness and grief. Dubious twilight lingered till the
          <lb/>beginning of <date when="--12"><name>December</name></date>; then darkness ruled. The stream near which
          <lb/><persName>Saabye's</persName> house was situated, roared beneath the ice; the sea dashed and
          <lb/>howled over the rocks, bursting in foam against his windows, and the
          <lb/>dogs filled the air with long continued moans. About the <date when="--01-12">12th of <name>Janu­

          <lb/>like the high-raised hopes of man.</quote></p>

          <p>From researches made by British Antiquarians, it appears that tradi­

          <lb/>founded upon it one of the most interesting modern epic poems in the
          <lb/>English languatge. In <persName>Howel's</persName> Letters, volume 2, page 71, it is recorded,
          <lb/>that <persName>Madoc ap Owen</persName>, Prince of <placeName>Wales</placeName>, made two voyages to

          <lb/><persName>H. Lloyd</persName>, contains, in its 225th page, the reasons which induced that
          <lb/>Prince to undertake such an expedition. Some modern writers have em­

          <p>It is recorded by <persName>Robertson</persName>, that an opinion prevailed almost univer­
          <lb/>sally among the <name>Mexicans</name>, that some dreadful calamity would befall their

          <lb/>the instruments of that fatal revolution which they dreaded, and this in
          <lb/>some measure accounts for the success of <persName>Cortes</persName>, with his ill-appointed
          <lb/>force, over the monarch of a great and populous empire.</p>
          <p>When the spoilers, in descending from the mountains of <placeName>Chalco</placeName>, caught
          <lb/>their first view of the vast plain of <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, interspersed with fertile and
          <lb/>cultivated fields, enriched with a lake resembling the sea in extent, whose
          <lb/>banks were encompassed with large towns, and whose bosom was beautified
          <lb/>with an island, where rose the capital city, adorned with its temples and
          <lb/>turrets, they were impressed at once with a conviction of the great wealth
          <lb/>of the country, and with an irresistable desire to possess it. After the hu­
          <lb/>miliating death of <persName>Montezuma</persName>, and the more barbarous subjugation of
          <lb/><persName>Guatimozin</persName>, the imperial city yielded to its conquerors,

          <lb/>memorable of any in the conquest of <placeName>America</placeName>, preceded the death of
          <lb/><persName>Cortes</persName> 25 years. The neglect of his country embittered the declining
          <lb/>life of the victor; and it was decreed, that the punishment of his injustice
          <lb/>and cruelty should be inflicted, not by the vengeance of those whom he
          <lb/>had injured, but by the ingratitude of those he had served.</p>

          <p>The annals of the crimes of man are darkened with no blacker instance
          <lb/>of perfidy, than that of <persName>Pizarro</persName> to the unfortunate monarch of

          <lb/>Confiding in the protestations of the <name>Spaniard</name>, he advanced to the distance

          <lb/>structed a priest to proclaim some of the articles of the Popish faith,
          <lb/>strangely intermixed with the claims of the crown of <placeName>Spain</placeName> upon the New
          <lb/>World, to which <persName>Ahatualpa</persName> not immediately assenting, the desperado
          <lb/>seized him as his prisoner, and gave the signal of assault upon his followers.</p>
          <p>The carnage continued till the close of day, and the <name>Peruvians</name>, unpre­
          <lb/>pared for combat, and ignorant of the mode of European warfare, left
          <lb/>4000 dead upon the field, without scarcely  making an impression upon
          <lb/>the phalanx of their enemies. The imprisoned <name>Inca</name> made liberal offers
          <lb/>for his ransom, and his subjects, like those of <persName>Richard Coeur de Lion</persName>,
          <lb/>would have stripped the churches of their consecrated gold, to purchase
          <lb/>liberty for their beloved sovereign. The apartment in which he was con­
          <lb/>fined was 22 feet in length and 16 in breadth, and <persName>Pizarro</persName> demanded that
          <lb/>it should be filled with vessels of gold, as high as he could reach. The
          <lb/>line of demarcation was drawn upon the wall—the <name>Peruvians</name> hastened to
          <lb/>heap the gold to the standard which avarice had prescribed, but with abomi­
          <lb/>nable treachery the <name>Inca</name> was detained in captivity. He was brought to
          <lb/>a mock trial, and condemned to be burnt alive. The miserable monarch
          <lb/>was offered, at the place of doom, that alternative which is allowed the

          <lb/>that <quote>the ships made use of in this service, are commonly of the worst
          <lb/>quality, old and unseaworthy, and the commanders ignorant, inexperienced,
          <lb/>and brutal. I was on board of a vessel at the <name>Helder</name>, <date when="1817-07-07"><name>July</name> 7th, 1817</date>,
          <lb/>which had formerly been a Russian ship of the line, which a <name>Dutchman</name>
          <lb/>had bought for the sake of carrying German emigrants to <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>.
          <lb/>There were already four or five hundred souls on board, and the vessel
          <lb/>was not to sail without her complement of passengers. I have found the
          <lb/>misery of most of the German emigrants greater, and the condition of all
          <lb/>more forlorn and helpless than I could have imagined. A ship arrived
          <lb/>from <placeName>Amsterdam</placeName> at <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, in the summer of 
          <date when="1817">1817</date>, the greater part
          <lb/>of whose passengers had not paid their freight. Two families were bought
          <lb/>by <emph>free negroes</emph> in <placeName>Maryland</placeName>, but the <name>Germans</name> resident 
          in <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>
          <lb/>were so disgusted, that they immediately rebought them, and formed an
          <lb/>association to prevent the recurrence of any such degrading abuse.</quote></p>

          <lb/>invincible resolution, there was seldom seen a milder and more
          <lb/>tender heart than his was; that he had nothing in him counterfeit
          <lb/>or sly; but was open, honest, and sincere, and that they never

          <p>The combats of <name>Gladiators</name>, were early exhibited at <placeName>Rome</placeName>, and the
          <lb/>people became so strongly attached to these entertainments, that the em­
          <lb/>perors found it polite to indulge their barbarous taste. <persName>Julius Cæser</persName>,
          <lb/>during his ædileship, gratified the populace with combats between 320 pair
          <lb/>of gladiators; and Gordian, before the imperial purple was conferred upon
          <lb/>him, gave those shows twelve times in a year, in some of which 500
          <lb/>couple were engaged. <persName>Titus</persName> exhibited a show of gladiators, wild beasts,
          <lb/>and representations of sea-fights upon the <name>Coliseum</name>, which lasted 100
          <lb/>days, and <persName>Trajan</persName> continued an exhibition of the same nature during one
          <lb/>third of a year, in the course of which he brought out 10,000 gladiators.
          <lb/>The masters, by whom these miserable combatants were instructed in the
          <lb/>science of defence, forced them to swear that they would fight till death,
          <lb/>and if they displayed cowardice, they were made to expire by fire, sword,
          <lb/>or whips, unless the voice of the emperor, or the people, gave them life.</p>

          <lb/><quote>in the utmost of my extremities, hath that blessed <persName>Pocahontas</persName>, 
          the daugh­
          <lb/>ter of the great king of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, saved my life.</quote> With the heroic 
          mag­
          <lb/>nanimity of a noble soul, she united the softness and tenderness of the
          <lb/>feminine character. Yet notwithstanding all her arts of disinterested
          <lb/>kindness to the <name>English</name>, she was treacherously decoyed by them on board
          <lb/>one of their vessels, and carried to <placeName>Jamestown</placeName>. Still their sense of hon­
          <lb/>our moved them to treat her with all that respect which her correct de­
          <lb/>portment and high rank deserved.</p>
          <p><quote>The motive to this step,</quote> says <persName>Judge Marshall</persName>, in his 
          <title>Life of <persName>Wash­
          <lb/>ington</persName></title>, <quote>was a hope, that the protection of 
          <persName>Pocahontas</persName> would give the
          <lb/><name>English</name> an ascendancy over <persName>Powhatan</persName>, her father, who was known to
          <lb/>dote on her. In this, however, they were disappointed. <persName>Powhatan</persName>
          <lb/>offered first, corn, then friendship, if they would immediately restore his
          <lb/>daughter, but refused to come to any terms until that reparation was
          <lb/>made for what he resented as an act of treachery. During the detention
          <lb/>of the Princess at <placeName>Jamestown</placeName>, she made an impression on the heart of
          <lb/><persName>Mr. Rolfe</persName>, a young gentleman of estimation in the colony, who also suc­
          <lb/>ceeded in gaining her affections. They were married with the consent of
          <lb/><persName>Powhatan</persName>, who by this event was entirely reconciled to the <name>English</name>, 
          and
          <lb/>ever after continued their sincere friend.</quote> After the arrival of <persName>Pocahon­
          <lb/>tas</persName> in <placeName>England</placeName>, with her husband, a petition was addressed in her 
          behalf
          <lb/>to <persName>Queen Anne</persName>, by <persName>Capt. Smith</persName>, bearing the date of 
          <date when="1616-06"><name>June</name> 1616</date>, in the
          <lb/>course of which he mentions, <quote>Being taken prisoner by the power of
          <lb/><persName>Powhatan</persName>, I received from this great savage exceeding great courtesy,
          <lb/>especially from his son <persName>Nantaquas</persName>, the manliest, comeliest, boldest spirit
          <lb/>that I ever saw in an <name>Indian</name>, and this sister <persName>Pocahontas</persName>, the king's 
          most
          <lb/>dear and well-beloved daughter, whose compassionate, pitiful heart of my

          <lb/>enthralled in their barbarous power, I cannot say that I ever felt the least

          courtiers, at the

          <lb/><placeName>Virginia</placeName>. Such was the weakness of this poor commonwealth, that had
          <lb/>not the <name>Indians</name> fed us, we directly had starved. And this relief, most

          <lb/>notwithstanding all the changes when inconstant fortune turned our peace
          <lb/>into war, would not spare to dare to visit us; and by her our jars have
          <lb/>been often appeased, and our wants still supplied. When her father, with the
          <lb/>utmost of his policy and power, sought to suprize me, having but eighteen
          <lb/>with me, the dark night could not affright her from adventuring through
          <lb/>the darksome woods, and with tearful eyes giving me the intelligence,
          <lb/>with her best advice how to escape his fury, which had the king known he
          <lb/>had surely slain her. She, under God, was the instrument to preserve
          <lb/>this colony from death, famine, and utter confusion: for if in those times

          <p><persName>Clarkson</persName>, in his life of <persName>William Penn</persName>, describes the manner 
          in which
          <lb/>his great treaty with the <name>Indians</name> was confirmed, in the year 
          <date when="1682">1682</date>. <quote>The
          <lb/>religious principles of <persName>Penn</persName>,</quote> says his biographer, <quote>which 
          led him to the
          <lb/>practice of the most scrupulous morality, did not permit him to look upon
          <lb/>the king's patent, or legal possession according to the laws of <placeName>England</placeName>,
          <lb/>as sufficient to establish his right to the country, without purchasing it by
          <lb/>fair and open bargain of the natives, to whom it properly belonged. He
          <lb/>had instructed commissioners who arrived in <placeName>America</placeName> before him, to buy
          <lb/>it of the latter, and to make with them a treaty of eternal friendship.
          <lb/>This, those commissioners had done, and now, by mutual agreement be­
          <lb/>tween him and the Indian chiefs, it was to be solemnly ratified. He pro­
          <lb/>ceeded, therefore, accompanied by his friends, consisting of men, women,
          <lb/>and young persons of both sexes, to <placeName>Coaquannoc</placeName>, the Indian name for
          <lb/>the place where <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> now stands. On his arrival, he found the
          <lb/>sachems and their tribes assembling. They were seen through the woods,
          <pb n="225"/>

          <lb/>as far as the eye could reach, and looked frightfully both on account of
          <lb/>their number and their arms. The <name>Quakers</name> are reported to have been
          <lb/>but a handful in comparison, and without any weapon; so that dismay and
          <lb/>terror must have seized them, had they not confided in the righteousness
          <lb/>of their cause. It is much to be regretted, when we have accounts of
          <lb/>minor treaties, between <persName>William Penn</persName> and the <name>Indians</name>, that no 
          historian
          <lb/>has any particular detail of this, though so many mention it, and all con­
          <lb/>cur in considering it the most glorious day of any in the annals of the world.
          <lb/>There are, however, relations in Indian speeches, and traditions in Quaker
          <lb/>families, descended from those who were present on the occasion, from
          <lb/>which we may learn something concerning it. It appears that though the
          <lb/>parties were to assemble at <placeName>Coaquannoc</placeName>, the treaty was made a little
          <lb/>higher up, at <placeName>Shackamaxon</placeName>. Upon this site, <placeName>Kensington</placeName> 
          now stands,
          <lb/>the houses of which may be considered as the suburbs of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>.
          <lb/>There was at <placeName>Shackamaxon</placeName>, an elm tree of a prodigious size. To this,
          <lb/>the leaders on both sides repaired, approaching each other under its widely-
          <lb/>spreading branches. <persName>William Penn</persName> appeared in his usual dress. He
          <lb/>had neither crown, sceptre, mace, sword, halberd, or any insignia of emi­
          <lb/>nence. He was distinguished only by wearing a sky-blue sash round his
          <lb/>waist, made of silk net-work, and of no larger dimension than an officer's
          <lb/>military sash, which, except in colour, it resembled. On his right hand
          <lb/>was <persName>Col. Markham</persName>, his secretary and relative; on his left, his friend
          <lb/><persName>Pierson</persName>, followed by the train of <name>Quakers</name>. Before him were carried 
          va­
          <lb/>rious  articles of mechandize, which, when they came near the Sachems,
          <lb/>were spread upon the ground. He held a roll of parchment, containing
          <lb/>the confirmation of the treaty of purchase and amity, in his hand. One
          <lb/>of the Sachems, who was the chief of them, then put upon his own head
          <lb/>a kind of chaplet, in which appeared a small horn. This, according to
          <lb/>scripture language, and among the primitive eastern nations, was an em­
          <lb/>blem of kingly power; and whenever the Chief who had a right to wear
          <lb/>it, put it on, it was understood that the place was made sacred, and the
          <lb/>persons of all present inviolable. Upon putting on this horn, all the <name>In­
          <lb/>dians</name> threw down their bows and arrows, seating themselves round their
          <lb/>Chiefs, in the form of a half moon upon the ground. The principal
          <lb/>Sachem then announced to <persName>William Penn</persName>, by the aid of an interpreter,
          <lb/>that the nations were ready to hear him. He then said, that the Great
          <pb n="226"/>
          <milestone unit="sig" n="19(5)v"/>
          <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(center)">226</mw>
          <lb/>Spirit, who made him and them, who ruled the heavens and the earth,
          <lb/>and was acquainted with the innermost thoughts of man, knew that he
          <lb/>and his friends had a hearty desire to live in peace and friendship with 
          <lb/>them, and serve them to the utmost of their power. It was not their
          <lb/>custom to use hostile weapons against their fellow-creatures, therefore,
          <lb/>came they to this treaty unarmed. Their object was not to do injury,
          <lb/>and thus provoke the Great Spirit, but to do good. They had met them
          <lb/>on the broad path-way of good faith and good will, so that no advantage
          <lb/>was to be taken on either side, but all was to be openness, brotherhood
          <lb/>and love. After these and other words, he unrolled the parchment, and
          <lb/>by means of the same interpreter, conveyed to them, article by article,
          <lb/>the conditions of the purchase, and the words of the contract then made
          <lb/>for their eternal union. Among other things, they were not to be mo­
          <lb/>lested in their lawful pursuits, even in the territory they had alienated, for
          <lb/>it was to be common to them, as well as to the <name>English</name>. They were to
          <lb/>have the same liberty to do all things therein, relating to the improve­
          <lb/>ment of their grounds, and providing sustenance for their families, which
          <lb/>the <name>English</name> had. If any dispute should arise between the two, it should
          <lb/>be settled by twelve persons, half of whom should be <name>English</name>, and half
          <lb/><name>Indians</name>. He then paid them for the land, and made them many presents
          <lb/>besides, from the merchandize which was spread before them. Having
          <lb/>done this, he laid the roll of parchment on the ground, observing again,
          <lb/>that the ground should be common to both people. He then added, that
          <lb/>he would not do like the inhabitants of <placeName>Maryland</placeName>, that is, call them only
          <lb/>children or brothers; for parents were sometimes unkind to their children,
          <lb/>and brothers would often differ; neither would he compare the friendship
          <lb/>between them to a chain, which the rain might rust, or a tree fall upon
          <lb/>and break; but he should consider them as the same flesh and blood with
          <lb/>the <name>Christians</name>, the same as if a man's body was to be divided into two
          <lb/>parts. Taking up the parchment, he then presented it to the Sachem
          <lb/>who wore the horn in his chaplet, and desired him and the other Sachems
          <lb/>to preserve it carefully for three generations, that their children might
          <lb/>know what had passed between them, when they were no longer living to
          <lb/>repeat it. It is to be regretted that the speeches of the <name>Indians</name>, on this
          <lb/>memorable day, have not come down to us. It is only known that they
          <lb/>solemnly pledged themselves, according to the manner of their country,

          <lb/>to live in love with <persName>William Penn</persName> and his children as long as the sun and
          <lb/>moon should endure. Thus ended this famous treaty, of which more has
          <lb/>been said in the way of praise, than of any other ever transmitted to pos­
          <lb/>terity.</quote></p>
          <p>To the commendation which the biographer of the Man of Peace be­
          <lb/>stows on this honourable transaction, we add the concise eulogium of
          <lb/><persName>Voltaire</persName>, who pronounced it to be <quote>the only treaty which was ratified
          <lb/>without an oath, and the only one which was never broken.</quote></p>

            <p>My cabin, since first I had one of my own, has ever been open to

            <lb/>began to range these woods, have I ever freely imparted to appease his
            <lb/>hunger, to clothe his nakedness. But what have I seen? What! but
            <lb/>that at my return at night, laden with spoil, my numerous family lie
            <lb/>bleeding on the ground, by the hand of those who had found my little hut
            <lb/>a certain refuge from the inclement storm, who had eaten my food, who
            <lb/>had covered themselves with my skins! What have I seen? What! 
            <lb/>but that those dear little mouths, for which I had toiled the live-long
            <lb/>day, when I returned at eve to fill them, had not one word to thank me
            <lb/>for all that toil!</p>
            <p>What could I resolve upon? My blood boiled within me! My
            <lb/>heart leaped to my mouth! Nevertheless, I bid my tomahawk be quiet,

            <lb/>and lie at rest for that war, because I thought the great men of your coun­
            <lb/>try sent them not to do it. Not long afterward, some of your men in­
            <lb/>vited our tribe to cross the river, and bring their venison with them.
            <lb/>They, unsuspicious of evil design, came as they had been invited. The
            <lb/>white men then made them drunk, murdered them, and turned their knives
            <lb/>even against the women.</p>
            <p>Was not my own sister among them? Was she not scalped by the
            <lb/>hands of that very man, whom she had taught to escape his enemies,
            <lb/>when they were scenting out his track! What could I resolve upon?
            <lb/>My blood now boiled thrice hotter than before! Thrice again my heart
            <lb/>leaped to my mouth. I bade no longer my tomahawk be quiet, and lie
            <lb/>at rest for that war. I no longer thought that the great men of your
            <lb/>country sent them not to do it. I sprang from my cabin to avenge their
            <lb/>blood, and fully have I done it in this war, by shedding yours from your
            <lb/>coldest to your hottest sun. Thus revenged, I am now for peace. To
            <lb/>peace have I advised most of my countrymen. Nay! what is more, I

          <p>The flowers of the Cornus Florida, or as it is usually called, Dogwood,
          <lb/>appear in the spring, and exhibit a beautiful appearance. Their large and
          <lb/>white involuere form a fine contrast to the forest green, and their hue
          <lb/>becomes gradually more delicate, as if emulous of the purity of snow.
          <lb/>Our natives use an infusion of these flowers to intermittents; and some
          <lb/>of the tribes gave a name to the season of Spring, in allusion to the bloom
          <lb/>of this plant. Its blossoms are succeeded by oblong drupes of a rich crim­
          <lb/>son tint, which are sometimes used as a tonic in the form of a spirituous
          <lb/>impregnation, and likewise furnish a favourite food for various species of
          <lb/>birds. Its wood, under the name of New-England box, is held in high
          <lb/>estimation for its durability, and enters into the construction of many
          <lb/>articles both for utility and ornament. But what constitutes its principal
          <lb/>value is the discovery that its inner or cortical bark, promises to be equally valuable with the 
          Peruvian. Indeed, it may be considered superiour, as
          <lb/>being less nauseous to the taste and the stomach, always to be obtained
          <lb/>in abundance, and not liable to the danger of adulteration. The merits
          <lb/>of this substance as a medicine, have been clearly and forcibly displayed by
          <lb/><persName>Dr. Walker</persName> of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, in an inaugural dissertation on the 
          comparative
          <lb/>virtues of the Cornus florida, Cornus sericea, and Cinchona officinalis of
          <lb/><persName>Linnæus</persName>. After detailing a number of chemical experiments, he re­
          <lb/>marks: <quote>A summary recapitulation of these experiments shews, that the
          <lb/>Cornus florida, sericea, and Peruvian bark, possess the same ingredients,
          <lb/>that is, gum, mucilage, and extracts; which last contain the tannin and
          <lb/>gallic acid, though in different proportions. The Florida has most of
          <lb/>the gum mucilage and extracts; the Sericea the next, which appears to
          <lb/>be an intermediate between the Florida and Cinchona; while the latter 
          <lb/>possesses most of the resin. Their virtues appear similar, and equal, in
          <lb/>their residence. The extract and resin possess all their active powers.
          <lb/>The extract appears to possess all their tonic powers. The resin, when
          <lb/>perfectly separated from the extract, appears to be purely stimulant; and

          <lb/>probably the tonic powers of the extract are increased when combined with

          <lb/>that during a period of 23 years, experience of its virtues had convinced
          <lb/>him, <quote>that it was not inferior to the Peruvian bark in curing intermittents;

          <lb/>and astringency, to the happy union of which the Corni have a claim as
          <lb/>respectable as that which has procured for the Peruvain bark a celebrity
          <lb/>as extensive as the bounds of rational medicine. Indeed, so striking is
          <lb/>the similitude, so exact the result from comparative trials, that in this at­

          important
          <lb/>branch of revenue. It is found also in <placeName>Carolina</placeName>, and among some of our
          <lb/>tribes was held in such high esteem, that the decoction of its toasted
          <lb/>leaves called <quote>black drink,</quote> their women were not permitted to taste.
          <lb/><persName>Lawson</persName>, in recording a tradition of this plant, says <quote>The savages of
          <lb/><placeName>Carolina</placeName> have it in veneration above all the plants they are acquainted
          <lb/>withal, and tell you the discovery thereof was by an infirm <placeName>Indian</placeName>, who
          <lb/>laboured under the burden of many r<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">u</unclear>gged distempers, 
          and could not
          <lb/>be cured by all their Doctors; so, one day he fell asleep, and dreamt
          <lb/>that if he took a decoction of the tree that grew at his head, he would
          <lb/>certainly be cured, upon which he awoke, and saw the Yaupon,
          <lb/>or Cassine-tree, which was not there when he fell a sleep. He followed
          <lb/>the direction of his dream, and became perfectly well in a short time.
          <lb/>Now I suppose, no man has so little sense as to believe this fable; yet
          <lb/>it lets us see what they intend thereby, and that it has doubtless worked
          <lb/>feats enough, to gain it such an esteem among these savages, who are
          <lb/>too well versed in vegetables, to be brought to a continual use of any one
          <lb/>of them, upon a mere conceit or fancy, without some apparent benefit
          <lb/>they found thereby; especially when we are sensible, that they drink

          <p>In closing these botanical notes, which probably comprize but a small
          <lb/>number of the medicinal plants known to our natives, the words of the
          <lb/>late <persName>Professor Barton</persName>, whose attention to this subject marked at once his
          <lb/>perseverence and benevolence, are particularly appropriate. <quote>Judging
          <lb/>from the discoveries which have been made in the term of three hundred
          <lb/>years, it may be safely conjectured, that there are no countries of the
          <lb/>globe from which there is reason to expect greater or more valuable
          <lb/>accessions to the Materia-Medica, than those of <placeName>America</placeName>. In conduct­

          <lb/>country, much useful information may, I am persuaded, be obtained
          <lb/>through the medium of our intercourse with the <name>Indians</name>. Some of the
          <lb/>rudest tribes of our contintent are acquainted with the general medical
          <lb/>properties of many of their vegetables. We shall find that the Materia

          not forget

          <lb/>formed some heroic act, he will not forget to acknowledge it as a mark
          <lb/>of divine favour, by making a sacrifice or publickly announcing that his
          <lb/>success was entirely owing to the courage given him by the All-Powerful 
          <lb/>Spirit. This habitual devotion to the Great First Cause, and a strong
          <lb/>feeling of gratitude for the favours that he confers, is one of the promi­
          <lb/>nent traits that characterize the mind of the untutor'd <name>Indian</name>. An old

          <lb/>followed the customs of his fathers and ancestors, of climbing upon a high
          <lb/>mountain, to thank the Great Spirit, for his benefits bestowed, and to
          <lb/>entreat a continuance of his favour; and that they were sure that their
          <lb/>prayers were heard, and acceptable to the Great Spirit, though he did not
          <lb/>himself appear to them.</quote> These declarations of their faith in the inefficacy of
          <lb/>prayer, may be concluded by a specimen of their devotion, at once pathetic
          <lb/>and sublime. <quote>O Eternal! have mercy upon me, because I am passing

          <lb/><date when="1801-12-09"><name>Dec.</name> 9, 1801</date>, by a Chief of the <name>Delaware tribe</name>

          <lb/>but this Chief with his party had become allies of the <name>English</name>. It
          <lb/>seems that they had repented when it was too late to retract, and were
          <lb/>compelled to continue in hostility to the <name>Americans</name>. At their return from
          <lb/>an expedition, the following report was made to the British command­

          boldness, frankness, dig­
          <lb/>nity and humanity, happily blended, and eloquently displayed, The
          <lb/>component parts of this discourse are put together, much according to
          <lb/>the rules of oratory of the schools, and which were certainly unknown to
          <lb/>the speaker. The peroration is short, truly pathetic, even sublime:
          <lb/>and I wish I could convey to the mind of the reader a small part of
          <lb/>the impression which this speech made on me, and on all who heard it
          <lb/>delivered.</quote></p>
          <p>The following effusion is of a wholly different character. It was
          <lb/>uttered a few years since, by a Maha Chieftain, named <persName>Big-Elk</persName>, over
          <lb/>the grave of the Chief of the <name>Teton tribe</name>, who died at <placeName>Portage des
          <lb/>Sioux</placeName>, on his return from our seat of government. He was interred 
          <lb/>with all the honours of war, and this speech was taken literally by the
          <lb/>Secretary of the American Commissioners.</p>

            <quote>Do not grieve. Misfortunes will happen to the wisest and best
            <lb/>of men. Death will come, and always comes out of season. It is the
            <lb/>command of the Great Spirit: all nations and people must obey. What
            <lb/>is past, and cannot be prevented, should not be grieved for. Be not

            <lb/>your Chief. A misfortune of this kind may never again befall you: per­
            <lb/>haps it would have overtaken you at your own village. Five times have
            <lb/>I visited this land, yet never returned without sorrow and pain. Woes
            <lb/>do not flourish particularly in our path. They grow every where. What
            <lb/>a misfortune that I could not have died this day, instead of the Chief
            <lb/>who lies before us. The trifling loss my nation would have sustained by
            <lb/>my death, would have been doubly paid for by the honours of my burial.
            <lb/>They would have wiped off every thing like regret. Instead of being
            <lb/>covered with a cloud of sorrow, my warriors would have felt the sun­
            <lb/>shine of joy in their hearts. To me it would have been a most glorious
            <lb/>occurrence. Hereafter, when I die at home, instead of this noble grave,
            <lb/>and grand procession, the rolling music, and thundering cannon, with a
            <lb/>banner waving over my head, I shall be wrapped in a robe, and raised on
            <lb/>a slender scaffold to the whistling winds, soon to be blown to the earth,
            <lb/>my flesh to be devoured by the wolves, and my bones scattered on the

          <p>This incident is borrowed from <persName>Schoolcraft's</persName> Journal. The heroine
          <lb/>was a native of the <name>Sioux tribe</name>, who inhabit the banks of the 
          <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>
          <lb/>and <placeName>Missouri</placeName>. They are warlike and powerful, and feared by the neigh­
          <lb/>bouring nations. This tribe admits of several subdivisions, among which
          <lb/>the clan of <name>Minowa Kantong</name> has obtained pre-eminence. One of
          <lb/>its principal bands resides near the head of <placeName>Lake Pepin</placeName>, and to this be­
          <lb/>longed the father of <persName>Oolaita</persName>. The <name>Minowa Kantongs</name> are by far the
          <lb/>most civilized of the <name>Sioux tribe</name>. They are skillfull in the construction
          <lb/>of canoes, and in the use of fire-arms, with which they are well provided.
          <lb/>They are the only ones among their nation, who erect long-huts, and
          <lb/>attend to the cultivation of vegetables. The <name>Sioux</name> are considered as
          <lb/>the most warlike and independent tribe of <name>Indians</name> within the territory
          <lb/>of the <placeName>United States</placeName>. With them, every passion is held in subservience
          <lb/>to the enthusiasm of the warrior, and to be <quote>invincible in arms,</quote> is the
          <lb/>summit of ambition. Such is the excellence of their leaders, and the
          <lb/>dauntless spirit of the people, that they have hitherto bid defiance to
          <lb/>every hostile attack. From their pronunciation, habits and personal
          <lb/>appearance, the opinion has been entertained that they derive their origin
          <lb/>from the <name>Tartars</name>. The following description of <placeName>Lake Pepin</placeName>, where a
          <lb/>part of this tribe have their territory, is from the pen of <persName>Schoolcraft</persName>.
          <lb/><quote>This beautiful sheet of water is an expansion of the <placeName>Mississippi river</placeName>,
          <lb/>six miles below the Sioux village of <placeName>Talangamane</placeName>, and one hundred
          <lb/>below the <placeName>Falls of St. Anthony</placeName>. It is twenty-four miles in length, with
          <lb/>a width of from two to four miles, and is indented with several bays, and
          <lb/>prominent points, which serve to enhance the beauty of the prospect.
          <lb/>On the east shore is a lofty range of lime-stone bluffs, which are much
          <lb/>broken and crumbled, sometimes run into pyramidal peaks, and often 
          <lb/>present a character of the utmost sublimity. On the west is a high level
          <lb/>prairie, covered with the most luxuriant growth of grass, yet nearly des­
          <lb/>titute of forest trees. This lake is beautifully circumscribed by a broad
          <lb/>beach of clean washed gravel, which often extends from the foot of the
          <lb/>surrounding highlands, three or four hundred yards into the lake, forming
          <lb/>gravelly points, upon which there is a delightful walk, and scalloping out

          <lb/>the margins of the lake, with the most pleasing irregularity. In walking
          <lb/>along these, the eye is attracted by the various colours of mineral gems,
          <lb/>which are promiscuously scattered among the water-worn debris of gra­
          <lb/>nitic, and other rocks; and the agate, <ref xml:id="er33" target="#ec33" type="error">carnelian</ref>, and 
          chalcedony are met
          <lb/>with at every step. The size of these gems is often as large as the egg
          <lb/>of the partridge, and their transparency and beauty of color is only excel­
          <lb/>led by the choicest oriental specimens.</quote></p>

          out on an

          <lb/>young hunters, pursuing the chase, who returned and gave information
          <lb/>to their aged chieftain, <persName>Malaanthee</persName>. He refused to believe that any
          <lb/>injury was intended them by the whites, on account of a treaty which had
          <lb/>been executed the preceding spring. He therefore unsuspiciously advanc­
          <lb/>ed to meet them, holding in one hand this treaty signed by the American
          <lb/>Commissioners, and in the other the flag of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, which he
          <lb/>had received at the same time. <quote>I, and my people,</quote> said he, <quote>are

          <lb/>friends of the thirteen fires. Faithfully have we observed the treaty
          <lb/>made with their Chiefs; and on this flag, which they gave me as a mark
          <lb/>of friendship, I place my own and my people's protection.</quote> A fatal
          <lb/>blow was their answer to the hoary Chief. The white flag, stained with
          <lb/>blood, was torn from his lifeless hand, and displayed as a trophy on the
          <lb/>Court-house at <placeName>Lexington</placeName>.</p>
          <p>This unprincipled deed is strongly contrasted with an instance of
          <lb/>magnanimity, and inviolable friendship, recorded in <persName>Mr. Jefferson's</persName> <title>Notes
          <lb/>on <placeName>Virginia</placeName></title>. <persName>Col. Byrd</persName> was once sent to transact 
          some business with 
          <lb/>the <name>Cherokee nation</name>; and it happened that some of our disorderly people
          <lb/>had just murdered one or two of theirs. It was proposed in the council
          <lb/>of the <name>Cherokees</name>, that <persName>Col. Byrd</persName> should be put to death, in revenge 
          for
          <lb/>the loss of their countrymen. Among them, was a chief named
          <lb/><persName>Silouéé</persName>, who on some former occasion had contracted a friendly 
          ac­
          <lb/>quaintance with <persName>Col. Byrd</persName>. Every night he came to him in his tent,
          <lb/>telling him not to be afraid, for they should not take away his life.
          <lb/>After many days deliberation, they however determined, contrary to
          <lb/><persName>Silouéé's</persName> expectation, that <persName>Col. Byrd</persName> should be 
          put to death, and some
          <lb/>warriors despatched as executioners. <persName>Silouéé</persName> attended them, and when
          <lb/>they entered the tent, threw himself between them and their victim,
          <lb/>exclaiming <quote>this man is my friend! Before you get at him, you must
          <lb/>kill me.</quote> On this, the warriors returned, and the Council respected
          <lb/>the principle so much, as to recede from their decision.</p>

          <p>Ever since the settlement of this country by the <name>Europeans</name>, the

          <p><persName>Mather</persName>, in his <title>Magnalia</title>, affirms, that <persName>Eliot</persName> 
          completed the whole
          <lb/>translation of the Bible into the language of the <name>Indians</name>, entirely with <emph>one
          <lb/>pen</emph>, which he consecrated to that holy office. After his acquisition of
          <lb/>this language, which was attended with many difficulties, he composed
          <lb/>a grammar of it, and translated such a number of treatises on Practical
          <lb/>Piety, that a small library was soon formed for those who had never
          <lb/>before seen their barbarous articulations arrested or arranged. Through

          <lb/>educated at <name>Cambridge</name>, where they became regular graduates. For
          <lb/>their assistance in their preparatory studies, he translated some scientific
          <lb/>essays, and works explaining more abstruse points in Theology. But
          <lb/>what he had most at heart was an entire Indian bible. The New Tes­

          <lb/>his pious spirit have rejoiced, could it have looked through the mists of
          <lb/>time, and traced the accomplishment of this fervent desire. Much had
          <lb/>been performed by him, for the spiritual instruction of the natives, the
          <lb/>correction of their vices; the establishment of family-prayer, and the
          <lb/>foundation of regular societies for religious worship. The first Church

          <lb/>Lenapi</name>, or <name>Delaware tribe</name>, he has collected a great number of interesting

          <lb/>and reverence, which the gift of prescience would have changed into
          <lb/>aversion and terror. <persName>Mr. Heckewelder</persName>, after describing the extent of
          <lb/>territory and degree of prosperity which they then enjoyed, says, <quote>On
          <lb/>a sudden they are checked in their career, by a phenomenon they had
          <lb/>till then never beheld; immense canoes arriving at their shores, filled
          <lb/>with people of a different colour, language, dress and manners, from
          <lb/>themselves. In their astonishment they call out to one another, 
          <said rend="pre(‘)post(’)">Behold!
          <lb/>the Gods are come to visit us!</said> They at first considered these wonderful
          <lb/>beings as messengers of peace, sent from the abode of the Great Spirit,
          <lb/>and therefore employed their time in preparing and making sacrifices to 
          <lb/>that Great Being, who had so highly honoured them. Lost in amaze­
          <lb/>ment, fond of enjoyment of this novel spectacle, and anxious to know
          <lb/>the result, they were unmindful of those matters which hitherto had taken
          <lb/>up their minds, and formed the object of their pursuits; they thought
          <lb/>of nothing else but the wonders which now struck their eyes, and were
          <lb/>constantly employed in endeavouring to divine this great mystery. Such
          <lb/>is the manner in which they relate that event: the strong impression of
          <lb/>which is not yet obliterated from their minds.</quote></p>

          <lb/><quote>The region of pure spirits, the Five Nations call <placeName>Eskanane</placeName>. Accord­
          <lb/>ing to their tradition there is a gloomy fathomless gulph, near the
          <lb/>borders of the delightful mansions of <placeName>Eskanane</placeName>, over which all good and
          <lb/>brave spirits pass with safety, under the conduct of a faithful and skilfull
          <lb/>guide appointed for the purpose, but when those of other characters
          <lb/>approach the gulph, the conductor who possesses a most penetrating
          <lb/>eye, instantly discovers their spiritual features, and denies them his aid,
          <lb/>assigning his reasons. They will however attempt to cross upon a small
          <lb/>pole, which before they reach the middle trembles and shakes, till pre­
          <lb/>sently down they fall, with horrid shrieks. In this dreary gulph they
          <lb/>suppose resides a great dog or dragon, perpetually restless and spiteful.
          <lb/>Sometimes the guilty inhabitants of these miserable regions approach
          <lb/>so near the happy fields of <placeName>Eskanane</placeName>, as to hear the songs and dances
          <lb/>of their former companions; but this only serves to increase their tor­
          <lb/>ments, as they can discern no light, or discover any passage by which
          <lb/>they can gain access to them.</quote></p>
          <p>The <name>Tuscaroras</name> have affinity with the <name>Oneidas</name>, and resemble them

          <lb/>the <name>Tuscaroras</name> in the vicinity. With their devotion during the services
          <lb/>I was particularly impressed. Some of them who approached the church
          <lb/>during a heavy rain, observing it to be the time of prayer, remained 
          <lb/>without, unsheltered, till prayers were finished. Their minister by the
          <lb/>aid of an interpreter, gave them a sermon of such impressive simplicity,
          <lb/>that the whole of it remained upon my memory. But when the tunes
          <lb/>of Old Hundred and <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> burst forth in strains of perfect melody,
          <lb/>I could scarcely restrain my feelings. Afterwards, a grey-headed chief,

          <lb/>waters, might be preserved on his return to his home, and be blessed
          <lb/>for feeling an interest in poor <name>Indians</name>. The deportment of these sons

          <lb/>Perhaps the failure of most of our early attempts to convert the <name>aborig­

          <lb/>viduals were made solemn, purified, and, we trust, gathered to the family

          <lb/>of present good, before they will renounce vicious gratifications for the
          <lb/>hope of futurity. A religion which recommends itself by teaching them
          <lb/>to guards against the famine, the storm, and the <quote>pestilence walking in

          <lb/>habitations are dissolved. To vanquish their doubts of the excellency
          <lb/>of doctrines, it is necessary to <ref xml:id="er35" target="#ec35" type="error">ameliorate</ref> their

          <lb/>system which would sap the foundation of preconceived idolatry, is feel­

          <lb/>The children ran away in great terror. I left books with some of the
          <lb/>people, and went away, amid the sneers and laughter of the common
          <lb/>soldiers. A party of boatmen I talked with, and begged them to take
          <lb/>a tract, but could not prevail. A <name>Mussulman</name> who had received one of
          <lb/>the Hindostance tracts, and found what it was, was greatly alarmed and
          <lb/>returned it. I am much discouraged at the rebuffs and suspicions I
          <lb/>meet with. As I was entering a boat, I happened to touch, with my
          <lb/>stick, a brass pot of one of the <name>Hindoos</name>, in which rice was boiling. So
          <lb/>defiled are we in their sight, that the pollution past from my hand,

          <lb/>him that he is a herald of that Prince, whose <quote>kingdom is not of this
          <lb/>world.</quote> The tribes upon our borders to whom religious teachers have
          <lb/>been sent, so far from testifying like the oriental heathen, strong reluc­
          <lb/>tance or aversion, have entrusted their children to them with tears of
          <lb/>gratitude, and in many instances aided in the expenses incidental to their
          <lb/>education. The <name>Cherokees</name> who have probably shared the most largely
          <lb/>in these benefits, have made the greatest progress in civilization. The
          <lb/>culture of the earth has become an object of increased attention. Many of
          <lb/>their females understand the use of the distaff and loom, and the agency
          <lb/>of the needle in promoting domestic comfort. An intelligent traveller in
          <lb/>that region, about four years since, writes <quote>the Cherokee women almost
          <lb/>universally dress after the manner of the whites, in gowns manufactured 
          <lb/>by themselves, from cotton which they have raised on their own little
          <lb/>plantations. Rapidly are they coming into habits of industry. In the
          <lb/><name>Choctaw nation</name>, 2000 spinning wheels, and several hundred looms have
          <lb/>been made and distributed.</quote></p>
          <p>The Cherokee council has recently promised a set of tools to those
          <lb/>young men who would become acquainted with some mechanic art; and
          <lb/>has also divided the territory of the tribe into districts, and appointed
          <lb/>judges in each for the regular distribution of justice. The children, who
          <lb/>have become members of the Schools, make respectable, and often rapid
          <lb/>progress in the branches assigned them. The circumstance of imparting
          <lb/>to them our language, instead of being forced to acquire theirs, furnishes
          <lb/>our missionaries with an important facility which is denied to their east­
          <lb/>ern brethren. Time and mental labour are thus rescued for other pur­
          <lb/>poses; and the pupils after obtaining the English tongue, which they
          <lb/>have hitherto done with great ease, enjoy in our books the advantage of
          <lb/>an unbounded store of knowledge. The delay occasioned by acquiring
          <lb/>the <name>Hindostance</name> or <name>Sanscrit</name> sufficiently well to converse with and preach
          <lb/>to the natives, assumes the aspect of an obstacle, which severity of ap­
          <lb/>plication alone can conquer. A Missionary, eminently distinguished
          <lb/>by his translations in the Asiatic dialects, remarks <quote>the idiom, and just
          <lb/>collocation of the words in <name>Hindostance</name> are very difficult. Every
          <lb/>few miles, the language changes, so that a book in the dialect of one
          <lb/>district would be unintelligible in another.</quote></p>

          <p>Among the facilities afforded for the instruction of our western
          <lb/>heathen, and which seems almost to amount to a preparation for truth,
          <lb/>may be numbered the circumstance, that their minds are not fettered by
          <lb/>an idolatry like that of <persName>Juggernaut</persName>, at once abject, imposing, and bar­
          <lb/>barous. Their belief in the Great Spirit, and the <quote>land of souls,</quote> is 
          <lb/>not so adverse to the <quote>simplicity which is in Christ,</quote> as the mysteries
          <lb/>of <persName>Vishnoo</persName>, and of <persName>Brumma</persName>.

          <lb/>bears date in <date when="1643">1643</date>, and is now very scarce, has the following passage.
          <lb/><quote>He who questions whether God made the world, the <name>Indians</name> will
          <lb/>teach him. I must acknowledge that I have in my conversations with
          <lb/>them, received many confirmations of those two great truths, that <emph>God is</emph>,
          <lb/>and that he is a rewarder of them who diligently seek him. If they
          <lb/>receive any good in hunting, fishing, or harvest, they acknowledge God
          <lb/>in it. Yea, if they meet with but an ordinary accident, such as a fall,
          <lb/>&amp;c. they say God was angry, and permitted it.</quote></p>
          <p>This habitual sense of the agency of a Divine Being in all the affairs
          <lb/>of life, might serve both as an example and reproof to some inhabitants
          <lb/>of a christian land; and seems to prove that a path is already broken up,
          <lb/>for the footsteps of knowledge and piety. The latter assertion is however
          <lb/>applied principally to those upon our frontiers, who suffer from poverty
          <lb/>and degradation. The natives, whose territory is farther to the west,
          <lb/>maintain comparative independence; and finding their own mode of life
          <lb/>sufficient for their wants, are less disposed to receive a better. But
          <lb/><quote>our brother within our gates,</quote> hath not rejected our benevolence, hath
          <lb/>not put from him the <quote rend="pre()">word of life.</quote> Do we <quote>adjudge him unworthy
          <lb/>of eternal life, that we turn from him to other <name>Gentiles</name>?</quote>—that we
          <lb/>prefer invading the jurisdiction of foreign governments, to discharging
          <lb/>the debts which our own has incurred? For the <name>Indian</name> hath a claim
          <lb/>upon our <emph>justice</emph>, which sophistry cannot cancel. It is vain to say that
          <lb/>their land was obtained by purchase. <emph>What a purchase</emph>! When whole
          <lb/>townships were obtained for a single intoxicating draught; and prov­
          <lb/>inces, like the vineyard of <placeName>Naboth</placeName>, wrested without payment, save the
          <lb/>life of the owner. In many of the original purchases of land from the
          <lb/><name>Indians</name>, payment was rendered with the sword, silencing the lip that
          <lb/>complained of injustice, and stilling the bosom that throbbed at tyranny.

          <p>It is a remarkable fact that every nation which has established per­

          <lb/>charitable pretensions comport with her execrable barbarities, that the
          <lb/>miserable natives, after a full explanation of the doctrines of her church,
          <lb/>were accustomed to say, that they <quote>had rather endure the sufferings of

          <lb/>the condition of the savage, by mingling his simple adoration of the

          <lb/>with the deepest dies of cruelty. Candour requires the acknowledgment
          <lb/>that some of her holy men have evinced a strong interest in the religious
          <lb/>instruction of the natives, mingled with that national urbanity which has
          <lb/>powerfully gained the affections of many of the sons of the forest. <quote>On

          <lb/>how did their conduct in many instances fulfil this sacred injunction?
          <lb/>The natives of the forest were seen fading before their footsteps, like

          <lb/>imparting spiritual life, destroyed even the principle of animal existence.
          <lb/>The example of many of the traders, who by frequent intercourse with

          <lb/>ity was, almost universally contradicted a religion which forbids fraud,

          <lb/>practical influence flowing from it, that the first settlers, who witnessed
          <lb/>the emotions of their surprize, were accustomed to hear them say, with 
          <lb/>a solemn countenance, <quote>You know God! will you tell falsehoods,

          <lb/>A zealous Missionary, once reasoning with the natives, on the impor­
          <lb/>tance of moral virtues, when derived from rectified principles, was inter­
          <lb/>rupted by a Chief, who rising, said with great earnestness, <quote>Hold your

            <quote>The great injuries we have received from white men, the wicked­

          <p><name>Brainerd</name>, in the <name>Cherokee nation</name>, was the first institution among our
          <lb/><name>aborigines</name>, upon a plan combining <name>christianity</name> with civilization. There,

          <lb/>the experiment was first made, whether <name>Indians</name> would resign their children
          <lb/>to foreign teachers, and whether those children were capable of the appli­
          <lb/>cation, the proficiency, the subordination of those, whose infancy had
          <lb/>passed amid higher privileges. Success has crowned an attempt which
          <lb/>commenced amid the fears of many, and the humble hopes of a few.
          <lb/>The children of the forest have cheerfully adopted a system of methodical
          <lb/>study and labour, more strict than we find established among ourselves.
          <lb/>Their progress has been shown almost universally rapid, and their minds are
          <lb/>considered by their teachers of an excellent order. That learning which
          <lb/>the child of indulgence views with aversion, and for the partial acqui­
          <lb/>sition of which he fancies himself entitled to reward, they consider as
          <lb/><ref xml:id="er38" target="#ec38" type="error">recreations</ref>. Food and raiment, which he receives 
          without thanks, they
          <lb/>esteem as favours, exciting gratitude. Among them also, are some
          <lb/>happy students of the <quote>wisdom that cometh from above;</quote> and the
          <lb/>important influence acquired by the Missionaries over the minds of the
          <lb/>parents, by attention to the welfare of their children, is a channel
          <lb/>through which much good may enter.</p>
          <p>The experiment first tried among the <name>Cherokees</name> has been repeated
          <lb/>among the <name>Choctaws</name> and <name>Great Osages</name>, so that already, at a variety of
          <lb/>stations, several hundred native children are listening to the voice of
          <lb/>Instruction.</p>
          <p>Whether the <name>Indians</name> ever <emph>can</emph> be civilized, still remains a question
          <lb/>with many cautious minds. If they <emph>ever can</emph>, now is the time: when
          <lb/>famine and misery have forced them to seek a refuge, and when that
          <lb/>refuge is provided for them in the arms of humanity. But reason
          <lb/>assures us, that the process must be slow. National character is not
          <lb/>modified, much less renovated, in a moment. By the time that the
          <lb/>whole of the present generation has past away, the point may be decided.
          <lb/>Yet if in civilized countries, where education exerts its sway with fewer
          <lb/>obstacles, the children even of virtuous parents sometimes prove faithless
          <lb/>both to the example of the one, and the impression of the other; much
          <lb/>ought to be expected of a roving and untutored race, to counteract the
          <lb/>purposes of instruction, and repress the enthusiasm of hope.</p>

          <p>At a time when missions to the East almost monopolized the exer­
          <lb/>tions of <name>christians</name>, the <persName>Rev. Cyrus Kingsbury</persName> was revolving amid the
          <lb/>solitude of the student's cell, the design of devoting himself to our
          <lb/>western <name>aborigines</name>. With firmness worthy of his cause, he penetrated
          <lb/>the lonely forest, and established the first permanent institution in which
          <lb/>the children of our natives had ever been taught to blend the arts of
          <lb/>civilized life with the hopes of an immortal existence. When the first
          <lb/>obstacles to an institution have been surmounted, he has left it to form
          <lb/>others in the wilderness; choosing not to <quote>rest in his labours, but to
          <lb/>bear the burden, and heat of the day.</quote> Only a few years have elapsed,
          <lb/>since his solitary tent was pitched among the wilds of <placeName>Chickamaugah</placeName>;
          <lb/>now, many <name>christians</name> have entered the same path, to water the seed
          <lb/>in the desert, and to forget their toil amid the joy of harvest. This
          <lb/>self-devoted band may be considered as adopting the plan which filled
          <lb/>the discriminating mind of <persName>Eliot</persName>, the first Indian apostle, who in his
          <lb/>early intercourse with them, declared, that in order to succeed in their
          <lb/>conversion to <name>christianity</name>, it was necessary that <quote>they should be taken
          <lb/>off from their wild way of living, and brought into some kind of civil

          <lb/>embraced <name>christianity</name>. A short time after she became a member of the

          <placeName>Chickamaugah</placeName>,
          <lb/><persName>Catharine Brown</persName>, at that time about the age of 16 years, was remarked
          <lb/>for her rapid progress in the various branches of education, and for the

          <lb/>ornaments with which she was furnished by her parents, had been worn
          <lb/>with some haughtiness, as valuable aids to a comely appearance. These
          <lb/>were of her own accord laid aside, and offered to assist in defraying the
          <lb/>expenses of the mission. On the minds of those of her companions who
          <lb/>seemed less sensible than herself of the advantages extended to them,
          <lb/>she strove to impress the magnitude of their privileges. Soon after the
          <lb/>establishment of the school, one of the instructers writes, <quote><persName>Catherine</persName><lb/>takes great pains to make those little <name>Cherokees</name>, who are inclined to be 
          <lb/>inconsiderate, understand the privilege they enjoy in attending school
          <lb/>here. Often has she been heard interceding for them with her Father
          <lb/>in Heaven. Every night she reads the Scriptures, and prays with those
          <lb/>little girls, who lodge in the same apartment: and every day she gives
          <lb/>increasing evidence that the love of God is shed abroad in her heart.</quote>
          <lb/>Since that period she has become more extensively known throughout the 
          <lb/>christian community, as an interesting example of the power of that holy
          <lb/>principle which at once renovates, fortifies, and exalts our nature. She
          <lb/>has become a faithful Instructress in a school recently established among
          <lb/>her tribe: and her brohter, a promising young man, who has also em­
          <lb/>braced our religion, is receiving in the excellent institution at <placeName>Cornwall</placeName>
          <lb/>(<placeName>Connecticut</placeName>) an education to fit him for a missionary to his people.

          <lb/>become heralds of salvation to their dear benighted countrymen, see

          <lb/>exertions were devoted to the <name>Cherokees</name>, and her residence was at

          <lb/>our good Father, the President, is ignorant of the proceedings of the
          <lb/>white people here. I believe that he is our friend, and wishes to do

          <lb/>My uncle <persName>Charles R. Hicks</persName> has gone on to the President at Washing­

          <p>In a public notice of her death, her friendship, and even maternal

          <lb/>woman, may be added an extract from the <name>London Missionary Register</name>,
          <lb/>conferring on the religious denomination to which she belonged, a tribute
          <lb/>of praise, honourable both to the merit that deserves, and the liberality
          <lb/>that bestows it. <quote>It is but justice to the United Brethren to say, that
          <lb/>they make the best missionaries in the world: for to a persevering, tem­
          <lb/>perate zeal that never tires, they join habits of personal industry which
          <lb/>enables them to subsist at a very small expense in their employers. The
          <lb/>expense of their establishment at <name>Gnadenthal</name>, amounting to £ 600 per
          <lb/>annum, is defrayed by the Missionaries themselves, with a deficiency of
          <lb/>only £ 19. They have competely won the affections of the <name>Hottentots</name>,
          <lb/>have prevailed on them to shake off their habits of sloth, and are rapidly 
          <lb/>bringing them to a state of civilization.</quote></p>

          <p><bibl><regMe>Numbers x, 29.</regMe></bibl> This will be recognized as the invitation of the
          <lb/>Jewish Lawgiver to his brother, when <name>Israel</name> was about to remove to the
          <lb/>promised land. Its spirit seems still to be infused into the minds of
          <lb/>those who are engaged in the formation of benevolent societies; and
          <lb/>among the young, the sympathy arising from it, is almost irresistable. 
          <lb/>The age in which we live, has been called the age of charity; and it
          <lb/>is peculiarly distinguished by the charities of childhood. Innumerable
          <lb/>associations for the most disinterested purposes, of bands just entering
          <lb/>into life, adorn our country. Apart from the aid which has thus been
          <lb/>rendered to poverty, and to the heathen, the effect is important upon
          <lb/>the unformed minds of the actors. For when industry or self-denial
          <lb/>are made the basis of their charity, energies are awakened, and habits
          <lb/>cherished, which look beyond the happiness of this life, and affect the
          <lb/>destinies of Eternity. The great designs of the present century, in the
          <lb/>accomplishment of which, both Infancy and Age unite, are thus beauti­
          <lb/>fully illustrated by the poet <persName>Montgomery</persName>.</p>

          <p>His excellency <persName>James Monroe</persName>, the present Chief Magistrate of the
          <lb/><placeName>United States</placeName>, has distinguished himself by a kind regard to the interests

          <lb/>and they are accustomed to speak of him as a Father, who is solicitous
          <lb/>for their welfare, and to view him as a Philanthropist, listening to <quote>the
          <lb/>sighing of the prisoner.</quote> The recent missions are indebted much to
          <lb/>his patronage, for the degree of success which has given strength to
          <lb/>their infancy. In his tour through the western states in <date when="1813">1813</date>, he visit­
          <lb/>ed <name>Brainerd</name>, gave particular directions for the erection of a building,
          <lb/>intended for the instruction of female pupils, and expressed the most
          <lb/>friendly interest in the whole establishment. This benevolent regard to
          <lb/>the miserable, which will long render his name respected and beloved,
          <lb/>seems now to be pervading the higher ranks of society, promising to
          <lb/>overcome that stern indifference which has too long been entertained
          <lb/>towards the sons of the forest, by a nation which covered their glory.
          <lb/>In the language of Scripture <quote>the set time to favour them has come.</quote>
          <lb/>No stronger proof of this assertion need be adduced, than the constitu­
          <lb/>tion of a Society recently organized  at the seat of government, under the
          <lb/>appellation of <orgName rend="pre(“)post(”)">The American Society for promoting the civilization
          <lb/>and general improvement of the Indian tribes within the United States</orgName>:
          <lb/>and which comprizes a great proportion of those illustrious characters,
          <lb/>whose virtues dignify their opinions, and whose opinions must influence
          <lb/>multitudes in our great community.</p>
