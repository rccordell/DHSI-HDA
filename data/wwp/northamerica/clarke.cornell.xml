<lb/>breathe therein. If you are drowsy I will rouse
<lb/>you. I will beat a tattoo on the parchment cases of
<lb/>your consciences. I will send a volley of small
<lb/>shot at your outward man, to compel you to throw
<lb/>off the garments of sin, in which you are now
<lb/>clothed, and to induce you all to put on the
<lb/>robes of repentance; clothe yourselves in sack­
<lb/>cloth; put ashes on your heads, and fall prostrate
<lb/>in the dust, there remain until repentance shall
<lb/>cause your eyes to rain tears, and you wallow like
<lb/>the swine in the filth of your own unrighteousness.
<lb/>Lay there ye vile sinners, for your hearts are sinks
<lb/>of corruption. Look at that maiden, is she not
<lb/>fair to the eye, but ah, her soul is tainted by the
<lb/>vanities of the world, and her inside is in a state
<lb/>of putrefaction. Was she to wed, she would be
<lb/>rotteness to the bones of her husband; for she
<lb/>hath not yet found religion. Cast off, fair sisters,
<lb/>these trappings of the world; throw them from you,

<lb/>as you would all save your souls from the fangs of

<lb/>you cry for one drop of water to cool the
<lb/>flame on your tongues; and there will be neither
<lb/>firemen nor engines to quench your flame, or ex­
<lb/>tinguish the blue blazes that will envelope you.
<lb/>Ah! what a pitiable state you people of the world
<lb/>will be thus tormented, while we, the saints, will
<lb/>look down from the realms of bliss, with pitying
<lb/>eyes; but then our pity will avail you nothing;
