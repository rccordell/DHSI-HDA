        <p>The simplicity and ignorance of poor <persName>Alice</persName>,
	  <lb/>caused a loud burst of laughter from the two older
	  <lb/>girls sitting by, who were inmates of the same
	  <lb/>family, and members of the same school; al­
	  <lb/>though, I dare say, had the same question been
	  <lb/>asked them, they would have been as unfortu­
	  <lb/>nate in their reply as she was.</p>
        <p><persName>Mrs. Athearn</persName> kindly explained the term, by
	  <lb/>saying—<said rend="pre(“)post(”)">Popery, <persName>Alice</persName>, is the religion of the
	    <lb/>Church of <placeName>Rome</placeName>, or in other words more famil­
	    <lb/>iar to you, the <rs type="properAdjective">Roman Catholic</rs> religion; and
	    <lb/>consists in a great variety of articles of faith and
	    <lb/>practice, which I cannot explain to you now,
	    <lb/>but which I will do, if you wish it, when more
	    <lb/>at leisure, and tell you something about this
	    <lb/>Reformation—<emph>why</emph> it was necessary—<emph>how</emph> it was
	    <lb/>produced—and what are its results.</said></p>
        <p><persName>Alice</persName> thanked her teacher, and quietly re­
	  <lb/>turned to her work.</p>
        <p>It had been a custom with <persName>Mrs. Athearn</persName> to
	  <lb/>spend the two hours alotted to needlework, in
	  <lb/>the long winter evenings, in the room appropri­
	  <lb/>ated to the young ladies, and to employ that
	  <lb/>time either in reading some interesting and in­
	  <lb/>structive communication, or relating herself
	  <lb/>something calculated to amuse and improve.
	  <lb/>She was anxious not a moment of the precious
	  <lb/>time of her pupils should be lost, in which they
	  <lb/>might be treasuring up knowledge; besides, she
	  <lb/>knew well the folly and idleness to which young,
	  <pb n="07"/>
	  <milestone unit="sig" n="1(2)r"/>
	  <mw type="pageNum">7</mw>
	  <lb/>giddy girls are prone, when collected together
	  <lb/>without the restraining presence of an elder.</p>
        <p>At the close of school, on the day of which
	  <lb/>we are speaking, <persName>Mrs. Athearn</persName> announced to
	  <lb/>the young ladies her intention of devoting a few
	  <lb/>evenings to a brief history of the Reformation.
	  <lb/><said rend="pre(“)post(”)">To you,</said> added she,
<said rend="pre(“)post(”)">who are engaged in his­
	    <lb/>torical research, it must be interesting, and to all
	    <lb/>it will be instructive; to the younger part of you,
	    <lb/>it will unfold a train of events, with their conse­
	    <lb/>quences, with which you ought not to be unac­
	    <lb/>quainted—to the older ladies, to <emph>all of you espe­
	      <lb/>cially who are <name>Christians</name></emph>, it will show what
	    <lb/>single, as well as united effort in the cause of
	    <lb/>our Saviour has accomplished by the blessing of
	    <lb/>God, and I hope, stimulate you to the <emph>holy
	      <lb/>activity</emph>, which the present state of religion
	    <lb/>throughout the world, seems to demand of the
	    <lb/>rising generation.</said> The annunciation of this
	  <lb/>subject encountered a great variety of feelings.
	  <lb/>By some, accustomed to regard every proposi­
	  <lb/>tion with interest, <emph>because <persName>Mrs. Athearn</persName> made
	    <lb/>it,</emph> it was received with satisfaction. To others,
	  <lb/>it really appeared a subject, fraught with enter­
	  <lb/>tainment and profit. Some thought it would
	  <lb/>prove dry, and altogether uninteresting. A few
	  <lb/>heard the announcement with indifference, but
	  <lb/>not so with little <persName>Alice</persName>; her blue eyes sparkled
	  <lb/>with animation, and her dimples came and went
	  <lb/>like the blushes of the morning. We might have
	  <lb/>fancied such a subject, to so young a mind,
	  <lb/>would appear devoid of interest; but <persName>Alice</persName> had
	  <pb n="08"/>
	  <milestone unit="sig" n="1(2)v"/>
	  <mw type="pageNum">8</mw>
	  <lb/>been early taught to <emph>think</emph>, and when once a par­
	  <lb/>ticular train of thought had taken possession of 
	  <lb/>her mind, there was no rest to her till it was fath­
	  <lb/>omed, understood, and treasured away in her
	  <lb/>storehouse of knowledge.</p>
        <p>Evening came; and before a huge wood fire
	  <lb/>that crackled and blazed most merrily, casting
	  <lb/>its brilliant glare over the features of a circle of
	  <lb/>happy and beautiful faces, glowing with youth
	  <lb/>and expectation, were <persName>Mrs. Athearn's</persName> scholars.</p>
        <p>Here and there a curled head was bustling
	  <lb/>about, and three or four tongues, that might long
	  <lb/>since have claimed a discovery of the secret of
	  <lb/>perpetual motion, were in the most lively exer­
	  <lb/>cise. Some were moving about lightly on the
	  <lb/>carpeted floor, arranging this thing and that—
	  <lb/>others were parcelling out their implements of
	  <lb/>work on a large centre-table, over which a well­
	  <lb/>trimmed shade-lamp cast its equal light; all
	  <lb/>occupied in busy preparation—for as yet, the
	  <lb/>tread that hushed all was unheard.</p>
        <p>But I must tell you some particulars of this
	  <lb/>lady and her school, to throw light and interest
	  <lb/>over many conversations and occurrences which
	  <lb/>will follow.</p>
        <p><persName>Mrs. Athearn</persName> was a middle-aged lady of great
	  <lb/>dignity and refinement, possessing a mind of su­
	  <lb/>perior strength, well-stored, and diligently culti­
	  <lb/>vated. She had been educated in the circles of
	  <lb/>rank and affluence, and in her intercourse with
	  <lb/>the world, had acquired that ease and elegance of
	  <lb/>manner, which acquaintance with polished soci­
	  <pb n="09"/>
	  <milestone unit="sig" n="1(3)r"/>
	  <mw type="pageNum">9</mw>
	  <lb/>ety seldom fails to confer. She had also been
	  <lb/>beautiful, in the true sense of the word, and still
	  <lb/>retained so much of the impress of youth in her
	  <lb/>form and countenance, that few persons of dis­
	  <lb/>cernment would have supposed they risked the
	  <lb/>credit of her judgment, to pronounce her still
	  <lb/>on the younger side of thirty.</p>
        <p>She had married early, and happily, and with
	  <lb/>her husband left her native land; but before her
	  <lb/>twenty third summer's sun had passed, she re­
	  <lb/>turned to her own country, still a beautiful, though
	  <lb/>blighted flower, with all her heart's treasures cen­
	  <lb/>tred in her babe, little <persName>Ellen</persName>, her only child. Her
	  <lb/>husband, and first-born, whom she loved with
	  <lb/>almost enthusiastic tenderness, she had left be­
	  <lb/>hind, sleeping on a foreign shore. But her sor­
	  <lb/>rows were <emph>blessed</emph> to her. Her afflictions were
	  <lb/>instrumental in working out for her a far more
	  <lb/>enduring inheritance, than the comforts and
	  <lb/>pleasures which earth can bestow. Her proud
	  <lb/>spirit became chastened and subdued, and by
	  <lb/>the grace of God she was rendered singularly
	  <lb/>submissive and devoted to Him, <quote>who doth not
	    <lb/>afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.</quote>
	  <lb/><bibl><regMe>Lam. iii. 33</regMe></bibl></p>
        <p>At her father's death, <persName>Mrs. Athearn</persName> came
	  <lb/>into possession of the old family mansion, and
	  <lb/>with her <persName>Ellen</persName>, then nine years of age, and one
	  <lb/>tried, faithfully attached domestic, she sought
	  <lb/>its retirement. It was situated a few miles from
	  <lb/>town, rather aside from the beautiful village of
	  <lb/><placeName>L――</placeName> in a most quiet, delightful place—and here
	  <mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">1*</mw>
	  <pb n="10"/>
	  <milestone unit="sig" n="1(3)v"/>
	  <mw type="pageNum">10</mw>
	  <lb/>she superintended <persName>Ellen's</persName> education almost en­
	  <lb/>tirely herself. Her opinions on the subject of
	  <lb/>female education were rather peculiar, and would
	  <lb/>perhaps be deemed enthusiastic by many moth­
	  <lb/>ers, who, not from necessity, but from thought­
	  <lb/>lessness, or a still more inexcusable motive, re­
	  <lb/>linquish the intellectual management of their
	  <lb/>daughters wholly, or almost so, to strangers, be­
	  <lb/>yond their own supervision or control.</p>
        <p><emph>Her</emph> views led her to feel deeply the awful
	  <lb/>responsibility which God had laid upon her, in
	  <lb/>the precious soul he had confided to her foster­
	  <lb/>ing care; and to feel that whatever of mere
	  <lb/><emph>temporal</emph> interest interfered with the just and
	  <lb/>faithful discharge of the duties which the im­
	  <lb/>mortal being consigned to her culture involved,
	  <lb/>it must be disregarded and neglected.</p>
        <p>Whether <persName>Mrs. Athearn's</persName> system was incor­
	  <lb/>rect or judicious, her lovely <persName>Ellen</persName>, at the age of
	  <lb/>sixteen, exhibited a most flattering result.</p>
        <p>There were, however, in the circle of <persName>Mrs.
	  <lb/>Athearn's</persName> acquaintance, many mothers of dis­
	  <lb/>tinction and influence, who supposed their nu­
	  <lb/>merous cares rendered it impossible for them to
	  <lb/>devote the time and systematic attention to their
	  <lb/>daughters, which their views of female educa­
	  <lb/>tion demanded. Yet they could not commit
	  <lb/>their precious charge to the influence of an in­
	  <lb/>discriminate boarding-school. With one im­
	  <lb/>pulse, their attention was directed to <persName>Mrs. Ath­
	  <lb/>earn</persName>, as eminently qualified by her attainments,
	  <lb/>the deep tone of her piety and her few worldly
	  <pb n="11"/>
	  <milestone unit="sig" n="1(4)r"/>
	  <mw type="pageNum">11</mw>
	  <lb/>cares, for an office so highly responsible and
	  <lb/>arduous.</p>
        <p>But could she forego her ease, her delightful,
	  <lb/>quiet seclusion, and assume a task at once so
	  <lb/>self-denying? A united petition was, however,
	  <lb/>presented, and though she received it with some
	  <lb/>surprise, and was tempted at first wholly to de­
	  <lb/>cline the undertaking, mature deliberation and
	  <lb/>prayer for guidance led her to a compliance
	  <lb/>with the general wish. She saw, as she had
	  <lb/>not seen it before, that her present life was
	  <lb/>comparatively useless to her fellow men, that the
	  <lb/>ease and freedom from care she had hitherto
	  <lb/>sought, were inconsistent with the professions of
	  <lb/>religious attachment she had made to Him, who
	  <lb/>went about ever doing good.</p>
        <p>She saw a wide field of usefulness before her
	  <lb/>in the culture of these young, pliant minds,—
	  <lb/>that if properly directed, a vast amount of good
	  <lb/>from their talents, their influence, and their
	  <lb/>wealth might accrue to the church, and she
	  <lb/>dared not, in the light of eternity, refuse a work
	  <lb/>so evidently an answer to her prayers for more
	  <lb/>extensive usefulness.</p>
        <p>A bequest of the little orphan, <persName>Alice Brandon</persName>,
	  <lb/>to her fostering care was made about the same
	  <lb/>time, and was another weight in the scale which
	  <lb/>induced her to comply with the wishes of her
	  <lb/>friends.</p>
        <p>Her house was at length thrown open and
	  <lb/>filled to the great delight of <persName>Ellen</persName>, and the almost
	  <lb/>ecstatic joy of little <persName>Alice</persName>. It was a noble es­

	  <mw type="pageNum">12</mw>
	  <lb/>tablishment without, and nothing which could
	  <lb/>promote <persName>Mrs. A.'s</persName> broad plans for her pupils was
	  <lb/>spared within, to render her home for them
	  <lb/>attractive.</p>
        <p><persName>Mrs. Athearn's</persName> father had been a great lover
	  <lb/>of the wild and romantic, and had taken partic­
	  <lb/>ular pains to cultivate the shrubbery around his
	  <lb/>dwelling; so much so, that his house was actu­
	  <lb/>ally embedded in a little forest of his own plant­
	  <lb/>ing and cultivation. And <persName>Mrs. Athearn</persName> was
	  <lb/>one who could not live without flowers; by her
	  <lb/>tasteful arrangement, the whole immediate vi­
	  <lb/>cinity of her dwelling in the summer seemed in
	  <lb/>one perfect bloom, while the odor of the flowers,
	  <lb/>the cool breath of the waving trees, and the
	  <lb/>singing of the birds that warbled in their
	  <lb/>branches, rendered <soCalled rend="pre(“)post(”)">the woodlands</soCalled> to a pass­
	  <lb/>er-by, one of the most delightful places in the
	  <lb/>world. But winter had robbed this place, as all
	  <lb/>others, or verdant beauty, and left little to notice
	  <lb/>save the slender twigs, and stiff, knotty branches
	  <lb/>of the trees, fringed with glittering icicles—with
	  <lb/>here and there an old elm bending beneath the
	  <lb/>weight of its years and its fringes, which little
	  <lb/><persName>Alice</persName> called <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">the good old centinels that stood
	    <lb/>bowing and nodding as if they would say, we
	    <lb/>will most faithfully guard the precious treasure
	    <lb/>within.</said> <persName>Mrs. Athearn</persName> had as wonderful a
	  <lb/>faculty of producing happy faces within doors,
	  <lb/>as in creating pleasant scenery without. Per­
	  <lb/>haps a uniformly happier group were seldom
	  <lb/>seen, than the twenty-five young ladies and mis­

	  <lb/>ses who were assembled on the evening to which
	  <lb/>we have referred, to engage in their usual even­
	  <lb/>ing task, and listen to <persName>Mrs. Athearn's</persName> story of
	  <lb/>the Reformation.</p>
        <p>The moment her gentle tread was heard in
	  <lb/>the hall, all buzzing died away; and it was
	  <lb/>amusing to see what a host of smiles were lighted
	  <lb/>by her glance, and with what fresh brilliancy
	  <lb/>the eyes sparkled that gazed a welcome at her
	  <lb/>entrance. Ten minutes were allowed for the
	  <lb/>adjustment of matters and things, previous to a
	  <lb/>commencement of the conversation; when past,
	  <lb/><persName>Mrs. Athearn</persName> said――<said rend="pre(“)post(”)">To give even a very
	    <lb/>brief account of all the events which led to this
	    <lb/>important era in the church, and mark its pro­
	    <lb/>gress in the different countries through which it
	    <lb/>spread, will require much time; and we shall
	    <lb/>not be able <emph>now</emph> to examine the history of each
	    <lb/>country <emph>separately.</emph> I shall therefore commence
	    <lb/>with general information relating to the state of
	    <lb/>religion throughout <placeName>Europe</placeName> about that period,
	    <lb/>and <placeName>Germany</placeName> will be the particular portion of
	    <lb/>the continent to which I shall turn your atten­
	    <lb/>tion, <emph>because</emph> it was in a province of that coun­
	    <lb/>try that the dawn of the Reformation commenced.
	    <lb/>By taking you with me, and enlisting your feel­
	    <lb/>ings in a particular detail of occurrences con­
	    <lb/>nected with that event in <emph>one</emph> country, I hope so
	    <lb/>far to rouse your inquisitiveness, as to lead
	    <lb/>you, at your leisure, by your own researches, to
	    <lb/>a similar acquaintance with the others.</said></p>

        <p>Little <persName>Mary</persName>, overjoyed at the mark of atten­
	  <lb/>tion which this request expressed, said quickly,

          <said>No, my dear; the Bible was studied
	  <lb/>exclusively by the priests, and they imparted
	  <lb/>only such portions of it to the people as they
	  <lb/>chose, studiously withholding its entire perusal
	  <lb/>from them, and even <emph>prohibiting</emph> its circulation.
	  <lb/>Besides, as it then did not exist in the common
	  <lb/>language of the country, even had it been cir­
	  <lb/>culated, to the mass of community entirely
	  <lb/>unacquainted with the dead languages, it would
	  <lb/>have been a sealed volume.</said>
        </p>
        <said>
          <p>The theological notions of the
 people were
	  <lb/>derived entirely from the canon law, (the de­
	  <lb/>crees of the Pope,) and the traditions of the
	  <lb/>fathers. The religion of <persName>Jesus Christ</persName> had been
	  <lb/>becoming more and more corrupt for several
	  <lb/>centuries, till the <orgName>Roman Catholic church</orgName> had
	  <lb/>so long taught <quote>for doctrines, the command­
	    <lb/>ments of men,</quote> that in the religion of <placeName>Europe</placeName>,
	  <lb/>as it then existed, it was almost impossible to
	  <lb/>recognize the religion of the Bible. The <emph>priest­
	    <lb/>hood</emph>, who, as ambassadors of Christ, ought to
	  <lb/>have imitated his holiness, meekness, and be­
	  <lb/>nevolence, had become distinguished for their
	  <lb/>immorality, ambition, fraud, avarice and cruelty.</p>

          <said>No; these evils were neither un­
	  <lb/>seen nor unfelt by the truly pious and most
	  <lb/>enlightened part of the community. But so
	  <lb/>completely was the reign of superstition and
	  <lb/>religious tyranny established throughout the
	  <lb/>land, that the majority saw as though they <emph>saw
	    <lb/>not</emph>, and felt as though they <emph>felt not</emph>. When
	  <lb/>they beheld the profligacy of the clergy—the
	  <lb/>base measures used by them to extort money
	  <lb/>from the people—their crimes and oppressions
	  <lb/>and impositions on the credulous multitude, they
	  <lb/>secretly indulged the most sovereign contempt
	    <lb/>for the <name>Roman See</name>; and had the evils they
	  <lb/>deplored been less deeply rooted and less in
	  <lb/>magnitude, they would have hoped for and at­
	  <lb/>tempted change.</said>
        </p>
        <said>
          <p>As things were, they became discouraged,
	  <lb/>depressed; feeling, unless the <emph>Lord's</emph> arm was
	  <lb/>outstretched for the rescue of his people, vain
	  <lb/>was the help of man;—and strong cries and
	  <lb/>prayers arose to the Lord of Hosts, for help;—
	  <lb/>that he would arise and stay the desolating
	  <lb/>waters which threatened totally to submerge the
	  <lb/>purity of the religion of their Lord <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>

	  <lb/><persName>Wickliffe</persName>, <persName>Huss</persName>, and <persName>Jerome</persName>, were of that num­

	  <lb/>determined attack of a <name>Luther</name> were needed,
	  <lb/>before the fabric tottered. Few had dared to
	  <lb/>lift their voices loud as yet, for the tortures of

		  <lb/>her noble, ancient architecture—her temples—
		  <lb/>her sculpture――her genius and taste; and
		  <lb/>though I expected to discover little comparatively,
		  <lb/>of old <placeName>Rome</placeName>, yet the bare view of the place
		  <lb/>where old <placeName>Rome</placeName> <emph>stood</emph> and her few noble re­
		  <lb/>mains I fancied would be sufficient to assist my
		  <lb/>imagination in portraying the rest. As for her
		  <lb/>religion, Popery, though I knew some of its
		  <lb/>superstitions, I knew comparatively little, and
		  <lb/>intended to lose no time in noticing its ridicu­
		  <lb/>lous ceremonies, but to devote myself to search­
		  <lb/>ing out her antiquities. But my first impres­
		  <lb/>sions were such, that I soon found myself
		  <lb/>regarding the Romish worship with particular
		  <lb/>scrutiny.</p><p>I found Popery, as it is exercised in <placeName>Italy</placeName>, so
		  <lb/>nearly resembling the Paganism of old <placeName>Rome</placeName>,
		  <lb/>that, while witnessing her religious ceremonies,

		  <lb/>fancying myself the spectator of some solemn act
		  <lb/>of ancient idolatry, rather than witnessing an
		  <lb/>act of religious worship under the title of Chris­
		  <lb/>tianity. The first time I entered a church
		  <lb/>here, the smoke and smell of incense streaming

          <p>Do these texts prompt the belief

          <p>The apostles treated him at all times as an

          <p>We should rather be inclined to assign the

        <said>
          <p>Most incline to the opinion that
 this infalli­
	  <lb/>bility must be restrained to the public authorita­
	  <lb/>tive decisions of the Pope, <quote>when he proposes
	    <lb/>and determines articles of faith—decides con­
	    <lb/>troversies, and adjudges what is to be believed
	    <lb/>and practised by the whole church as necessary
	    <lb/>to salvation.</quote> Most glaring arguments against
	  <lb/>the infallibility of the Roman pontiff meet the
	  <lb/>eye on the very threshold of investigation. In
	  <lb/>the first place, the earliest Popes for several cen­
	  <lb/>turies, disclaimed all pretensions to infallibility.
	  <lb/>Several of the Roman pontiffs have been vile,
	  <lb/>profligate wretches—the history of their lives is

	  <lb/>which <name>Papists</name> rest for support in this doctrine,

	  <lb/>for want of time, and because I hope we, who

	  <lb/>of the gospel in this Christian land, shall never
	  <lb/>so far forsake the law and the testimony which

	  <lb/>selves, as to embrace doctrines so absurd, and
	  <lb/>so unsuited to the humility of the low estate
	  <lb/>into which sin has reduced us, as these. But

	  <lb/>Another affirms, <quote>all the authority which the

		    <lb/>letter last evening, and most cheerfully devote

		    <lb/>the wish you expressed to be more particularly
		    <lb/>informed of some of the religious ceremonies of

		    <lb/>churches and noticing <emph>particularly</emph> every thing
		    <lb/>connected with Romish worship which caught
		    <lb/>my eye. Some of the numerous paintings which
		    <lb/>adorn the altars I examined—they were very
		    <pb n="45"/>
		    <milestone unit="sig" n="4(3)r"/>
		    <mw type="pageNum">45</mw>
		    <lb/>beautiful; indeed I never saw any, that could
		    <lb/>compare with them for beauty of execution. I
		    <lb/>became less surprised, as I gazed at them with
		    <lb/>admiration myself, at the reverence, solemnity
		    <lb/>and enthusiastic admiration with which they
		    <lb/>inspired those who had received from nature an
		    <lb/>eye to observe, and a heart to feel keenly the
		    <lb/>beauties of this art—especially when I consider­
		    <lb/>ed the ignorance and superstition of Papal
		    <lb/>worship which had shrouded them from infancy,
		    <lb/>and led them to mistake these natural sensibil­
		    <lb/>ities of a discriminating taste for true devotion and
		    <lb/>holy love to the being whom they represented.</p><p>The pomp and glory of the worship of this
		    <lb/>church is wonderfully calculated to awe and
		    <lb/>amuse the minds of a superstitious people. The
		    <lb/>costly paintings—the images of saints, enriched
		    <lb/>with gold and pearl—the costly habits of the
		    <lb/>officiating priests—the choice vocal and instru­
		    <lb/>mental music—the public processions and pa­
		    <lb/>rades—in short, every thing combines, by its
		    <lb/>magnificence, to win the attention and confi­
		    <lb/>dence of an unthinking people.</p><p>But I am more and more astonished at the
		    <lb/>gross frauds, practised in connection with sup­
		    <lb/>posed relics, and the credulity of people in
		    <lb/>regard to them. Among other relics which
		    <lb/>they pretend to show here, are <emph>the heads of <persName>St.
		      <lb/>Peter</persName> and <persName>St. Paul</persName></emph>, encased in silver busts,

		  <lb/>Christ, became converted and afterwards left
		  <lb/><placeName>Judea</placeName> for <placeName>Mantua</placeName>, carrying with him this phial
		  <lb/>of blood; he buried the sacred relic, and was so
		  <lb/>thoughtful as to enclose it in an envelope, stating
		  <lb/>all these facts. It is very remarkable that the

		  <lb/>should be perfectly fresh as it was when found,
		  <lb/>after lying in the ground sixteen centuries!!!</p>

            <quote>A certain friar had preached a sermon
	    <lb/>during lent, upon the state of the man mentioned
	    <lb/>in Scripture possessed with seven devils, with so
	    <lb/>much eloquence and unction, that a simple coun­
	    <lb/>tryman who heard him, went home, and be­
	    <lb/>came convinced that these seven devils had got
	    <lb/>possession of him. The idea haunted his mind,
	    <lb/>and subjected him to the most dreadful terrors,

	    <lb/>sel. The father, who had some smattering of
	    <lb/>science, bethought himself at last of a way to
	    <lb/>rid the honest man of his devils. He told him
	    <lb/>it would be necessary to combat with the devils
	    <lb/>singly; and on the day appointed, when the
	    <lb/>poor man came with a sum of money to serve
	    <lb/>as a bait for the devil—without which, the good
	    <lb/>father had forewarned him no devil could be
	    <lb/>dislodged—he bound a chain, connected with
	    <lb/>an electrical machine in an adjoining chamber,
	    <lb/>round his body, lest, as he said, the devil should
	    <lb/>fly away with him—and having warned him that
	    <lb/>the shock would be terrible when the devil went
	    <lb/>out of him, he left him praying devoutly before
	    <lb/>an image of the <name>Madonna</name>, and after some time
	    <lb/>gave him a pretty smart shock, at which the
	    <lb/>poor wretch fell insensible on the floor from
	    <lb/>terror. As soon, however, as he recovered, he
	    <lb/>protested that he had seen the devil fly away out
	    <lb/>of his mouth, breathing blue flames and sulphur,
	    <lb/>and that he felt himself greatly relieved. Seven
	    <lb/>electrical shocks, at due intervals, having ex­
	    <lb/>tracted seven sums of money from him, together
	    <lb/>with the seven devils, the man was cured, and

		  <lb/>brother, that this letter has lain untouched sev­
		  <lb/>eral days. I have been so completely engaged
		  <lb/>in the continued round of ceremonies, which
		  <lb/>engross the hearts and time of this people during
		  <lb/>the <soCalled rend="pre(‘)post(’)">holy week</soCalled> as to leave me no leisure to
		  <lb/>finish the accounts I have already begun.
		  <lb/><placeName>Rome</placeName> is filled with pilgrims, and all the churches
		  <lb/>with worshippers—devout ones—save here and
		  <lb/>there a heretic, whose curiosity, like mine, has
		  <lb/>led him to mingle with the crowd, and follow
		  <lb/>the footsteps of the multitude through the end­
		  <lb/>less absurdities, which tread hard on the heels of
		  <lb/>each other.</p>
                    <p>Processions of penitents are seen silently
		  <lb/>winding their way along the streets, clothed in
		  <lb/>long dark robes, preceded by a black cross, and
		  <lb/>bearing in their hands skulls, and bones, and
		  <lb/>contribution-boxes for souls in purgatory.</p>
                    <p>A most superb procession took place on the
		  <lb/>morning of the festa of the annunciation, which
		  <lb/>I, with thousands of others, ran to see.</p>
                    <p>The Pope, riding on a white mule, (I sup­
		  <lb/>pose to imitate our Saviour's entry at <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>,)
		  <lb/>came attended by his horse-guards who rode
		  <lb/>before to clear the way, mounted on prancing
		  <lb/>black horses and accompanied by such a flourish
		  <lb/>of trumpets and kettle-drums as to wear far
		  <lb/>more of the appearance of a martial parade than
		  <lb/>of a religious proceeding. All were dressed in
		  <lb/>splendid full uniform, and in every cap waved a
		  <lb/>myrtle sprig, the sign of rejoicing. The car­
		  <lb/>dinals followed; and the rear was brought up
		  <pb n="72"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="6(4)v"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum">72</mw>
		  <lb/>by a bare-headed priest on a mule, with the host
		  <lb/>in a golden cup, the sight of which operated
		  <lb/>like a talisman on every soul around me, (for
		  <lb/>every knee bent,) save here and there one, who
		  <lb/>like myself stood heretically amid the kneeling
		  <lb/>mass, looking about panic-struck at this magic-
		  <lb/>like movement.</p>
                    <p>The Pope himself was clothed in robes of
		  <lb/>white and silver, and as he passed along the
		  <lb/>crowds of gazing people that lined the streets and
		  <lb/>filled the windows, he forgot not incessantly to
		  <lb/>repeat his benediction—a twirl of three fingers,
		  <lb/>typical of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,—
		  <lb/>the little finger representing the latter.</p>
                    <p>Many tiresome ceremonies followed his
		  <lb/>entry into the church. He was seated on his
		  <lb/>throne; all the cardinals successively approach­
		  <lb/>ed—kissed his hand—retired a step or two—
		  <lb/>gave three low nods—one to him in front, as
		  <lb/>personifying God, the Father, one to the right,
		  <lb/>intended for the Son; and one to the left for the
		  <lb/>Holy Ghost.</p>
                    <p>I am sure, my dear brother, as this ceremo­
		  <lb/>ny passed, the blood curdled in my veins—I was
		  <lb/>transfixed to the spot. I saw not what passed
		  <lb/>without me, but this text of holy writ stood like
		  <lb/>letters of fire, glaring upon me from within.—</p>
                    <p>
                      <quote rend="pre(‘)post(’)">Who, <emph>as God</emph>, sitteth in the temple of God,
		    <lb/><emph>showing himself that he is God.</emph></quote>
                    </p>
                    <p>When the first shock of this blasphemy had
		  <lb/>passed away, the inferior priests were bowing,
		  <lb/>each in their turn, and in adoring attitude <emph>kis­

		    <lb/>sing the toe</emph>, as it is called, which is in fact, the
		  <lb/>embroidered cross on the shoe of this lord of
		  <lb/>lords. High mass then began; during the ele­
		  <lb/>vation of the host, the Pope knelt before the
		  <lb/>high altar and in silence prayed—then followed
		  <lb/>an infinitude of gettings up and sittings down—
		  <lb/>of sayings and dead pauses, which I am sure
		  <lb/>those around me did not half comprehend; and
		  <lb/>of which I could—<emph>nothing</emph>.</p>
                    <p>A lighted taper was then brought, (though
		  <lb/>it was broad daylight,) and held for the Pope,
		  <lb/>while he read something, I know not what,
		  <lb/>from a great volume before him, and after sev­
		  <lb/>eral other ceremonies as comprehensible and
		  <lb/>edifying as those I have named, he rose and
		  <lb/>retired, twirling his benediction all the way
		  <lb/>out, as he twirled it all the way in. After
		  <lb/>this, I had little running to do, till <name>palm Sun­
		  <lb/>day</name> came. You know I am far-famed as a
		  <lb/>punctual man—and a full hour I had been seat­
		  <lb/>ed in the gaze of expectation, waiting the Pope's
		  <lb/>appearance in the chapel, when he came. He
		  <lb/>was clothed this time in scarlet and gold, and a
		  <lb/>most sumptuous figure he made. The cardinals
		  <lb/>were dressed in their mourning robes, of a violet
		  <lb/>color, richly trimmed with antique lace, with
		  <lb/>mantles of ermine and scarlet trains—but these
		  <lb/>were soon changed for garments of gold. The
		  <lb/>same round of ceremonies toward the Pope was
		  <lb/>performed as I related on the festa of the annun­
		  <lb/>ciation. Two palm branches received the Pope's
		  <lb/>benediction, after having passed through a cloud
		  <pb n="74"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="6(5)v"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum">74</mw>
		  <lb/>of incense. Smaller ones, artificial, composed
		  <lb/>of plaited straw or dried reed-leaves, to which
		  <lb/>crosses were appended, were presented to
		  <lb/>each cardinal, archbishop, and to all the infe­
		  <lb/>rior orders of the clergy, to the deacons, canons,
		  <lb/>choristers, cardinals' trainbearers, &amp;c. as they
		  <lb/>individually descended the steps of the throne
		  <lb/>after performing the ceremonious routine I have
		  <lb/>mentioned before. The procession then began to
		  <lb/>move off, two and two, beginning with the
		  <lb/>lowest clerical rank, and at last the Pope him­
		  <lb/>self in his chair of state, under a crimson canopy
		  <lb/>and borne on the shoulders of four men. Great
		  <lb/>pomp and splendor marked this parade. The
		  <lb/>crowns and mitres of the bishops and patriarchs,
		  <lb/>white and crimson, glittering with jewels, and
		  <lb/>set with precious stones—their long, rich dres­
		  <lb/>ses—the slow and uniform march of the pro­
		  <lb/>cession, and the gay crowds surrounding, pre­
		  <lb/>sented quite an imposing appearance. The pro­
		  <lb/>cession issued forth into the hall in the rear of
		  <lb/>the chapel, and marching round it, entered
		  <lb/>again and seated themselves as before. A mul­
		  <lb/>titude of tedious services then followed—with
		  <lb/>frequent kneelings—the tinkling of bells, dres­
		  <lb/>sings, undressings, &amp;c.; then the cardinals all
		  <lb/>embraced each other, gave the kiss of peace,
		  <lb/>and the scene closed.</p>
                    <p>The next service I attended was three days
		  <lb/>after on Wednesday in the same chapel at half
		  <lb/>past four, P.M. The house was filled to over­
		  <lb/>flowing. I had a conspicuous place, and could
		  <pb n="75"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="6(6)r"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum">75</mw>
		  <lb/>distinctly see all that passed, and amused my­
		  <lb/>self through a long and tedious chant with
		  <lb/>my own reflections on the varied scene before
		  <lb/>me. My attention was then arrested by a row
		  <lb/>of <emph>mourning candles</emph>, fifteen in number, all light­
		  <lb/>ed, though still broad day; the central one over­
		  <lb/>topped the others, they retreating in size each
		  <lb/>way. I learned the <emph>tall</emph> mourning candle was
		  <lb/>the virgin <persName>Mary</persName>; the nearest each side, like
		  <lb/>maids of honor, were the two <persName>Marys</persName>, and all the 
		  <lb/>rest apostles. As the services proceeded, the 
		  <lb/>candles, one by one, were extinguished, a typi­
		  <lb/>cal representation of the falling off of the apos­
		  <lb/>tles in the hour of trial. The virgin was at last
		  <lb/>left alone in the midst, and she at length was
		  <lb/>set under the altar. As it grew dark, only light
		  <lb/>enough was allowed to make the darkness visi­
		  <lb/><choice><sic>i</sic><corr/></choice>ble—to give a sombre, chilling melancholy to
		  <lb/>the whole aspect of things. Strains of music
		  <lb/>then commenced of such unearthly pathos
		  <lb/>as never before fell on my ear. I will not
		  <lb/>attempt to describe it; for a time, I seemed
		  <lb/>to forget where or what I was, so deeply was
		  <lb/>every faculty of my soul absorbed in the plain­
		  <lb/>tive, heart-stirring swellings that rose, and then
		  <lb/>melted away among the suppressed breathings
		  <lb/>of awe-stricken listeners. The lady who sat
		  <lb/>next me heard till nature fainted—and many on
		  <lb/>my right and left listened till too deeply agitated
		  <lb/>to suppress the keenness of their emotion.</p>
                    <p><term>Holy Thursday</term>, the succeeding day, was the
		  <lb/>interment of Christ; nearly the same ceremo­
		  <pb n="76"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="6(6)v"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum">76</mw>
		  <lb/>nies were performed as I have already related,
		  <lb/>with the addition of the deposit of the host by
		  <lb/>the Pope in the sepulchre beneath the altar, at
		  <lb/>the close of the procession.</p>
                    <p>Then came the washing of feet, in imitation
		  <lb/>of our Saviour's washing the disciple's feet. This
		  <lb/>was performed by the Pope himself, officiating in
		  <lb/>a long white linen robe, and wearing a bishop's
		  <lb/>mitre.</p>
                    <p>A silver bucket of water was presented to
		  <lb/>him by an attending cardinal. The Pope knelt
		  <lb/>before the first of the pilgrim-priests, immersed
		  <lb/>one foot in water, then touched it with a fringed
		  <lb/>towel—kissed the leg, and gave the cloth and a
		  <lb/>sort of white flower or feather to the man—then
		  <lb/>went on to the next. The whole ceremony
		  <lb/>occupied by a few moments; the Pope then
		  <lb/>returned to the throne, changed his dress for the
		  <lb/>robes of white and silver, and proceeded to the
		  <lb/>next service. The twelve priests seated them­
		  <lb/>selves at a table, loaded with various dishes and
		  <lb/>flowers; and the Pope, after pronouncing a
		  <lb/>blessing, handed to each from a side-table, bread,
		  <lb/>plates, and cups of wine, which each rose to
		  <lb/>receive from his highness' hand; a few forms
		  <lb/>having passed, he gave a parting benediction
		  <lb/>and withdrew.</p>

		  <lb/>Curiosity led me, a short time since, to witness
		  <lb/>the holy rite of baptism, performed on a young
		  <lb/>lady in the family of <persName>Mr. R.</persName> with whom I am on
		  <lb/>terms of considerable intimacy. The ordi­
		  <lb/>nance of baptism, as administered in a Romish
		  <lb/>church, is so encumbered with ceremonies, that it
		  <lb/>can be scarcely recognized as the simple seal of
		  <lb/>the gospel-covenant. There are the forms observ­
		  <lb/>ed before coming to the font—those at the font—
		  <lb/>and those which follow the administration of
		  <lb/>the ordinance. A long series of catechetical in­
		  <lb/>struction precedes the rite itself, succeeded by
		  <lb/><emph>exorcism</emph>—which is using <gloss rend="pre(‘)post(’)">words of sacred
		    <lb/>and religious import, and of prayers, to expel
		    <lb/>the devil, and to weaken and crush his pow­
		    <lb/>er.</gloss> Salt is put into the mouth—the sign
		  <lb/>of the cross is made with the holy oil upon
		  <lb/>the forehead, eyes, ears, breast and shoulders—

		  <lb/>the nostrils and ears are touched with spittle—
		  <lb/>the crown of the head is anointed with chrism,
		  <lb/>after the performance of the baptismal ceremo­
		  <lb/>ny—a white garment is given, and a wax taper,
		  <lb/>burning, is put into the hand. All these various
		  <lb/>rites are typical of the several effects which the
		  <lb/>sacred ordinance is said to confer; viz. <quote rend="pre(‘)post(’)">To
		    <lb/>remit original sin, and actual guilt, however
		    <lb/>enormous—to remit all the punishment due to
		    <lb/>sin—to bestow invaluable privileges, such as
		    <lb/>justification and adoption—to produce abun­
		    <lb/>dance of virtues—to unite the soul to Christ—
		    <lb/>and to open the portals of heaven.</quote></p>
                    <p>Such are the unwarranted, efficacious virtues
		  <lb/>which the Romish church have ventured to
		  <lb/>ascribe to this simple ordinance, which the Bible
		  <lb/>recognizes only as the visible sign of an inward
		  <lb/>union, and which <emph>of itself</emph> and <emph>in itself</emph> confers
		  <lb/>no grace.</p>
                    <p>I suppose you are aware that the <name>Roman
		  <lb/>Catholics</name> make seven sacraments, whereas we
		  <lb/>have but two. Their order is this: baptism,
		  <lb/>confirmation, eucharist, penance, extreme unc­
		  <lb/>tion, orders, and matrimony. I intend to say
		  <lb/>somewhat on each of these points before I
		  <lb/>close this letter, but will first take you with
		  <lb/>me to see the young lady, of whom I have
		  <lb/>been speaking, pass through the ceremony of
		  <lb/>taking the veil!! <persName>Miss Celia R.</persName> is a beautiful

		  <lb/>ing this, his dearest earthly treasure, to his
		  <lb/>brother's care. <persName>Mr. R.</persName> is a native Italian, and
		  <lb/>staunch in his Romish belief—though his lady,
		  <lb/>I suspect, submits with great repugnance to an
		  <lb/>observance of this indispensable mummeries of her
		  <lb/>husband's faith. <persName>Miss R.</persName> came to <placeName>Italy</placeName>, over­
		  <lb/>whelmed with the sense of melancholy and lone­
		  <lb/>liness, which her father's death and her present
		  <lb/>state of orphanage, (though independent in point
		  <lb/>of fortune,) has occasioned; her sadness was
		  <lb/>not at all lessened by the change of customs, of
		  <lb/>scenes and companions, which her removal
		  <lb/>from the land of her nativity and the associations
		  <lb/>of early youth has produced. She has yielded
		  <lb/>a listening ear to the counsels and persuasions
		  <lb/>of the friends she has acquired since her arrival,
		  <lb/>and with firm faith in the represented advan­
		  <lb/>tages and pleasures of the life of a <emph>nun</emph>, she has
		  <lb/>this morning taken upon herself all the solemn,
		  <lb/>unwarranted and irrevocable vows of monastic
		  <lb/>life!</p>
                    <p>Poor girl! in the depth of her present sorrow,
		  <lb/>the world seems dark and cheerless; she knows
		  <lb/>not that youth, in its elasticity, <emph>bends</emph> only beneath
		  <lb/>the weight of sorrow, to rise again when the
		  <lb/>fury of the storm is past, and look out upon the
		  <lb/>charm of social life, with all its wonted fresh­
		  <lb/>ness and delight. Her visions of futurity are
		  <lb/>now clothed in the sombre shadows which her
		  <lb/>spirit wears; she dreams not, that the bright
		  <lb/>sun of youth and hope, though enveloped now,
		  <lb/>will soon emerge cloudless, and free, and brilliant
		  <pb n="83"/>

		  <lb/>as it was before. She thinks her sadness is re­
		  <lb/>ligion; her voluntary renunciation of all earth
		  <lb/>offers, an offering acceptable in the eyes of
		  <lb/>Him, who disdains every sacrifice but that of a
		  <lb/>broken and contrite heart for <emph>sin</emph>; and she seeks
		  <lb/>the comfort which is found only in repentance
		  <lb/>and faith in the merits of her Saviour, in the
		  <lb/>cold, dull, monotonous round of duties she her­
		  <lb/>self imposes, and the costly sacrifice of what her
		  <lb/>heavenly Father never required her to forego.</p>
                    <p>But enough of this—though I am in quite a 
		  <lb/>moralizing mood, and heartily sick of cold ex­
		  <lb/>ternals, warmed by no life-throb—of a religion
		  <lb/>all <emph>body</emph> and no <emph>soul</emph>.
		  <lb/>It was a most delightful morning—one of
		  <lb/><placeName>Italy's</placeName> brightest days—and one who has never
		  <lb/>roamed abroad amid all the beauties of Italic
		  <lb/>scenery, and the soothing mildness and fra­
		  <lb/>grance of her atmosphere, can scarcely conceive
		  <lb/>how delightful her bright days are; and I
		  <lb/>thought, as I bent my steps at an early hour to
		  <lb/>the chapel in the convent of <persName>St. Sylvestro</persName>, that
		  <lb/>when the young lady came to look for the last
		  <lb/>time upon the beauties and pleasures she was
		  <lb/>about to renounce, for the cold, cheerless im­
		  <lb/>prisonment of this living-tomb, her heart must
		  <lb/>misgive her, and her soul recoil from the rash,
		  <lb/>fatal vow――and I <emph>hoped</emph> it would be so; for
		  <lb/>I knew she had voluntarily, unadvised by her
		  <lb/>uncle or aunt, and strongly opposed by the lat­
		  <lb/>ter, formed this inconsiderate resolution, and
		  <lb/>chosen this living-death. But she came at last,
		  <pb n="84"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="7(4)v"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum">84</mw>
		  <lb/>and two footmen, in splendid liveries, made way
		  <lb/>for her entrance. She was in full dress,  sparkling
		  <lb/>in brilliants, her dark hair blazing in diamonds,
		  <lb/>her cheeks unblanched—rather deepened by the
		  <lb/>excitement of the moment, and I think I never saw
		  <lb/>her more beautiful. She pressed forward amid
		  <lb/>the gazing crowd with a firm, though gentle
		  <lb/>step, while the fixed purpose of her soul beamed
		  <lb/>full in her eye; the path-way and altar were
		  <lb/>strewed with flowers—the public applauding—
		  <lb/>strangers admiring—cardinals blessing—priests
		  <lb/>flattering—friends weeping—nuns chanting—
		  <lb/>and <emph>I</emph>, inwardly execrating a practice unauthor­
		  <lb/>ized by the Bible, uncommanded by <persName>Jehovah</persName>,
		  <lb/>yet encouraged and insisted upon by those, who
		  <lb/>unworthily call themselves the messengers of
		  <lb/>the will of the Highest.</p>
                    <p>The ceremonies commenced. You can
		  <lb/>scarcely imagine the indignation that by this
		  <lb/>time boiled within me, as I listened to the dis­
		  <lb/>course pronounced from the pulpit by an old,
		  <lb/>fat Dominican monk, who poured forth such a
		  <lb/>volume of rhapsody—with not a particle of sober
		  <lb/>reason or religion in it; or anything, except
		  <lb/>what was calculated to inflame an inexperi­
		  <lb/>enced imagination; calling her <quote rend="pre(‘)post(’)">the affianced
		    <lb/>spouse of Christ,</quote> a <quote rend="pre(‘)post(’)">saint on earth,</quote>
<quote rend="pre(‘)post(’)">one who

		  <lb/>you, my brother, with all <emph>your fire</emph>, would not
		  <lb/>have staid to hear.</p>
                    <p>The sermon closed, and at the altar the beau­

		  <lb/>tiful victim knelt—and on it laid her youth and
		  <lb/>beauty, wealth—the pleasures and refinements
		  <lb/>of life, the delights of friendship, the charms of
		  <lb/>nature and of freedom—every thing—all that
		  <lb/>nature <emph>has</emph> to give, she gave; she sacrificed them
		  <lb/><emph>all</emph> on the shrine before her, and pronounced
		  <lb/>those vows, which severed her from them for­
		  <lb/>ever.</p>
                    <p>As the chant of her fatal vow died away in
		  <lb/>melting recitative, every eye was moistened, as
		  <lb/>far as my vision reached, save hers for whom
		  <lb/>they wept.</p>
                    <p>Her diamonds were then removed; and her
		  <lb/>long, dark tresses, in all their native polish and
		  <lb/>beauty, fell clustering about her shoulders—one
		  <lb/>lock of it was monopolized by the cardinal—
		  <lb/>then the grate opened, the choral voices of the
		  <lb/>black sisterhood chanted a strain of welcome, as
		  <lb/>she retired from the benediction of the cardinal
		  <lb/>and the embraces of her friends, within her fu­
		  <lb/>ture tomb. She renounced her name and
		  <lb/>adopted a new one—her beautiful garments
		  <lb/>were removed, and the plain, coarse dress of the
		  <lb/><rs type="properAdjective">Franciscan</rs> order was assumed; her ornaments
		  <lb/>were laid away forever, and nature's beautiful
		  <lb/>covering, that richly polished hair, was severed 
		  <lb/>by the sisters' fatal shears.</p>
                    <p>The white veil was thrown on, (which is a
		  <lb/>very different thing from what I had supposed,
		  <lb/>being simply <quote rend="pre(‘)post(’)">a piece of white linen, fixed on

		  <lb/>ate nun, the beautiful <persName>Celia R.</persName> appeared to view
		  <lb/>again, behind the open grate—not otherwise,
		  <lb/>for she and the world, (save seen through the
		  <lb/>bars of her life-prison,) were now parted for­
		  <lb/>ever. We all agreed the simple dress of the
		  <lb/>new nun had not at all abated from her beauty,
		  <lb/>for her bright eyes, and the lovely expression of
		  <lb/>her fair countenance had not departed with her
		  <lb/>brilliant attire. <emph>I</emph> thought her, indeed, even
		  <lb/>prettier than before.</p>
                    <p>She appeared calm and firm until the last,
		  <lb/>when nature <emph>would</emph> have its gush, and while
		  <lb/>receiving the praises, congratulations and sym­
		  <lb/>pathy of friends and acquaintance, in spite of
		  <lb/>her, her tears fell fast and free. We left her—
		  <lb/>the heroine of an hour.—But oh! how often in

		  <lb/>which she has doomed herself, will she sigh over

          <p>The Pope's supremacy was established, or

	  <lb/>mention of the seven sacraments is made by

	  <lb/>writers of the twelfth century. Transubstantia­
	  <lb/>tion had no footing before the seventh or eighth
	  <lb/>century. But all these, and various other doc­
	  <lb/>trines as absurd and false, established by tradi­
	  <lb/>tion and confirmed by use, awaited the genera­
	  <lb/>tions of the fourteenth century. How few in 
	  <lb/>the whole mass of population, as they crowded
	  <lb/>upon the stage of life, and adopted this or that
	  <lb/>article of belief, and yielded to this or that
	  <lb/>custom, would stop to inquire <emph>why</emph> is this, and
	  <lb/><emph>wherefore</emph> that.</p>
          <p>Ask, even in our own land of books, news­
	  <lb/>papers, and sources of information numberless,
	  <lb/>the mass of people, <emph>why</emph> is this usage? and <emph>how</emph>
	  <lb/>came this into practice? and half would give no

	  <lb/>it should be so now. So in the days before the
	  <lb/>Reformation. The religious knowledge of the
	  <lb/>people was drawn from public sentiment and
	  <lb/>prevailing customs, and their faith was pinned
	  <lb/>on the priest's sleeve. Unacquainted with the
	  <lb/>Bible, they were satisfied with the current opin­
	  <lb/>ions, and never thought of examining a subject
	  <lb/>in which they suspected no error.</p>
          <p>Here and there we find an inquisitive mind,

          <p>True, the personal character
 of the pontiffs
	  <lb/>who had immediately preceded the era of

	  <lb/>in the eyes of the well-informed part of the

	  <lb/>bowed devoutly to the See of <placeName>Rome</placeName>, while he
	  <lb/>retained little respect for the character of its
	  <lb/>occupants. He had been greatly shocked, as I
	  <lb/>mentioned last evening, by the luxury, licen­
	  <lb/>tiousness and debauchery of the Romish clergy
	  <lb/>on his visit to <placeName>Rome</placeName>. <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">He would not,</said> he
	  <lb/>often remarked, <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">for the value of a thousand
	    <lb/>florins, have missed the instruction afforded him
	    <lb/>by this journey.</said> The scenes he witnessed, con­
	  <lb/>tributed, more than any thing, to open his eyes
	  <lb/>to Papal delusion. His intimate acquaintance
	  <lb/>too with the little red morocco Latin Bible,

	  <lb/>utter inconsistences of Popish practices with

          <p>This change of views was gradual and almost

          <p>When
<persName>Leo Tenth</persName> was advanced to the Papal
	  <lb/>chair, he found the coffers of the church nearly
	  <lb/>emptied by the extravagant dissipation of his
	  <lb/>predecessors. To replenish them, he had re­
	  <lb/>course to the sale of indulgences, and <persName>Tetzel</persName>,
	  <lb/>among others, was an agent, (as we should say,)
	  <lb/>for one of the provinces.</p>
          <p>The <emph>ostensible</emph> motives, however, for the pre­
	  <lb/>sent collections, were the expense of carrying on
	  <lb/>the war against the infidels, and finishing, mag­
	  <lb/>nificently, the church of <persName>St. Peter</persName> at <placeName>Rome</placeName>; but
	  <lb/>the money raised was in fact appropriated to
	  <lb/>neither purpose.</p>
          <p>Had <persName>Tetzel</persName> possessed more prudence, and
	  <lb/>been less presumptuous and disgusting in his
	  <lb/>harangues, <persName>Luther</persName>, deeply absorbed in his soli­

	  <mw type="pageNum">124</mw>
	  <lb/>tary meditations and private studies, might not
	  <lb/>have been roused to active opposition.</p>
          <p>But he seemed in his zeal entirely to have
	  <lb/>forgotten himself, and ventured to go a length in
	  <lb/>extolling the efficacy of indulgences, which the
	  <lb/>darkest age would not have tolerated. He de­
	  <lb/>clared <quote>the purchasers of them had remission
	    <lb/>of all their sins, <emph>past</emph>, <emph>present</emph> and <emph>to come</emph>,
	    <lb/>however great their enormity.</quote></p>
          <p><quote>If any man,</quote> said he, <quote>purchase letters of
	    <lb/>indulgence, his soul may rest secure with respect
	    <lb/>to salvation. The souls confined in purgatory,
	    <lb/>for whose redemption indulgences are purchased,
	    <lb/>as soon as the money tinkles in the chest, <emph>in­
	      <lb/>stantly escape from the place of torment and
	      <lb/>ascend into heaven. For twelve pence, you may
	      <lb/>redeem the soul of your father out of purgatory</emph>,
	    <lb/>and are you so ungrateful that you will not
	    <lb/>rescue your parent from torment &amp;c.</quote> He
	  <lb/>even boasted, <quote>that he saved more souls from
	    <lb/>hell by indulgences, than the apostle <persName>Peter</persName> had
	    <lb/>converted to Christianity by his preaching!
	    <lb/>And that a red cross, elevated in the churches

	  <lb/>affected the minds of others as they did his;
	  <lb/>but none had the honesty or courage to come
	  <lb/>forward boldly, and check his impudence and
	  <lb/>profligacy.</p>
          <p><persName>Luther's</persName> first measure was to write to <persName>Albert</persName>,
	  <lb/>archbishop of <placeName>Magdeburg</placeName>, who employed <persName>Tetzel</persName>
	  <lb/>as his deputy, and who received half the profits;
	  <lb/>he expressed his fears of the evil results, which
	  <lb/>would arise from a continuation of the traffic, and
	  <lb/>entreated him to withdraw his license from <persName>Tet­
	  <lb/>zel</persName>—but the archbishop was too much interested
	  <lb/>in its success to listen to this. <persName>Tetzel</persName> had be­

	  <lb/>by the complaints of those to whom he had re­
	  <lb/>fused absolution, because they would not submit

	  <lb/>ness, he threatened <persName>Luther</persName>, and all who should
	  <lb/>call in question the efficacy of his commodities,
	  <lb/>with the inquisition, and even caused a pile to
	  <lb/>be erected for the burning of heretics. But
	  <lb/>these measures were little calculated on his part,
	  <lb/>to intimidate the bold <persName>Luther</persName>, or reconcile him
	  <lb/>to a traffic, which he found nowhere coun­
	  <lb/>tenanced in the Scriptures.</p>
          <p><persName>Luther</persName> began at length, in the pulpit, to point
	  <lb/>out the evils with which indulgences were at­
	  <lb/>tended. <quote>He exclaimed against the profane

	  <lb/>tered into a formal dispute with him concerning

        <p>
          <said><persName>Cajetan</persName> at length became enraged, and, assum­

          <said>He was
 astonished, as you may well
	  <lb/>suppose, at such an abrupt mention of a recanta­

	  <lb/>him that he was mistaken. He had flattered

	  <lb/>remove many imputations with which he had
	  <lb/>been loaded by the malice and ignorance of his
	  <lb/>antagonists—but the peremptory, irritated tone
	  <lb/>of this cardinal dashed in a moment all the hopes
	  <lb/>on this point which he had entertained. From
	  <lb/>all I can learn, <persName>Luther</persName> manifested the temper
	  <lb/>and spirit of a <name>Christian</name>. Fear of the future did
	  <lb/>not suffer his native intrepidity of mind at this
	  <lb/>time to desert him. Fully persuaded of the

	  <lb/>clared, <quote>that he could not, with a safe conscience,
	    <lb/>renounce opinions which he believed to be true;

          <said>Yes; and this decided, fearless man­
	  <lb/>ner did not arise from the momentary impulse of
	  <lb/>a rash, presumptuous temper, reckless of conse­
	  <lb/>quences, for in a letter addressed a short time
	  <lb/>previous to <persName>Staupitz</persName>, the superior of the Augustin­

	      <lb/>copy of the <quote><title>Defence of his Propositions</title> to the
	    <lb/>Pope, that the malicious insinuations of his ene­
	    <lb/>mies might be counteracted,</quote> we find the same
	  <lb/>intrepid spirit, connected with deep humility and
	  <lb/>a conciliatory temper. He says, <quote>I request you
	    <lb/>will send these trifles of mine to that most ex­
	    <lb/>cellent pontiff, <persName>Leo Tenth</persName>, that they may serve
	    <lb/>to plead my cause at <placeName>Rome</placeName>. Not that I wish
	    <lb/>you to be joined with me in danger; for it is my
	    <lb/>desire that these things be done at my own haz­
	    <lb/>ard. I expect that Christ, as Judge, will pro­
	    <lb/>nounce what is right by the mouth of the Pope.
	    <lb/>To those of my friends who would alarm me for
	    <lb/>the consequences, I have nothing else to say
	    <lb/>than what <persName>Reuchlin</persName> said, <quote>He who is poor, has

	    <lb/>no property, neither do I desire any. There

	    <lb/>tinual illness, and if they take away my life by
	    <lb/>open violence or stratagem, they make me but
	    <lb/>little poorer. I am satisfied with the possession
	    <lb/>of my Redeemer and Propitiator, the Lord <persName>Jesus

          <said>In father proof of the meek, conciliating

	  <lb/>during his interviews with <persName>Cajetan</persName>, he expressed
	  <lb/>great reverence for the Pope—offered to submit
	  <lb/>the dispute to certain Universities, and even
	  <lb/>promised to remain silent on the subject of
	  <lb/>indulgences, provided a similar injunction were
	  <lb/>given to his adversaries. But <persName>Cajetan</persName> was in­
	  <lb/>flexible; he still insisted on a recantation, and
	  <lb/><persName>Luther</persName>, calmly but firmly refusing to do violence
	  <lb/>to the dictates of his conscience, was command­
	  <lb/>ed to leave his presence and not to return unless

        <p>Two or three young ladies, as <persName>Mrs. Athearn</persName>
	  <lb/>paused here, raised their eyes from their work,
	  <lb/>and began to speak, all at once. One smiled,

	  <lb/>quishment of her intention to speak at present,
	  <lb/>and an invitation to her neighbour to make known
	  <lb/>her request. The eldest then turned to <persName>Mrs. Ath­

	    <lb/>clauses in her last remarks, referring to <persName>Luther's</persName>
	    <lb/>reverence for the Pope, and his expectation that

	  <milestone n="11(5)v" unit="sig"/>
	  <mw type="pageNum">134</mw>
	  <lb/>not poured into his mind, all at once; when he
	  <lb/>began to oppose <persName>Tetzel</persName>, the Reformation which
	  <lb/>he afterwards effected was far from his inten­
	  <lb/>tion—indeed, I doubt not with his views at that
	  <lb/>time, he would have trembled with horror at the
	  <lb/>thoughts of what he afterwards gloried in accom­
	  <lb/>plishing. It was by industry and meditation that
	  <lb/>he arrived at the clear and enlightened views
	  <lb/>which he eventually entertained. His examina­
	  <lb/>tion of one error in Popish doctrine led to the
	  <lb/>detection of another; and as he loosened one
	  <lb/>pillar in the mighty fabric of Popery, another
	  <lb/>tottered and another trembled, till, amazed, he
	  <lb/>found the whole structure defective. It is easy
	  <lb/>to follow the pathway of thought which he trav­
	  <lb/>elled; and it was an easy, natural task for the 
	  <lb/>clear vision and discriminating mind of a man
	  <lb/>like <persName>Martin Luther</persName>, as he turned to the right and
	  <lb/>left, to detect, in their successive course, the gross
	  <lb/>defects of such a corrupt system. Thus, when
	  <lb/>the extravagant tenets concerning indulgences
	  <lb/>arrested his investigating glance, he necessarily
	  <lb/>inquired into the <emph>true cause</emph> of our justification
	  <lb/>and acceptance with God—and here the radi­
	  <lb/>cally false notion of the Papist awaited him.
	  <lb/>The discovery of this pointed significantly to the
	  <lb/>utter uselessness of pilgrimages and penances to
	  <lb/>merit divine favor—to the vanity of a reliance on
	  <lb/>the intercessions of saints and the impiety of
	  <lb/>image-worship—the abuses of auricular confes­
	  <lb/>sion—and the absurd imaginary existence of
	  <lb/>purgatory. When he reached this height in
	  <pb n="135"/>
	  <milestone n="11(6)r" unit="sig"/>
	  <mw type="pageNum">135</mw>
	  <lb/>such a system of errors, how natural that he
	  <lb/>should pause here to call in question the divine
	  <lb/>original of Papal power—the base of the whole
	  <lb/>structure. When his mind became settled on
	  <lb/>this point, the mists of Papal infallibility and the
	  <lb/>decisions of any other human authority quickly
	  <lb/>vanished, and the clear, blazing light of the <emph>word
	    <lb/>of God</emph>, as the only standard of appeal in theolo­
	  <lb/>gical truth, stood forth in its glory. No mind but
	  <lb/>the Infinite can fully comprehend every thing at
	  <lb/>a glance; can take in cause and effect, with all
	  <lb/>their intermediate gradations, at once. Constitu­
	  <lb/>ted as we are, one object must be viewed at a
	  <lb/>time, and every obstacle must singly disappear at
	  <lb/>each successive step in knowledge. To this
	  <lb/>gradual progress, <persName>Luther</persName> owed his success. It
	  <lb/>was this slow, insensible dawning of light in the
	  <lb/>mind of the community that startled not the wa­
	  <lb/>riness of the Pope, nor roused the deep slum­
	  <lb/>bers of the church. One direct, violent attack,
	  <lb/>at the outset, on the authority of the church
	  <lb/>would have removed <persName>Luther</persName> at once from the
	  <lb/>scene, and extinguished the faint glimmerings of
	  <lb/>light which were kindling around him. But he
	  <lb/>was suffered silently to undermine the whole sys­

<persName>Mrs. Athearn</persName>,
<said rend="pre(“)">was
	    <lb/>an Englishman, who lived in the commencement
	    <lb/>of the fourteenth century; a man of fine talents
	    <lb/>and extraordinary learning. His acquirements
	    <lb/>attained for him the office of wardenship of <name>Can­
	    <lb/>terbury Hall</name>; but his discernment in detecting,
	    <lb/>and his boldness in openly and severely censur­
	    <lb/>ing some of the flagrant corruptions in the church,
	    <lb/>soon roused against him the indignation of the
	    <lb/>clergy, and procured his deposition by arch­
	    <lb/><persName>bishop Langham</persName>. <persName>Wickliffe</persName> appealed to the
	    <lb/>Pope; but the freedom with which he had
	    <lb/>attacked the monastic orders only confirmed the
	    <lb/>decision. His fame increased, and four years
	    <lb/>after his deposition, his sovereign presented to
	    <lb/>him the rectory of <placeName>Lutterworth</placeName> in <placeName>Leicester­
	    <lb/>shire</placeName>. He still declared his sentiments freely
	    <lb/>and boldly, undaunted by former persecution.
	    <lb/>He even hestitated not to affirm that the Pope
	    <mw rend="align(left)indent(4)" type="sig">12</mw>

	    <lb/>was only equal to a common priest—that <persName>Peter</persName>
	    <lb/>was not superior to the other apostles—that the
	    <lb/>church abounded in superstitions and idolatries,
	    <lb/>and that a reformation was absolutely necessary.
	    <lb/>He vindicated the right of the common people to
	    <lb/>read the Bible, and actually translated the Scrip­
	    <lb/>tures into the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> language, and promoted
	    <lb/>its circulation among them. These opinions
	    <lb/>and measures were not long suffered unmolested.
	    <lb/>He was cited in <date when="1377">1377</date>, by the exasperated Popish
	    <lb/>clergy, to appear at <placeName>London</placeName> before the archbishop
	    <lb/>of <placeName>Canterbury</placeName> and the bishop of <placeName>London</placeName>; but
	    <lb/>no formal examination of his doctrines took
	    <lb/>place, for no sooner had he presented himself
	    <lb/>before his judges, than some high words passing
	    <lb/>between the <persName>duke of <placeName>Lancaster</placeName></persName>, one of <persName>Wick­
	    <lb/>liffe's</persName> patrons, and the bishop, the meeting was
	    <lb/>dissolved, and <persName>Wickliffe</persName> was left to preach with
	    <lb/>his accustomed boldness, till the year following,
	    <lb/>when the duke having declined in power, <persName>Wick­
	    <lb/>liffe</persName> was summoned by the bishops a second
	    <lb/>time. He obeyed the citation—but, protected by
	    <lb/>several persons of authority, and countenanced
	    <lb/>by multitudes, his enemies dared not pass any
	    <lb/>sentence against him. The clergy however ex­
	    <lb/>erted themselves to the utmost to suppress his
	    <lb/>Translation of the Scriptures; but the more they
	    <lb/>strove to <emph>prevent</emph> its circulation, the more anxious
	    <lb/>and inquisitive to read it the people became, and
	    <lb/>the more rapidly it in reality extended. Those

	    <lb/>many by it shook off the delusions of spiritual
	    <lb/>tyranny, ran in the way of its commandments,
	    <lb/>and became heirs of a glorious immortality. He
	    <lb/>labored faithfully and zealously to a good old
	    <lb/>age, and, though he providentially escaped the
	    <lb/>cruelties of martyrdom which many, who fol­
	    <lb/>lowed him, suffered, he lived amid persecution
	    <lb/>and trial, finding truly, that through much tribu­
	    <lb/>lation the faithful enter the kingdom of heaven.
	    <lb/>He died at <placeName>Lutterworth</placeName>, of palsy, in <date when="1384">1384</date>, in the
	    <lb/>60th year of his age. His memory was not for­
	    <lb/>gotten by <name>Papists</name>, nor did the influence of the
	    <lb/>labors of his life cease after his death; indeed,
	    <lb/>my dear young ladies, could we now see with the

	  <lb/>During his second examination before the bishops,
	  <lb/>it is said he became somewhat intimidated, and
	  <lb/>was led to some qualifications of his sentiments,
	  <lb/>which his friends and himself, in other circumstan­
	  <lb/>ces, could not justify; but many foul aspersions
	  <lb/>have been cast upon him which are false. His
	  <lb/>knowledge of some of the doctrines of the gospel
	  <lb/>was, I doubt not, in a measure defective, but con­
	  <lb/>sidering the darkness of the age in which he lived,
	      <lb/>it is not wonderful that it should be so. <choice><sic>“</sic><corr/></choice>He held,

	    <lb/>tification is to be obtained solely through the
	    <lb/>righteousness of Christ. To those who imagined

	  <lb/>ceedings, he was confined in an unwholesome
	  <lb/>dungeon, continually harassed by the commis­
	  <lb/>sioners, who used every endeavor to oblige him
	  <lb/>to retract; but their arts were fruitless. He
	  <lb/>remained firm, but his health suffered, and he
	  <lb/>became dangerously ill; he was then removed
	  <lb/>to the fortress of <name>Gottleben</name>, but the rigor of his
	  <lb/>confinement was unabated. He remained deaf
	  <lb/>to all the solicitations used to induce him to
	  <lb/>recant, and persisted in demanding a public
	  <lb/>trial before the council. About this time, <persName>Jerome</persName>
	  <lb/>of <placeName>Prague</placeName> made his appearance at <placeName>Constance</placeName>.
	  <lb/>He was the strongly attached friend of <persName>Huss</persName>,
	  <lb/>and had been a strenuous co-worker with him in
	  <lb/>his efforts to effect a reformation in <placeName>Bohemia</placeName>.
	  <lb/>When <persName>Huss</persName> was cited to appear before the coun­
	  <lb/>cil of <placeName>Constance</placeName>, <persName>Jerome</persName> encouraged him by
	  <lb/>his counsel, and comforted him by his prayers
	  <lb/>and sympathy, and promised, should he be op­
	  <lb/>pressed, to follow and support him. True to
	  <lb/>his word and friendship, and regardless of his
	  <lb/>own safety, so deeply did he feel for the welfare
	  <lb/>of his afflicted friend, he came in this extremity

	  <mw type="pageNum">147</mw>
	  <lb/>to redeem his pledge. It seemed as if, like
	  <lb/><persName>David</persName> and <persName>Jonathan</persName>, the souls of <persName>Huss</persName> and
	  <lb/><persName>Jerome</persName> were knit together; and like them, in

          <said>Yes; but the latter fell a victim

	  <lb/>deportment throughout was characterized by
	  <lb/>integrity and candor, while that of his persecu­
	  <lb/>tors exhibited a striking picture of malignity
	  <lb/>and rage. He was strongly pressed to retract
	  <lb/>his errors, to own the justice of the accusations,
	  <lb/>and to submit to the decrees of the council.</said>
        </p>
        <p>
          <said>He calmly replied to their promises and
	  <lb/>threatenings, <quote>to abjure is to renounce an error
	    <lb/>that hath been held; but as in many of those
	    <lb/>articles, errors are laid to my charge which I

	    <lb/>oath? As to those articles which I own to be
	    <lb/>mine, I will renounce them with all my heart, if
	    <lb/>any man will teach me sounder doctrines.</quote> But
	  <lb/>a universal retraction was still insisted upon by
	  <lb/>the court—he, of course, remained inflexible,
	  <lb/>and after a tedious examination he was again
	  <lb/>remanded to prison and put in irons. As soon
	  <lb/>as he had departed, the emperor denounced him
	  <lb/><quote>a heretic, fit for the flames,</quote>—and before the

          <p>He was followed to the prison
 by a form of

	  <lb/>overcome his constancy, and every indignity
	  <lb/>heaped upon him, but all to no purpose. His
	  <lb/>books were collected and burnt—he was again
	  <lb/>brought before the council—accused—and con­
	  <lb/>demned—silenced when he attempted to answer
	  <lb/>his impeachment, and tauntingly upbraided,
	  <lb/>when despairing of all human succor, he knelt
	  <lb/>in his extremity before them, and lifting up his
	  <lb/>hands toward heaven he entreated his Saviour's
	  <lb/>blessing, and committed his cause to Him who
	  <lb/>could neither be corrupted by bribes, nor de­
	  <lb/>ceived by false witnesses. He was then insulted
	  <lb/>by being arrayed in priest's garments, and a
	  <lb/>paper coronet, on which were three painted
	  <lb/>devils and this inscription, <mentioned rend="slant(italic)">arch-heretic</mentioned>, they
	  <lb/>placed upon his head, saying <quote>We devote thy

          <p>He was led to the place of execution—the
	  <lb/>fire was kindled. Amid the crackling of com­

	  <lb/>to God—and these his last words were distinctly

          <p>Thus died <persName>John Huss</persName>; and long was the day

	  <lb/>of the anniversary of his martyrdom, from

          <said rend="pre(“)"><persName>Charles's</persName> first act of administration, as has

	    <mw type="pageNum">163</mw>
	    <lb/>at <placeName>Worms</placeName>, to take measure for the stay of the
	    <lb/>prevailing heretical opinions. The deliberations
	    <lb/>of the assembly were slow and formal. After
	    <lb/>attending to political regulations, the state of
	    <lb/>religion was taken into consideration. Now,
	    <lb/>had the views and policy of <persName>Charles</persName> extended no
	    <lb/>farther than his Germanic possessions, he might
	    <lb/>have been induced to favor a man, who, like <persName>Lu­
	    <lb/>ther</persName>, asserted so boldly the privileges and immu­
	    <lb/>nities for which the empire had struggled so
	    <lb/>long with the Popes. But, in order to counter­
	    <lb/>act the vast and ambitious schemes which
	    <lb/><persName>Francis First</persName> was designing against him, he
	    <lb/>was obliged to regulate his conduct by more ex­
	    <lb/>tensive views; it seemed necessary to retain the
	    <lb/>friendship of the Pope, and soothe him into a
	    <lb/>concurrence in his measures. In order to ac­
	    <lb/>complish this, he determined on treating <persName>Luther</persName>
	    <lb/>with the utmost severity, as the most effectual
	    <lb/>method of securing so important an ally as the
	    <lb/>Pope. He was prepared himself to gratify the
	    <lb/>Papal legates in <placeName>Germany</placeName>, by condemning <persName>Lu­
	    <lb/>ther</persName> without any formal trial or deliberation.
	    <lb/>But such an abrupt manner of proceeding was
	    <lb/>deemed by the members of the diet as unjustifi­
	    <lb/>able and unjust, and <persName>Luther</persName> was therefore sum­
	    <lb/>moned to appear, and declare publicly whether
	    <lb/>he adhered or not to those opinions which had
	    <lb/>procured him the censures of the church. <persName>Lu­

	    <lb/>ence, notwithstanding the urgent entreaties and
	    <lb/>solicitations of his friends, who, remembering the

        </p>
        <p>Here <persName>Mrs. Athearn</persName> requested on of the older

	  <lb/>of the Council of <placeName>Trent</placeName>, from the <name>Italian</name>, by
	  <lb/>Father <persName>Paul</persName>.</p>
        <p>It had belonged to her father, whose taste for
	  <lb/>antique works had led him to search out and
	  <lb/>collect in his various travels, numerous literary
	  <lb/>productions of other ages in different languages,
	  <lb/>which she now often found of immense value to
	  <lb/>her as books of reference.</p>
        <p>It was some time before the young lady re­
	  <lb/>turned with the desired volume; when she did,
	  <lb/>she made an apology for her absence, by saying
	  <lb/><said rend="pre(“)post(”)">it was so covered with dust, it was a long time

        <p><persName>Mrs. Athearn</persName> looked mildly but seriously at
	  <lb/><persName>Alice</persName>, to whose charge the care of dusting and
	  <lb/>keeping in order the books of the library was

	  <lb/>companions around, when she turned from <persName>Mrs.

        <p>
          <said rend="pre(“)post(”)">That it was of no use to brush up the old

	    <lb/>would not make them look bright and new.</said>
        </p>
        <p><persName>Mrs. Athearn</persName> said nothing; it was not neces­

	  <lb/>them back to the path of duty—<quote>it made them

	    <lb/>neglect.</quote></p>
        <p><persName>Mrs Athearn</persName> opened the book and read to
	  <lb/>the young ladies in <name>English</name>, an abstract of the
	  <lb/>edict issued by the emperor immediately after
	  <lb/><persName>Luther's</persName> departure. Its purport was this.</p>
        <p>He first stated it to be his duty and determi­
	  <lb/>nation to defend and nourish the interests of
	  <lb/>religion in his dominions, and to extinguish all
	  <lb/>heresies in their earliest stages. He stated that
	  <lb/><persName>Martin Luther</persName> had attempted to infect <placeName>Germany</placeName>
	  <lb/>with the contagion of his opinions, and that the
	  <lb/>nation was in imminent danger unless immediate
	  <lb/>remedies were applied—that the holy <persName>Pope Leo</persName>,
	  <lb/>after having exhorted that monk in a very
	  <lb/>fatherly manner, in vain, had been obliged, with
	  <lb/>the <name>Sacred College</name>, to condemn his writings
	  <lb/>and to declare him a heretic, unless within a
	  <lb/>certain prescribed period, he should revoke his
	  <lb/>opinions—of which sentence the apostolical
	  <lb/>nuncio had given him a copy, entreating him,
	  <lb/>(<persName>Charles</persName>,) as the true protector of the church,
	  <lb/>to publish it throughout the empire, and through
	  <lb/>the whole extent of his dominions. That, mean­
	  <lb/>while, <persName>Martin</persName>, instead of amending, or returning
	  <lb/>to his duty, was writing, from day to day, Latin
	  <lb/>and German books, filled with heresies, some of
	  <lb/>which he specified. Not one of his writings,
	  <lb/>continued the emperor, but is pestiferous—not
	  <lb/>one which contains not mortal poison—not a
	  <lb/>word even which is not <emph>pure poison</emph>.</p>

        <p>Therefore, wishing to follow the steps of the
	  <lb/>Roman emperors, his predecessors, after having
	  <lb/>conferred with the electors, the princes, and
	  <lb/>the States of the Empire, as also with his private
	  <lb/>council, composed of persons selected from all
	  <lb/>the nations under his domination—he had, with
	  <lb/>their advice and unanimous consent, to remove
	  <lb/>all causes of complaint and contest among those
	  <lb/>who affirmed that <persName>Luther</persName> ought to be heard in
	  <lb/>his own defence, before proceeding to the execu­
	  <lb/>tion of the Pope's bull—(although perhaps it
	  <lb/>was not suitable to hear a man, condemned by
	  <lb/>the Pope, obstinate in his wicked opinions and
	  <lb/>publicly known as a heretic—) he had, neverthe­
	  <lb/>less, cited him by one of his heralds—(not for
	  <lb/>the purpose of examining and judging matters of
	  <lb/>faith that was the Pope's province—) but to lead
	  <lb/>him if possible, into the right way, by weighty
	  <lb/>and salutary exhortations. In short, he related
	  <lb/>how <persName>Luther</persName> was introduced into the Assembly—
	  <lb/>upon what he had been interrogated—what he
	  <lb/>had answered, &amp;c. In conclusion he added,
	  <lb/>that on account of the obligations he was under
	  <lb/>to God, the duty he owed to the Pope, and the
	  <lb/>imperial dignity with which he was clothed, by
	  <lb/>the counsel and consent of the electors, of the
	  <lb/>States of the Empire, and in execution of the sen­
	  <lb/>tence of the Pope, he declared <persName>Martin Luther</persName> a
	  <lb/>notorious heretic, and commanded that he should
	  <lb/>be publicly viewed as such. He forbade all to re­
	  <lb/>ceive him, or protect him in any way. He ordered
	  <pb n="170"/>
	  <milestone n="14(5)v" unit="sig"/>
	  <mw type="pageNum">170</mw>
	  <lb/>all princes and States of the Empire, under the
	  <lb/>accustomed penalties, to seize and imprison
	  <lb/>him after the expiration of twenty-one days,
	  <lb/>and to pursue all his accomplices, and adhe­
	  <lb/>rents, depriving them of all their possessions,
	  <lb/>both personal goods and real estate. He for­
	  <lb/>bade also the reading or retaining any of his
	  <lb/>books—ordering princes and magistrates to burn
	  <lb/>and abolish them entirely. And inasmuch as in
	  <lb/>divers places, abridgments of his works were
	  <lb/>made and printed, he absolutely forbade them
	  <lb/>hereafter to be printed—commanding the mag­
	  <lb/>istrates to seize and burn them, punishing the
	  <lb/>printers and all those who sold, or those who
	  <lb/>bought them.</p>
        <p><persName>Mrs. Athearn</persName> laid the volume which she now
	  <lb/>closed on the table beside her, and devoted a few
	  <lb/>moments to the inspection of work, before she
	  <lb/>resumed the history. Considerable feeling was
	  <lb/>evidently awakened among the young ladies, in
	  <lb/>behalf of <persName>Luther</persName>, and several expressed great
	  <lb/>fears, not for him and his friends alone, but they
	  <lb/>trembled for the interests of the cause in which
	  <lb/>they were engaged.</p>
        <p>All rejoiced that <persName>Luther</persName> had been so kindly
	  <lb/>secreted from public vengeance by the elector
	  <lb/>of <placeName>Saxony</placeName>, and evidently longed to learn the

	    <lb/>from public observation and effort, proved rather
	    <lb/>an advantage than a hindrance to the progress
	    <lb/>of the cause. Public sympathy was enlisted for

	    <lb/>literary society in <placeName>Europe</placeName>, which condemned
	    <lb/>his opinions. The other was, the publication of

	    <lb/>cerning the Babylonish captivity. However,
	    <lb/>neither the authority of the university, nor the
	    <lb/>dignity of the monarch overawed him—he soon
	    <lb/>published his animadversions on both, in a style
	    <lb/>no less vehement and severe than he would have
	    <lb/>used in confuting his meanest antagonist. The
	    <lb/>eye of universal attention was now directed to a
	    <lb/>controversy, conducted by disputants so illus­
	    <lb/>trious; and so contagious was the spirit of inno­
	    <lb/>vation which the revival of learning in this age
	    <lb/>had roused throughout <placeName>Europe</placeName>, and so weighty
	    <lb/>was the evidence accompanying the doctrines of
	    <lb/>the Reformers, even on their first publication,
	    <lb/>that in spite of civil and ecclesiastical power
	    <lb/>united, they daily gained converts both in <placeName>France</placeName>

          <p>In reply to the nuncio, the diet stated the

	      <lb/>the glory of God and the good of souls.</quote> In the
	      <lb/>reply which the nuncio made to this suggestion,
	      <lb/>he said this proposition would not be displeasing
	      <lb/>to his highness, the Pope, if it were made in
	      <lb/>more civil and respectful terms. He advised
	      <lb/>the diet to amend every expression in it which
	      <lb/>might excite the Pope's displeasure; for in­
	      <lb/>stance, such as <quote rend="pre()post()slant(italic)">to convoke a council with the

	    <lb/>might seem that they wished to tie his highness'
	    <lb/>hands.</p>
          <p rend="pre(“)">Concerning various points on which the Pope
	    <lb/>had given instructions for the observance of the
	    <lb/>diet, he ordered, that no person should in future
	    <lb/>preach any doctrine which had not been exam­
	    <lb/>ined by the bishop; that all printers of the her­
	    <lb/>etical books in circulation, should be punished
	    <lb/>according to the late sentence—and that all the
	    <lb/>books should be burned.</p>
          <p rend="pre(“)">In short, the nuncio demanded the immedi­

	    <lb/>drew up a list of grievances, a hundred in num­

	  <mw type="pageNum">185</mw>
	  <lb/>the Pope's intention relative to a council, and
	  <lb/>in regard to the redress of their grievances.</p>
          <p>The nuncio endeavoured to elude any definite
	  <lb/>answer to the former inquiry; he made, how­
	  <lb/>ever, many general declarations of the Pope's
	  <lb/>resolution to pursue those measures which would
	  <lb/>insure the greatest good of the church. As to
	  <lb/>the latter, he stated, as <persName>Adrian's</persName> decease occur­
	  <lb/>red before the catalogue alluded to had reached
	  <lb/><placeName>Rome</placeName>, it had not, consequently, been laid before
	  <lb/>the present Pope; he therefore declined making
	  <lb/>any decisive answer, in the Pope's name.</p>
          <p>His embassy produced very little effect on the
	  <lb/>decisions of the diet; no additional severity
	  <lb/>against <persName>Luther</persName> and his party was enjoined, and
	  <lb/>the demand for a free council was warmly re­
	  <lb/>newed.</p>
          <p>The spirit of liberty which the new system
	  <lb/>diffused, induced many monks about this time
	  <lb/>to withdraw from the unnatural state of seclu­
	  <lb/>sion and inactive life, which they had adopted.</p>
          <p>Several nuns also effected their escape from

          <p>A spirit of controversy was roused and in­

	  <lb/>the Reformer and his opponents. Persecution,
	  <lb/>too, slaked her thirst for the moment in the

	  <lb/>All <placeName>Germany</placeName> seemed in commotion; diets were
	  <lb/>held year after year, and closed with little else
	  <lb/>than warm expressions of strong desire for the
	  <lb/>assembling of the long-proposed council. But
	  <lb/>this the Pope uniformly evaded and opposed,
	  <lb/>although its necessity daily increased. The
	  <lb/>emperor too, became anxious that the religious
	  <lb/>differences, which had so long agitated <placeName>Germa­

          <said>Very favorable to the Reformation.
	  <lb/>Not only individuals, but whole provinces abjur­
	  <lb/>ed their subjection to the court of <placeName>Rome</placeName>; they
	  <lb/>established the reformed worship in their terri­
	  <lb/>tories, and suppressed entirely the rites of the
	  <lb/>Romish church. In a short time, nearly one
	  <lb/>half of the Germanic body had revolted from
	  <lb/>the Papal see. <persName>Charles</persName> was alarmed; political
	  <lb/>motives, as well as strong attachment to the
	  <lb/>established religion, influenced a determination
	  <lb/>to employ his utmost zeal to suppress these new
	  <lb/>opinions. He therefore appointed another diet
	  <lb/>at <placeName>Spires</placeName> to take into consideration the state of
	  <lb/>religion. Strong hopes were now entertained
	  <lb/>by the <name>Roman Catholics</name>, that something effec­
	  <lb/>tual would be done to extinguish the spreading
	  <lb/>heresy. <persName>Luther</persName> too, and his adherents, looked
	  <lb/>forward to this meeting with great interest and
	  <lb/>strong hopes.</said>
        </p>
        <said>
          <p>The diet at length assembled on
 the <date when="1529-03-15">fifteenth
	  <lb/>of <name>March</name>, 1529</date>. For twelve years this contro­
	  <lb/>versy had been carried on; the minds of men

	  <lb/>greatly increased, and many were of high rank.
	  <lb/>It was soon perceived that any <emph>violent</emph> measures
	  <lb/>at this time would have brought fearful conse­
	  <lb/>quences. Prudence forbade any other present
	  <lb/>step than a strict injunction to those states of the
	  <lb/>empire, which had already obeyed the decree
	  <lb/>issued against <persName>Luther</persName>, at <placeName>Worms</placeName>, in the year
	  <lb/><date when="1524">1524</date>, to persevere in its observation; and to
	  <lb/>prohibit the other states from attempting any
	  <lb/>other innovations in religion, particularly from
	  <lb/>abolishing the mass, before the meeting of a
	  <lb/>general council. This decree occasioned much
	  <lb/>dispute; but it was at length approved by a ma­
	  <lb/>jority of voices.</p>
          <p>The elector of <placeName>Saxony</placeName>, and several other
	  <lb/>princes, together with the deputies of fourteen
	  <lb/>free cities, entered a solemn protest against this
	  <lb/>decree, as both unjust and impious. In conse­

	  <lb/>the <name>Protestants</name> at present, but to conciliate them,

	  <lb/>tants</name>, sought from the Pope the early appoint­
	  <lb/>ment of such an assembly; representing <emph>that</emph> as
	  <lb/>the only authority to which they would submit,
	  <lb/>and the only measure which could, in the pre­
	  <lb/>sent state of things, terminate their difficulties.
	  <lb/>The Pope was exceedingly displeased with
	  <lb/><persName>Charles'</persName> proceedings in regard to calling a
	  <lb/>council, and he strove to divert him from this
	  <lb/>purpose; when he found this vain, he reluctant­
	  <lb/>ly consented, but he employed every artifice to
	  <lb/>delay, hoping, by still farther manœuvres, even­
	  <lb/>tually to defeat it.</said>
        </p>
        <said>
          <p>The pontiff insisted that the
 council should
	  <lb/>meet in <placeName>Italy</placeName>—the <name>Protestants</name> demanded a
	  <lb/>council in <placeName>Germany</placeName>; they insisted that all their
	  <lb/>disputes should be settled by a reference to
	  <lb/>Scripture—the Pope, that the decrees of the
	  <lb/>church and the opinions of the fathers should
	  <lb/>decide the matter. The <name>Protestants</name> demanded
	  <lb/>a <emph>free</emph> council, in which the divines, delegated
	  <lb/>by different churches, should have a voice; the
	  <lb/>Pope was bent on a council, so modelled by
	  <lb/>himself, that all its decisions should be depen­
	  <lb/>dent on <emph>his</emph> pleasure.</p>
          <p>The <name>Protestants</name> declared they would not bind
	  <lb/>themselves to submit to any council, before they
	  <lb/>knew on what principle its decrees were to be
	  <pb n="195"/>
	  <milestone n="16(6)r" unit="sig"/>
	  <mw type="pageNum">195</mw>
	  <lb/>founded—by whom they would be pronounced
	  <lb/>—and what forms of procedure would be ob­
	  <lb/>served; the Pope affirmed that a council was
	  <lb/>altogether unnecessary, unless those who de­
	  <lb/>manded it would bind themselves to acquiesce
	  <lb/>in its decrees, whatever they should be.</p>
          <p>Such were the points of dispute started, by
	  <lb/>which the Pope artfully delayed the council,
	  <lb/>without drawing upon himself the whole blame
	  <lb/>of retarding it. Matters were in this state when
	  <lb/>the Papal chair again became vacated by the
	  <lb/>death of <persName>Clement</persName>.</p>
          <p>His successor, <persName>Paul Third</persName>, fully aware of the
	  <lb/>censure <persName>Clement</persName> had incurred by his obstinacy
	  <lb/>in regard to assembling a council, affected a wil­
	  <lb/>lingness that such a meeting should take place;
	  <lb/>but he was anxious it should be in a city under
	  <lb/>his own influence. He was secretly averse to
	  <lb/>such a measure, as much so perhaps as any of
	  <lb/>his predecessors, but he flattered himself, that
	  <lb/>his seeming readiness to meet the general de­
	  <lb/>mand would ward from him any reproach, in
	  <lb/>case the difficulties he foresaw would
	  <lb/>arise as to the time and place of meeting,
	  <lb/>and all the various particulars concerning its
	  <lb/>regulation, should finally preclude its taking
	  <lb/>place. He despatched nuncios to the several
	  <lb/>courts, declaring his intention to call a general
	  <lb/>assembly, and appointed <placeName>Mantua</placeName> as the place of
	  <lb/>meeting.</p>
          <p>As he hoped, the <name>Protestants</name> opposed this;
	  <lb/>they protested against meeting in a place so

	  <lb/>their original demand, that it should be conven­
	  <lb/>ed in <placeName>Germany</placeName>. A series of negotiations and
	  <lb/>intrigues followed; the Pope <emph>seemed</emph> eager to
	  <lb/>assemble a council, and yet, under existing cir­
	  <lb/>cumstances, put off its meetings at his pleasure.
	  <lb/>To soothe the <name>Germans</name>, at length <persName>Charles</persName> sum­
	  <lb/>moned several successive diets, in which dispu­
	  <lb/>tants on both sides appeared, and strenuous
	  <lb/>efforts were made to reconcile the contending
	  <lb/>parties, but in vain. The decrees of these diets,
	  <lb/>although they produced no results very favorable
	  <lb/>to the Protestant cause, greatly offended the
	  <lb/>Pope and excited his jealousy toward the empe­
	  <lb/>ror—he felt that his assuming the power of
	  <lb/>appointing divines to examine and determine
	  <lb/>matters of controversy, was a very undutiful and
	  <lb/>dangerous invasion of his rights.</p>

	  <lb/>templated decisions of this great assembly; they
	  <lb/>were jealous of the encroaching power and
	  <lb/>influence of the monastic orders, and they
	  <lb/>hoped now to recover their rights and privi­
	  <lb/>leges.</p>
          <p>As for the Pope, all his schemes centred in
	  <lb/>the aggrandizement of the holy see. He in­
	  <lb/>tended to make no concessions, and to permit
	  <lb/>no changes, which would not further this de­
	  <lb/>sign; this was soon discovered by the Protes­
	  <lb/>tant party, and they determined not to acknow­
	  <lb/>ledge a council called with such intentions, and 
	  <lb/>prosecuted with such feelings.</p>
          <p>Three legates, the cardinals <persName>De Monte</persName>, <persName>Santa
	  <lb/>Croce</persName>, and <persName>Pole</persName>, were chosen to preside in the
	  <lb/>council in the name of the Pope. They repaired
	  <lb/>to the place appointed, where only about twenty
	  <lb/>prelates, one after another, assembled. They
	  <lb/>spend the whole summer in negotiations, but
	  <lb/>nothing of importance was adjusted; nothing,
	  <lb/>in fact, was accomplished, and another session
	  <lb/>was appointed to be held the coming <name>December</name>.
	  <lb/>The diet, this year, assembled at <placeName>Worms</placeName>. Warm
	  <lb/>discussions passed.</p>
          <p>The <name>Protestants</name> earnestly hoped from this
	  <lb/>assembly to obtain such a confirmation of their
	  <lb/>religious rights, that they could enjoy them in
	  <lb/>greater security than they had hitherto done;
	  <lb/>but the only reply they could obtain to their
	  <lb/>earnest solicitations was, that as the Pope had
	  <lb/>at length been persuaded to appoint a council,
	  <mw rend="align(left)indent(4)" type="sig">17*</mw>
	  <pb n="202"/>
	  <milestone n="17(3)v" unit="sig"/>
	  <mw type="pageNum">202</mw>
	  <lb/>they must wait for its decrees, and abide by its
	  <lb/>decisions.</p>
          <p>But they remonstrated warmly against the
	  <lb/>council—it was called to meet without the
	  <lb/>bounds of the empire; the Pope had assumed
	  <lb/>the right of presiding, by appointing three
	  <lb/>legates as judges; he had called it also by his
	  <lb/>own authority, independent of the emperor, and
	  <lb/>they pronounced it illegal, and affirmed they
	  <lb/>held the decree of the late diet to be still in full
	  <lb/>force. They moreover openly declared, <quote>that
	    <lb/>they would not deign to vindicate their religion
	    <lb/>in presence of a council, assembled not to ex­
	    <lb/>amine, but to condemn them; and that they
	    <lb/>would pay no regard to an assembly held under
	    <lb/>the influence of a Pope, who had already pre­
	    <lb/>cluded himself from all title to act as a judge, by
	    <lb/>his having stigmatized their opinions with the
	    <lb/>name of heresy, and denounced against them
	    <lb/>the heaviest censures, which, in the plenitude of
	    <lb/>his usurped power, he could inflict.</quote></p>
          <p>They remained inflexible, and thus the assem­
	  <lb/>bly dissolved. <persName>Charles</persName>, however, to gain time
	  <lb/>to ripen the schemes he had in view, artfully

	  <lb/>they were soon undeceived; <persName>Charles</persName> betrayed

        <said>
          <p>The reformed party were alarmed
 at these

          <p>Sessions of the council were held on the <date when="1545-12-13">thir­

	  <lb/>pomp and much religious solemnity.
	  <lb/>The time was entirely occupied with matters of
	  <lb/>form; in the fourth session, Scripture and tradi­
	  <lb/>tion were taken into consideration. The rejec­
	  <lb/>tion of tradition by the reformers was at once
	  <lb/>condemned, and the result of the session was a
	  <lb/>decree of this import—that the books, designated
	  <lb/>Apocryphal, were of equal authority with the
	  <lb/>Scriptures of the <rs type="title">Old</rs> and <rs type="title">New Testament</rs>; and
	  <lb/>that the tradition, which had been handed down

	    <lb/>mitted to writing.</quote></p>
          <p>All who refused submission to this decree,
	  <lb/>were doomed, in the name of the Holy Ghost, to
	  <lb/>the punishment of obstinate heretics. The Pope,
	  <lb/>at this time issued a bull against the archbishop

          <p>Deeply as the deceit of the emperor, and the

 during the summer, the Pope

	  <lb/>total destruction. The emperor's enmity to it
	  <lb/>appeared rapidly to increase; in the diet at
	  <lb/><placeName>Augsburg</placeName>, which followed these commotions,
	  <lb/>the emperor personally commanded absolute ac­
	  <lb/>quiesence in the decisions of the council of
	  <lb/><placeName>Trent</placeName>; he took possession of the churches there
	  <lb/>by force, and re-established the <rs type="properAdjective">Roman Catholic</rs>
	  <lb/>worship in them. Troops were stationed in the
	  <lb/>neighboring cities and villages, ready to enforce
	  <lb/>any decisions he chose. The bold, public meas­
	  <lb/>ures, adopted by the emperor, were calculated
	  <lb/>greatly to inflame the head of the church, so
	  <lb/>long accustomed to rule in such matters, and to
	  <lb/>know no appeal from his wishes and laws. He
	  <lb/>became exceedingly jealous of <persName>Charles'</persName> increas­
	  <lb/>ing power; to check the monarch's ambition
	  <lb/>and continue his own influence in it complete,
	  <lb/>he resolved to remove the assembly from <placeName>Trent</placeName>, and
	  <lb/>to <placeName>Bologna</placeName>, entirely beneath his own supervision.
	  <lb/>An infectious disease broke out in <placeName>Trent</placeName>, and

	  <lb/>for effecting his purpose. It was done; the em­

	  <lb/>force the <name>Protestants</name>, more than formerly, to
	  <lb/>submit to its decisions. He could not think for

	  <lb/>of subjecting them to the <rs type="properAdjective">Roman Catholic</rs> faith.
	  <lb/>What could he do? In the midst of his dilemma,

	  <pb n="213"/>
	  <milestone n="18(3)r" unit="sig"/>
	  <mw type="pageNum">213</mw>
	  <lb/>from the belief of both parties, as he could in­

	  <lb/>Popish churches to adopt. With the assistance
	  <lb/>of some Romish ecclesiastics, he succeeded in
	  <lb/>composing a complete system of divinity, which,

          <p>The seventh and eighth sessions, held <date when="--03-03"><name>March</name><lb/>3d</date> and <date when="--03-11">11th</date>, were devoted to the consideration
	  <lb/>of the <emph>sacraments</emph>. You know the views of the
	  <lb/>Romish church on their number, efficacy, &amp;c.
	  <lb/>from our conversation on a preceding evening.
	  <lb/>Baptism and confirmation were the particular
	  <lb/>points on which they dwelt during their present
	  <lb/>deliberations. Transubstantiation, it was re­
	  <lb/>solved, should be considered in the next assem­
	  <lb/>bly.</p>
          <p>Various circumstances which occurred before
	  <lb/>the ninth session, I have already related by
	  <lb/>anticipation. The proposition of the Pope to
	  <lb/>remove the council to <placeName>Bologna</placeName> I named. This
	  <lb/>intended measure greatly enraged the emperor.
	  <lb/>He was fully aware, that the <name>Protestants</name> would
	  <lb/>never submit to the decisions of a council, held
	  <lb/>in any Papal city—he was offended that he had
	  <lb/>not been consulted in the measure, and in his
	  <lb/>wrath he declared the Pope to be an obstinate
	  <pb n="217"/>
	  <milestone n="18(5)r" unit="sig"/>

	  <lb/>old man, and that he would ruin the church
	  <lb/>eventually. He threatened to throw <persName>Santa
	  <lb/>Croce</persName> (the Pope's legate) into the <placeName xml:id="a10" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n10">Adige</placeName>, if
 he
	  <lb/>persisted in urging the removal of the council.
	  <lb/>However, it was made, and the ninth session
	  <lb/>held there <date when="--04-21"><name>April</name> 21</date>. <persName>Charles</persName> meanwhile con­
	  <lb/>soled himself, with his sanguine hopes of calling
	  <lb/>a council himself, which should give satisfaction
	  <lb/>to all parties; he resolved that his new system
	  <lb/>should be adopted as the faith of every member,
	  <lb/>both Protestant and Popish, and he intended to
	  <lb/>see to it, that every thing in the discipline
	  <lb/>and practice of the church, which needed correction,
	  <lb/>should forthwith be corrected.</p>
          <p>Few prelates, for various reasons, repaired to
	  <lb/><placeName>Bologna</placeName>, and nothing of importance was deter­
	  <lb/>mined at the ninth session, or the tenth, and the
	  <lb/>council was prorogued for an indefinite period.</p>
          <p>On <date when="1551-05-01"><name>May</name> 1, 1551</date>, was held the eleventh ses­
	  <lb/>sion, and the usual solemnities were observed

          <p>After many conferences and much

	  <lb/>to <placeName>Trent</placeName>; that all decrees, already passed there,
	  <pb n="218"/>

	  <lb/>should be re-examined, and that the Protestant
	  <lb/>divines should have a free, deliberative voice in
	  <lb/>the assembly; that the Pope should not preside
	  <lb/>either personally or by his legates.</p>
          <p>The <name>Protestants</name> promised submission to the
	  <lb/>council on such conditions.</p>
          <p>But the Pope was resolute in his denial to
	  <lb/>accede to any of these demands; the assembly
	  <lb/>at <placeName>Bologna</placeName> dwindled almost into nonentity, and
	  <lb/>to save contempt, the pontiff dissolved it. Soon
	  <lb/>after, grieved and disheartened, he died, and

	  <lb/>unlike his predecessors, was anxious to reassem­

	  <lb/>and efficient measures; but all the sanguine
	  <lb/>expectations, indulged with regard to his admin­

          <p><persName>Cardinal Caraffa</persName>, taking the name of <persName>Paul

	  <lb/>orders of men. He seemed entirely to have
	  <lb/>forgotten the change in public sentiment as
	  <lb/>to the unlimited power of Papal authority,
	  <lb/>and assumed the right even to dispose of king­
	  <lb/>doms. <quote>No prince,</quote> he said, <quote>should be his

          <p>The new Pope, on his election, professed
	  <lb/>great concern for reform, and immediately pro­
	  <lb/>ceeded to form a body of Popish ecclesiastics,
	  <lb/>amounting to nearly one hundred and fifty,
	  <lb/>whom he deputed to inquire into the various
	  <lb/>abuses charged upon the Romish church.</p>
          <p>Some of the cardinals proposed, that mat­
	  <lb/>ters should be discussed in a general council;
	  <lb/>he was greatly enraged at the proposition, and
	  <lb/>said <quote>he needed no council, he was above them
	    <lb/>all.</quote> It was observed, that <quote>although a council
	    <lb/>added nothing to the authority of the Pope, yet
	    <lb/>it was useful in devising the means of executing
	    <lb/>his designs.</quote></p>
          <p>He replied, <quote>if there must be a council, it
	    <lb/>should be at <placeName>Rome</placeName>, and no where else; and none
	    <lb/>but bishops should attend it. <placeName>Trent</placeName> was situat­
	    <lb/>ed in the midst of heretics; it should never be

	  <lb/>One evening, however, as he was returning to
	  <lb/>his own house, he was fired upon from a window,

	  <lb/>indignation and sorrow at what had happened, as

	  <lb/>But the snare was deep-laid, and sure. That

	    <lb/>willingly took the direction of it. The day was

	  <lb/>rang, the signal decreed. A body of troops
	  <lb/>rushed forth to commence the slaughter. <persName>Co­

	  <lb/>ed, and the victim found. He begged them to
	    <lb/>spare him—to respect his gray <sic>heirs</sic>. They
	  <lb/>replied not, but the foremost plunged his sword
	  <lb/>into the admiral's breast, and threw the body
	  <lb/>into the court; it was treated with every indig­

	  <lb/>eration into schools; let them go, and early in­

	  <lb/>will be prepared to reject the crude dogmas of

	  <lb/>many souls, guided by the example and influence
	  <lb/>of a holy, consistent, active Christian family
	  <lb/>influence, might find their way to heaven.</p>
          <p>I rejoice that a spirit of deep interest, of ju­
	  <lb/>dicious effort, and of earnest prayer for the
	  <lb/>western portion of our country, seems now
	  <lb/>awaking among <name>Christians</name>;—may it greatly in­

	  <lb/>sanctified and saved, and like the faithful ser­

	  <lb/>might exert a holy, renovating influence in this
