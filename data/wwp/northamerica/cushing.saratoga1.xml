          <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">Among</hi> the many brave and gallant men, who, in the
	    <lb/>memorable year <date when="1759">1759</date>, gathered unfading laurels on
	    <lb/>the <placeName>Plains of Abraham</placeName>, and shared the dangers and the
	    <lb/>glories of the immortal <persName>Wolfe</persName>, there were few, who
	    <lb/>more proudly distinguished themselves than <persName>Captain
	    <lb/>Courtland</persName>, then a young and inexperienced man, just
	    <lb/>entering on the busy stage of life. But, young and in­
	    <lb/>experienced as he was, there were older and abler
	    <lb/>officers who viewed with admiration his undaunted
	    <lb/>valour, and beheld with pleasure the enthusiasm with
	    <lb/>which he unsheathed his virgin sword to fight the battles
	    <lb/>of his king. <persName>Captain Courtland</persName> was the descendant of
	    <lb/>an ancient family which for centuries had given to its
	    <lb/>country brave defenders in time of war, and statesmen
	    <lb/>able to counsel in seasons of extremity, or in the hour of
	    <lb/>peace and national prosperity. Possessed of an ample
	    <lb/>fortune, and enjoying in the society of a beautiful and
	    <lb/>accomplished woman, to whom he was but just united,
	    <lb/>the pleasures of domestic life; yet with all the eager
	    <lb/>delight of a youthful soldier, he received an order to
	    <lb/>join his regiment, then destined to <placeName>America</placeName>, and, an­
	    <lb/>imated by the prospect of future glory, he quitted the
	    <lb/>endearments of home and the charms of polished society
	    <lb/>to embark on a tempestuous ocean in search of a for­
	    <lb/>eign, almost a savage shore, stimulated by the enthusi­
	    <lb/>asm of an enterprising spirit, and burning to follow to
	    <lb/>victory those great and brave men, who were about to

	    <mw type="pageNum">4</mw>
	    <lb/>carry the terror of their arms into the <placeName>French Provinces</placeName>
	    <lb/>of the new world. The vessel in which <persName>Captain Court­
	    <lb/>land's</persName> regiment was embarked sailed for <placeName>Louisburg</placeName>, and,
	    <lb/>joining the fleet under convoy of <persName>Admirals Saunders</persName> and
	    <lb/><persName>Holmes</persName>, landed, towards the last of <date when="1759-06"><name>June</name> 1759</date>, on the
	    <lb/><placeName>Isle of Orleans</placeName>, a few leagues below the city of <placeName>Quebec</placeName>.
	    <lb/>The progress of their operations, history has faithfully
	    <lb/>recorded. <persName>Captain Courtland</persName> distinguished himself in
	    <lb/>such a manner as to gain the favour of his illustrious
	    <lb/>general, and on the memorable <date when="1759-09-13">thirteenth of <name>September</name></date>
	    <lb/>he led on his soldiers with a dauntless and intrepid valor,
	    <lb/>that hastened the issue of that victorious day, and drew
	    <lb/>from the lips of his beloved commander, the last expres­
	    <lb/>sion of his kindness and approbation. But even in
	    <lb/>the hour of personal and national triumph, the manly
	    <lb/>cheek of <persName>Courtland</persName> was bathed in tears, and throughout
	    <lb/>the army of the victors the voice of joy and congratu­
	    <lb/>lation was lost in the deep and heart-breathed anguish
	    <lb/>of mourning and lametation;—for the beaming eye
	    <lb/>which cheered them in the hour of danger, which
	    <lb/>brightened at their triumphs, and softened with pity at
	    <lb/>their sufferings, was quenched in death; and that bold
	    <lb/>arm which pointed to victory, was nerveless and unstrung.
	    <lb/>Silent as the tomb which now shrouds the form of the
	    <lb/>hero, was all that remained of the brave, the gallant, the
	    <lb/>lamented <persName>Wolfe</persName>; and melancholy seemed the triumph,
	    <lb/>so dearly purchased. It was not till the autumn of the 
	    <lb/>succeeding year that the soldiers of <placeName>France</placeName> were com­
	    <lb/>pletely subdued by the arms of <placeName>Britain</placeName>, when the places
	    <lb/>within the government of <placeName>Canada</placeName> were surrendered to
	    <lb/>his Britannic Majesty, whose victorious troops took pos­
	    <lb/>session of the conquered country. The regiment of
	    <lb/><persName>Captain Courtland</persName> with some others was then ordered
	    <lb/>home; and, flushed with conquest, the remnant of these
	    <lb/>gallant troops sailed, in the spring of <date when="1761">1761</date>, from the
	    <lb/><placeName>St. Lawrence</placeName>, on their return to <placeName>England</placeName>.</p>
          <p>Previously to his departure, <persName>Captain Courtland</persName> visited
	    <lb/>the <placeName>English Provinces</placeName>. Of an ardent temperament, a
	    <lb/>lover of freedom, and an admirer of nature in all her
	    <lb/>varied forms, he had marked with feelings of unmixed
	    <pb n="5"/>

	    <mw type="pageNum">5</mw>
	    <lb/>pleasure the bold and sturdy spirit, which characterized
	    <lb/>the inhabitants of these provinces, and gazed with deep
	    <lb/>emotion upon the grand and sublime scenery peculiar
	    <lb/>to <placeName>America</placeName>. He passed some weeks with a friend in
	    <lb/><placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, and had daily opportunities, in the excur­
	    <lb/>sions which they made, of enjoying the less magnificent,
	    <lb/>but equally beautiful scenery which adorns the neigh­
	    <lb/>bourhood of this far-famed city. His letters to his wife
	    <lb/>were filled with praises of the country and the people;
	    <lb/>the one so diversified and grand; the other so lofty,
	    <lb/>bold, and independent; as if the majesty of their rivers
	    <lb/>and mountains, and the solemn grandeur of their forests,
	    <lb/>had infused a spirit of elevation and freedom into the
	    <lb/>inhabitants of this new and untamed world. The
	    <lb/>friends of <persName>Captain Courtland</persName> saw with pleasure his pre­
	    <lb/>dilection for their adopted country, and exerted all their
	    <lb/>eloquence to induce him to make is his also. He was
	    <lb/>indeed strongly inclined to accede to their wishes; but
	    <lb/>before he could form any decision on the subject, his
	    <lb/>regiment was ordered home, and he left <placeName>America</placeName> uncer­
	    <lb/>tain if he should ever see it more. He reached <placeName>England</placeName>
	    <lb/>in safety, and, amid the sweets of domestic life, the vision­
	    <lb/>ary dreams which had amused him in <placeName>America</placeName> faded
	    <lb/>from his mind, or served occasionally for the basis of
	    <lb/>those airy castles, which he and <persName>Mrs. Courtland</persName> loved
	    <lb/>to raise. The active duties of his profession, however,
	    <lb/>soon called him again from the tranquil enjoyments of
	    <lb/>home, and continued almost unremittingly to engage
	    <lb/>him, during the two succeeding years, when the ratifi­
	    <lb/>cation of the definitive treaty of peace at <placeName>Paris</placeName>, in <date when="1763">1763</date>,
	    <lb/>terminated the long and sanguinary war, and permitted
	    <lb/>Captain, now <persName>Major Courtland</persName> to return again to the
	    <lb/>bosom of his family. But the continued absence of her
	    <lb/>husband, and the loss of two lovely children, had brok­
	    <lb/>en the health and spirits of <persName>Mrs. Courtland</persName>; and the
	    <lb/>Major held with alarm the gradual decay of her con­
	    <lb/>stitution, and the deep dejection of a mind, once all
	    <lb/>activity and life. The physicians recommended change
	    <lb/>of scene and climate; and the recollection of <placeName>America</placeName>, its
	    <lb/>pure and bracing air, its beautiful and varied landscapes,
	    <mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(+3)">1*</mw>

	    <milestone unit="sig" n="1(3)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">6</mw>
	    <lb/>which had awakened such deep emotion in his heart,
	    <lb/>resolved him, if <persName>Mrs. Courtland</persName> would consent, instant­
	    <lb/>ly to commence the voyage, and try what effect this
	    <lb/>change of residence might produce upon her declining
	    <lb/>health. He found no difficulty in obtaining her assent,
	    <lb/>and his sanguine temper led him to hope every thing
	    <lb/>from the influence of scenes so new and interesting, on
	    <lb/>a susceptible and cultivated mind. <persName>Mrs. Courtland</persName>,
	    <lb/>with an only brother, was left an orphan in early in­
	    <lb/>fancy, and she had few ties to bind her to her native
	    <lb/>land. Love of country, of fortune, of society, were all
	    <lb/>lost in the absorbing passion which centered in her
	    <lb/>husband. His heart was her home, his wishes hers,
	    <lb/>and where he was happiest she would be so also; whether
	    <lb/>amid the splendours and refinements of British luxury,
	    <lb/>or in the solitudes of the American forests. The pre­
	    <lb/>parations necessary for her departure seemed to awaken
	    <lb/>her from the despondency, which sorrow and indispo­
	    <lb/>sition had occasioned, and she thought and spoke of it
	    <lb/>with a degree of interest and animation; which she had
	    <lb/>not discovered for several months before. Early in
	    <lb/>the spring of <date when="1764">1764</date> <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, having obtained a
	    <lb/>year's leave of absence, embarked for <placeName>America</placeName> with
	    <lb/>his wife and only surviving child, a beautiful little girl,
	    <lb/>of two years old. Their voyage was prosperous, and
	    <lb/>it produced the most beneficial effects upon the debili­
	    <lb/>tated frame of <persName>Mrs. Courtland</persName>; while the cordial welcome
	    <lb/>with which she was greeted in a land of strangers, by
	    <lb/>those who knew and loved her husband, banished the
	    <lb/>slight sadness, which, on her first arrival, hung upon
	    <lb/>her spirits. They landed in <placeName>New York</placeName>, but shortly
	    <lb/>proceeded to <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, where <persName>Major Courtland</persName> had
	    <lb/>a larger circle of acquaintance. Not choosing a city
	    <lb/>residence, he took a house beautifully situated, on the
	    <lb/>banks of the <placeName>Schuylkill</placeName>, some miles distant from the
	    <lb/>city. It belonged to a friend of his, now in <placeName>England</placeName>,
	    <lb/>and with whom, in this spot, he had passed many de­
	    <lb/>lightful days during his former visit to <placeName>America</placeName>. It
	    <lb/>was built in the English style, and, though simple, with
	    <lb/>a degree of elegance seldom seen at that period in

	    <lb/><placeName>America</placeName>, except in the dwellings of the very wealthy, or
	    <lb/>of those who wished to enjoy the luxuries, and retain
	    <lb/>some appearance of the rank which they had possessed
	    <lb/>in their native land. It consisted but of one story;
	    <lb/>yet it was a spacious building; and the piazza, which
	    <lb/>surrounded it, and the large hall in the centre, which
	    <lb/>opened from a lawn in front, to a tastefully arranged
	    <lb/>garden behind, gave it an air of beauty and lightness,
	    <lb/>peculiarly pleasing and attractive. Extensive wings, on
	    <lb/>each side, included all the apartments which were ne­
	    <lb/>cessary or convenient for family use or enjoyment; the
	    <lb/>lawn sloped gradually to the river, whose lucid waters
	    <lb/>were seen glancing, at intervals, through the foliage of
	    <lb/>the majestic trees that stood thickly around the dwelling,
	    <lb/>and gave to it a sequestered and solitary air, which in the
	    <lb/>eyes of <persName>Major Courtland</persName> constitued its greatest charm.
	    <lb/>Amidst the shades of this lovely retreat <persName>Mrs. Courtland's</persName>
	    <lb/>health gradually improved, and the soothing tenderness
	    <lb/>of her husband, with the artless endearments of her
	    <lb/>child, restored to her wounded mind the cheerfulness
	    <lb/>and elasticity of which affliction had deprived it. The
	    <lb/>society also, which they gathered around them, though
	    <lb/>less numerous, was not less refined and intellectual than
	    <lb/>that which they had been accustomed to enjoy in <placeName>Eng­
	      <lb/>land</placeName>. Their present enjoyments were so rational and
	    <lb/>calm, their future prospects so cloudless and delightful,
	    <lb/>that they both looked forward with repugnance to the
	    <lb/>time, when they must quit their present quiet residence
	    <lb/>and share again in the pleasures, the pursuits, and the
	    <lb/>follies of the world.</p>
          <p>But this period was never to arrive. Three short
	    <lb/>and happy months had scarcely passed away, when the
	    <lb/>somewhat renovated health of <persName>Mrs. Courtland</persName> seemed
	    <lb/>again declining. The excessive heat of the summer
	    <lb/>months powerfully affected her feeble frame, and she
	    <lb/>drooped like a delicate flower beneath its withering
	    <lb/>influence. Again the anxious fears of her husband were
	    <lb/>awakened, and he would instantly have borne her to a
	    <lb/>colder region, in search of that health, which she was
	    <lb/>never more to find. But rendered languid by disease,
	    <pb n="8"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="1(4)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">8</mw>
	    <lb/>she implored him not to remove her from her present
	    <lb/>residence; and on being assured by her physicians, that
	    <lb/>all experiments would prove unavailing, he relinquished
	    <lb/>his hopeless project, and with despair at his heart forced
	    <lb/>himself to wear a look of cheerfulness, that he might,
	    <lb/>if possible, sustain the spirits of his wife. With a for­
	    <lb/>titude, which Heaven alone could have imparted, he
	    <lb/>remained firm at <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">the dreadful post of observation,</quote>
	    <lb/>which he was called to fill; soothing with unwearied
	    <lb/>tenderness the irritations and the sufferings of disease,
	    <lb/>and administering, with his own hand, to the wants of
	    <lb/>his beloved patient. <persName>Mrs. Courtland</persName> survived just six
	    <lb/>months after her arrival in <placeName>America</placeName>; she had suffered
	    <lb/>much, but the inflictions of Providence hade been sanc­
	    <lb/>tified to her; they had weaned her affections from earth,
	    <lb/>and with cheerful confidence committing her husband
	    <lb/>and infant child to the care and protection of Heaven,
	    <lb/>she awaited in humble faith and hope, the moment of
	    <lb/>her final release. Disappointed in his fondest hopes,
	    <lb/>by the death of the earliest and dearest object of his affec­
	    <lb/>tions, <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, for a time, refused all sympathy
	    <lb/>and consolation. He shut himself in his apartment, and
	    <lb/>holding his little girl in his arms yielded to the utmost
	    <lb/>violence of sorrow; but, when the first paroxysm of
	    <lb/>grief had passed away, he acquired more self-command,
	    <lb/>and forcibly withdrew his thoughts from dwelling con­
	    <lb/>stantly on the dead, to recollect the duties which he
	    <lb/>owed the living. He thought, at first, of returning di­
	    <lb/>rectly to <placeName>England</placeName>; but, attached to the manners and
	    <lb/>scenes of <placeName>America</placeName>, he felt a painful reluctance at the
	    <lb/>idea of quitting it. A new tie also bound him to the
	    <lb/>land; it contained the ashes of his lamented wife; and
	    <lb/>when his child should learn to speak and think of her
	    <lb/>mother, it would afford him a melancholy pleasure to
	    <lb/>lead her to the spot where reposed her mortal remains;
	    <lb/>to tell her of the virtues which adorned her character,
	    <lb/>and teach her to imitate them, and to love and venerate
	    <lb/>her memory. <placeName>England</placeName>, too, had lost, for him, its most
	    <lb/>attractive charm. He loved it, as his country; he
	    <lb/>honoured its laws, its institutions, and its government;
	    <pb n="9"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="1(5)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">9</mw>
	    <lb/>but she, who gave to every scene a charm, he could
	    <lb/>never more behold there; and the home of his fathers,
	    <lb/>the haunts of his youth, the friends he had loved,
	    <lb/>would unceasingly awaken painful remembrances of her,
	    <lb/>who slept in a distant land, and over whose forsaken
	    <lb/>grave he could not even enjoy the luxury of weeping.
	    <lb/>These thoughts long continued to occupy and agitate
	    <lb/>him; and he was still in a state of uncertainty and sus­
	    <lb/>pense, when he received a letter from the friend, who
	    <lb/>was the proprietor of the estate on which he now re­
	    <lb/>sided. He informed <persName>Major Courtland</persName> that, in conse­
	    <lb/>quence of an unexpected change in his prospects, he
	    <lb/>found himself under the necessity of remaining in <placeName>Eng­
	      <lb/>land</placeName>, and wishing, of course, to dispose of his estate in
	    <lb/><placeName>America</placeName>, he made him the first offer of it, upon the
	    <lb/>most reasonable terms. The overture was too tempt­
	    <lb/>ing to be rejected, and <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, delighted to
	    <lb/>possess a place, which his wife had loved, and which
	    <lb/>had been the scene of her last hours, without hesitation
	    <lb/>paid the stipulated price, and renounced, for the present
	    <lb/>at least, all intention of quitting <placeName>America</placeName>. He now
	    <lb/>viewed, with increased interest, the beautiful domains
	    <lb/>around him, and began to embellish and improve them.
	    <lb/>He became daily more averse to the idea of returning
	    <lb/>to <placeName>England</placeName>, and at last adopted the resolution of resign­
	    <lb/>ing his commission, and remaining in <placeName>America</placeName> till
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName> should reach the age, when it would be
	    <lb/>proper for her to enjoy the society and pleasures of
	    <lb/>the world. This design, once formed, was immedi­
	    <lb/>ately executed: he sent home his resignation, and
	    <lb/>turned his whole attention to the pursuits and enjoy­
	    <lb/>ments of rural life, and to the engaging task of educating
	    <lb/>his child.</p>
          <p><persName>Mrs. Courtland</persName> had brought with her to <placeName>America</placeName> a
	    <lb/>female, whom she considered rather in the light of a
	    <lb/>humble friend, than in that of a mere domestic, and who,
	    <lb/>having lived with her for several years previous to her
	    <lb/>marriage, had imbibed for her a strong attachment.
	    <lb/>This woman belonged to a respectable family, and had
	    <lb/>received an education far superior to what, in her class
	    <pb n="10"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="1(5)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">10</mw>
	    <lb/>of life, is usually thought necessary; and to her espe­
	    <lb/>cial care <persName>Mrs. Courtland</persName> affectionately consigned her
	    <lb/>little girl. <persName>Martha</persName>, touched by the confidence which
	    <lb/>this request evinced, solemnly promised never to for­
	    <lb/>sake the child of her benefactress, while it was in her
	    <lb/>power to be in any way serviceable to her, and to devote
	    <lb/>herself entirely, during her helpless childhood, to her
	    <lb/>comfort and enjoyment. <persName>Martha's</persName> love for the little
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName> rendered the performance of her promise an
	    <lb/>easy and a pleasurable task. It indeed bordered on
	    <lb/>idolatry; so that <persName>Major Courtland</persName> felt no concern lest
	    <lb/>she should be neglected, but feared rather, that her
	    <lb/>kind-hearted attendant would err on the side of indul­
	    <lb/>gence. To prevent this danger, he kept a watchful
	    <lb/>eye over their young charge, who, already c<choice><sic>c</sic><corr>o</corr></choice>nscious of
	    <lb/>her power, often maintained it with a degree of spirit
	    <lb/>and obstinacy that surprised her father, and warned him of
	    <lb/>many difficulties to be encountered in the formation of
	    <lb/>a mind, which, notwithstanding all its faults, gave early
	    <lb/>promise of uncommon loveliness. Yet he found it pain­
	    <lb/>ful to reprove even the failings of an object so beloved:
	    <lb/>her innocent endearments soothed his widowed heart,
	    <lb/>and often, while, with melancholy fondness, he traced
	    <lb/>the features of her mother in her infant countenance,
	    <lb/>he breathed a silent prayer to heaven to spare this last
	    <lb/>sweet bud of hope, that remained upon his desolated
	    <lb/>tree.</p>
          <p>As years passed on, time, with his obliterating hand,
	    <lb/>softened the painful regrets of <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, while
	    <lb/>the opening charms of <persName>Catherine</persName> filled his heart with
	    <lb/>paternal pleasure, and bound him again with a strong
	    <lb/>but gentle tie to earth. He did not indeed cease to
	    <lb/>mourn over the memory of her, who had been so early
	    <lb/>taken from him; but the poignancy of his regret had
	    <lb/>softened into a feeling of tender sadness, and there
	    <lb/>were no hours to him so sweet, as those passed with
	    <lb/>his daughter on her grave, which he watered with his
	    <lb/>tears. <persName>Catherine</persName> wept because he did; and listened
	    <lb/>with a heart full of emotion to his praises of the mother,
	    <lb/>whom it was her misfortune never to have known.

	    <lb/><persName>Major Courtland</persName> had caused the remains of his lady to
	    <lb/>be removed to a sequestered spot in his garden, be­
	    <lb/>neath the drooping branches of some willows that stood
	    <lb/>grouped together beside a small stream of clear water.
	    <lb/>A simple obelisk of white marble marked the place of
	    <lb/>her repose, and around it in the hand of affection had
	    <lb/>planted the earliest and most fragrant flowers. It was
	    <lb/>here that <persName>Catherine</persName> received the first lessons of virtue,
	    <lb/>which impressed her youthful mind; and thus the asso­
	    <lb/>ciations, connected with this spot, were of the most
	    <lb/>pure and sacred nature. The soft murmur of the
	    <lb/>stream, the fragrance of the flowers, the gentle sighing
	    <lb/>of the wind through the graceful branches of the wil­
	    <lb/>lows, all conspired to hallow the pleasing awe attached
	    <lb/>to it; and often the father and the daughter fancied
	    <lb/>that the spirit of her, whose remains moudlered be­
	    <lb/>neath the flowery turf, hovered around them in this
	    <lb/>favorite resort. Interested in the cultivation of his
	    <lb/>estate, and in the education of his daughter, <persName>Major
	      <lb/>Courtland</persName> found time pass rapidly away; he wished
	    <lb/>for no higher pleasures than those which he derived
	    <lb/>from her affection, from the conctemplation of nature,
	    <lb/>from the charms of literature, and from the society of
	    <lb/>the few friends, with whom he occasionally associated.
	    <lb/>Yet he was an ardent lover of his king and country;
	    <lb/>and happy as he found himself in his present abode, he
	    <lb/>anticipated the day, when he should return to the land
	    <lb/>of his fathers, and present his lovely daughter, bloom­
	    <lb/>ing with youth and beauty, to the gay and admiring
	    <lb/>circle, in which she was born to move. She was
	    <lb/>growing up, adorned with every personal charm, and
	    <lb/>gifted with a mind of uncommon strength and beauty;
	    <lb/>her doting father watched, with trembling solicitude,
	    <lb/>the rapid expansion of her intellectual powers, and
	    <lb/>saw, with inexpressible pleasure, the graces and love­
	    <lb/>liness of the mother revived in the youthful person of
<lb/>his daughter.</p>
          <p>But from the contemplation and enjoyment of an ob­
	    <lb/>ject so dear, <persName>Major Courtland</persName> was aroused by the
	    <lb/>murmur of national discontent, which began now to
	    <pb n="12"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="1(6)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">12</mw>
	    <lb/>spread among all ranks, deepening and strengthening
	    <lb/>as it spread, till the voice of complaint was that of the
	    <lb/>people; and the country, at large, became ripe for a
	    <lb/>revolt. A stern and devoted loyalist, he could not
	    <lb/>listen to these murmurs without the strongest indigna­
	    <lb/>tion. What the colonists termed arbitrary accts, impo­
	    <lb/>sitions, and grievances, on the part of the mother coun­
	    <lb/>try, he, influenced by the partiality of national feeling,
	    <lb/>deemed to be just and lawful requisitions; and the
	    <lb/>love of liberty, by which they professed to be actuated,
	    <lb/>he stigmatized as the stirrings of aspiring ambition,
	    <lb/>which prompted them to shake off the mild restraints
	    <lb/>of British law and justice. But he was too prudent to
	    <lb/>express opinions so repugnant to the spirit of the peo­
	    <lb/>ple, and he remained a silent, though not an indifferent,
	    <lb/>spectator of the progress of events. It was no matter
	    <lb/>of wonder, when so many preserved a strict neutrality,
	    <lb/>that he should do so too; and though suspicion was
	    <lb/>awake on all sides, and many individuals were pointed
	    <lb/>out and denounced as loyalists and tories, yet <persName>Major
	      <lb/>Courtland</persName>, seldom seen in the populous haunts of men,
	    <lb/>and occupied in the most simple and harmless pursuits,
	    <lb/>escaped all obloquy, and became alternately the unwil­
	    <lb/>ling confidant of both parties. Popular discontent con­
	    <lb/>tinued to increase with an alarming rapidity: every
	    <lb/>day aggravated the evils, of which the colonists com­
	    <lb/>plained, and strengthened the determination of <placeName>Great
	      <lb/>Britain</placeName> to subdue the rebellious spirit, which manifest­
	    <lb/>ed itself: but the resistance of <placeName>America</placeName> increased in
	    <lb/>proportion to the impositions of her government, till, at
	    <lb/>length, the provinces, ripe for revolt, with an unani­
	    <lb/>mous impulse, flew to arms, and commenced that des­
	    <lb/>perate conflict, which for seven long years deluged in
	    <lb/>blood the fairest portions of the land, and terminated in
	    <lb/>the triumph of freedom, and the establishment of all
	    <lb/>the rights and priveleges most dear to civilized man.
	    <lb/><persName>Major Courtland</persName> was solicited by individuals of each
	    <lb/>party to engage in the contest, but his political and
	    <lb/>national attachments forbade his aiding the American
	    <lb/>cause; neither could he resolve to combat against a
	    <pb n="13"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="2(1)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">13</mw>
	    <lb/>land, which had afforded him a pleasant habitation, for
	    <lb/>so many years, and which was endeared to him by a
	    <lb/>thousand fond and tender recollections. <persName>Catherine</persName> felt
	    <lb/>and thought far differently from her father; but the deep
	    <lb/>attachment which he ever expressed for the land of his
	    <lb/>birth, prevented her from giving utterance to the secret
	    <lb/>sentiments of her heart. Though as yet scarcely past
	    <lb/>the age of childhood, her mind was mature beyond her
	    <lb/>years, and her ardent feelings led her early to imbibe a
	    <lb/>strong affection for the land of her adoption; it was
	    <lb/>the only one which she had ever known, and it was
	    <lb/>endeared to her by all the sweet recollections of infan­
	    <lb/>cy, and by all the enjoyments and hopes of youth. No
	    <lb/>country, she fondly thought, could be more lovely, no
	    <lb/>people more virtuous, or more nobly independent; and
	    <lb/>the very spirit which roused them to arms was one
	    <lb/>which met an answering impulse in her bosom. With
	    <lb/>the most anxious interest she watched the progress of
	    <lb/>the strife, till her passions and her hopes were enlisted
	    <lb/>in the cause of the colonists, in whose triumphs she
	    <lb/>exulted, and in whose sufferings and defeats she deeply
	    <lb/>but silently sympathized; for, as yet, she dared not
	    <lb/>risk her father's displeasure by expressing, in his pre­
	    <lb/>sence, her joy or her regret. How would he reprove
	    <lb/>her, who ever spoke of the colonists as factious and
	    <lb/>ambitious, and deprecated their proceedings as alto­
	    <lb/>gether unjustifiable and rebellious! <persName>Major Courtland</persName>,
	    <lb/>however, was frequently compelled to hear their praises
	    <lb/>from the lips of an old servant, to whom, in considera­
	    <lb/>tion of his age and long services, he allowed more
	    <lb/>liberty of speech than he would have been inclined to
	    <lb/>grant an ordinary domestic. During the campaign of
	    <lb/><date when="1759">1759</date> in <placeName>Canada</placeName>, <persName>Hugh</persName> had been his constant and faith­
	    <lb/>ful attendant, and had then, from the bravery and hos­
	    <lb/>pitality of the <name>Americans</name>, imbibed for them that par­
	    <lb/>tiality, which, during his long residence in the country
	    <lb/>since that period, had ripened into a deep and perma­
	    <lb/>nent attachment. His eulogiums on their valor height­
	    <lb/>ened the enthusiasm with which <persName>Catherine</persName> regarded
	    <lb/>them, and his oft repeated accounts of their constancy
	    <mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(+3)">2</mw>

	    <lb/>and sufferings were heard by her with emotion, and
	    <lb/>fanned the flame of patriotism which burned so brightly
	    <lb/>in her heart. <persName>Catherine</persName> often wished for a companion
	    <lb/>of her own sex and age, and her wishes were, at last,
	    <lb/>gratified by the arrival of a cousin, who, having ac­
	    <lb/>companied her father from <placeName>England</placeName>, came to reside
	    <lb/>with her, during his continuance in <placeName>America</placeName>. <persName>Col.
	      <lb/>Dunbar</persName> was the only brother of <persName>Mrs. Courtland</persName>, and,
	    <lb/>at the commencement of the war, he had accompanied
	    <lb/>the army of <persName>General Howe</persName> to <placeName>America</placeName>. His lady and
	    <lb/>daughter sailed with him from <placeName>England</placeName>; but the former,
	    <lb/>then in delicate health, died during the voyage, and,
	    <lb/>after the evacuation of <placeName>Boston</placeName> by the British troops,
	    <lb/>the Colonel sent his motherless girl to remain under
	    <lb/>the protection of her uncle while he followed the un­
	    <lb/>certain fortunes of war.</p>
          <p><persName>Amelia Dunbar</persName> was two years older than her cousin;
	    <lb/>and, though gifted with far less beauty, she possessed a
	    <lb/>pleasing person and a sweet and interesting counte­
	    <lb/>nance. But their characters were more dissimilar than
	    <lb/>their persons; <persName>Amelia</persName> was timid and pensive, kind but
	    <lb/>not ardent in her feelings, and never by any event
	    <lb/>transported to enthusiasm. <persName>Catherine</persName> had a mixture
	    <lb/>of gaiety and tenderness of spirit, and of softness in her
	    <lb/>composition, which was truly captivating. She was
	    <lb/>governed by feeling, and the excitement of the moment
	    <lb/>often carried her beyond the verge of prudence. Warm
	    <lb/>in her attachments she thought no service too great to
	    <lb/>be performed for those she loved, and was ready, at
	    <lb/>any moment, to sacrifice her wishes to the inclination
	    <lb/>of her friends. Her lofty feelings rendered her a pas­
	    <lb/>sionate admirer of brave and heroic actions, and her
	    <lb/>affection for her adopted country was strengthened and
	    <lb/>increased by the noble contempt of suffering and death,
	    <lb/>displayed by its daring soldiery; and, above all, by the
	    <lb/>great and magnanimous chief who led forth its armies,
	    <lb/>and who, animated by the purest patriotism, devoted
	    <lb/>himself to its cause, without one selfish aspiration after
	    <lb/>emolument or fame. She soon found, with regret,
	    <lb/>though not with surprise, that her feelings would meet
	    <pb n="15"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="2(2)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">15</mw>
	    <lb/>with no sympathy in the heart of her cousin, who was
	    <lb/>as firm a loyalist as <persName>Major Courtland</persName> was himself, or
	    <lb/>as he could have wished his daughter to be; and
	    <lb/>who viewed, with all the anger that her gentle nature
	    <lb/>was susceptible of cherishing, the persevering struggles
	    <lb/>of the <mcr>rebels</mcr> against the laws and authority of their
	    <lb/>rightful soveriegn. <persName>Catherine</persName>, of course, resolved not
	    <lb/>to alienate the affections of her cousin, or wound her
	    <lb/>national attachment, by an avowal of her obnoxious
	    <lb/>sentiments; but her ungaurded heart yielded to every
	    <lb/>impulse of enthusiasm, and she was too deeply interest­
	    <lb/>ed in the public cevents of the day, always to remember,
	    <lb/>that there were those before whom the expression of
	    <lb/>her feelings would be considered both criminal and un­
	    <lb/>natural. Circumstances and conversations were per­
	    <lb/>petually occurring, which made her forget all caution,
	    <lb/>and unveiled both to her cousin and her father the
	    <lb/>opinions and attachments which she cherished. <placeName>Penn­
	      <lb/>sylvania</placeName>, and particularly the neighbourhood of <placeName>Phila­
	      <lb/>delphia</placeName>, had now become the principal seat of the war;
	    <lb/>and the <name>Americans</name>, pursued beyond the <placeName>Delaware</placeName>, re­
	    <lb/>mained shut up in the capital, while the troops of the
	    <lb/>king surrounded them, and maintained quiet possession
	    <lb/>of the adjacent country. <persName>Catherine's</persName> bouyant hopes
	    <lb/>were saddened by the gloomy reports, which constant­
	    <lb/>ly reached them, of the reduced numbers of the Amer­
	    <lb/>ican army, the desperate state of their affairs, and the
	    <lb/>sufferings to which they were in consequence exposed.
	    <lb/>The triumph of the royal cause was spoken of as cer­
	    <lb/>tain, and the British officers, who were in the habit of
	    <lb/>visiting at <persName>Major Courtland's</persName>, seemed confident of a
	    <lb/>speedy peace, and convinced of the inability of the
	    <lb/>colonists to maintain a longer resistance.</p>

          <p>As the regiment of <persName>Colonel Dunbar</persName> was, at this pe­
	    <lb/>riod, stationed in the vicinity of <persName>Major Courtland's</persName>
	    <lb/>residence, <persName>Amelia</persName> had frequent opportunities of seeing
	    <lb/>her father. He was often the guest of his brother-in-
	    <lb/>law, and though he seldom came alone, both himself
	    <lb/>and his companions in arms were ever cordially wel­
	    <lb/>comed and hospitably entertained. <persName>Catherine</persName> would
	    <lb/>have highly enjoyed the society of these well-bred and
	    <lb/>intelligent men, had she not been compelled so often,
	    <lb/>to listen to the expression of sentiments repugnant to
	    <lb/>her feelings, and which she feared might increase the
	    <lb/>abhorrence with which her father already regarded the
	    <lb/>struggles of the colonists, and urge him again to un­
	    <lb/>sheath his sword in the service of his king. <persName>Colonel
	      <lb/>Dunbar</persName> was a high spirited and brave soldier; he hated
	    <lb/>whatever savored of republicanism, and was a zea­
	    <lb/>lous defender of royalty and its prerogatives. Secretly
	    <lb/>suspecting <persName>Catherine's</persName> attachment for what he termed
	    <lb/>the cause of rebellion, he took every opportunity indi­
	    <lb/>rectly to reprove her, and was unsparing in the harsh­
	    <lb/>ness of his censures on the ungrateful colonists. <persName>Cath­
	      <lb/>erine</persName>, however, firm in her principles and attach­
	    <lb/>ments, chose rather to endure the severity which she
	    <lb/>incurred, than disavow the opinions which she had
	    <lb/>adopted from a conviction of their justness; though,
	    <lb/>from regard to her father's feelings, as well as to avoid
	    <lb/>continual dispute, she remained silent, except when
	    <lb/>some very unjust assertion, or provoking ridicule, threw
	    <lb/>her off her guard, and led her, with all the fervor of
	    <lb/>unstudied eloquence, to vindicate the people whom she
	    <lb/>loved. But she soon grew weary of the Colonel's un­

	    <lb/>ceasing sarcasms. His visits, though usually short, were
	    <lb/>dreaded by her; and when she heard him express his
	    <lb/>intention of passing the approaching <name>Christmas</name> with
	    <lb/>them, she looked forward to the day, which had hith­
	    <lb/>erto been one of rational enjoyment, as to a season of
	    <lb/>trial and vexation.</p>
          <p><persName>Major Courtland</persName>, who loved to keep the festival with
	    <lb/>true old English hospitality, requested his brother to
	    <lb/>extend the invitation to as many as he pleased; and
	    <lb/>accordingly <persName>Colonel Dunbar</persName> arrived, in the morning,
	    <lb/>bringing with him several officers of his regiment. The
	    <lb/>day passed cheerfully on: all seemed disposed to for­
	    <lb/>get the public events of the period, and <persName>Catherine</persName>,
	    <lb/>agreeably disappointed that political topics formed no
	    <lb/>part of the conversation, was all gaiety and animation;
	    <lb/>while <persName>Amelia</persName>, happy in the presence of her father,
	    <lb/>contributed, with more than her usual spirit, to the en­
	    <lb/>joyment of the circle. But, during the hour of dinner,
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName> observed that her uncle, a convivial man,
	    <lb/>and rather given to excesses, quaffed frequent libations,
	    <lb/>and circulated the bottle with a freedom that shortly
	    <lb/>excited the spirits of the gentlemen, and gradually in­
	    <lb/>troduced the subject which she had so much dreaded,
	    <lb/>and sought, by every means in her power, to avert.
	    <lb/><persName>Amelia</persName> became silent; for she well knew her father's
	    <lb/>irritability, and was aware of the offence, which the
	    <lb/>zealous expression of his sentiments would give to the
	    <lb/>feelings of her cousin. But <persName>Catherine</persName> seemed resolved
	    <lb/>not to hear what was passing at the lower end of the
	    <lb/>table; for she turned to <persName>Captain Talbot</persName>, who sat next
	    <lb/>her, and began earnestly to converse with him on the
	    <lb/>merit of some French plays which he had sent her a
	    <lb/>few days before. The young man more than half sus­
	    <lb/>pected her secret predilection for the land, against
	    <lb/>which he was in arms, and compreheneded the cause
	    <lb/>which induced her to engage him, at this moment, on a
	    <lb/>literary topic; but he was deeply touched by her
	    <lb/>charms, and he would almost as soon have forfeited
	    <lb/>his commission as have wounded the feelings which
	    <lb/>seemed to him so natural and so excusable. He there­

	    <lb/>fore entered with animation on the subject which she
	    <lb/>had proposed, and <persName>Catherine</persName> herself soon became so
	    <lb/>interested in the discussion, as to forget the motive
	    <lb/>which had prompted her to commence it, and even to
	    <lb/>remain unobservant of the warm language of her uncle,
	    <lb/>and of the pointed sarcasms which he intended for her
	    <lb/>ear; but, remarking her inattention, he resolved to
	    <lb/>arouse her from it, and pushing the decanter towards
	    <lb/>her he said, in an elevated voice,</p>
          <p><said><persName>Miss Cath<choice><sic>a</sic><corr>e</corr></choice>rine</persName>, you do not drink your cousin's
	      <lb/>toast.</said> <said>Pardon me, sir, but I did not hear it,</said> she
	    <lb/>replied, slightly colouring; and turning, as she spoke,
	    <lb/>from <persName>Captain Talbot</persName>, who, absorbed by her, had been
	    <lb/>likewise inattentive to it. <said>The gallant <persName>General Howe</persName>!</said>
	    <lb/>said <persName>Colonel Dunbar</persName>, raising his glass to his lips, and
	    <lb/>fixing on her a keen and searching glance; but she
	    <lb/>cordially drank to the welfare of a man, whom all par­
	    <lb/>ties reverenced and admired, though when her uncle
	    <lb/>requested from her a favor similar to that which <persName>Ame­
	    <lb/>lia</persName> had conferred, she blushed and was for a moment
	    <lb/>silent; but soon recovering herself, she gave, <said>The
	      <lb/>land we love.</said></p>
          <p><said>That, <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>, is rather an ambiguous sen­
	      <lb/>timent,</said> said the Colonel with severity; <said>and were there
	      <lb/>a dozen rebels present, it would suit them just as well
	      <lb/>as if they had hearts as loyal as either yours or mine.</said></p>
          <p>He smiled sarcastically, as he concluded; and <persName>Cap­
	      <lb/>tain Talbot</persName>, highly displeased, was on the point of re­
	    <lb/>plying with as much asperity as he dared discover to­
	    <lb/>wards his superior officer, when <persName>Catherine</persName>, justly of­
	    <lb/>fended by the pointed rudeness of her uncle's words
	    <lb/>and manner, prevented him by saying with an empha­
	    <lb/>sis which heightened the glow upon her cheek,</p>
          <p>
            <said>And because a rebel drinks to the land he loves,
	      <lb/>may we not do so also, uncle? Does party feeling in­
	      <lb/>deed run so high, that two nations, using the same lan­
	      <lb/>guage, can no longer express themselves in similar
	      <lb/>phrases, without being suspected of harbouring a sinis­
	      <lb/>ter meaning?</said>
          </p>
          <p><persName>Colonel Dunbar</persName> looked chagrined, but he replied
	    <pb n="19"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="2(4)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">19</mw>
	    <lb/>with a forced and rather ungracious smile, <said>Excuse
	      <lb/>me, <persName>Catherine</persName>; you cannot suppose I suspect <emph>you</emph> of
	      <lb/>harboring any disloyal or sinister meaning, but in
	      <lb/>these treacherous and uncertain times, you will allow it
	      <lb/>is best to be explicit in word as well as deed.</said></p>
          <p><said>Certainly, uncle; though suspicion may extend
	      <lb/>too far, and has sometimes converted tried friends into
	      <lb/>inveterate foes,</said> she replied smiling.</p>
          <p><said>But a celebrated writer has cautioned us,</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>Colonel Dunbar</persName>, <said><quote rend="pre()post()">to live always with a friend as if he
	      <lb/>were one day to become an enemy</quote>.</said></p>
          <p><said>It is a detestable maxim,</said> answered <persName>Catherine</persName> in­
	    <lb/>dignantly, <said>and he who is capable of carrying it into
	      <lb/>practice, ought never to enjoy the pleasures of virtuous
	      <lb/>friendship.</said></p>
          <p><said>Well, well, <persName>Catherine</persName>,</said> said <persName>Colonel Dunbar</persName>, <said>I
	      <lb/>confess I have sometimes thought you rather inclined
	      <lb/>to whigism, but in future I will believe your heart as
	      <lb/>loyal as my own, and that all your good wishes are en­
	      <lb/>listed on the right side.</said></p>
          <p><said>At least, my dear uncle,</said> she said with a smile,
	    <lb/>which <persName>Captain Talbot</persName> thought resistless, <said>believe this,
	      <lb/>that I can never wish ill to the land of my birth, how­
	      <lb/>ever tender may be my attachment to that which only
	      <lb/>I have known, and which has nurtured me with so much
	      <lb/>kindness from my infancy.</said></p>
          <p><said>I have taught <persName>Catherine</persName> to love <placeName>America</placeName>,</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>Major Courtland</persName>, <said rend="post()">though I never wished her to pre­
	      <lb/>fer it to her mother country, nor can I yet believe that
	      <lb/>she is so perverted as to do so. But let us now recon­
	      <lb/>cile all differences by a toast in which I am sure both
	      <lb/>loyalist and republican would cordially pledge us.</said> He
	    <lb/>filled his glass, and gave, <said>A speedy peace on honorable
	      <lb/>terms;</said> which was drunk with great good humor; and
	    <lb/>soon after the ladies retired. <persName>Captain Talbot</persName> shortly
	    <lb/>followed them, and as <persName>Amelia</persName> quitted the apartment
	    <lb/>on some errand soon after he entered, he improved the
	    <lb/>opportunity, afforded by her absence, to renew the sub­
	    <lb/>ject which had been discussed at the dinner table.
	    <lb/><said>Let us speak no more of it,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>; <said>I can­

	      <lb/>not conceal, nor will I deny, the predilection which I
	      <lb/>feel for this country. I do not owe to it my birth, but
	      <lb/>it was here that I received my earliest impressions, and,
	      <lb/>amid this lovely scenery, they have deepened into sen­
	      <lb/>timents which time cannot efface. Among this people,
	      <lb/>whom my uncle denounces, my father has chosen his
	      <lb/>abode, and to their kindness he is indebted for atten­
	      <lb/>tions which can never be repaid, and which I am
	      <lb/>sure his noble nature never will forget. All that I
	      <lb/>love is centered here; even the ashes of my mother,</said>
	    <lb/>she continued with emotion, <said>repose in the bosom of
	      <lb/>this soil and render sacred the land of my adoption. Is
	      <lb/>it then strange that I should cling to it with affection,
	      <lb/>and shudder at those denunciations, which I daily hear
	      <lb/>pronounced against it? No, I am a daughter of <placeName>Amer­
		<lb/>ica</placeName>, and I tremble for the moment which seems fast
	      <lb/>approaching, when her lofty spirit shall be made to bend
	      <lb/>beneath the iron yoke of tyranny and oppression. For­
	      <lb/>give me, <persName>Captain Talbot</persName>,</said> she added, suddenly check­
	    <lb/>ing herself, <said>I forget that I am speaking to a loyalist,
	      <lb/>who may judge harshly of this frank avowal; I remem­
	      <lb/>ber only that I address a brave soldier, and an honorable
	      <lb/>man, who, though his own sentiments may be at variance
	      <lb/>with those which I have unguardedly expressed, will
	      <lb/>be too generous to censure feelings, which have origin­
	      <lb/>ated in the peculiar circumstances of my situation.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Captain Talbot</persName> gazed with admiration upon the
	    <lb/>glowing countenance of <persName>Catherine</persName>, varying with emo­
	    <lb/>tion, while she spoke with a rapidity and eloquence
	    <lb/>that forbade his interrupting her. Bowing profoundly
	    <lb/>at the gratifying compliment with which she concluded,
	    <lb/>he replied,</p>
          <p>
            <said>I am far from wishing to censure sentiments, <persName>Miss
		<lb/>Courtland</persName>, which I cannot but honor as the virtuous
	      <lb/>emotions of a good and susceptible heart. They are
	      <lb/>such as must be peculiarly lively in all who, at this
	      <lb/>trying period, call themselves children of <placeName>America</placeName>; and
	      <lb/>though myself in arms against her, I do not the less
	      <lb/>admire her spirit, or respect the talents of her chiefs.
	      <lb/>But I am enlisted in the service of a monarch, whom I

	      <milestone unit="sig" n="2(5)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">21</mw>
	      <lb/>love, and the profession, which I have embraced forbids
	      <lb/>my shrinking, in the hour of danger, from the duties it
	      <lb/>enjoins. The present situation of affairs induces us
	      <lb/>to think the contest is about to be decided; but wheth­
	      <lb/>er <placeName>America</placeName> conquers or submits, we know she will do
	      <lb/>either nobly. At all events, the country which <persName>Miss
		<lb/>Courtland</persName> loves, will always be to me an object of
	      <lb/>respect.</said>
          </p>
          <p>The entrance of <persName>Amelia</persName> terminated the conversation;
	    <lb/>and, the other gentlemen coming from the dining-room
	    <lb/>soon after, it was not resumed. The evening passed away
	    <lb/>in a variety of amusements peculiar to the season, and
	    <lb/>at a late hour <persName>Colonel Dunbar</persName> and his companions
	    <lb/>took leave of their friends and returned to the camp.</p>
          <p>Early on the following morning <persName>Major Courtland</persName> was
	    <lb/>awakened by the sound of distant cannonading, which
	    <lb/>shortly became so loud and incessant, as to disturb the
	    <lb/>remainder of the family. <persName>Major Courtland</persName> apprehend­
	    <lb/>ed an engagement must have taken place between the
	    <lb/>contending armies; though, considering the situation of
	    <lb/>the <name>Americans</name>, this seemed almost an incredible sup­
	    <lb/>position, unless the <name>British</name> had crossed the <placeName>Delaware</placeName>
	    <lb/>and surprised them in their encampments. At all events,
	    <lb/>something of the kind must have occasioned the firing,
	    <lb/>and the idea of <persName>Colonel Dunbar's</persName> danger filled them
	    <lb/>all with anxiety. <persName>Amelia</persName> in particular refused to be
	    <lb/>comforted, and, unable to control her grief, she shut
	    <lb/>herself up in her apartment to wait the return of <persName>Hugh</persName>
	    <lb/>who had been sent off to gather tidings of the cause of
	    <lb/>the alarm. <persName>Major Courtland</persName> also, uneasy at home,
	    <lb/>mounted his horse, and rode out to meet his messenger;
	    <lb/>but he did not return; and it was late in the afternoon,
	    <lb/>when <persName>Hugh</persName> was seen riding up the avenue alone. <persName>A­
	      <lb/>melia</persName> had returned to the parlour, and <persName>Catherine</persName> was
	    <lb/>seeking to sooth her apprehensions, when <persName>Hugh</persName>, wet
	    <lb/>by the mingled sleet and rain which had fallen during
	    <lb/>the day, and bespattered with mud, abruptly presented
	    <lb/>himself before them. <said>All is well, ladies,</said> he said
	    <lb/>panting for breath; <said>and, <persName>Miss Amelia</persName>, the Colonel is
	      <lb/>safe, and has had no fighting to day.</said></p>

          <mw type="pageNum">22</mw>
          <p><said>Thank God!</said> exclaimed both the cousins at the
	    <lb/>same moment, while <persName>Amelia</persName>, suddenly relieved from
	    <lb/>her anxiety, which had become intolerably keen, sunk
	    <lb/>almost fainting on her seat. <persName>Catherine</persName> hastened to
	    <lb/>support her; and when she had revived, <persName>Hugh</persName> pro­
	    <lb/>ceeded to give them farther intelligence. <said>I found,
	      <lb/>ma'am,</said> he said in answer to <persName>Catherine's</persName> inquiries,
	    <lb/><said>that the country people knew nothing of what had
	      <lb/>happened; and so, thinking his Honor would be displeas­
	      <lb/>ed if I came home without doing the errand on which
	      <lb/>he sent me, I rode towards his Honor the Colonel's head
	      <lb/>quarters, and was thinking what if the sentinel forbid
	      <lb/>my passing, how I should act, when I met <persName>Peterson</persName>,
	      <lb/>riding post haste to bring the tidings here. Last night,
	      <lb/>ma'am, the <name>Americans</name> marched from their encampment,
	      <lb/>and this morning by daylight fell upon the <name>Hessian</name>
	      <lb/>outposts at <placeName>Trenton</placeName>; carried them, gained a complete
	      <lb/>victory, and captivated three whole German regiments!</said></p>
          <p>A secret pleasure lighted up <persName>Hugh's</persName> rough features
	    <lb/>as he delivered this intelligence, and sparkled with less
	    <lb/>disguise on the eager and surprised countenance of <persName>Cath­
	      <lb/>erine</persName>; though it seemed to her so strange,—so almost
	    <lb/>impossible, that she could not refrain from expressing
	    <lb/>a doubt of its correctness.</p>
          <p><said>But, ma'am,</said> returned <persName>Hugh</persName> with earnestness, <said>the
	      <lb/>Colonel sent <persName>Peterson</persName> with the news; and he would
	      <lb/>not have done so, had it not been true; besides, he
	      <lb/>told me that the troops had been under arms all day;
	      <lb/>but that some runaways had just brought word that the
	      <lb/><name>Americans</name> had gone back with their captives; so it
	      <lb/>was probable they would have no fighting to day. The
	      <lb/>German barbarians!</said> he added with strong indignation,
	    <said>they will get more mercy than they deserve.</said></p>
          <p>An ejaculation of pleasure involuntarily escaped from
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName>, as she ruminated upon this wonderful intelli­
	    <lb/>gence; when <persName>Amelia</persName> suddenly raised her head from
	    <lb/>her cousin's shoulder, on which, till now, it had rested;
	    <lb/>and said, in a reproachful tone, and with a glance of
	    <lb/>displeasure.</p>

          </p>
          <p><said>It is in its success that I know triumph,</said> she repli­

	      <lb/>try; and, were it not so, as a friend to humanity, I
	      <lb/>rejoice in the capture of these mercenary <name>Germans</name>,
	      <lb/>who without any love for liberty and justice, without
	      <lb/>any knowledge even of the cause in which they are

          <p><said>Ah, <persName>Miss Amelia</persName>, they are more bloodthirsty than

	      <lb/>war is a bloody trade, and must harden the softest
	      <lb/>heart.</said></p>
          <p><said>Ah, in truth, <persName>Miss Amelia</persName>,</said> returned <persName>Hugh</persName>, zealous
	    <lb/>to defend the honor of the profession, <said>many a warm
	      <lb/>heart, and many a tender one too, beats under a soldier's
	      <lb/>doublet. They are brave who fight for their country;
	      <lb/>but they who fight only for money can have but few
	      <lb/>kindly feelings left.</said></p>
          <p><said>You are right, <persName>Hugh</persName>,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>; <said>he who
	      <lb/>fights for his country, his home, and his religion, and
	      <lb/>he only, is the brave and noble soldier. But did you
	      <lb/>not see my father? and why has he not returned?</said></p>
          <p>
            <said>I met him, <persName>Miss Catherine</persName>, just as I was parting with
	      <lb/><persName>Peterson</persName>, and he sent me on to bring you the tidings,
	      <lb/>while he stopped to ask a few more questions. But,
	      <lb/>ma'am, my master is coming up the avenue, at this
	      <lb/>moment.</said>
          </p>
          <p>He moved towards the door, as he spoke; and
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName>, after dismissing him, went out upon the
	    <lb/>piazza to meet her father. She, however, received on­
	    <lb/>ly a confirmation of what <persName>Hugh</persName> had already told her,
	    <lb/>without the addition of any farther particulars, which,
	    <lb/>in fact, were as yet but imperfectly known to any but
	    <pb n="24"/>

	    <mw type="pageNum">24</mw>
	    <lb/>the actors in this unexpected event. The Major seem­
	    <lb/>ed not disposed to converse upon it; he was evidently
	    <lb/>chagrined, and retired soon after dinner to his own
	    <lb/>apartment; which <persName>Catherine</persName> heard him traverse with
	    <lb/>agitated steps, till long past midnight.</p>
          <p>The truth was, that he began to feel the inactive life
	    <lb/>which he led, becoming daily more irksome. Fond of
	    <lb/>his country and his profession, he could not see the
	    <lb/>prosperity of the one, or the honor of the other, threat­
	    <lb/>ened, without feeling himself called upon to lend what
	    <lb/>aid was in his power to their support. He detested,
	    <lb/>what he called the ingratitude of <placeName>America</placeName>; and he felt
	    <lb/>every tie which bound him to her, weakened by the re­
	    <lb/>sistance she was making to the authority of a superior
	    <lb/>and, as he thought, a just and righteous power. His
	    <lb/>national pride, also, was humbled by the triumph of her
	    <lb/>arms. Though she had conquered only the soldiers of
	    <lb/><placeName>Germany</placeName>, they were in the service of <placeName>England</placeName>, and
	    <lb/>should have proved themselves invincible. At such a
	    <lb/>moment too, it was peculiarly aggravating, when the
	    <lb/>contest seemed about to terminate in favour of the <name>Eng­
	    <lb/>lish</name>, who, assured of victory, despised the feeble army of
	    <lb/><placeName>America</placeName>, and reposed in security within their encamp­
	    <lb/>ments.</p>
          <p>The victory of <name>Trenton</name>, however, was but the com­
	    <lb/>mencement of a succession of victories, which reversed
	    <lb/>the good fortune of the British arms, drove them from
	    <lb/>their strong encampments, and obliged them to give up
	    <lb/>an offensive war, and think only of defending themselves
	    <lb/>from the frequent attacks of their resolute foe. It was
	    <lb/>the more galling to their pride to receive their constant
	    <lb/>defeats from a shattered army reduced almost to ex­
	    <lb/>tremity; while they were both powerful and well dis­
	    <lb/>ciplined.</p>
          <p>In the mean time the spring opened; and still <persName>Major
	      <lb/>Courtland</persName> remained undecided, whether or not to engage
	    <lb/>in active service. He was often solicited to do so, and
	    <lb/>by those, for whom he had the highest reverence and
	    <lb/>respect. <persName>General Burgoyne</persName>, whose friendship he had
	    <lb/>enjoyed in <placeName>England</placeName>, had several times written, urging
	    <pb n="25"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="3(1)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">25</mw>
	    <lb/>him to join in aiding the cause of his country; and
	    <lb/>since his appointment to the command of the Northern
	    <lb/>Army he had repeated his invitation, informing him,
	    <lb/>that he was authorized to bestow on him the same rank,
	    <lb/>as that which he had formerly held, or even a higher
	    <lb/>one if that would be any additional inducement to him.
	    <lb/>But it was not honor which <persName>Major Courtland</persName> coveted;
	    <lb/>the days of romantic enthusiasm were past with him,
	    <lb/>and a sincere wish to serve his country was the only
	    <lb/>motive that induced him again to engage in the ardu­
	    <lb/>ous duties of his profession. His anxious affection for
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName> was all that now caused him to hesitate;
	    <lb/>but even that at length yielded to what he considered
	    <lb/>the obligations of duty, and, before he informed her
	    <lb/>of his intention, he wrote to accept the appointment in
	    <lb/><persName>General Burgoyne's</persName> army, which was soon to com­
	    <lb/>mence its operations. He felt an extreme reluctance
	    <lb/>to speak with <persName>Catherine</persName> upon the decisive step which
	    <lb/>he had taken; but time pressed; there was not a mo­
	    <lb/>ment to be lost; his presence was even now required
	    <lb/>in the army; and anxious, before his departure to make
	    <lb/>some arrangements for the safety and comfort of his
	    <lb/>family, he one morning entered the apartment where
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName> was sitting alone at work, and communicated
	    <lb/>his projects with as much gentleness as possible.</p>
          <p>But with all his precaution, he was shocked to ob­
	    <lb/>serve the emotion which she betrayed, on receiving his
	    <lb/>intelligence. Her work fell from her hands, and with
	    <lb/>a countenance, on which grief and anxiety were strong­
	    <lb/>ly painted, she looked fixedly at him, without uttering
	    <lb/>a word. <persName>Major Courtland</persName> was sensible of his daughter's
	    <lb/>attachment to <placeName>America</placeName>; but he knew not its extent;
	    <lb/>neither was he aware of the intense interest, with which
	    <lb/>she watched the progress of the strife; nor that she
	    <lb/>had espoused the cause of the republicans, alike from
	    <lb/>principle and affection. When, therefore, he proceed­
	    <lb/>ed to state the nature of his feelings, and the motives
	    <lb/>which, after long deliberation, had induced him to take
	    <lb/>up arms, he was surprised at the vehemence, with
	    <mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(+3)">3</mw>

	    <milestone unit="sig" n="3(1)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">26</mw>
	    <lb/>which she answered him, and which seemed far greater
	    <lb/>than even the occasion warranted.</p>
          <p><said>My father, my dear father,</said> she exclaimed, with
	    <lb/>extreme emotion, <said>I entreat you to pause a moment
	      <lb/>before you arm against a land which ought to be so
	      <lb/>dear; which has been so long our happy dwelling-
	      <lb/>place; whose inhabitants are not to us like strangers,
	      <lb/>but amongst whom we have lived and interchanged the
	      <lb/>courtesies and endearing acts of sympathy and kindness.</said></p>
          <p><said><persName>Catherine</persName>, I have reflected many moments, and
	      <lb/>hesitated long before making this my final decision,</said>
	    said the Major; <said>but my country has a claim which
	      <lb/>cannot be denied, and I feel that I have too long delay­
	      <lb/>ed to grasp my sword at her defence.</said></p>
          <p><said>Better, my dear father, far better,</said> she exclaimed,
	    <lb/><said>to let the sword, once so bravely wielded, rust forever
	      <lb/>in its scabbard, than draw it forth in this unrighteous
	      <lb/>cause, and plunge it into the bleeding bosom of a coun­
	      <lb/>try, which claims from us, who have so long lived upon
	      <lb/>her soil, the affection and the gratitude of children.</said></p>
          <p><said>I love <placeName>America</placeName>,</said> said <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, <said>but I
	      <lb/>heartily detest her cause; and never shall my arm be
	      <lb/>raised to aid those daring rebels, who openly defy
	      <lb/>their king, and have dared to raise against him their
	      <lb/>standard of revolt.</said></p>
          <p><said>I do not ask you to aid them, father,</said> answered
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName>; <said>only preserve the neutrality which you
	      <lb/>have so long maintained; continue to enjoy with me
	      <lb/>our quiet retreat, and let us, at distance, only view the
	      <lb/>progress of the strife. Enough that your youth was
	      <lb/>spent in the service of your country; let the evening
	      <lb/>of life, my dear father, be devoted to gentler duties.
	      <lb/>Remember that filial affection has a claim, which, if
	      <lb/>dissolved, will leave your daughter friendless and deso­
	      <lb/>late indeed.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Major Courtland</persName> was touched by her pathetic plead­
	    <lb/>ing, but his honor was pledged, and he would not suf­
	    <lb/>fer his resolution to be shaken. Rallying his self-com­
	    <lb/>mand, and assuming a cheerful air, he said, after a mo­
	    <lb/>mentary pause,</p>
          <pb n="27"/>
          <milestone unit="sig" n="3(2)r"/>
          <mw type="pageNum">27</mw>
          <p>
            <said>You are a soldier's daughter, <persName>Catherine</persName>, and would
	      <lb/>you have your father shrink in the hour of peril from
	      <lb/>the performance of his duty. Rather seek to support
	      <lb/>and encourage him, than, by your repinings, render
	      <lb/>still more painful the trials incident to his profession.
	      <lb/>Such was your lamented mother's conduct, who never,
	      <lb/>in the most agonizing moments of separation, betrayed
	      <lb/>a feeling unworthy a soldier's wife, but cherished her
	      <lb/>husband's honor as her own, and endured, with smiling
	      <lb/>patience, the anxieties to which she was continually
	      <lb/>subjected.</said>
          </p>
          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> felt the full force of this reproof, gentle as
	    <lb/>it was, and rendered touching by the allusion to her
	    <lb/>mother. Her eyes filled with tears; but, brushing
	    <lb/>them hastily away, she said,</p>
          <p>
            <said>Danger and death are terrible, when connected in
	      <lb/>our minds with an object whom we love; but indeed,
	      <lb/>my dearest father, if I know my own heart, the appre­
	      <lb/>hension of these evils agitate it less than the dread of
	      <lb/>that crime which I fear you will commit, if you resolve
	      <lb/>to espouse the cause of <placeName>England</placeName>, and assist her to tri­
	      <lb/>umph over this bleeding and struggling land. It is like
	      <lb/>stabbing the mother who nurtured us; like betray­
	      <lb/>ing the friend to whom we are indebted for benefits,
	      <lb/>which have prolonged, and given sweetness to ex­
	      <lb/>istence.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>My dear girl,</said> returned <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, <said>I am
	      <lb/>grieved, but not surprised, at the strength of your at­
	      <lb/>tachment to this country. You can remember no other,
	      <lb/>and I have myself taught you to regard it with affection.
	      <lb/>But we view things differently; so very differently,
	      <lb/>that I fear our sentiments on this subject can never be
	      <lb/>reconciled. Of this, however, rest assured, that I am
	      <lb/>not ungrateful to this land, nor heedless of her welfare.
	      <lb/>But she has brought upon herself the chastisements
	      <lb/>under which she now suffers, and I consider it the duty
	      <lb/>of every friend to good order, and particularly of every
	      <lb/>true loyalist, to lend his aid in quelling her rebellious
	      <lb/>and aspiring spirit.</said></p>

          <p><said>Let those, who have never shared her bounties,
	      <lb/>turn their weapons against her,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>. <said>It
	      <lb/>cannot be required of you, father, to repay evil for the
	      <lb/>kindness you have received.</said></p>
          <p><said>I have indeed received many kindnesses,</said> returned
	    <lb/><persName>Major Courtland</persName>; <said>but notwithstanding all that I owe
	      <lb/>to this country, there is another, <persName>Catherine</persName>, to which I
	      <lb/>am under still deeper obligations: one to which I am
	      <lb/>indebted for birth, fortune, character, all that I possess,
	      <lb/>all that I am. And would you have me remain deaf to
	      <lb/>her call, calmly enjoying the ease of domestic quiet, or
	      <lb/>traitorously aiding the cause of those who ungratefully
	      <lb/>spurn her authority, and absurdly claim an indepen­
	      <lb/>dence which they never can support?</said></p>
          <p><said>My dear father,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, <said>pardon what I
	      <lb/>know you will term my obstinacy; but, till convinced
	      <lb/>that I am wrong, I must persist in the opinion, that
	      <lb/>whatever obligations you may fancy yourself under to
	      <lb/>the land of your nativity, you are bound by no tie of
	      <lb/>honor or of duty to assist her in a war of tyranny and op­
	      <lb/>pression.</said></p>
          <p><said>You are incorrigible, <persName>Catherine</persName>,</said> said the Major,
	    <lb/>smiling; <said>but we cannot hope to agree in principle,
	      <lb/>till we differ less widely in terms. We will discuss the
	      <lb/>subject no longer, at present: I will leave you to reflect
	      <lb/>upon it, and I trust your good sense and native rectitude
	      <lb/>of mind will convince you that I am not so deeply in
	      <lb/>the wrong as you appear to imagine me.</said></p>
          <p>He kissed her tenderly, as he concluded, and when
	    <lb/>he had quitted the room, <persName>Catherine</persName>, no longer able to
	    <lb/>restrain her feelings, burst into a flood of tears. All
	    <lb/>the happiness of her past life seemed at an end, and she
	    <lb/>looked forward into the gloomy and uncertain future,
	    <lb/>with a shuddering sensation of terror and dismay.</p>
          <p><persName>Major Courtland</persName>, however, had taken his resolution,
	    <lb/>and he remained inflexible. With all possible despatch
	    <lb/>he busied himself in preparations for his departure, and
	    <lb/>consulted with his daughter and niece (the latter of
	    <lb/>whom, by the removal of her father to a considerable
	    <lb/>distance, was not left entirely to his care) on the situ­

	    <mw type="pageNum">29</mw>
	    <lb/>ation which, during his absence, it would be most eli­
	    <lb/>gible for them to occupy. To leave them in his own
	    <lb/>house, surrounded by an army flushed with victory, and
	    <lb/>swelled with numbers of undisciplined and lawless mi­
	    <lb/>litia, was impossible; and, after long consideration, he
	    <lb/>adopted a plan, which struck him as the safest and best
	    <lb/>that could be devised.</p>
          <p>The <name>quakers</name> of that period were, in general, strenu­
	    <lb/>ous supporters of the royal cause: though, living in the
	    <lb/>midst of the republicans, they affected a strict neutrality,
	    <lb/>and forbore openly to violate their principles by taking
	    <lb/>up arms, yet, by secret means, they aided the <name>British</name>,
	    <lb/>and counteracted the <name>Americans</name> as much as they could,
	    <lb/>consistently with their own safety. To one of this sect,
	    <lb/>whom <persName>Major Courtland</persName> had long known and frequently
	    <lb/>befriended, he resolved to commit the care of <persName>Cathe­
	      <lb/>rine</persName> and her cousin, assured that they would find with
	      <lb/>him a safe and peaceable asylum, though it might be
	      <lb/>destitute of many of the pleasures and luxuries which
	      <lb/>they had been accustomed to enjoy. Another motive,
	      <lb/>which induced <persName>Major Courtland</persName> to make choice of the
	    <lb/><name>quaker's</name> protection, in preference to that of any one
	      <lb/>else, was, that he resided in <placeName>Albany</placeName>, at which place it
	    <lb/>was supposed the victorious armies of <persName>Howe</persName> and <persName>Bur­
	      <lb/>goyne</persName> were destined to meet and rejoice together in the
	    <lb/>success of their arms</p>
          <p>Unwilling to leave his house and lands exposed to
	    <lb/>desolation and pillage, and aware also of the danger of
	    <lb/>confiscation, to which, as the property of an avowed
	    <lb/>loyalist, they would certainly be liable, <persName>Major Courtland</persName>
	    <lb/>made a pretended sale of them to a friend, who, though
	    <lb/>he rather inclined towards the <name>Americans</name>, had ever
	    <lb/>preserved a strict neutrality, and who gladly exchanged
	    <lb/>his residence in the city for so quiet and sheltered a
	    <lb/>retreat.</p>
          <p>Having made these necessary arrangements, and left
	    <lb/>all his domestics, excepting <persName>Hugh</persName> and <persName>Martha</persName>, to the
	    <lb/>direction and service of the temporary occupant, <persName>Major
	      <lb/>Courtland</persName>, with <persName>Catherine</persName> and his niece, bade adieu
	    <lb/>for the present to the banks of the <placeName>Schuylkill</placeName>; and,

	    <lb/>having obtained permission to repair to <placeName>Albany</placeName>, they
	    <lb/>proceeded with all possible expedition towards the
	    <lb/>place of their destination. They reached it without
	    <lb/>incident and in safety, and after seeing his charge
	    <lb/>comfortably situated beneath the hospitable roof of the
	    <lb/><name>quaker</name>, <persName>Richard Hope</persName>, <persName>Major Courtland</persName> bade them
	    <lb/>farewell, and hastened to join the army of <persName>General

          <p>The family of Mr., or as he was usually called,
	    <lb/><persName>Richard Hope</persName>, consisted of himself, his wife, and two
	    <lb/>domestics; a stout Dutch girl, whose broad, thick-set
	    <lb/>form indicated uncommon strength, though it did not
	    <lb/>promise all that agility which she really possessed; and
	    <lb/>a boy, who served in the several capacities of butler,
	    <lb/>groom, and waiter.</p>
          <p><persName>Mr. Hope</persName> was a pacific, precise, good-hearted man,
	    <lb/>and, being under obligations of some weight to <persName>Major
	      <lb/>Courtland</persName>, thought he could never be sufficiently kind
	    <lb/>and assiduous towards those members of his family
	    <lb/>whom the Major had placed under his protection. In­
	    <lb/>dependent of any personal obligation, however, <persName>Richard
	      <lb/>Hope</persName>, to do him justice, would, from native benevo­
	    <lb/>lence of feeling, and the influence of religious principle,
	    <lb/>have exercised all the rites of kindness and hospitality
	    <lb/>towards his new inmates. He was an ardent loyalist,
	    <lb/>and he entered more warmly into the interests of the
	    <lb/>cause, and expressed his sentiments oftentimes with
	    <lb/>more asperity than became the mild and peaceful cha­
	    <lb/>racter of the tenets which he professed. <persName>Catherine</persName>

	    <lb/>sedulously avoided any discussion of the subject.
	    <lb/>Since her father had openly espoused the royal cause,
	    <lb/>she felt unwilling to express opinions which might ap­
	    <lb/>pear like censures upon his conduct, and she listened in
	    <lb/>silence to the <name>Quaker's</name> eulogiums and denunciations, or
	    <lb/>answered only by playful ridicule directed against his
	    <lb/>zeal, which he bore with unmoved complacency. In
	    <lb/>truth his invincible good humor seemed proof against
	    <lb/>all attacks, and, <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">let good or ill betide,</quote> his temper
	    <lb/>retained the same unruffled serenity, and his features
	    <lb/>the same placid smile, as if nothing unusual had occur­
	    <lb/>red. Even his harshest invectives were uttered with a
	    <lb/>quiet look, and in a monotonous tone, which contrasted
	    <lb/>ludicrously with the tenor of his words, and, in fact,
	    <lb/>destroyed one half of their effect. But he deemed it
	    <lb/>unbecoming a follower of <persName>William Penn</persName>, as he said, to
	    <lb/>let every idle wind ruffle his serenity, and this opinion,
	    <lb/>strictly adhered to, had made him a complete machine.</p>
          <p><persName>Mrs. Hope's</persName> equanimity was not quite so uniform,
	    <lb/>as he husband's; for, though she made him her exam­
	    <lb/>ple, and believed him as near perfection, as it was pos­
	    <lb/>sible for mortal to attain, yet she found it difficult,
	    <lb/>amidst the multiplicity of domestic cares and anxieties,
	    <lb/>always to preserve the placid and quiet look, peculiar
	    <lb/>to her sect. It was through <persName>Major Courtland's</persName> influ­
	    <lb/>ence with the father of <persName>Mrs. Hope</persName>, that he had been
	    <lb/>induced to consent to her marriage with a <name>quaker</name>, for
	    <lb/>whose love, she had forsaken the faith in which she had
	    <lb/>been educated, and embraced the tenets of her lover;
	    <lb/>and to these tenets she had ever since adhered, with
	    <lb/>the most scrupulous fidelity, as if fearful that the purity
	    <lb/>of her motives might be questioned, should she deviate
	    <lb/>in the slightest degree from the line of conduct, which
	    <lb/>her new profession enjoined.</p>
          <p>The habitation of this inoffensive couple was situat­
	    <lb/>ed about a mile from the city, on the bank of the <placeName>Hud­
	      <lb/>son</placeName>. Though a gothic Dutch building, it was both
	    <lb/>pleasant and convenient. It was surrounded by
	    <lb/>shrubbery, and the small but tastefully arranged garden,
	    <lb/>gay with flowers and shaded with fruit trees, which

	    <mw type="pageNum">32</mw>
	    <lb/>overarched the walks, was the frequent and favourite
	    <lb/>resort of <persName>Catherine</persName> and her cousin. On the terraced
	    <lb/>roof of a pretty summer-house, at the bottom of the
	    <lb/>garden, whence the prospect was seen spreading itself
	    <lb/>out in all the luxuriance and sublimity of nature, they
	    <lb/>passed many delightful hours. They had brought with
	    <lb/>them a selection of books, and <persName>Mr. Hope</persName> furnished them
	    <lb/>with such as he was able to procure. Indeed he exert­
	    <lb/>ed himself greatly to contribute to their happiness;
	    <lb/>frequently accompanying them in little excursions round
	    <lb/>the country, and in short sails upon the <placeName>Hudson</placeName>, which
	    <lb/>rolled its <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">world of waters</quote> so near the garden wall,
	    <lb/>that the crews of the vessels and small boats which
	    <lb/>glided past, could easily be distinguished from the
	    <lb/>summer house. <persName>Catherine</persName> and <persName>Amelia</persName> loved to watch
	    <lb/>them in the bright and balmy evenings, which are so
	    <lb/>common in <placeName>America</placeName> during the summer months; their
	    <lb/>tall masts and white shrouds partially silvered by the
	    <lb/>moon beams, the water sparkling and rippling beneath
	    <lb/>their keels, while the deep-toned voices of the sailors,
	    <lb/>and the shrill whistle of the boatswain were the only
	    <lb/>sounds that broke upon the profound stillness of the night.</p>
          <p><persName>Amelia</persName> was solicitous about her father, from whom
	    <lb/>she seldom heard and never very directly or particularly;
	    <lb/>but she was naturally of an easy and contented disposi­
	    <lb/>tion; and since her residence in <placeName>America</placeName>, she had been
	    <lb/>so accustomed to his absence, and had so often seen him
	    <lb/>return from the most desperate battles in safety, that
	    <lb/>she sought to stifle every anxious thought, and indulged
	    <lb/>the hope that she should soon welcome him again, safe
	    <lb/>and unhurt, from all the perils to which he had been ex­
	    <lb/>posed. Thus lulling her apprehensions, she appeared
	    <lb/>cheerful and even happy; often speaking of her father,
	    <lb/>and looking forward, with hope, to the period, when
<lb/>she should again see him.</p>
          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> observed with surprise her cousin's free­
	    <lb/>dom from all inquietude; but she was too considerate
	    <lb/>to insinuate a word which might awaken it. Her own
	    <lb/>anxiety was very great; but, unwilling to disturb the
	    <lb/>serenity which <persName>Amelia</persName> was enjoying, and which she
	    <pb n="33"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="3(5)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">33</mw>
	    <lb/>thought might be soon and fatally interrupted, she stu­
	    <lb/>diously repressed her feelings, and, supported by the
	    <lb/>native strength and bouyancy of her mind, she appeared
	    <lb/>always animated and cheerful, though in secret she had
	    <lb/>many fears and painful anticipations to distress her.</p>
          <p>By means of the loyalists and their emisaries, she re­
	    <lb/>ceived through <persName>Mr. Hope</persName> frequent tidings from her father,
	    <lb/>who, animated by the cause in which he was engaged,
	    <lb/>and happy to be again actively employed in the duties
	    <lb/>of his profession, wrote to <persName>Catherine</persName> in the gayest man­
	    <lb/>ner possible, recounted the victories their arms were
	    <lb/>gaining in the north, and intimated that, before a long
	    <lb/>time had elapsed, the royal armies of <placeName>Canada</placeName> and <placeName>New
	      <lb/>York</placeName> would dine together in <placeName>Albany</placeName>. As <persName>Catherine</persName>
	    <lb/>finished reading the letter which so confidently an­
	    <lb/>nounced the probability of this event, she could not
	    <lb/>suppress a deep sigh, which burst almost involuntarily
	    <lb/>from her bosom. <persName>Mr. Hope</persName>, who sat reading in the
	    <lb/>room, was startled by it, and raising his eyes from the
	    <lb/>book, he regarded her attentively some moments. She
	    <lb/>sat against an open window, her head resting on her
	    <lb/>hand, while the crimson twilight which had succeeded
	    <lb/>a glorious sunset threw its soft reflection upon her face
	    <lb/>and figure. Her eyes were fixed upon the western
	    <lb/>sky, but there was sadness in their expression, and the
	    <lb/>glowing animation of her countenance was softened in­
	    <lb/>to a deep and touching melancholy. <said>Alas! that so
	      <lb/>much loveliness must fade so soon,</said> thought the good
	    <lb/><name>quaker</name>, as, yielding to the impulse of admiration, he
	    <lb/>earnestly regarded the beautiful girl before him. An­
	    <lb/>other sigh from <persName>Catherine</persName> still heavier than the first
	    <lb/>disturbed his contemplation, and, hastily laying down
	    <lb/>his book, he rose from his chair and approached her.
	    <lb/><said>Art thou ill or unhappy, <persName>Catherine</persName>,</said> he said, <said>that
	      <lb/>thou givest vent to sighs so deep and frequent?</said></p>
          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> started at this unexpected address, but in­
	    <lb/>stantly replied, <said>I am not ill, I thank you, my kind
	      <lb/>friend, but</said>—and she glanced upon the still open pages
	    <lb/>of the letter. <said>I fear for my father's safety, and can I
	      <lb/>be at ease?</said></p>

          <p><said>Thy father has been in many battles,</said> said the
	    <lb/><name>quaker</name>, <said>and He who giveth victory hath not yet suf­
	      <lb/>fered him to fall.</said></p>
          <p><said>I know it well,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, <said>and I do no dis­
	      <lb/>trust his goodness, but yet</said>――</p>
          <p><said>But yet,</said> said <persName>Mr. Hope</persName>, interrupting her, <said>thou
	      <lb/>dost wish that thou couldst take the guidance of affairs
	      <lb/>into thine own hands, and hasten the issue according to
	      <lb/>thy own desires, dost thou not?</said></p>
          <p><said>I trust I am not so vain and impious as that,</said>, said
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName>, <said>but I do wish, <persName>Mr. Hope</persName>, that my father
	      <lb/>had never taken part in this unhappy quarrel.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Mr. Hope</persName> gazed at her a moment, as if doubting
	    <lb/>whether he had understood her right, then exclaimed
	    <lb/>with unwonted vehemence,</p>
          <p>
            <said><persName>Catherine Courtland</persName>, dost thou know what thou art
	      <lb/>saying? Thou knowest that thy liberties are threatened,
	      <lb/>that thy country's glory and thy sovereign's honor are
	      <lb/>at stake, and dost thou wish that thy father had remain­
	      <lb/>ed to behold the waves of the <placeName>Schuylkill</placeName> crimsoned with
	      <lb/>the blood of thy countrymen, and to see them driven
	      <lb/>from its banks by a host of rebels and of traitors?</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>I wish,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, calmly, <said>that the peaceful
	      <lb/>sentiments of <persName>William Penn</persName> would influence mankind
	      <lb/>to throw aside the implements of death, and cease from
	      <lb/>desolating the fair inheritance which God has given
	      <lb/>them, by deeds of murder and ferocity.</said></p>
          <p><said>Thou speakest with a wisdom far above thy years,</said><lb/>said the <name>quaker</name>, conscience-struck by this allusion to the
	    <lb/>venerated <persName>Penn</persName>, and aware that, if it was a crime to take
	    <lb/>up arms, he had sinned most grievously in will, though
	    <lb/>he had not dared to do so in deed.  <said>God hasten that
	      <lb/>happy period,</said> he added after a brief pause, and in a
	    <lb/>tone of solemnity, <said>when wars and fightings shall cease
	      <lb/>in the earth, and every man shall sit under his own vine
	      <lb/>and fig tree, without any to molest and make him afraid.</said>
	    <lb/><said>Yet thou must acknowledge, <persName>Catherine</persName>, that were it
	      <lb/>lawful ever to resist evil, it would be so now.</said></p>
          <p><said>It would indeed,</said> she answered, <said>and may God
	      <lb/>prosper the just cause.</said></p>

          <p><said>Amen!</said> ejaculated the <name>quaker</name>, and quietly resumed
	    <lb/>his book; while <persName>Catherine</persName>, smiling at his want of pen­
	    <lb/>etration, folded her letter, and rose to quit the room.</p>
          <p>Wrapped in melancholy reflections, she walked slow­
	    <lb/>ly into the garden and resorted to her favourite station,
	    <lb/>upon the flat roof of the summer-house. The day had
	    <lb/>been unusually sultry, and the gorgeous hues, which
	    <lb/>at sunset had colored the western sky, were rapidly
	    <lb/>changing into dark, and threatening clouds, which were
	    <lb/>every instant rent by vivid flashes of lightning, follow­
	    <lb/>ed by heavy peals of thunders. The wind swept, in
	    <lb/>fitful gusts, over the surface of the <placeName>Hudson</placeName>, whose dark
	    <lb/>waves, crested with foam, broke in quick succession
	    <lb/>against the shore; every billow rising higher than the
	    <lb/>last, and lashing the banks with accumulated fury. The
	    <lb/>ancient forests which for ages had battled with the
	    <lb/>elements bowed their tall heads to the earth and spread
	    <lb/>forth their broad arms as if bidding defiance to the
	    <lb/>tempest, and warding off the fire of heaven, which
	    <lb/>threatened every moment to sear the brightness of their
	    <lb/>verdure, and uproot them from the soil where they had
	    <lb/>so long flourished, drinking in the light and dew of
	    <lb/>heaven and stretching forth their branches with the
	    <lb/>vigor and majesty of beauty.</p>
          <p>A scene of so much sublimity could not be viewed
	    <lb/>with indifference by the enthusiastic and high-minded
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName>. The subject of her bitter and anxious
	    <lb/>meditation was forgotten, and with a feeling of raptur­
	    <lb/>ous exaltation, which few have felt and none can
	    <lb/>describe, she watched the progress of the tempest.
	    <lb/>Reckless of all personal danger and inconvenience, she
	    <lb/>leaned, lost in admiration, over the terrace; the spray
	    <lb/>of the angry billows moistened her face, but she regard­
	    <lb/>ed nothing, save the grandeur of the spectacle, which
	    <lb/>nature, wrapped in clouds, and agitated by the stormy
	    <lb/>winds of heaven, presented her. As she looked upon
	    <lb/>the frightful agitation of the waters, illuminated by the
	    <lb/>lurid flashes which incessantly played upon their sur­
	    <lb/>face, she suddenly perceived a small canoe struggling
	    <lb/>with the waves, now lost between their dreadful gulfs,
	    <pb n="36"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="3(6)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">36</mw>
	    <lb/>and then riding triumphantly upon their foaming sum­
	    <lb/>mits. What a situation for a human being! Death
	    <lb/>seemed inevitable, and <persName>Catherine</persName> shuddered, as with
	    <lb/>intense interest she watched the progress of the frail
	    <lb/>bark, amid the perils which surrounded it.</p>
          <p>At length, it gained a point opposite the summer-
	    <lb/>house, and seemed nearing the shore. As it approached
	    <lb/>the land, she perceived, by the vivid light which stream­
	    <lb/>ed from the heavens, that it was occupied by a solitary
	    <lb/>individual, who, as he guided its course, chanted in a
	    <lb/>clear and steady voice, which betrayed no symptoms
	    <lb/>of fear, a song, of which <persName>Catherine</persName> was able only to
	    <lb/>distinguish an occasional word of line. The chants
	    <lb/>were short, after the Indian manner, with pauses be­
	    <lb/>tween; but the distinct and sonorous tone, in which
	    <lb/>they were uttered, enabled her without much difficulty
	    <lb/>at length to catch the following words.</p>
          <p>
            <said>Bound swiftly over the waters! Speed on thy
	      <lb/>course, my light canoe! The waves are dark, and the
	      <lb/>winds arise in their futy! No longer I behold the blue
	      <lb/>heavens! Clouds darken the skies, and the stars are
	      <lb/>quenched in darkness!</said>
          </p>
          <p>These words, sung in a strain of wild, but not unpleas­
	    <lb/>ing melody, were several times repeated; others too
	    <lb/>were added, which the noise of the tempest rendered
	    <lb/>unintelligible, if indeed they were pronounced in <name>Eng­
	    <lb/>lish</name>: to <persName>Catherine</persName>, they seemed to be in a different and
	    <lb/>unknown language. In the mean time, the canoe rapid­
	    <lb/>ly approached the shore dancing like a fairy skiff over
	    <lb/>the furious billows, till it touched the strand and was
	    <lb/>safely moored beneath a group of trees, which over­
	    <lb/>hung the water. The song then ceased, and the voy­
	    <lb/>ager, leaping from his frail vessel, began to ascend the
	    <lb/>somewhat precipitous and wooded bank of the river.
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName> watched him intently, though he was frequent­
	    <lb/>ly lost from her view in the intervals of darkness which
	    <lb/>succeeded the vivid glare of the lightning. At length
	    <lb/>he suddenly disappeared among the trees; but she still
	    <lb/>looked earnestly forth, hoping to catch another view of
	    <lb/>his person.</p>
          <pb n="37"/>
          <milestone unit="sig" n="4(1)r"/>
          <mw type="pageNum">37</mw>
          <p>The fury of the tempest was abating, and <persName>Catherine</persName>
	    <lb/>watched in the expectation of seeing the stranger un­
	    <lb/>moor his boat and proceed upon his voyage, when sud­
	    <lb/>denly the same wild and plaintive chant, which she had
	    <lb/>heard upon the waters, arose from beneath the very
	    <lb/>wall of the summer-house. She bent eagerly over the
	    <lb/>terrace and beheld the object of her curiosity reclining
	    <lb/>at the foot of an oak which the lightnings of some pre­
	    <lb/>ceding tempest had blasted. A bright flash played
	    <lb/>upon his person, as she gazed, and revealed to her as­
	    <lb/>tonished eyes the dusky complexion and savage attire
	    <lb/>of an <name>Indian</name>. He reclined upon the ground with his
	    <lb/>head resting against the massy trunk of the oak, appar­
	    <lb/>ently watching the lightnings as they played among the
	    <lb/>clouds. His bow and quiver of arrows were lying be­
	    <lb/>side him, and a cloak formed of feathers was parted at
	    <lb/>the breast, so as to display a profusion of beads and
	    <lb/>silver ornaments, with which the Indian tribes are fond
	    <lb/>of decorating their persons. An instinctive horror froze
	    <lb/>the blood of <persName>Catherine</persName>, at sight of this savage being.
	    <lb/>She had heard so much of the atrocious cruelties, com­
	    <lb/>mitted by these daring natives of the forest, that she
	    <lb/>could not behold one of them, without fear and aversion.
	    <lb/>Several of their tribes, she well knew, were in league
	    <lb/>with her countrymen; but what barbarous excesses
	    <lb/>had they not committed! Urged on by a love of
	    <lb/>plunder and a thirst for human blood, they had, in
	    <lb/>many instances, turned their weapons against their allies,
	    <lb/>and basely betrayed the cause, which they had sworn
	    <lb/>to serve. The recent murder of the lovely and unfor­
	    <lb/>tunate <persName>Miss McRea</persName>, by two of these savages, had filled
	    <lb/>every breast with pity and consternation. The fright­
	    <lb/>ful deed was now present to the mind of <persName>Catherine</persName>,
	    <lb/>with all its aggravated circumstances, and, while she
	    <lb/>looked upon the <name>Indian</name>, she shuddered, as if she actual­
	    <lb/>ly beheld the perp<choice><sic>r</sic><corr/></choice>etrator of the cruel act before her.
	    <lb/>Struck with the loneliness of her situation, and her te­
	    <lb/>merity in remaining so long exposed to the danger of
	    <lb/>discovery, she turned with the intention of effecting an
	    <lb/>instant retreat, when she heard the voice of <persName>Mr. Hope</persName>
	    <mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(+3)">4</mw>

	    <lb/>in conversation with a stranger advancing along the
	    <lb/>walk, and she sat down to wait till they passed.
	    <lb/>Aware that the garden gate was locked, she of course
	    <lb/>imagined the entrance of the <name>Indian</name> to be impracticable,
	    <lb/>and she felt no other uneasiness than that arising from
	    <lb/>her vicinity to so savage a being. But she was vexed
	    <lb/>when <persName>Mr. Hope</persName> and his companion, instead of passing
	    <lb/>into another walk, entererd the summer-house; and un­
	    <lb/>willing to interrupt what seemed to be an earnest con­
	    <lb/>ference, she submitted to the necessity of remaining
	    <lb/>where she was, till they had quitted the building.</p>
          <p>The storm had passed away without rain, and the
	    <lb/>moon struggled at intervals through the broken clouds
	    <lb/>whose huge black masses seemed to impede her pro­
	    <lb/>gress, and still shrouded the heavens in partial darkness.
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName> dared not to bend over the terrace to take
	    <lb/>another view of the <name>Indian</name>, whose song was hushed in­
	    <lb/>to silence, but she could easily perceive his canoe float­
	    <lb/>ing as far as the rope by which it was moored would
	    <lb/>permit, and then dashed upon the shore with violence
	    <lb/>by the returning wave.</p>
          <p>From the contemplation of this object she was arous­
	    <lb/>ed by the import of some words which reached her from
	    <lb/>below. They related to a subject which had been pre­
	    <lb/>viously discussed in her presence, and she of course felt
	    <lb/>herself guilty of no breach of honor, in choosing rather
	    <lb/>to remain an invisible auditor, than to intrude upon a con­
	    <lb/>ference which seemed so interesting to the speakers.
	    <lb/>She judged it improbable that the <name>Indian</name> would be able
	    <lb/>to comprehend what was said, even supposing it possi­
	    <lb/>ble for him to hear through a wall of several feet in
	    <lb/>thickness, and while the agitated waters still roared with
	    <lb/>a tremendous noise; and therefore, deeming it unne­
	    <lb/>cessary to apprize <persName>Mr. Hope</persName> of his vicinity, she remain­
	    <lb/>ed stationary, while the following conversation passed
	    <lb/>in the apartment below.</p>
          <p><said>But <persName>Jacob</persName>,</said> said <persName>Mr. Hope</persName> in a persuasive tone,

	      <lb/>ings of the evils which are threatening to fall upon them.</said></p>

	      <lb/>mander in the service of the rebels, is meditating an
	      <lb/>attack upon the outposts, between the northern ex­
	      <lb/>tremity of <placeName>Lake George</placeName>, and the fortress of <placeName>Ticondero­
		<lb/>ga</placeName>; and if he proves successful, he will not only gain
	      <lb/>the command of the lake, but also cut off all means
	      <lb/>of communication between the royal army and <placeName>Canada</placeName>.
	      <lb/>This, as thou well knowest, is a circumstance of so
	      <lb/>much importance, that I would go myself, were it pos­
	      <lb/>sible, even without the hope of reward, rather than not
	      <lb/>have it known to those whom it so nearly concerns.</said></p>
          <p><said>Then, <persName>Richard Hope</persName>,</said> answered the other <name>Quaker</name>,
	    <lb/>for such his speech bespoke hom to be, <said>thou must
	      <lb/>even go thyself, or find some other emissary to do thy
	      <lb/>errand. We are men of peace, and it becometh not us
	      <lb/>to meddle with these dealers in human blood. He
	      <lb/>that taketh the sword shall perish by the sword; and
	      <lb/>this may be our miserable end, if we depart from our
	      <lb/>profession, and hold communion with these sons of
	      <lb/><persName>Belial</persName>.</said></p>
          <p><said>But is it not to prevent the flowing forth of human
	      <lb/>blood, that I send thee with this despatch?</said> asked <persName>Mr.
	      <lb/>Hope</persName>. <said>If the rumour of this projected enterprise is
	      <lb/>known, the plans of the rebels will be of course defeat­
	      <lb/>ed, and thus the lives of many will be saved, who
	      <lb/>would else fall victims to the surprise of an unexpected
	      <lb/>attack.</said></p>
          <p><said>Thou sayest true in that,</said> answered the other, after
	    <lb/>a pause of several minutes; <said>but what, if I consent to
	      <lb/>do thy errand, is to be my recompense for time and
	      <pb n="40"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="4(2)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">40</mw>
	      <lb/>labour spent in traversing mountains, forests, and marsh­
	      <lb/>es, which no human foot, save that of the lurking spy,
	      <lb/>or wild <name>Indian</name>, has ever dared to tread? Thou know­
	      <lb/>est that my portion of worldly wealth is small, and Heav­
	      <lb/>en has given me children and a wife to feed and clothe.</said></p>
          <p><said>Five pounds sterling from my own purse;</said> said <persName>Mr.
	      <lb/>Hope</persName>, <said>in addition to the sum already offered thee,
	      <lb/>shall be thine, if thou will promise faithfully to execute
	      <lb/>the trust committed to thy care, and will hasten back
	      <lb/>with all the speed which thou canst make.</said></p>
          <p><said>Give me then the packet,</said> said the <name>Quaker</name>; <said>to­
	      <lb/>morrow before day break I shall depart; and in four
	      <lb/>days, if God speed me on my way, thou wilt see me
	      <lb/>again before thee to claim the promised reward.</said></p>
          <p><said>And thou shalt have it, if thou hast faithfully fulfil­
	      <lb/>ed thy commission,</said> said <persName>Mr. Hope</persName>; <said>but thou must
	      <lb/>go forth to-night, <persName>Jacob</persName>; time and tide wait for no man,
	      <lb/>as thou well knowest; and when affairs of life and death
	      <lb/>are depending, it is not fit that thou shouldst wait for
	      <lb/>them. But come first with me; I have those beneath
	      <lb/>my roof, who, it may be, will wish to charge thee with
	      <lb/>a token of affection to one who is dear to them, in the
	      <lb/>camp, whither thou art going; and <persName>Susannah Hope</persName> will
	      <lb/>furnish thee with such wholesome viands, as shall be
	      <lb/>necessary to sustain thee, during thy toilsome journey.</said></p>
          <p>During this dialogue, the clouds had nearly all rolled
	    <lb/>away towards the east, and the moon was now shining
	    <lb/>bright in the clam blue heavens. The <name>Indian's</name> canoe
	    <lb/>remained moored beneath the trees, and <persName>Catherine</persName>,
	    <lb/>surprised that he had not resumed his voyage, bent
	    <lb/>cautiously over the terrace to ascertain if he were still
	    <lb/>beneath the wall. But she started hastily back when
	    <lb/>she beheld him standing close to the garden wall, one
	    <lb/>hand resting upon it and his head bent forward, as if
	    <lb/>intently listening to the conversation of the <name>Quakers</name>.
	    <lb/>She quickly descended the stairs to inform them of their
	    <lb/>singular auditor; but before <persName>Mr. Hope</persName>, who with his
	    <lb/>companion was on the point of quitting the summer-house,
	    <lb/>could express his surprise at her unexpected appear­
	    <lb/>ance, the <name>Indian</name>, with the agility peculiar to his race,
	    <pb n="41"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="4(3)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">41</mw>
	    <lb/>had leaped over the garden wall, and now stood in sav­
	    <lb/>age majesty before the amazed <name>Quakers</name>.</p>
          <p>His cloak formed of the plumage of the most beauti­
	    <lb/>ful birds, curiously sewed together, after the manner of
	    <lb/>the <name>Indians</name>, exhibited a gay variety of colours, as it
	    <lb/>glanced in the bright moonlight, and, falling gracefully
	    <lb/>from his shoulders, revealed a form of unrivalled symme­
	    <lb/>try, whose exquisite proportions might well have served
	    <lb/>a sculptor for the model of an <persName>Apollo</persName>. His counte­
	    <lb/>nance was noble and dignified, and as he fixed his piercing
	    <lb/>eyes upon the group who stood motionless before him,
	    <lb/>awe and admiration filled the mind of <persName>Catherine</persName>, and
	    <lb/>banished every vestige of that fear and abhorrence,
	    <lb/>with which she had regarded him, during the violence
	    <lb/>of the tempest.</p>
          <p><said>Who art thou, friend?</said> at length asked <persName>Mr<choice><sic/><corr>.</corr></choice> Hope</persName>,
	    <lb/>recovering from the surprise which had at first enchain­
	    <lb/>ed his faculties. <said>Who art thou, and why dost thou
	      <lb/>intrude upon the privacy of our retirement?</said></p>
          <p><said>Who am I, dost thou ask?</said> exclaimed the <name>Indian</name>
	    <lb/>in pure <name>English</name>, and breaking at once into the forcible
	    <lb/>and figurative language peculiar to his race. <said>Who
	      <lb/>am I! Seest thou yon blasted oak, stripped of his hon­
	      <lb/>ors, and seared by the lightnings of heaven? Such am
	      <lb/>I; seared and blasted; stripped of my verdure and my
	      <lb/>blossoms, and left a useless trunk in the midst of the
	      <lb/>green and thriving stocks around me. Why, dost thou
	      <lb/>ask, come I hither? I come to warn thee, <persName>Richard Hope</persName>,
	      <lb/>thee, a man of peace, to beware how thou treatest with
	      <lb/>those who love war, and trade in human blood. Thou
	      <lb/>hast nothing to do with these things; give me thy
	      <lb/>papers, and bid thy messenger depart to his home.</said></p>
          <p><said>Friend, thou dost make a demand which I cannot
	      <lb/>grant,</said> answered <persName>Mr. Hope</persName>; <said>my papers are important,
	      <lb/>and what assurance have I that thou wilt deliver them
	      <lb/>in safety to him for whom they are designed?</said></p>
          <p><said>Thou hast none,</said> returned the <name>Indian</name>, <said>but since
	      <lb/>I know the tidings thou wouldst send, thinkest thou thy
	      <lb/>messenger can travel in safety where my red brethren
	      <lb/>may lie in ambush to entrap him?</said></p>

          <p><persName>Jacob</persName> shrunk back with a look of horror at this men­
	    <lb/>acing intimation, secretly resolving that no promise of
	    <lb/>reward, however great, should induce him to risk his
	    <lb/>life in the adventure. <persName>Mr. Hope</persName>, without observing the
	    <lb/>alarmed gesture of his intended emissary, said to the
	    <lb/><name>Indian</name>,</p>
          <p>
            <said>Then thou dost not join thy brethren in aiding the
	      <lb/><name>English</name>, but clingest to the cause of <placeName>America</placeName>?</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>I am an <name>American</name>,</said> answered the <name>Indian</name> in a tone
	    <lb/>of proud and energetic feeling, which thrilled through
	    <lb/>the heart of <persName>Catherine</persName>; <said>I love peace,</said> he continued,
	    <lb/><said>and I wished to obey the fathers of this nation, who
	      <lb/>commanded our tribes to remain quiet and take no part
	      <lb/>in the quarrel of their white brothers. But my red
	      <lb/>brethren were angry, because I would not follow them
	      <lb/>to battle, and they came in wrath to my cabin. All
	      <lb/>perished, all that I loved! The mother and five brave
	      <lb/>sons! But the murderers did not escape. They were
	      <lb/>smitten by a strong arm; they fell to the earth like
	      <lb/>trees of the forest before the tempests of heaven! And
	      <lb/>he who avenged the wrongs of <persName>Ohmeina</persName> shall never be
	      <lb/>betrayed. Give me then thy papers, for thou canst not
	      <lb/>send them in safety to the English camp.</said></p>
          <p><said>Thou canst not wrest them from me,</said> answered
	    <lb/><persName>Mr. Hope</persName>, resolved not to yield them to the savage;
	    <lb/><said>and since thou already knowest their contents, why
	      <lb/>dost thou request me to deliver them up?</said></p>
          <p><said>I would take them to prevent thy messenger from
	      <lb/>going,</said> answered the <name>Indian</name>; <said>yet send him if thou
	      <lb/>wilt; I know every pass of the mountains, every rest­
	      <lb/>ing place of the forests, the course of all the streams;
	      <lb/>and dost thou think he can escape the ambush which
	      <lb/>I shall spread for him? Yes, send him, <persName>Richard
		<lb/>Hope</persName>,</said> he repeated in a stern and menacing tone, <said>but I
	      <lb/>bid thee beware of what shall follow; my eye shall
	      <lb/>watch thee, and the red man of the forest shall bear
	      <lb/>thee where thou canst not again betray thy country­
	      <lb/>men.</said></p>
          <p><said>Give him the papers,</said> exclaimed the trembling
	    <lb/><persName>Jacob</persName>; <said>I will not be thy messenger, friend <persName>Richard</persName>,

	      <milestone unit="sig" n="4(4)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">43</mw>
	      <lb/>and thou wilt bring the blood of the innocent upon thy
	      <lb/>head, if thou persistest in thy mad design. Again I tell
	      <lb/>thee, leave these men of strife to reap the fruits of their
	      <lb/>folly; we have no portion with them, and why should
	      <lb/>we depart from the precepts of our faith to do them
	      <lb/>service?</said></p>
          <p><said>Verily, <persName>Jacob</persName>, thou speakest with power and with
	      <lb/>effect,</said> said <persName>Mr. Hope</persName>, intimidated by the menaces of
	    <lb/>the <name>Indian</name>, and stung with a consciousness, that he was
	    <lb/>taking an active part in concerns which his religion
	    <lb/>taught him to abhor.</p>
          <p><said>I cannot,</said> he said, addressing the <name>Indian</name>, <said>give
	      <lb/>thee these papers, because they are not mine, but en­
	      <lb/>trusted to me by another; but I will return them to him,
	      <lb/>from whom they were received, and endeavor to pre­
	      <lb/>vent their being sent, by declaring the perils which
	      <lb/>await the messenger, on condition that thou wilt not
	      <lb/>attempt the violence which thou hast threatened against
	      <lb/>me.</said></p>
          <p><said>See then that thou dost keep thy word,</said> said the
	    <lb/><name>Indian</name>, <said>and no evil shall befall thee; but if thou break­
	      <lb/>est it, beware the vengeance of <persName>Ohmeina</persName>!</said></p>
          <p>So saying, he gathered his cloak around him and
	    <lb/>bounded lightly over the garden wall. <persName>Catherine</persName>, who
	    <lb/>had been deeply interested in this singular interview;
	    <lb/>and, impressed by the bold and noble bearing, the for­
	    <lb/>cible language, and authoritative manner of the <name>Indian</name>,
	    <lb/>ran to the top of the summer-house to observe his far­
	    <lb/>ther motions. He had already reached the brink of the
	    <lb/>river; the canoe was loosed from its moorings; the
	    <lb/>voyager sprang lightly into it, and pushing it from the
	    <lb/>shore, it bounded gaily over the moonlight waters.
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName>, absorbed by reflection, watched its course
	    <lb/>till the frail bark had diminished to a speck, that soon
	    <lb/>became imperceptible in the distance. She then re­
	    <lb/>turned to the house, whither the <name>Quakers</name> had gone im­
	    <lb/>mediately after the departure of the <name>Indian</name>. She found
	    <lb/><persName>Mrs. Hope</persName> and <persName>Amelia</persName> listening to the recital of the
	    <lb/>evening's adventure, and while they congratulated them­
	    <lb/>selves, that they had not been witnesses of the singular
	    <pb n="44"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="4(4)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">44</mw>
	    <lb/>scene, she expressed the pleasure which it had afforded
	    <lb/>her, and dwelt with so much enthusiasm on the grace
	    <lb/>and dignity of the <name>Indian's</name> manner and appearance,
	    <lb/>that <persName>Amelia</persName> inquired, with surprise and displeasure, how
	    <lb/>it was possible she could have felt one emotion of de­
	    <lb/>light in the presence of so savage a being.</p>
          <p>On the following morning <persName>Mr. Hope</persName>, agreeably to
	    <lb/>his promise, returned the papers to <persName>Mr. Forrester</persName>, the
	    <lb/>gentleman from whom he had received them, and with
	    <lb/>whom he had concerted the plan of forwarding them
	    <lb/>to the British commander. He wrote a statement of
	    <lb/>the occurrence which had induced him to ab<choice><sic>o</sic><corr>a</corr></choice>ndon the
	    <lb/>enterprise, and represented the danger which attended
	    <lb/>the undertaking to be so great, that it would of course
	    <lb/>deter any one from attempting it. He did not hesitate
	    <lb/>to declare that he could take no farther interest in it;
	    <lb/>for in truth he had been completely roused, by the
	    <lb/>mixture of menace and reproach conveyed in the words
	    <lb/>of the <name>Indian</name>, to reflect with remorse upon the part he
	    <lb/>was acting; a part so inconsistent with the principles of
	    <lb/>his faith, so adverse to the precepts, which from infancy,
	    <lb/>he had been taught to reverence and obey. We will
	    <lb/>not say that fear had no agency in the somewhat sud­
	    <lb/>den but wise resolutions of <persName>Mr. Hope</persName>, though we will
	    <lb/>do him the justice to declare, that reflection and princi­
	    <lb/>ple aided and confirmed the impressions which this
	    <lb/>passion was first instrumental in producing.</p>
          <p><persName>Mr. Forrester</persName> was one of those characters so common
	    <lb/>during the revolution, who, from the motives of conven­
	    <lb/>ience, policy, or cowardice, professed neutrality, but
	    <lb/>secretly lent all possible aid to the royalists. He was
	    <lb/>an <name>Irishman</name> by birth, but had been long enough in
	    <lb/><placeName>America</placeName> to have imbibed strong prejudices against
	    <lb/>the people, and they became daily more bitter and
	    <lb/>implacable by finding himself an object of suspicion
	    <lb/>and dislike. Some reports, disadvantageous to his
	    <lb/>character, had followed him to the country, and increas­
	    <lb/>ed the aversion, which his haughty and arrogant man­
	    <lb/>ners had already excited. Vindictive and unprincipled,
	    <lb/>he sought, like <persName>Haman</persName> of old, to revenge his private
	    <pb n="45"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="4(5)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">45</mw>
	    <lb/>hatred upon the nation at large, and though he had been
	    <lb/>heard to speak with asperity of his own countrymen,
	    <lb/>he exerted himself to gain for them all the important
	    <lb/>intelligence, which might aid their cause and hasten the
	    <lb/>downfall of the <soCalled rend="pre(“)post(”)slant(italic)">rebels</soCalled>.</p>
          <p>Having easily penetrated the sentiments of the un­
	    <lb/>suspicious <persName>Mr. Hope</persName>, he had, by his plausible manners,
	    <lb/>obtained his confidence, and now sought to make him a
	    <lb/>useful instrument in designs, which his own cowardice
	    <lb/>prevented his adventuring in alone. He wished to keep
	    <lb/>behind the curtain, that, in case suspicion should awake,
	    <lb/>it might be attached to one more active than himself;
	    <lb/>and, though much chagrined by the return of the papers,
	    <lb/>and irritated by what he termed the childish fright,
	    <lb/>which had induced <persName>Mr. Hope</persName> to relinquish them, yet
	    <lb/>he had found him too useful an agent, to run the risk of
	    <lb/>openly expressing his displeasure, and he resolved to
	    <lb/>seek the <name>Quaker</name> and persuade him by gentle words to
	    <lb/>retract the declaration which he had made.</p>
          <p>With this design he left the city, on the evening after
	    <lb/>the return of the papers, and walked towards the hab­
	    <lb/>itation of the <name>Quaker</name>. The outer door was open, and
	    <lb/>entering without ceremony, he found <persName>Mr. Hope</persName> alone
	    <lb/>in the parlour and so busily engaged in reading <persName>William
	      <lb/>Penn's</persName> 
<title xml:id="a-tmp1" corresp="#n-tmp1" rend="pre(“)post(”)">Maxims and
 Reflections relating to the Con­
	      <lb/>duct of Human Life,</title> that he seemed unconscious of
	    <lb/>the fast gathering darkness which was usurping the
	    <lb/>place of the brilliant twilight that had so long enabled
	    <lb/>him to read without difficulty. He laid aside the book
	    <lb/>when <persName>Mr. Forrester</persName> entered, who advanced and saluted
	    <lb/>him with an air of frankness and cordiality which he could
	    <lb/>assume at pleasure. As soon as the usual salutations
	    <lb/>were exchanged, and a few preliminary observations
	    <lb/>ended, <persName>Mr. Forrester</persName>, with apparent gentleness and real
	    <lb/>caution, introduced the subject of his visit. Drawing
	    <lb/>forth the packet, he said, <said>Since I received these pa­
	      <lb/>pers from you, <persName>Mr. Hope</persName>, I have lost no time in endeav­
	      <lb/>oring to find some one who would be willing for a
	      <lb/>suitable reward to undertake the office of conveying
	      <lb/>them to the place of their destination; but there is not

	      <milestone unit="sig" n="4(5)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">46</mw>
	      <lb/>a man that I can find, who has patriotism enough to
	      <lb/>run the smallest risk for the welfare of his country; and
	      <lb/>I again come to entreat, that you will advise and assist
	      <lb/>me in an affair of so much importance.</said></p>
          <p><said>Thou knowest, friend <persName>Forrester</persName>,</said> said <persName>Mr. Hope</persName>,
	    <lb/><said>that I have done all that I could, and more than I
	      <lb/>ought, to assist thee in this matter; and since I have
	      <lb/>told thee that I could take no farther part in it, of what
	      <lb/>avail is it again to apply to me?</said></p>
          <p><said><persName>Mr. Hope</persName>,</said> returned <persName>Forrester</persName>, <said>I do not wish to
	      <lb/>give you offence, and I thank you for your good inten­
	      <lb/>tions; but you must excuse me if I say, you have as
	      <lb/>yet afforded me no assistance at all. You received the
	      <lb/>papers with a promise to send them, but terrified by
	      <lb/>the savage threats of a powerless <name>Indian</name>, you returned
	      <lb/>them with a declaration that you could afford me no
	      <lb/>farther aid.</said></p>
          <p><said>Because,</said> answered <persName>Mr. Hope</persName>, <said>I regarded the
	      <lb/>threats of the <name>Indian</name>, as the interposition of Heaven, to
	      <lb/>prevent me from sharing in transactions which are
	      <lb/>stained with blood, and which, according to the pre­
	      <lb/>cepts of my faith, I ought to view only with pity and
	      <lb/>abhorrence, and to refrain from taking any part or lot
	      <lb/>therein.</said></p>
          <p><said>Superstitious dotard!</said> muttered <persName>Mr. Forrester</persName> in
	    <lb/>an under tone, and scarcely able to suppress his rising
	    <lb/>passion; but recollecting the impolicy of indulging it,
	    <lb/>he said in a soothing voice, <said>The contents of the pack­
	      <lb/>et, it is true, were not exactly overtures of peace; but
	      <lb/>they were designed to warn an unsuspicious garrison
	      <lb/>of a meditated assault, and prevent a waste of human
	      <lb/>life, by giving them time to prepare for defence.</said></p>
          <p><said>Thou art mistaken, friend,</said> said <persName>Mr. Hope</persName>; <said>if the
	      <lb/>attack is unsuspected, the fortress will be more likely to
	      <lb/>surrender, and this will be the means of sparaing many
	      <lb/>lives, which, in case of a vigorous defence, must cer­
	      <lb/>tainly be lost.</said></p>
          <p><said>And will you,</said> asked <persName>Mr. Forrester</persName>, striving in
	    <lb/>vain to conceal his vexation, <said>will you sit down con­
	      <lb/>tented with such cowardly and fallacious reasoning, and

	      <lb/>not make a single effort to aid a cause, which you have
	      <lb/>declared to be so dear to you? Already these insolent
	      <lb/>rebels triumph over the soldiers of their sovereign, and
	      <lb/>predict the moment of their separation from the land
	      <lb/>which ought to be an object of their eternal love and
	      <lb/>veneration. They exult in the defeat of the gallant
	      <lb/><persName>Baum</persName> and <persName>Breyman</persName> at <name>Bennington</name>, and in the retreat
	      <lb/>of <persName>St. Leger</persName> before the walls of <name>Fort Stanwix</name>. With
	      <lb/>arrogant presumption, they even venture to prophecy
	      <lb/>the total discomfiture of <persName>Burgoyne's</persName> experienced army,
	      <lb/>and yet you calmly hear the insolent boasting of these
	      <lb/>upstart people, at your very doors, without breathing a
	      <lb/>wish for the triumph of the just and righteous cause.</said></p>
          <p><said>Thou art mistaken, friend,</said> repeated <persName>Mr. Hope</persName> in
	    <lb/>a quiet tone, which evinced that he was wholly unmov­
	    <lb/>ed by the rapid and emphatic gesticulation of his irrita­
	    <lb/>ble companion; <said>thou art mistaken; I have interested
	      <lb/>myself, but too actively, in the great struggle now pas­
	      <lb/>sing before us. I have departed too far from the faith
	      <lb/>which I profess; I have forgotten that he who said,
	      <lb/><quote>they that take the sword, shall perish by the sword,</quote>
	      <lb/>said also, <quote>blessed are the peace-makers, for they shall
		<lb/>be called the children of God;</quote> and while I have been
	      <lb/>careful not literally to grasp this weapon of the evil one,
	      <lb/>neither have I been guided by the promise, so dear and
	      <lb/>encouraging to all, who in sincerity embrace the prin­
	      <lb/>ciples of our sect. I have deeply erred, and I confess
	      <lb/>with shame, that often, when I might have instilled the
	      <lb/>balm of peace and brotherly affection into the irritated
	      <lb/>minds of partizans and patriots, I have, contrary to the
	      <lb/>doctrines I venerate, and to the examples I revere,
	      <lb/>sought to increase the flame of dissension and triumph­
	      <lb/>ed in the success of my endeavors. May God forgive
	      <lb/>me! and bestow upon me a double portion of his grace
	      <lb/>and spirit, to enable me, henceforth, to withstand the
	      <lb/>temptations and devices of <persName>Satan</persName>!</said></p>
          <p><persName>Mr. Forrester</persName> smiled with contemptuous scorn at the
	    <lb/>fervent ejaculation of the conscience-struck <name>Quaker</name>, and
	    <lb/>unable any longer to repress his anger, it burst forth in
	    <lb/>a strain of passionate invective.</p>

          <p><said>Curse upon thy canting sect,</said> he said, <said>who ever
	      <lb/>make their pretended sanctity a veil for treachery and
	      <lb/>cowardice! But hear me, <persName>Richard Hope</persName>; you cannot
	      <lb/>impose upon my experience with a tale of your convic­
	      <lb/>tion and repentance, however plausible and well invent­
	      <lb/>ed; I have known you too long, and seen you too often
	      <lb/>engaged in affairs which you now affect to regard with
	      <lb/>horror, to believe in the sincerity of your conscientious
	      <lb/>scruples. No, either you have received a bribe from
	      <lb/>the rebels, or this devil of an <name>Indian</name> has frightened you
	      <lb/>into a cloke of sanctimony, which I swear to strip off,
	      <lb/>though the ghost of <persName>William Penn</persName> himself were to come
	      <lb/>from the tomb and forbid me.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Mr. Hope</persName> shuddered with horror at this sacrilegious
	    <lb/>mention of the sainted <persName>Penn</persName>; but unawed by the furi­
	    <lb/>ous demeanor of <persName>Mr. Forrester</persName>, he retained an unmoved
	    <lb/>countenance, and answered in the calm and slow tone,
	    <lb/>in which he was accustomed to speak, <said>May God par­
	      <lb/>don thy intemperate wrath, and enable me to preserve
	      <lb/>unmoved, my resolution! <persName>Friend Forrester</persName>, thou must
	      <lb/>seek some other agent to assist thee; I cannot lend
	      <lb/>thee any farther aid. I have unveiled to thee my in­
	      <lb/>most heart, trusting thou wouldst respect the scruples
	      <lb/>of a tender conscience; but since thou dost only ridi­
	      <lb/>cule and insult them, thou mayest vainly hope, by thy
	      <lb/>angry looks and menacing gestures, to fright me from
	      <lb/>the course which I know and feel to be right. But
	      <lb/>even if thou couldst, I have it not in my power to for­
	      <lb/>ward the despatches. <persName>Jacob Weston</persName> has declined the
	      <lb/>task, and I know of none to whom I could apply.
	      <lb/><persName>Friend Forrester</persName>, we must leave the direction and issue
	      <lb/>of affairs to Heaven. Feeble and impotent mortals, as
	      <lb/>we are, how can we aid the designs of the Almighty,
	      <lb/>or turn the course of events according to our own wish­
	      <lb/>es?</said></p>
          <p><said>Cease thy idle babbling, and give thy counsel when

	      <lb/>will hear no more of it. I tell thee I detest these vile
	      <lb/><name>Americans</name>, and would give one half that I possess to
	      <lb/>see them humbled by the arms of <placeName>Britain</placeName>. With their

	      <lb/>prying and suspicious eyes they scrutinize my actions,
	      <lb/>as if they thought me in very truth, an agent of the
	      <lb/>devil. They have dared to doubt my honor, and even
	      <lb/>whispered that I left my country in disgrace! And
	      <lb/>shall I not seek to revenge these insults so galling to
	      <lb/>my feelings, so degrading to my character? By Heav­
	      <lb/>en, I will travel myself with these despatches, sooner than
	      <lb/>risk the success of an enterprise which may yield a fresh
	      <lb/>theme of exultation for their vain and boasting tongues.</said></p>
          <p><said>It is personal pique, then, which has induced thee
	      <lb/>to wish for the triumph of thy country,</said> said the <name>Quak­
	    <lb/>er</name>; <said>verily I did believe thee to be inspired by the
	      <lb/>purest patriotism, and while I listened to thee, I caught
	      <lb/>a portion of thy ardor. Thou hast deceived me in this;
	      <lb/>and how do I know but thou art the dishonest man,
	      <lb/>which the <name>Americans</name> declare thee, and hast fled from
	      <lb/>thy country, to avoid the justice of its laws?</said></p>
          <p><persName>Mr. Forrester</persName> in the heat of passion had unawares
	    <lb/>betrayed himself, but it was too late to recede, and re­
	    <lb/>solving to brave the suspicions, which he had so in­
	    <lb/>cautiously awakened, he approached close to the open
	    <lb/>window against which <persName>Mr. Hope</persName> was seated, and said
	    <lb/>with a look and in an accent of defiance,</p>
          <p>
            <said>How dare you attempt to blacken, by such insinua­
	      <lb/>tions, a character, of which you know no evil? My
	      <lb/>wrath is implacable, when once awakened, and this
	      <lb/>affront shall not go unavenged, unless you will instantly
	      <lb/>engage to lend me your aid in forwarding these papers
	      <lb/>to <persName>General Burgoyne</persName>.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>I tell thee, for the last time, that I cannot, and will
	      <lb/>not aid thee;</said> said <persName>Mr. Hope</persName>, in a firm and decided
	    <lb/>tone, which evinced the strength of his resolution</p>
          <p><said>And I,</said> said a voice from without the windows, <said>I
	      <lb/>tell thee, that he <emph>shall</emph> not aid thee.</said></p>
          <p>At the same moment the packet which he held was
	    <lb/>snatched from <persName>Mr. Forrester</persName>, by a hand suddenly ex­
	    <lb/>tended and as suddenly withdrawn. A slight motion of
	    <lb/>the foliage was perceived, and immediately after an in­
	    <lb/>distinct figure sprang from the thick covert of bushes
	    <lb/>and darted rapidly past the window.</p>

          <p><persName>Mr. Forrester</persName>, recovering from his surprise, leaped
	    <lb/>through the open casement and followed the sound of
	    <lb/>the flying footsteps down a dark alley, at the termination
	    <lb/>of which he again caught a glimpse of the figure, as it
	    <lb/>emerged from the deep shadows of the trees. He call­
	    <lb/>ed aloud, but it passed forward without reply till it gain­
	    <lb/>ed the garden wall, when with inconceivable quickness
	    <lb/>it sprung over and disappeared from view</p>
          <p><persName>Mr. Forrester</persName> stood for a moment lost in astonish­
	    <lb/>ment; but curiosity and a desire to recover his papers
	    <lb/>impelled him forward, and advancing hastily to the wall,
	    <lb/>with some difficulty he climbed high enough to observe
	    <lb/>what passed on the other side. The beams of the
	    <lb/>moon fell unobstructed upon the object of his pursuit,
	    <lb/>and enabled him at once to identify the person and at­
	    <lb/>tire of the <name>Indian</name>, whose menaces had so intimidated
	    <lb/><persName>Mr. Hope</persName>, and whose appearance the <name>Quaker</name> had
	    <lb/>minutely described to him. He raised his voice and
	    <lb/>demanded the packet, when the <name>Indian</name> turned full to­
	    <lb/>wards him, and waved his hand in token that he should
	    <lb/>not follow him, at the same time unclosing his cloak and
	    <lb/>with a significant gesture pointing to the papers, which
	    <lb/>he had deposited in his bosom. He then moved rap­
	    <lb/>idly towards his canoe, and though <persName>Mr. Forrester</persName> con­
	    <lb/>tinued alternately to threaten and entreat, he passed on
	    <lb/>without regarding him, and leaping into his little bark
	    <lb/>paddled from the shore and shortly disappeared in the
	    <lb/>distance.</p>
          <p>Vexed and mortified, <persName>Mr. Forrester</persName> quitted his
	    <lb/>uncomfortable station on the wall, and muttering curses
	    <lb/>on <persName>Mr. Hope</persName>, the rebels, and the <name>Indian</name>, he bent his
	    <lb/>steps towards the house. <persName>Mr. Hope</persName> met him near the
	    <lb/>bottom of the garden; his suspicions of the person,
	    <lb/>who had so unceremoniously possessed himself of the
	    <lb/>papers, already glanced upon the <name>Indian</name>, and they
	    <lb/>were confirmed by the intelligence of <persName>Mr. Forrester</persName>.
	    <lb/>But it was vain to think of recovering the despatches;
	    <lb/>they were irretrievably gone. Who could trace the
	    <lb/>steps of these sons of the forest, or detect the wiles
	    <lb/>which they spread, with so much art, for those, whom
	    <lb/>it was their design to entrap?</p>

          <p>Though <persName>Mr. Forrester</persName> had ridiculed the terrors of
	    <lb/><persName>Mr. Hope</persName>, he was himself alarmed, and considered his
	    <lb/>personal safety endangered; as those, to whom the
	    <lb/><name>Indian</name> would probably deliver the papers, would doubt­
	    <lb/>less deem it of importance to secure an individual,
	    <lb/>whose active zeal in the cause of the enemy might be
	    <lb/>productive of the most fatal consequences to themselves.
	    <lb/>He therefore took the resolution of quitting <placeName>Albany</placeName>. He
	    <lb/>had long been ready for an instant removal, in case of
	    <lb/>exigency, and he now believed the moment had arrived,
	    <lb/>when it was necessary for him to depart.</p>
          <p><persName>Mr. Hope</persName>, to whom he communicated his intention,
	    <lb/>did not attempt to dissuade him from it. Indeed he
	    <lb/>judged it incompatible with his safety to remain any
	    <lb/>longer in the city, where he would be exposed to the
	    <lb/>constant scrutiny of this vigilant <name>Indian</name>, who walked in
	    <lb/>darkness, and whom they knew not how to avoid. He
	    <lb/>therefore, as a friend, and in sincere good will, advised
	    <lb/>him to go without delay; and <persName>Mr. Forrester</persName>, always
	    <lb/>eager to avoid danger, and reluctant, for reasons of his
	    <lb/>own, to be the subject of severe investigation, received
	    <lb/>the <name>Quaker'</name> counsel as it was intended, and determin­
	    <lb/>ed immediately to depart. He apologized for the
	    <lb/>harshness of his language, during the conversation of that
	    <lb/>evening, by pleading the excessive chagrin and perplexity,
	    <lb/>which the affair had occasioned him; and, having receiv­
	    <lb/>ed the forgiveneness of his pacific friend, and an assurance
	    <lb/>of his continued good will, he bade him a kind adieu,
	    <lb/>and mounting a fleet horse, left the city, and before
	    <lb/>morning dawned was far from it; though whither he
	    <lb/>directed his course was known to no one beside himself.</p>

          <p>While the events recorded in the last chapter were
	    <lb/>passing in the family of <persName>Richard Hope</persName>, the progress of
	    <lb/>the royal army under <persName>General Burgoyne</persName> was marked
	    <lb/>by a series of uninterrrupted victories. Composed of
	    <lb/>veteran troops, led by experienced and accomplished
	    <lb/>officers, and furnished with a formidable train of artillery,
	    <lb/>and all the necessary and dreadful accompaniments of
	    <lb/>war, it proceeded on its course conquering and to con­
	    <lb/>quer; while, to increase the terrors of its frightful array,
	    <lb/>a host of ferocious <name>Indians</name>, in their savage attire, thirst­
	    <lb/>ing for blood, and uttering the tremendous war cries of
	    <lb/>their tribes, followed its progress.</p>
          <p>The <name>Americans</name> retreated before a power which, with
	    <lb/>their inadequate means, it would have been temerity to
	    <lb/>oppose; and the fortress of <placeName>Ticonderoga</placeName>, which two
	    <lb/>years before, their valor had wrested from the <name>British</name>,
	    <lb/>again returned to the hands of the conquerers. But
	    <lb/>the bravery, with which the little flotilla of the <name>Ameri­
	      <lb/>cans</name> engaged the superior force of the enemy, and the
	    <lb/>vigorous resistance which they made, at <placeName>Hubberton</placeName> and
	    <lb/>at <name>Fort Anne</name>, are evidences sufficiently convincing, to
	    <lb/>the candid and unprejudiced mind, that imperious ne­
	    <lb/>cessity, and not cowardice, compelled them to yield
	    <lb/>this strong hold of the North, and decline a contest
	    <lb/>which must inevitably have destroyed their compara­
	    <lb/>tively feeble force.</p>
          <p>The royal army, elated with the success of this first
	    <lb/>enterprise, began to think itself invincible. Both offi­
	    <lb/>cers and soldiers regarded with contempt an enemy so
	    <pb n="53"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="5(3)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">53</mw>
	    <lb/>inferior in numbers and in discipline. They considered
	    <lb/>their toils as already ended, and imagined that they had
	    <lb/>only to march forward and take possession of the places
	    <lb/>which would doubtless be quickly evacuated at their
	    <lb/>approach. They considered themselves in possession
	    <lb/>of the grand keys of <placeName>North America</placeName>, in having obtained
	    <lb/>the command of <placeName>Ticonderoga</placeName> and the lakes, and, an­
	    <lb/>imated by the prospects which seemed opening before
	    <lb/>them, they retained, in the midst of toil and many dif­
	    <lb/>ficulties, a spirit of undaunted cheerfulness and gaiety;
	    <lb/>apparently regarding as trifles the serious obstacles,
	    <lb/>which embarrassed their march through a country in­
	    <lb/>terseccted with mountains and broken by creeks and
	    <lb/>deep morasses. Besides these natural impediments,
	    <lb/>the <name>Americans</name> in their retreat had felled enormous trees
	    <lb/>across the path, demolished bridges, and thrown every
	    <lb/>possible obstruction in their way: but still the British
	    <lb/>troops persevered with confidence, and on their approach
	    <lb/>to <name>Fort Edward</name>, on the <placeName>Hudson</placeName>, the point to which
	    <lb/>their wishes had long tended, it was precipitately aban­
	    <lb/>doned, and they entered in triumph the deserted for­
	    <lb/>tress.</p>
          <p><persName>General Schuyler</persName>, with his army, and the remnant
	    <lb/>of the troops who had fled from <placeName>Ticonderoga</placeName>, and by a
	    <lb/>circuitous passage through the woods, joined him in
	    <lb/>extreme wretchedness at this place, retired to <placeName>Saratoga</placeName>,
	    <lb/>then to <placeName>Stillwater</placeName>, and even as far south as the mouth
	    <lb/>of the <placeName>Mohawk</placeName>, where, unshaken by the disasters which
	    <lb/>had befallen them, they prepared, with astonishing con­
	    <lb/>stancy and vigor, to form an encampment which should
	    <lb/>present a complete barrier to the farther progress of the
	    <lb/>enemy.</p>
          <p>But the royal army had new and formidable difficul­
	    <lb/><choice><sic>cul</sic><corr/></choice>ties to encounter, which forbade its pressing forward
	    <lb/>in that splendid career, which had heretofore attracted
	    <lb/>the regard of every eye. They had precipitately pene­
	    <lb/>trated into the heart of a strange country, ill provided
	    <lb/>with stores of any kind, which they were now obliged
	    <lb/>to transport from <name>Fort George</name>, a distance of sixteen
	    <lb/>miles, over an exceedingly difficult country. Many

	    <lb/>impediments attended the undertaking; they were in
	    <lb/>want of cattle to aid their endeavors, and repeated
	    <lb/>heavy rains had rendered the bad roads well nigh im­
	    <lb/>passable. The excitement, which continued success
	    <lb/>had occasioned, subsided, and the sanguine spirits of
	    <lb/>the troops were saddened by the difficulties which
	    <lb/>awaited them, and the toil and danger which they were
	    <lb/>daily obliged to encounter. But when, after fifteen
	    <lb/>days of constant and unremitting exertion, there was
	    <lb/>found to be not more than four days provision in store,
	    <lb/>their prospects were gloomy indeed, and the situation
	    <lb/>of their affairs embarrassing in the extreme.</p>
          <p>Other events more mortifying, and equally vexatious,
	    <lb/>occurred at this time. The defeat of the expedition to
	    <lb/><placeName>Bennington</placeName>, which was a large deposit of stores, which
	    <lb/>they hoped to seize, and the failure of <persName>Colonel St. Le­
	      <lb/>ger's</persName> attack upon <name>Fort Stanwix</name>, by which all <persName>General
	      <lb/>Burgoyne's</persName> hopes of uniting his forces with those of <persName>St. 
	      <lb/>Leger's</persName> were destroyed, rendered the situation and
	    <lb/>prospects of the royal army truly deplorable.</p>
          <p>To retreat, even were it practicable, was at once to
	    <lb/>abandon the object of the expedition, to incur the im­
	    <lb/>putation of cowardice, and to provoke the sarcasms of a
	    <lb/>thousand evil tongues.</p>
          <p><persName>General Burgoyne</persName> had supplanted his valiant and
	    <lb/>virtuous predecessor in the command of this enterprise,
	    <lb/>and his pride was concerned in remaining firm at the
	    <lb/>post, which he had assumed with such confident hopes
	    <lb/>of victory. At his first outset, he had declared, <said>this
	      <lb/>army must not retreat,</said> and as his present position was
	    <lb/>no longer tenable, he considered his only alternative to
	    <lb/>be an immediate engagement with the American force,
	    <lb/>now under the command of <persName>General Gates</persName>.</p>
          <p>Confident of success, he endeavoured to revive the
	    <lb/>drooping spirits of his troops, and in the prospect of a
	    <lb/>battle they were inspired with new life, and forgot the
	    <lb/>hardships and privations they were forced to endure.
	    <lb/>They felt a contempt for the enemy that had retreated
	    <lb/>so rapidly before them, and who, they believed, could fight
	    <pb n="55"/>

	    <mw type="pageNum">55</mw>
	    <lb/>only beneath the covert of hedges and entrenchments,
	    <lb/>but would shrink from a fair combat in the open field.</p>
          <p><persName>General Burgoyne</persName> felt the importance of forcing his
	    <lb/>way to <placeName>Albany</placeName>, the central point, at which the victori­
	    <lb/>ous armies were to assemble, and from the reports
	    <lb/>which reached him, of the increasing strength of the
	    <lb/>enemy, he judged that no time was to be lost in haz­
	    <lb/>arding an engagement. He therefore moved from <name>Fort
	      <lb/>Edward</name>, and, marching along the <placeName>Hudson</placeName>, encamped
	    <lb/>nearly opposite to <placeName>Saratoga</placeName>, where he still continued
	    <lb/>his exertions in bringing forward stores and provisions
	    <lb/>from <name>Fort George</name>.</p>
          <p>Among the officers, there were frequent conversa­
	    <lb/>tions on the present situation of affairs. Some censured
	    <lb/>the General, and boded the most fatal calamities which
	    <lb/>were to befall the army, while others, more sanguine,
	    <lb/>prophesied a brilliant termination to the campaign, and
	    <lb/>the consequent reduction of the <mcr>rebels</mcr> to obedience and
	    <lb/>good behaviour. Among the latter, there were none
	    <lb/>more confident than <persName>Major Courtland</persName>. From the pe­
	    <lb/>riod of his engaging in active service, he had felt as if
	    <lb/>transported back to the days of early manhood, and
	    <lb/>about to commence a new career of glory. With all
	    <lb/>the ardor and intrepidity which had distinguished his
	    <lb/>youth, he espoused the cause of his country, and confi­
	    <lb/>dently predicted the complete triumph of her arms.
	    <lb/>The victories, which had markred the commencement
	    <lb/>of the campaign, elated him to almost boyish rapture;
	    <lb/>nor did he at all despond at their difficulties and defeats,
	    <lb/>which had since attended their progress.</p>
          <p>Even his affection for his daughter, who had been so
	    <lb/>long the sole object of his hopes and wishes, seemed
	    <lb/>lost in the overwhelming passion for military glory,
	    <lb/>which inflamed him. In the letters which he address­
	    <lb/>ed her, there was less of the tenderness of a father, than
	    <lb/>the impatient spirit of a warrior, who longs for the mo­
	    <lb/>ment of combat, and dwells with delighted accuracy, on
	    <lb/>the dreadful paraphernalia, of death which surround
	    <lb/>him.</p>

          <mw type="pageNum">56</mw>
          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> shuddered at the tenor of these letters, but
	    <lb/>she implored Heaven to preserve her father's life, and
	    <lb/>drew comfort from the belief, that the excitement of
	    <lb/>his feelings was transient, and would subside with the
	    <lb/>occasion which had awakened it. With the most pa­
	    <lb/>thetic earnestness, she entreated him to guard his safety
	    <lb/>for her sake; and, touched by the ardor of her filial af­
	    <lb/>fection, he sometimes heaved a momentary sigh at the
	    <lb/>remembrance of those peaceful pleasures which he had
	    <lb/>voluntarily resigned, for the strife of battle and the
	    <lb/>noisy confusion of a camp.</p>
          <p>But the present dangerous crisis allowed him no
	    <lb/>time for the indulgence of these softening thoughts.</p>
          <p><persName>General Burgoyne</persName>, having, by the most indefatigable
	    <lb/>exertions, obtained a supply of about thirty days' pro­
	    <lb/>vision and other necessary stores, resolved to cross the
	    <lb/><placeName>Hudson</placeName>, and encamp on the plain and heights of <placeName>Sara­
	      <lb/>toga</placeName>; a measure which was warmly opposed by many
	    <lb/>of his officers, and as strenuously supported by others,
	    <lb/>among whom was <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, who panted for an
	    <lb/>engagement with the republicans.</p>
          <p><persName>General Burgoyne</persName>, however, asked no counsel, and
	    <lb/>seemed indifferent to the disapprobation, which was
	    <lb/>visible among some of his officers. His only chance of
	    <lb/>safety depended on his being able to force a passage to
	    <lb/><placeName>Albany</placeName>, and the season was already so far advanced, as
	    <lb/>to admit of no delay. He accordingly crossed the
	    <lb/><placeName>Hudson</placeName>, on a bridge of boats, and, advancing along
	    <lb/>the river, halted within four miles of the enemy, who were
	    <lb/>returning northward, in the hope of encountering him,
	    <lb/>and were at this time encamped in considerable force,
	    <lb/>about three miles above <placeName>Stillwater</placeName>.</p>
          <p>On the morning of the <date when="1777-09-19">nineteenth of <name>September</name></date>, the
	    <lb/><name>British</name> resumed their line of march, and prepared for
	    <lb/>immediate action. Some accidental skirmishes between
	    <lb/>the advanced parties of the two armies, preceded a
	    <lb/>general engagement, which was sustained on both sides
	    <lb/>with unexampled valor, and continued with unabated
	    <lb/>fury, till night terminated the dreadful contest. The
	    <lb/><name>Americans</name> then retired to their encampment, while the
	    <pb n="57"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="5(5)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">57</mw>
	    <lb/><name>British</name> remained upon the field of battle, fortifying their
	    <lb/>camp, and preparing for another engagement.</p>
          <p>Though victory had not declared for either army, she
	    <lb/>certainly inclined in favor of the <name>Americans</name>, since their
	    <lb/>loss scarcely amounted to half the number of the ene­
	    <lb/>my's, and might be easily supplied; while that of the
	    <lb/><name>British</name> had weakened their force, and in their present
	    <lb/>situation could not be repaired. They, however, de­
	    <lb/>clared the combat to have terminated in their favor,
	    <lb/>since they retained possession of the battle ground, and
	    <lb/>persisted in affirming, that had not the approach of
	    <lb/>night occasioned a cessation of arms, a positive victory
	    <lb/>would doubtless have been won by them. <persName>Major
	    <lb/>Courtland</persName> strenuously supported this belief. He could
	    <lb/>not brook the idea that an army so equipped, so disci­
	    <lb/>plined, and so brave, should encounter the shame of a
	    <lb/>defeat, and with that high sense of honor and national
	    <lb/>pride, which so strinkingly characterizes the <name>English</name>, he
	    <lb/>wished for death rather than disgrace. His enthusiastic
	    <lb/>loyalty, and the contempt with which he seemed to re­
	    <lb/>gard every species of danger, called forth the admira­
	    <lb/>tion of his brother officers, and attached to him many
	    <lb/>young and daring spirits, who burned to signalize them­
	    <lb/>selves in arms, and loved to animate their zeal, by list­
	    <lb/>ening to the ardent expressions of so experienced and
	    <lb/>brave a soldier. He shunned no duty, however toil­
	    <lb/>some or hazardous, and the present state of affairs call­
	    <lb/>ed for all the activity and vigilance of officers and men.</p>
          <p>Increasing difficulties and perplexities continued to
	    <lb/>harass the British commander. The desertion of the
	    <lb/><name>Canadians</name> and <name>Indians</name>, in large numbers, weakened his
	    <lb/>strength, and lessened his confidence in those that re­
	    <lb/>mained. The provisions of the men were reduced,
	    <lb/>from necessity, to half their usual allowance; the stock
	    <lb/>of forage was nearly exhausted, and the cattle were fast
	    <lb/>perishing for want of sustenance. To add to his dis­
	    <lb/>tress, no intelligence had been received from <persName>Sir Henry
	      <lb/>Clinton</persName>, from whose co-operation he had expected much
	    <lb/>assistance; and while the army of <persName>General Gates</persName> was
	    <lb/>swelled by troops of deserters from his own, and thou­
	    <pb n="58"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="5(5)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">58</mw>
	    <lb/>sands were flocking from all quarters to join its stan­
	    <lb/>dard, he could do nothing to augment his strength, nor
	    <lb/>make a movement which would afford him relief, or in
	    <lb/>the least brighten the desperate situation in which he
	    <lb/>had incautiously involved himself. He could only keep
	    <lb/>a strict watch over his enemy's motions, and use every
	    <lb/>means to fortify his own camp, and guard it from sud­
	    <lb/>den attack. In the midst of his anxieties, he sought, by
	    <lb/>the firmness and fortitude of his conduct, to animate
	    <lb/>his soldiers with hope, while at the same time, by
	    <lb/>the cheerfulness with which he shared their toils and
	    <lb/>privations, he increased their attachment, and encour­
	    <lb/>aged them to support with constancy the dangers and
	    <lb/>hardships which they were compelled to endure.</p>
          <p>As they were encamped within cannon shot of the
	    <lb/>enemy, they were harassed by continual alarms. They
	    <lb/>were closely watched, and it not unfrequently happen­
	    <lb/>ed, that their pickets were attacked by parties of the
	    <lb/><name>Americans</name>. In this situation, constant vigilance was
	    <lb/>requisite. But, surrounded as they were by perils,
	    <lb/><persName>General Burgoyne</persName> was induced to remain stationary
	    <lb/>for the present, in consequence of intelligence received
	    <lb/>from <persName>Sir Henry Clinton</persName>, urging him to hold out till the
	    <lb/><date when="1777-10-12">twelfth of the following month</date>, when, by making a di­
	    <lb/>version in his favour on the <placeName>North river</placeName>, he would oblige
	    <lb/><persName>General Gates</persName> to divide his army, and render it easy
	    <lb/>for him to prevail over the reduced force of the enemy.
	    <lb/>The dread of famine presented the only obstacle to
	    <lb/>this design, and the difficulty of foraging rendered
	    <lb/>it almost madness in them to think of holding out for
	    <lb/>so long a time. Yet so much depended on their doing
	    <lb/>so, that the General strenuously exhorted his troops to
	    <lb/>patience and forbearance, in the hope of future victory.
	    <lb/>Sometimes he ventured to send out small foraging par­
	    <lb/>ties, though strong detachments were necessary to cov­
	    <lb/>er these expeditions, and even then they could not be
	    <lb/>made without encountering the most imminent risk; so
	    <lb/>watchful were the <name>Americans</name> to cut off all means of
	    <lb/>succour or support from their enemy.</p>
          <p>Some soldiers one day brought a report of a small farm­
	    <pb n="59"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="5(6)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">59</mw>
	    <lb/>house, in the woods, a few miles distant, near which they
	    <lb/>had observed cattle feeding, and pigs and poultry cluster­
	    <lb/>ed around the door. A prize of so much value was not to
	    <lb/>be despised, when every accidental supply, however
	    <lb/>small, was an object of importance to them. A detach­
	    <lb/>ment was accordingly ordered to issue forth that night,
	    <lb/>for the purpose of transporting the treasures of the
	    <lb/>farm-house to the camp.</p>
          <p><persName>Major Courtland</persName> learned with pleasure, that he was
	    <lb/>the officer destined to command this nocturnal expedi­
	    <lb/>tion; and, always eager for active service, he busied
	    <lb/>himself in preparations for the adventure. All things
	    <lb/>being in complete readiness, he went with two other
	    <lb/>officers to examine the redoubts, which had been thrown
	    <lb/>up for the protection of the hospital, and on which the
	    <lb/>men were still laboring.</p>
          <p>As they stood viewing the works, a rifle-shot from a
	    <lb/>concealed party of the enemy, struck a soldier and kill­
	    <lb/>ed him on the spot.</p>
          <p><said>The devil take these <name>Americans</name>! They pop us off
	      <lb/>like ninepins,</said> exclaimed <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, one of
	    <lb/>the officers who had accompanied <persName>Major Courtland</persName> to
	    <lb/>the redoubt.</p>
          <p><said>And with more indifference than we should roll a
	      <lb/>bowl</said>, returned <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, with something like
	    <lb/>indignation in his accent, as he moved toward the un­
	    <lb/>fortunate man, whom his comrades were raising from
	    <lb/>the ground.</p>
          <p><said>Is he dead?</said> inquired <persName>Colonel Percy</persName>, the other
	    <lb/>officer, with concern.</p>
          <p><said>There's not a breath left in his body, sir,</said> replied
	    <lb/>one of the soldiers, a tear glistening on his weather­
	    <lb/>beaten cheek as he gazed on the lifeless face of his
	    <lb/>comrade; <said>and a braver fellow,</said> he added, <said>never
	      <lb/>drew a trigger for his king.</said></p>
          <p><said>Never, <persName>Donald</persName>! I will bear witness to that truth,</said><lb/>said <persName>Colonel Percy</persName>; <said>but let him have a soldier's buri­
	      <lb/>al, and that is all that any of us can expect in a time
	      <lb/>like this.</said></p>
          <p><said>Heaven bless your Honor!</said> answered <persName>Donald</persName>;
	    <pb n="60"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="5(6)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">60</mw>
	    <lb/><said>but curse these rebels, who shoot better men than
	      <lb/>themselves,</said> he muttered, as he assisted his comrades
	    <lb/>to bear off the body of the dead soldier.</p>
          <p><said>A hearty malediction, and given with free good
	      <lb/>will;</said> exclaimed <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, laughing.</p>
          <p><said>Yes, and if maledictions could defeat an army, we
	      <lb/>should have been victors before this,</said> said <persName>Colonel
	    <lb/>Percy</persName>, gravely.</p>
          <p><said>You intend that for me, colonel,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>;
	    <lb/><said>but though I curse them occasionally, I am never
	      <lb/>quite so much in earnest as honest <persName>Donald</persName> was just
	      <lb/>now; for, in truth, they are such brave fellows that I
	      <lb/>cannot help honoring them from my very soul, rebels
	      <lb/>and traitors as they are. But there goes the fellow,</said>
	    <lb/>he suddenly exclaimed,<choice><sic>”</sic><corr/></choice> 
	    <said rend="pre()"><choice><sic/><corr>“</corr></choice>who shot down <persName>Stedman</persName> just
	      <lb/>now, and there goes another, and another; by heaven
	      <lb/>there must be a party of them posted among those
	      <lb/>pines. Give me a rifle and let us have a shot at them.</said></p>
          <p><said>They are some of <persName>Morgan's</persName> riflemen,</said> said <persName>Major
	    <lb/>Courtland</persName>, looking earnestly after them, as they appear­
	    <lb/>ed and disappeared among the thick trees which cover­
	    <lb/>ed the little eminence, while the white frocks by which
	    <lb/>they were distinguished, rendered them at once con­
	    <lb/>spicuous to the eye of the attentive observer. Twenty
	    <lb/>rifles were instantly discharged at the place, but appar­
	    <lb/>antly without success, and the fire was immediately re­
	    <lb/>turned with as little effect; when the whole party filed
	    <lb/>off to the left, and hastily retreated from view.</p>
          <p><said>Curse the dastards,</said> exclaimed <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>,
	    <lb/>the blood rushing to his face, as he threw down the rifle
	    <lb/>which had served him so badly; <said>would to Heaven I
	      <lb/>could exterminate them!</said></p>
          <p><persName>Major Courtland</persName> and <persName>Colonel Percy</persName> burst into a
	    <lb/>laugh.</p>
          <p><said>I think, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,</said> said the former, <said>you curse
	      <lb/>the rebels with as good a grace as honest <persName>Donald</persName> him­
	      <lb/>self; you forget that you admire their bravery too much
	      <lb/>to wish them any worse harm than a defeat.</said></p>
          <p><said>And so I did just now,</said> answered <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, col­
	    <lb/>oring and laughing; <said>but it was so provoking to see
	      <pb n="61"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="6(1)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">61</mw>
	      <lb/>them file off to a man in the midst of such a volley;
	      <lb/>and the very fellows too, against whom I bear the most
	      <lb/>malice. During the last engagement, as you well know,
	      <lb/>they were posted behind every tree to single out and
	      <lb/>shoot the most distinguished officers, and <persName>Captain McIn­
		<lb/>tosh</persName> shot a villain down who was in the very act of
	      <lb/>levelling his piece at <persName>General Burgoyne</persName> himself.</said></p>
          <p><said>War is terrible enough without this dreadful aggra­
	      <lb/>vation of its horrors,</said> said <persName>Colonel Percy</persName>, <said>and a prac­
	      <lb/>tice so cruel and unjustifiable must excite the indigna­
	      <lb/>tion of every honorable and humane mind.</said></p>
          <p><said>They probably act upon the principle,</said> said <persName>Major
	    <lb/>Courtland</persName>, smiling, <said>of destroying the leaders, in or­
	      <lb/>der to hasten the issue of the contest, and prevent a
	      <lb/>waste of human life.</said></p>
          <p><said>Absurd!</said> returned <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, <said>the principle thus
	      <lb/>acted upon is worthy only of cowards. In fact, <persName>Major
	      <lb/>Courtland</persName>, the circumstance admits of no palliation.</said></p>
          <p><said>I am far from wishing to palliate it, <persName>Captain O'Car­
		<lb/>roll</persName>,</said> returned the major; <said>for no one, I assure you,
	      <lb/>can regard it with greater abhorrence than myself.</said></p>
          <p><said>It is nothing better than deliberate assassination,</said><lb/>said <persName>Colonel Percy</persName>; <said>but I am so charitable towards
	      <lb/>the <name>Americans</name>, as willingly to believe that the orders,
	      <lb/>if any were given, proceeded from some ferocious par­
	      <lb/>tizan, whose illiberal prejudices led him to consider the
	      <lb/>life of his foe, as of no more value than that of the wild
	      <lb/>deer which bounds through his forests. From some
	      <lb/>one like the fiery and implacable <persName>Arnold</persName>, perhaps, of
	      <lb/>whom we have heard so much, and whose passions, as
	      <lb/>we are told, continually transport him beyond the limits
	      <lb/>of honor and of justice. But if is half past four,</said> he
	    <lb/>said, looking at his watch; <said>and as we are to dine with
	      <lb/><persName>General Reidesel</persName>, <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, it is time for us
	      <lb/>to be gone.</said></p>
          <p><said>And it is time for me too, to think of dinner,</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, <said>if I would be in season for the
	      <lb/>expedition to-night.</said></p>
          <p><said>Why, we do not leave the camp till midnight,</said> said

	    <lb/>the major, <said>so there is no need of haste in this impor­
	      <lb/>tant ceremony.</said></p>
          <p><said>So much the better;</said> returned the captain, <said>we
	      <lb/>know not what perils we have to encounter, and it is
	      <lb/>well to fortify one's self with an additional bottle or
	      <lb/>two.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Major Courtland</persName> smiled, and cautioning his young
	    <lb/>friend to partake sparingly of the exhilarating juice of
	    <lb/>the grape, as the adventures of the night might render
	    <lb/>it of importance, that they should both retain perfect
	    <lb/>possession of their faculties, he bade him good morn­
	    <lb/>ing, and walked from the redoubt with <persName>Colonel Percy</persName>.</p>
          <p>At the appointed hour, the party of foragers, with
	    <lb/><persName>Major Courtland</persName> and <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> at their head,
	    <lb/>issued in silence from the camp. The night was cloud­
	    <lb/>less, and myriads of stars were shining brightly in the
	    <lb/>clear blue sky. Guided by a provincial soldier, one of
	    <lb/>those who had givevn information of the house, they
	    <lb/>proceeded cautiously along the verge of the forest, occa­
	    <lb/>sionally halting to listen for sounds of danger, and then
	    <lb/>resuming their swift and noisely progress. After pro­
	    <lb/>ceeding without accident for nearly a mile, their guide
	    <lb/>struck into a road on the right, which led through a
	    <lb/>narrow defile, bordered on each side by craggy rocks,
	    <lb/>and terminating in a dense forest, where the matted
	    <lb/>boughs shut out the sight of the star-light heavens, and

	    <lb/>cult than it had yet been.</p>
          <p><persName>Captain O'Carroll's</persName> patience was sorely tried; he
	    <lb/>saw no termination to their march, and began to fear
	    <lb/>that the soldier had led them wrong. <said>These Ameri­
	      <lb/>can forests,</said> he said, advancing to the side of <persName>Major
	    <lb/>Courtland</persName>, <said>are worse than the hills of the Highlands
	      <lb/>where I have so often shot grouse with my uncle; even
	      <lb/>the bogs of my own dear <placeName>Ireland</placeName> cannot boast so charm­
	      <lb/>ing a variety of bush and briar as are here at every
	      <lb/>step fastening to one's person, or threatening with their
	      <lb/>sharp points to exterminate one's eyes.</said></p>
          <p><said>Hush!</said> said <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, <said>or we may be as­
	      <lb/>sailed by worse enemies than bushes and briars, and
	      <lb/>start more formidable game than Highland grouse.</said></p>

          <p><persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> laughed and fell back to his place.
	    <lb/>After proceeding a short distance farther, the party
	    <lb/>came to a open space in the forest where the trees had
	    <lb/>been felled, though their huge blackened stumps re­
	    <lb/>mained, giving the place the appearance of a vast cem­
	    <lb/>etery, thickly covered with grave-stones. As they ad­
	    <lb/>vanced, this melancholy resemblance was exchanged
	    <lb/>for marks of superior cultivation. Fields of Indian
	    <lb/>corn, ripe for the sickle and bristling with ears, promised
	    <lb/>to recompense the tedious march of the night. A flock
	    <lb/>of sheep were clustered together in the corner of a
	    <lb/>small enclosure, and, near a cottage built of logs, some
	    <lb/>cattle were browsing on the faded herbage. All around
	    <lb/>wore the aspect of plenty, and evinced that the own­
	    <lb/>ers, to use the homely phrase of the country, <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">were
	      <lb/>well to do in the world.</quote></p>
          <p>As <persName>Major Courtland</persName> took a hasty view of the premi­
	    <lb/>ses, he was surprised to observe at that unusual hour, a
	    <lb/>strong gleam of light issue from the window of the cot­
	    <lb/>tage, and, fearing that their expedition might by some
	    <lb/>means have become known to the vigilant enemy, he
	    <lb/>halted to consult with <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, whether it were
	    <lb/>best to advance, or for fear of the worst, to secure a
	    <lb/>safe retreat. But the soldier who acted as their guide,
	    <lb/>having assured him that the light proceeded from a huge
	    <lb/>wood fire, which, in a country where fuel was so abun­
	    <lb/>dant, it was often the custom to keep burning through
	    <lb/>the night, as soon as the cool season commenced, he
	    <lb/>again advanced towards the house.</p>
          <p>It was not the wish of the British commander to
	    <lb/>strip from the laborious farmer his little all, without
	    <lb/>ample remuneration. Commissioned to purchase, not
	    <lb/>to rob, <persName>Major Courtland</persName> rode to the door of the cot­
	    <lb/>tage and knocked loudly to awaken its inmates. A
	    <lb/>slight noise was heard within, but no one appeared;
	    <lb/>and reining his horse up before the narrow window, he
	    <lb/>observed by the red glare which illuminated the inte­
	    <lb/>rior of the dwelling, the figure of an <name>Indian</name>, just van­
	    <lb/>ishing through a small door opposite. No other living
	    <lb/>being was visible; and, surprised at the mysterious
	    <pb n="64"/>

	    <mw type="pageNum">64</mw>
	    <lb/>silence which pervaded a habitation, where he had been
	    <lb/>told a large family resided, he turned to question
	    <lb/>the provincial soldier. But he was not to be found;
	    <lb/>yet no one had seen him depart, and if he had gone,
	    <lb/>he must have stolen off unperceived, at the moment
	    <lb/>when the attention of his comrades was fixed upon the
	    <lb/>farm-house.</p>
          <p><persName>Major Courtland</persName> and <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> looked fix­
	    <lb/>edly upon each other; the same idea rushed upon the
	    <lb/>mind of both, but the impatient Captain was the first
	    <lb/>who spoke.</p>
          <p><said>There is treason, you may rest assured,</said> he said,
	    <lb/><said rend="pre()"><choice><sic/><corr>“</corr></choice>and the sooner we retreat the better, if indeed it is not 
	      <lb/>already too late.</said></p>
          <p><said>And if it is, we will die like brave men,</said> returned
	    <lb/>the Major, <said>but let us at least attempt it.</said></p>
          <p>He had scarcely ceased speaking, and was about to
	    <lb/>give the order for a rapid retreat, when the tremendous
	    <lb/>war-whoop of the <name>Indian</name> resounded through the forest,
	    <lb/>awaking the silent echoes and bringing with it associa­
	    <lb/>tions of horror, which chilled the blood of the brave little
	    <lb/>band, who, uncertain from what direction they were to
	    <lb/>be assailed, drew up by command of their leader in or­
	    <lb/>der of battle, and nerved their hearts to meet the bar­
	    <lb/>barous foe, whom the frightful yell of the savage had
	    <lb/>led them to expect.</p>
          <p>But they were deceived. <persName>Major Courtland</persName> was in
	    <lb/>the act of issuing some necessary directions, when a
	    <lb/>body of republican troops emerged from a thicket in
	    <lb/>rear of the house, and, led on by a spirited officer, com­
	    <lb/>menced a furious attack upon the <name>British</name>. Perceiving
	    <lb/>at once, that the enemy exceeded him in number, <persName>Ma­
	      <lb/>jor Courtland</persName>, to avoid the shame of a surrender, and
	    <lb/>prevent the sacrifice of his men in so unequal a contest,
	    <lb/>resolved to attempt an immediate retreat. Could he
	    <lb/>gain the narrow defile at the entrance of the forest and
	    <lb/>despatch a courier to the camp with intelligence of their
	    <lb/>situation, all might yet be well. He therefore began
	    <lb/>his retreat; and, fighting as he retired, had the satisfac­
	    <lb/>tion to enter the defile with the loss of only two men.

	    <lb/>Here <persName>Major Courtland</persName> sent off his emissary for succours,
	    <lb/>and as the moon had arisen, so as to enable them to
	    <lb/>distinguish friend from foe, the combat raged with in­
	    <lb/>creased fury, and with more deadly effect. <persName>Major
	    <lb/>Courtland</persName> and <persName>Captain O'Carrol<choice><sic/><corr>l</corr></choice></persName> animated their men by
	    <lb/>their example, and cheered them by words of encour­
	    <lb/>agement and approbation; but as many of their number
	    <lb/>already strewed the earth, and still the expected suc­
	    <lb/>cours did not arrive, it seemed impossible that they
	    <lb/>could much longer sustain the unequal conflict. To
	    <lb/>complete their distress, a ball winged with unerring aim,
	    <lb/>at length penetrated the breast of <persName>Major Courtland</persName> and
	    <lb/>he fell bleeding from his horse.</p>
          <p>The courage and efforts of the soldiers seemed at
	    <lb/>once paralyzed by this sight. In vain <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>
	    <lb/>sought to rally and lead them on to a fresh charge;
	    <lb/>grief and despair appeared to subdue them, and though
	    <lb/>they still offered resistance, it was slight and ineffectual.</p>
          <p>No sooner had <persName>Major Courtland</persName> fallen, than an <name>In­
	      <lb/>dian</name> who had followed the <name>Americans</name>, and the same
	    <lb/>who had raised the war-whoop, approached the spot
	    <lb/>where he was lying, and perceiving that life was not yet
	    <lb/>extinct, lifted his tomahawk to strike, when the leader of
	    <lb/>the party observing his design, called out in a command­
	    <lb/>ing tone, <said>Forbear, <persName>Ohmeina</persName>! spare the vanquished
	      <lb/>and respect the brave!</said> The Major's horse feeling his
	    <lb/>rein slacken, had carried his master to the verge of the
	    <lb/>enemy's line before he fell; and the American officer,
	    <lb/>now approaching the spot where he lay, was directing
	    <lb/>the <name>Indian</name> to raise and bear him from the scene of strife,
	    <lb/>when a shout of joy burst from the despairing remnant
	    <lb/>of <persName>Major Courtland's</persName> troops, and a reinforcement of
	    <lb/><name>British</name> rushed through the narrow defile to succour their
	    <lb/>exhausted comrades</p>
          <p>The <name>Americans</name> seemed undaunted by the arrival of
	    <lb/>fresh forces to the enemy. They formed their lines
	    <lb/>with coolness and precision, and prepared anew for the
	    <lb/>charge.</p>
          <p>A soldier, who had beheld with grief the capture of
	    <lb/>his wounded Major, seized this moment of surprise and

	    <lb/>confusion to rush forward and drag him within the de­
	    <lb/>file, where he placed him under the care of a disabled
	    <lb/>comrade, and without being missed or observed regain­
	    <lb/>ed his station before the attack commenced.</p>
          <p>A sanguinary conflict now ensued, sustained on both
	    <lb/>sides with such unparalleled vigor and obstinacy, that it
	    <lb/>is impossible to say which would have gained the vic­
	    <lb/>tory. But happily for the preservation of life, the
	    <lb/>heavens became obscured by clouds, and the total dark­
	    <lb/>ness which ensued forced the combatants to terminate
	    <lb/>the bloody strife.</p>
          <p>The <name>Americans</name> then drew off their forces, probably
	    <lb/>not judging it advisable to remain till morning so near
	    <lb/>the main body of the British army, and left the royal
	    <lb/>party unmolested to retire to their encampment.</p>

          <p><persName>Major Courtland</persName> recovered his senses shortly after
	    <lb/>his removal to the camp, and on opening his eyes, the
	    <lb/>first objects which they encountered, were <persName>Captain

	    <lb/>The joy of the attached servant broke forth in rap­
	    <lb/>turous exclamations, when he witnessed the arrival of
	    <lb/>his master from his long and deathlike swoon. <persName>Captain

	    <lb/>and sincerity; and, after thanking him for his kindness
	    <lb/>and attention, <persName>Major Courtland</persName> requested him to give

          <p><said>The men were struck with dismay when they saw
	      <lb/>you fall,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, instantly complying with the
	    <lb/>Major's request; <said>they fired at random and would in
	      <lb/>defiance of my exertions have forced me to surrender,
	      <lb/>had not a reinforcement arrived just in time to save me
	      <lb/>from disgrace. Warm work ensued; and, with all our
	      <lb/>valor and fresh forces besides, those fighting rebels
	      <lb/>would have beat us hollow, had not the complaisant
	      <lb/>heavens, sympathizing, no doubt, in our distress, seen
	      <lb/>fit to veil themselves in clouds, and so saved us the
	      <lb/>shame of skulking like hounds to our camp; or what
	      <lb/>would have been far worse, of following to the enemy's,
	      <lb/>at the heels of that black looking fellow who led the
	      <lb/>rebels on, and stood fire and sword like a bomb-proof
	      <lb/>house. And do you know, Major,</said> he continued, <said>that
	      <lb/>you came near losing your scalp, by the means of that
	      <lb/>tawny representative of <persName>Satan</persName>, who set up such an in­
	      <lb/>fernal howl at the log castle yonder? But just as he
	      <lb/>was about to strike, this same leader, <persName>Grame</persName>, or <persName>Gra­
		<lb/>hame</persName>, I think some one called him, reproved the savage
	      <lb/>in a tone, that caused him quickly to desist from his 
	      <lb/>bloody design. I wish,</said> he added, <said><persName>General Burgoyne</persName><lb/>would win over this rebel officer, and keep him to fright­
	      <lb/>en our savage allies into submission; otherwise I fear
	      <lb/>we shall be starved out of our quarters here, and beaten
	      <lb/>out of our bravery in the next engagement to boot.</said></p>
          <p><said>A truce to your ridiculous fears, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>;</said> ex­
	    <lb/>claimed the Major, impatient at this suggestion. And
	    <lb/>desirous to change the subject, he asked, <said>Has the ras­
	      <lb/>cal who betrayed us been discovered yet, and if not,
	      <lb/>are any steps to be taken for the purpose?</said></p>
          <p><said>The general,</said> replied <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, <said>has offered re­
	      <lb/>wards for his apprehension; all condemn the traitorous
	      <lb/>villain, and wish him brought to punishment, but you
	      <lb/>are aware, that in the present crisis every mind is filled
	      <lb/>with concerns, which serve to render this affair a matter
	      <lb/>of secondary interest.</said></p>
          <p><said>I do not consider it so,</said> returned <persName>Major Courtland</persName>,
	    <lb/><said>and think the fellow ought to be made an example of,

          <p><said>And so does every one,</said> said the Captain; <said>but
	      <lb/>what can be done? Watched as we are by eyes more
	      <lb/>vigilant than were the hundred glaring orbs of old
	      <lb/><persName>Argus</persName> himself, our most active efforts would be fruitless.
	      <lb/>I will vouch for it, that before this, he is safely lodged
	      <lb/>in snug quarters, where he finds better living and jollier
	      <lb/>hearts than he met with here.</said></p>
          <p><said>But not stouter ones,</said> exclaimed the Major;
	    <lb/><said rend="pre()"><choice><sic/><corr>“</corr></choice>though your's, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, seems strongly inclining to­
	      <lb/>wards the milk and honey of the American camp.</said></p>
          <p>The color mounted to <persName>O'Carroll's</persName> face. <said>None but
	      <lb/>a superior officer would have dared to suggest such a
	      <lb/>suspicion,</said> he said; <said>and <persName>Major Courtland</persName>,</said> he added
	    <lb/>in a tone of wounded feeling, <said>is the last man, from
	      <lb/>whom I should have expected an imputation, alike un­
	      <lb/>just to my sentiments, and degrading to my character
	      <lb/>as a British officer.</said></p>
          <p><said>Pshaw, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>!</said> said the Major, <said>your Irish
	      <lb/>blood is too inflammable by half; you know me too well
	      <lb/>to take so seriously what was said and meant jocosely:
	      <lb/>and I, my dear fellow,</said> he continued, affectionately
	    <lb/>grasping his hand, <said>have seen too many instances of
	      <lb/>your bravery and self-denying loyalty, to harbor a single
	      <lb/>doubt of your constancy, even amidst severer trials
	      <lb/>than those which now beset us.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> warmly returned the pressure of
	    <lb/>the Major's hand, while the indignant flush which had
	    <lb/>overspread his handsome and ingenuous features, was
	    <lb/>succeeded by one of shame for the earnestness, with
	    <lb/>which he had resented his playful raillery.</p>
          <p><said>You are undeservedly kind, sir,</said> he said; <said>but it
	      <lb/>shall be my study to merit this flattering expression of
	      <lb/>your good opinion, and to your indulgence I will trust,
	      <lb/>to pardon the boyish impetuosity which prompted me
	      <lb/>so hastily to resent a harmless jest!</said></p>
          <p><said>It would be absurd to take exceptions at the im­

	      <lb/>terrible explosion.</said></p>
          <p><said>You are not far from right, Major,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,
	    <lb/>laughing; <said>and if ever we arrive at the end of this
	      <lb/>tiresome war, I intend to locate myself in the Scotch
	      <lb/>Highlands, and temper my Irish warmth with some of
	      <lb/>the icy particles, which float in the clear atmosphere of
	      <lb/>those frosty regions. But I see you are fatigued,
	      <lb/>Major; so I will leave you to the care of <persName>Hugh</persName> for the
	      <lb/>present, and go out to gather something that will amuse
	      <lb/>you, when I return.</said></p>
          <p>A few days of rest and careful nursing served to
	    <lb/>restore <persName>Major Courtland</persName> nearly to his usual health.
	    <lb/>The wound which he had received was neither deep
	    <lb/>nor dangerous, though the violence of his fall and a
	    <lb/>considerable loss of blood had rendered him, for some­
	    <lb/>time, insensible, and occasioned a degree of weakness
	    <lb/>which closely confined him for an umber of days. <persName>Cap­
	      <lb/>tain O'Carroll</persName> who had imbibed for <persName>Major Courtland</persName>
	    <lb/>an ardent attachment, and indeed his sanguine tem­
	    <lb/>perament rendered him incapable of feeling any other,
	    <lb/>shared with <persName>Hugh</persName> the pleasure of attending him; and,
	    <lb/>except when professional duty required his presence
	    <lb/>elsewhere, he was always beside the invalid, reading to
	    <lb/>amuse him, or cheering the languor of illness with the
	    <lb/>sportive sallies of his inexhaustible gaiety.</p>
          <p>As the Major was one evening sitting and musing
	    <lb/>alone, on the occurrences of the past, and the probable
	    <lb/>events of the future, <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> entered with
	    <lb/>an air somewhat less gay than usual.</p>
          <p><said>What tidings have you, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>?</said> asked the Ma­
	    <lb/>jor, earnestly regarding him; <said>has any thing disastrous
	      <lb/>occurred in the camp? or has another score of our
	      <lb/>savage allies deserted us? Something I am sure has
	      <lb/>disturbed you.</said></p>
          <p><said>That would not disturb me,</said> returned <persName>O'Carroll</persName>.
	    <lb/><said>The barbarous wretches!</said> he continued with energy;
	    <lb/><said>would to Heaven the army were cleansed from every
	      <lb/>stain of them; for, on my honor, I believe a curse has
	      <lb/>lighted on us for employing such ferocious beings.</said></p>

          <p><said>What! soon after we left <name>Fort Edward</name>? I recol­

	    <lb/>of the unfortunate <persName>Jane McRea</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>Yes;</said> returned <persName>O'Carroll</persName> with feeling; <said>amidst
	      <lb/>the solitude and desolation of a wilderness, this lovely
	      <lb/>girl was bound, by two ferocious savages, to a tree, and
	      <lb/>cruelly scalped and murdered. Without a hand to aid,
	      <lb/>or a voice to sooth her, she fell a victim to the wanton
	      <lb/>fury of monsters, human only in outward form.</said></p>
          <p><said>Let us dwell no longer on this melancholy subject,</said><lb/>said <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, as he remarked the flushed cheek
	    <lb/>and saddened countenance of his gay young friend.
	    <lb/><said>It has a depressing effect,</said> he added, <said>and I feel that
	      <lb/>I want excitement of a more cheerful nature; your ab­
	      <lb/>sence to day has left me too much time for reflection,
	      <lb/>and I have dwelt more on the endearments of home,
	      <lb/>than a soldier, whose views cannot extend with certainty
	      <lb/>beyond the present hour, has any right to do. And
	      <lb/>now what have you to relate that can afford me enter­
	      <lb/>tainment!</said></p>
          <p><said>It is rumored,</said> replied <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, shaking off his
	    <lb/>unwonted melancholy and speaking with cheerfulness;
	    <lb/><said>It is rumoured in the camp that <persName>General Burgoyne</persName>
	      <lb/>has received a letter in cyphers from <persName>Sir Henry Clin­
		<lb/>ton</persName>, informing him of his intention to attack some for­
	      <lb/>tresses, which the rebels have in the Highlands, I think;
	      <lb/>is there not such a place?</said></p>
          <p><said>Yes, on the <placeName>North river</placeName>,</said> returned <persName>Major Courtland</persName>,
	    <lb/><said>between <placeName>Albany</placeName> and <placeName>New York</placeName>; and these fortresses
	      <lb/>are designed to guard the passage up to <placeName>Albany</placeName>.</said></p>

          <mw type="pageNum">71</mw>
          <p><said>Aye, but <persName>Sir Henry</persName> will soon tumble them about
	      <lb/>the ears of the rebellious garrison, or I am greatly mis­
	      <lb/>taken,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>And what great good will result from their demol­
	      <lb/>ition?</said> inquired the Major, somewhat impatiently.
	    <lb/><said>Our situation is becoming every day more desperate;
	      <lb/>our numbers are diminishing, our provisions shrinking,
	      <lb/>our cattle dying, while the enemy, directly in front of
	      <lb/>us, impede our progress, and threaten to cut us in pie­
	      <lb/>ces if we stir.</said></p>
          <p><said>But this unexpected attack upon the important for­
	      <lb/>tresses on the <placeName>North river</placeName>,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, <said>may do us
	      <lb/>essential service, by inducing <persName>General Gates</persName> to weaken
	      <lb/>his army, in order to send them succours.</said></p>
          <p><said>No, he is too cautious for that,</said> said the Major;
	    <lb/><said><persName>Gates</persName> is a consummate General, and will let these
	      <lb/>forts with all their garrisons be blown up, rather than
	      <lb/>permit us to recover the least advantage here. But has
	      <lb/>the General returned any answer to <persName>Clinton</persName>?</said></p>
          <p><said>I am told by <persName>Colonel Percy</persName>,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, <said>who
	      <lb/>in some way learns all the secrets of the cabinet, that
	      <lb/>two officers have volunteered to go in disguise to <persName>Sir
	      <lb/>Henry</persName>, with any despatch which the General may wish
	      <lb/>to send; and that in consequence of this offer, he has
	      <lb/>resolved to send them with an exact account of our
	      <lb/>situation to <persName>Sir Henry</persName>, and press him to prosecute his
	      <lb/>design.</said></p>
          <p><said>And how long are we to remain cooped up in this
	      <lb/>encampment?</said> asked <persName>Major Courtland</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>Till <persName>Sir Henry</persName> has battered down all the forts, and
	      <lb/>quelled all the rebels between this and <placeName>New York</placeName>, I
	      <lb/>suppose,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>for I believe the General
	      <lb/>is in no haste to come to an engagement till he is suc­
	      <lb/>coured by the southern army.</said></p>
          <p><said>And how are they to succour us?</said> demanded the
	    <lb/>Major, in an impatient tone, <said>hemmed in as we are by
	      <lb/>a powerful army, whose numbers and strength are con­
	      <lb/>stantly increasing!</said></p>
          <p><persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> shook his head with a smile, and,
	    <lb/><persName>Colonel Percy</persName> at that moment entering, he referred the
	    <pb n="72"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="6(6)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">72</mw>
	    <lb/>Major to him, again asserting that he was in all the se­
	    <lb/>crets of the cabinet.</p>
          <p><said>I only know,</said> said <persName>Colonel Percy</persName>, <said>that two officers
	      <lb/>have gone off in different directions with despatches for
	      <lb/><persName>Sir Henry Clinton</persName>.</said></p>
          <p><said>And may I ask what was the nature of those des­
	      <lb/>patches?</said> said <persName>Major Courtland</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>To inform <persName>Sir Henry</persName>, as I have understood,</said> said
	    <lb/>the colonel, <said>of the present situation of the army, to
	      <lb/>urge him to attack the American forts, in the hope of
	      <lb/>diverting part of the force under <persName>General Gates</persName>, and to
	      <lb/>say that he would retain the position we now occupy
	      <lb/>till the <date when="1777-10-12">twelfth of <name>October</name></date>, in the anticipation of more
	      <lb/>favorable events.</said></p>
          <p><said>The <date when="1777-10-12">twelfth of <name>October</name></date>, and it is now only <date when="1777-10-01">the
	      <lb/>first</date>!</said> exclaimed <persName>Major Courtland</persName>. <said>Impossible, ut­
	      <lb/>terly impossible! <persName>Colonel Percy</persName>. The men cannot
	      <lb/>live without food, and we have not provisions to last a
	      <lb/>week.</said></p>
          <p><said>And what is worse yet,</said> said <persName>Colonel Percy</persName>, <said>all
	      <lb/>means of communication with <placeName>Canada</placeName> are in danger of
	      <lb/>being destroyed, and our hope of retreat, should we at
	      <lb/>last be constrained to attempt one, entirely cut off.</said></p>
          <p><said>How so?</said> inquired the Major, hastily.</p>
          <p><said>Intelligence has just reached the camp,</said> replied
	    <lb/><persName>Colonel Percy</persName>, <said>of an attempt making by the <name>Ameri­
		<lb/>cans</name> to recover the fortress of <placeName>Ticonderoga</placeName>. They
	      <lb/>have already surprised the outposts, taken mounts <placeName>Hope</placeName>
	      <lb/>and <placeName>Defiance</placeName>, besides a great number of batteaux and
	      <lb/>an armed sloop. They are now making vigorous at­
	      <lb/>tacks upon the works, and should they surrender, Heav­
	      <lb/>en only knows what fatal influence the event may have
	      <lb/>upon the issue of this campaign.</said></p>
          <p><said>Fatal indeed,</said> responded <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, <said>and
	      <lb/>at best our affairs are nearly de<choice><sic/><corr>s</corr></choice>perate. If we are de­
	      <lb/>feated in the next engagement, we are inevitably lost.
	      <lb/>Yet what does it signify, when all are active around us,
	      <lb/>that we continue idle in our encampment, vainly wait­
	      <lb/>ing for aid, which will probably never reach us? Our
	      <lb/>soldiers are not yet weakened by famine, though Heaven
	      <pb n="73"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="7(1)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">73</mw>
	      <lb/>knows it is fast approaching; they are impatient for ac­
	      <lb/>tion, and why are they not led forth to meet the enemy,
	      <lb/>before he has become so powerful as to crush us at a
	      <lb/>single blow?</said></p>
          <p><said>It is indeed the only chance which can save us,</said><lb/>said <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, <said>and the sooner we engage the
	      <lb/>rebels the better. As to waiting for the movements of
	      <lb/><persName>General Clinton</persName>, it is a vain thing, unless, like the an­
	      <lb/>cient <name>Israelites</name>, we expect to be fed with manna; for,
	      <lb/>if I may judge from the anatomies of fowls, which
	      <lb/>graced our table to-day, Colonel, there is not much of
	      <lb/>the fat of the land to be found in our camp.</said></p>
          <p><said>You seem to have a gread dread of famine, <persName>O'Car­
		<lb/>roll</persName>,</said> said the Colonel, laughing; <said>but you know it is
	      <lb/>only to make a nocturnal sally upon some of the log
	      <lb/>houses in the neighbourhood, to get a supply at once.</said></p>
          <p><said>With all my heart,</said> answered the Captain <said>so
	      <lb/>there are no <name>Indians</name> in the case.</said></p>
          <p><said>But, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,</said> said <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, <said>these
	      <lb/>savages that you dread so much, are less invincible than
	      <lb/>the brave fellow who led on the <name>Americans</name>, and fought
	      <lb/>so like a lion at their head that he seemed almost as
	      <lb/>terrible as <persName>Mars</persName> himself.</said></p>
          <p><said>There is a pleasure in measuring swords with such
	      <lb/>a noble foe,</said> said the Captain, <said>far above what is felt
	      <lb/>in the conquest of hosts of meaner rivals. Amid all
	      <lb/>the fury of the fight, I could not but remark his lofty
	      <lb/>bearing, his intrepid bravery, the air of calm self-pos­
	      <lb/>session with which he directed the movements of his
	      <lb/>men, and the resolute courage with which he met and
	      <lb/>returned our most furious onsets. Even the graceful
	      <lb/>ease with which he reined in his noble war-horse did
	      <lb/>not escape my observation, in despite of the obscurity
	      <lb/>and confusion of the scene, nor the tone of proud and
	      <lb/>awful authority which checked the murderous design of
	      <lb/>the <name>Indian</name>, when in the very act of raising his toma­
	      <lb/>hawk to strike the defenceless head of <persName>Major Court­
		<lb/>land</persName>.</said></p>
          <p><said>I wish I knew the name of this hero, whom you
	      <lb/>have exalted into a demi-god,</said> said the major, smiling;
	    <mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(+3)">7</mw>

	    <lb/><said>if he were a damsel in disguise, you would not have
	      <lb/>burst forth into a more passionate eulogium.</said></p>
          <p><said>I only know that his name is <persName>Grahame</persName>,</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>O'Carroll</persName>, <said>and that he is as gallant in the field as the
	      <lb/>bravest knight that ever won the prize at a tourna­
	      <lb/>ment.</said></p>
          <p><said>He possesses humanity and generosity at least,</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>Major Courtland</persName>; <said>and, if the fortune of war should
	      <lb/>ever throw him in my power, I shall strive to convince
	      <lb/>him that national animosities cannot chill the warm
	      <lb/>and grateful feelings of an <name>Englishman's</name> heart.</said></p>
          <p><said>I believe,</said> said <persName>Colonel Percy</persName>, <said>I may claim the
		<lb/>honor of an acquaintance with this brave man; if he
		<lb/>bears a colonel's commission in the rebel army it is the
		<lb/>same; and I can truly say he is as much of the accom­
		<lb/>plished gentleman as of the gallant soldier. He is an
		<lb/>honor to his profession, and I have only to regret that
		<lb/>the sword, which he wields so bravely, is not employed
	      <lb/>in a more just and righteous cause.</said></p>
          <p><said>And where did you chance to become personally ac­
	      <lb/>quainted with this valiant champion of liberty?</said> inquir­
	    <lb/>ed <persName>Major Courtland</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>I had the honor, as you perhaps know,</said> returned
	    <lb/>the Colonel, <said>to serve under <persName>General Sir Guy Carlton</persName>,
	      <lb/>at the time of the attack upon <placeName>Quebec</placeName> by the <name>Ameri­
	      <lb/>cans</name>, two years ago. The failure of their daring enter­
	      <lb/>prise threw many of the assailants into our hands, and
	      <lb/>Colonel, then <persName>Captain Grahame</persName>, who was severely
	      <lb/>wounded, among the rest. His name I found spread
	      <lb/>terror among our troops, and revived the drooping cou­
	      <lb/>rage of his own. During the assault upon the works,
	      <lb/>he had performed prodigies of valor. He was one of
	      <lb/>the first who daringly leaped upon the barricade at the
	      <lb/><name xml:lang="fr">Saut des Matelots</name>, and made prisoner the captain of
	      <lb/>the guard with most of his men. Darkness, and igno­
	      <lb/>rance of the situation of the town, alone prevented the
	      <lb/>procedure of the <name>Americans</name>; but when daylight re­
	      <lb/>turned, they rallied their gallant little band, amounting
	      <lb/>to no more than two hundred men, and for three hours
	      <lb/>combatted the whole force of our garrison, when un­
	      <pb n="75"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="7(2)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">75</mw>
	      <lb/>able any longer to sustain a conflict so unequal, they
	      <lb/>surrendered themselves prisoners of war; but not be­
	      <lb/>fore <persName>Captain Grahame</persName>, bleeding and covered with
	      <lb/>wounds, had fallen lifeless to the ground.</said></p>
          <p><said>What gallantry!</said> exclaimed <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, excited by
	    <lb/>the relation of the Colonel. <said>You compel me, <persName>Colo­
		<lb/>nel Percy</persName>, to admire a people whom from my very soul
	      <lb/>I wish to detest; and had I lived among them, and
	      <lb/>known them as <persName>Major Courtland</persName> has done, I am not
	      <lb/>certain that I should have continued as loyal as he is.</said></p>
          <p><said>If you are inclined to espouse their cause, <persName>O'Car­
		<lb/>roll</persName>, it is not too late now,</said> said the Major, smiling;
	    <lb/><said>but first let us hear the Colonel's account of this young
	      <lb/>officer, who has so bewitched your Irish fancy.</said></p>
          <p><said>He remained with us,</said> resumed <persName>Colonel Percy</persName>,
	    <lb/><said>till an exchange of prisoners took place, during which
	      <lb/>time I had frequent opportunities of enjoying his socie­
	      <lb/>ty. I found him manly, intelligent, liberal in sentiment,
	      <lb/>possessing a cultivated mind, and highly captivating and
	      <lb/>polished manners. He was the idol of the soldiery,
	      <lb/>and a favourite with all his brother officers, although
	      <lb/>there was a slight expression of sternness in his counte­
	      <lb/>nance, and a degree of hauteur in his manners, which
	      <lb/>oftener repels than conciliates affection. And yet I know
	      <lb/>not how, but so it was, that all hearts were attracted to­
	      <lb/>wards him, and all minds delighted in his society. A
	      <lb/>certain secret but resistless fascination seemed to sur­
	      <lb/>round him, which drew every one within its influence.</said></p>
          <p><said>And have you never met him since that time,</said> in­
	    <lb/>quired <persName>O'Carroll</persName>. <said>Never,</said> answered <persName>Colonel Percy</persName>,
	    <lb/><said>till the engagement of the <date when="1777-09-19">nineteenth</date>, brought us
	      <lb/>again within view of each other. But his corps occu­
	      <lb/>pying a station farther to the right than mine, saved us
	      <lb/>the pain of being directly opposed in this deadly en­
	      <lb/>counter. I think I could not have deliberately aimed
	      <lb/>at the life of a man, whom I so much admire, and with
	      <lb/>whom I have lived on terms of the most famliliar inti­
	      <lb/>macy.</said></p>
          <p><said>But had you been with us,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, <said>on
	      <lb/>the night when that howling <name>Cerberus</name> of an <name>Indian</name>

	      <lb/>brought down a whole detachment of the rebels upon
	      <lb/>us, friendship, kindness, and good will, would have
	      <lb/>yielded to the desperation and excitement of the com­
	      <lb/>bat.</said></p>
          <p><said>The darkness and confusion,</said> said the Colonel,
	    <lb/><said>would probably have prevented my recognizing in
	      <lb/>my opponent the person of an old friend. But had it
	      <lb/>not been so, I should have remembered the claims of
	      <lb/>my country, and performed my duty, though the foe
	      <lb/>whom I encountered had been my dearest friend. But
	      <lb/>your account of the <name>Indian</name>, <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, recalls
	      <lb/>to my recollection an incident, which was related to
	      <lb/>me, during our stay at <name>Fort Edward</name>, and which, as it
	      <lb/>tends still farther to develope the character of this inte­
	      <lb/>resting officer, it will afford me pleasure to relate.</said></p>
          <p>
            <said>A chief of the Mohawk nation had located himself
	      <lb/>on the banks of the <placeName>Hudson</placeName>, a few miles from <name>Fort
		<lb/>Edward</name>, and collected around him a small settlement
	      <lb/>composed of six or eight families, whom he was at­
	      <lb/>tempting to teach some of the arts of civilization. You
	      <lb/>smile, <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, but it was even so; and more
	      <lb/>incredible still, this <name>Indian</name> had received a good educa­
	      <lb/>tion at a school established by a missionary in one of
	      <lb/>the colonies, <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName>, I believe, for the express
	      <lb/>purpose of enlightening these savage hordes.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>And of course,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, <said>they were then
	      <lb/>returned to their native forests to teach knowledge to
	      <lb/>the panthers and jackalls. As a quicker and surer
	      <lb/>method I would advise to adopt these less ferocious
	      <lb/>animals for pupils, and when their education was com­
	      <lb/>plete, send them forth to civilize their savage neighbors.
	      <lb/>But a truce to trifling; though I confess, Colonel, the
	      <lb/>idea of a civilized <name>Indian</name> is an anomaly far beyond my
	      <lb/>comprehension.</said></p>
          <p><said>Anomalous as it may appear to you, <persName>Captain O'Car­
		<lb/>roll</persName>,</said> said the Major, <said>the information which <persName>Colonel
	      <lb/>Percy</persName> has given you respecting the school is strictly
	      <lb/>true. And more than this, it has been attended with
	      <lb/>so much success, that about eight years since it receiv­
	      <lb/>ed a charter of incorporation for a university, and is

	      <lb/>now under the especial patronage and protection of the
	      <lb/><persName>Earl of <placeName>Dartmouth</placeName></persName>.</said></p>
          <p><persName>O'Carroll</persName> was mute with astonishment, and <persName>Colonel
	    <lb/>Percy</persName>, smiling at the mixture of surprise and incredu­
	    <lb/>lity which appeared upon his features, proceeded in
	    <lb/>his narration.</p>
          <said rend="bequeath((pre(“))(p))">
            <p>This Mohawk chief, who was called <persName>Ohmeina</persName>, had
	      <lb/>imbibed a strong attachment for the <name>Americans</name>, during
	      <lb/>the period of his residence among them. Grateful for
	      <lb/>their kindness, and for the instructions which they had
	      <lb/>given him, he refused to join in the league which his
	      <lb/>tribe made with us, against his benefactors, and by en­
	      <lb/>treaties and remonstrances induced his little colony to
	      <lb/>preserve the neutrality which had been recommended
	      <lb/>to them by the <name>Americans</name>. Shortly after his return
	      <lb/>from the populous abodes of men, he took a wife of his
	      <lb/>own nation, resumed his former savage costume, and
	      <lb/>with it many habits of his early life; partly from
	      <lb/>a wish to avoid the jealousy of his neighbours, and part­
	      <lb/>ly from that attachment to the impressions of youth,
	      <lb/>which is peculiarly strong in the savage tribes, and
	      <lb/>which all the advantages and comforts of civilization
	      <lb/>had not been able to eradicate from the heart of this
	      <lb/>Mohawk chief. But nothing could induce him to en­
	      <lb/>gage in hostilities; neither the threats and intreaties of
	      <lb/>his brethren, nor the alluring bribes of our people were
	      <lb/>of the least avail. True to his determination, he
	      <lb/>steadily resisted both, and daily instilled into the minds
	      <lb/>of his children and his colony, a reverence and love
	      <lb/>for that people, who had instructed him concerning the
	      <lb/>Great Being who formed them, and had taught him so
	      <lb/>many good and wonderful things from their books of
	      <lb/>knowledge.</p>
            <p>The officers of the American army, then occupy­
	      <lb/>ing <name>Fort Edward</name>, often visited this little settlement, but
	      <lb/>of all who went none was more joyously welcomed then
	      <lb/><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>. He delighted to pass whole hours
	      <lb/>in conversing with the chief, whose forcible and highly
	      <lb/>figurative language had acquired elegance and proprie­
	      <lb/>ty by cultivation, without having lost any of its native

	      <lb/>strength and originality. He contemplated with plea­
	      <lb/>sure the happiness of <persName>Ohmeina's</persName> domestic life, and al­
	      <lb/>most envied the sweet tranquillity in which his days
	      <lb/>glided peacefully away. Five active boys, his pride
	      <lb/>and delight, were growing up around him, and their
	      <lb/>mother possessed a degree of beauty and feminine soft­
	      <lb/>ness, not often found among the red daughters of the
	      <lb/>forest.</p>
            <p>One exceedingly dark evening, the gloom of which
	      <lb/>was rendered more awful by vivid flashes of lightning,
	      <lb/>which seemed to wrap the heavens in a flame, as <persName>Col­
	      <lb/>onel Grahame</persName> was returning, from a short expedition, to
	      <lb/>the fort, at the head of a small detachment of soldiers,
	      <lb/>he observed a bright light flashing at intervals, above
	      <lb/>the tall forest trees which surrounded the infant settle­
	      <lb/>ment of the pacific <name>Indians</name>. At first he thought the
	      <lb/>lightning might have struck some tree and set it on fire,
	      <lb/>but soon apprehending some more serious evil, he or­
	      <lb/>dered his men to halt, and riding a few paces in advance,
	      <lb/>he plainly distinguished the cries of children, the shrieks
	      <lb/>of women, and the terrific war-whoop of the savages,
	      <lb/>mingling with the sullen blast, which swept through the
	      <lb/>forests. Followed by his men, he plunged into the
	      <lb/>narrow foot-path which led to the Indian village. As
	      <lb/>he approached it, the sounds of terror and distress be­
	      <lb/>came more distinct, and <persName>Grahame</persName>, filled with appre­
	      <lb/>hension for the fate of the unfortunate <name>Indians</name>, urged
	      <lb/>on his panting steed, till the whole frightful scene burst
	      <lb/>upon him and all his suspicions were at once confirmed.
	      <lb/>Every wigwam was in flames, and the dead and the
	      <lb/>dying lay bleeding on the ground around the burning
	      <lb/>walls of their late happy homes. A few half-naked
	      <lb/>females ran shrieking to the forest for safety, while in
	      <lb/>the midst of this scene of disolation, the chief, <persName>Ohmeina</persName>,
	      <lb/>with the wretched remnant of his people, were contend­
	      <lb/>ing with a band of savages greatly exceeding them in
	      <lb/>number. <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> was filled with horror at
	      <lb/>the frightful aspect of the assailants. Their faces stain­
	      <lb/>ed with paint, their unearthly yells, their stern ferocity,
	      <lb/>as they brandished their tomahawks, bathed with the
	      <lb/>blood of the innocent, and glittering in the lurid glare

	      <lb/>of the flames, which their demoniac rage had en­
	      <lb/>kindled, produced a sight revolting to the feelings of
	      <lb/>humanity, and which roused to indignation every ge­
	      <lb/>erous impulse of his heart. The shrieks of the misera­
	      <lb/>ble victims, and the discordant cries of their fiendlike
	      <lb/>murderers, had prevented them from perceiving the
	      <lb/>approach of the American party, till a bright flash of
	      <lb/>lightning revealed them, just emerging from the dark
	      <lb/>precincts of the forest. The next moment they advanc­
	      <lb/>ed into the area, where every object was visible in the
	      <lb/>light of the blazing wigwams, and were greeted by a
	      <lb/>shout of joy from the chief and his adherents. A vol­
	      <lb/>ley of musketry instantly rattled among the enemy, and
	      <lb/>killed several of their number; but, contrary to their
	      <lb/>usual custom, instead of flying at the sight of fire-arms,
	      <lb/>they rushed with more determined fury to the combat.</p>
            <p>Having expended all their cartridges with effect,
	      <lb/>the soldiers of <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> rushed, with the point
	      <lb/>of the bayonet, upon the obstinate savages. One, more
	      <lb/>malignant even than his fellows, who had been grappling
	      <lb/>with <persName>Ohmeina</persName>, seeing the Colonel approach, quitted his
	      <lb/>prey, but aimed, at the same moment, a successful blow
	      <lb/>at a boy of ten years old, who stood beside the chief,
	      <lb/>and felled him to the ground. The desolated <persName>Ohmeina</persName>
	      <lb/>cast a glance of anguish on his son, as he lay bleeding at
	      <lb/>his feet, and then, with an air of determined vengeance,
	      <lb/>turned upon his murderer. But <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> had
	      <lb/>already avenged the wrongs of his Indian friend. The
	      <lb/>savage fell before his invincible assailant, and those of
	      <lb/>his followers who did not share his fate, precipitately
	      <lb/>quitted the scene of action, and fled, pursued by the
	      <lb/><name>Americans</name> to the shelter of their forests. Of all this
	      <lb/>happy little colony, two only, beside the chief, remain­
	      <lb/>ed; their dwellings were consumed, their fields laid
	      <lb/>waste, and their wives and children murdered in cold
	      <lb/>blood before their eyes. <persName>Ohmeina's</persName> wife and sons had
	      <lb/>been the first victims of this inhuman massacre. The
	      <lb/>eldest only had escaped, and followed his father with all
	      <lb/>the intrepidity of manhood, to avenge the death of his
	      <lb/>mother and brothers.</p>

            <p>The cause of this unprovoked attack <persName>Ohmeina</persName> sup­
	      <lb/>posed to originate in the anger of a neighbouring chief,
	      <lb/>who with his tribe had joined the <name>British</name>, and, having
	      <lb/>been urgent with <persName>Ohmeina</persName> to do the same, had, upon
	      <lb/>his refusal, sworn to punish his obstinacy, ascribing it
	      <lb/>to his superior knowledge, which raised him, in his
	      <lb/>own estimation, above his brethren, and made him wish
	      <lb/>to keep them in subjection, for which purpose doubtless,
	      <lb/>he had formed a league with the <name>Americans</name>.</p>
            <p>Two of
	      <persName>Colonel Grahame's</persName> soldiers only had been
	      <lb/>killed in the conflict, and some of the others now as­
	      <lb/>sisted the <name>Indians</name> to form a litter of the branches of
	      <lb/>trees, on which they placed the boy, who was still alive,
	      <lb/>and returned with him to the fort, followed by the <name>In­
		<lb/>dians</name>. <persName>Ohmeina</persName> walked, in stern and gloomy silence,
	      <lb/>by the side of his son; and during the melancholy
	      <lb/>march not a word was spoken by any of the party; so
	      <lb/>sad was the impression which the dreadful events of the
	      <lb/>night had made upon every mind.</p>
            <p>The grief of the chief was deep but silent; <persName>Colonel
	      <lb/>Grahame</persName> sought to alleviate it by the expression of his
	      <lb/>sympathy, and to press upon the heart of the unfortunate
	      <lb/>man, those mild and soothing precepts of christianity, in
	      <lb/>which he had been instructed, and which had so greatly
	      <lb/>tended to soften and humanize his savage nature. But
	      <lb/>nothing touched him so sensibly as the young officer's
	      <lb/>kindness to his wounded boy. He placed him on his
	      <lb/>own couch and watched with tender solicitude by his
	      <lb/>side; but he did not long survive his wounds, and when
	      <lb/>he died, the grateful <name>Indian</name> devoted his life to his bene­
	      <lb/>factor, and clings to him, it is said, with such enthusiastic
	      <lb/>attachment, that danger, and even death in their most
	      <lb/>frightful forms, have no terrors for him, when engaged
	      <lb/>in his service.</p>
          </said>
          <p><said>It was he then,</said> said <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, who, as
	    <lb/>well as <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, had listened with deep in­
	    <lb/>terest to this narration, <said>who gave the alarm at the log
	      <lb/>hut in the forest?</said></p>
          <p><said>Yes, undoubtedly,</said> returned the Colonel; <said>and I
	      <lb/>wonder the recollection of this affair did not occur to
	      <pb n="81"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="7(5)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">81</mw>
	      <lb/>me, when <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> first mentioned the <name>Indian</name>.
	      <lb/>Wherever <persName>Ohmeina</persName> is seen, one may be sure, as I am
	      <lb/>informed, that <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> is not very remote.</said></p>
          <p><said>Your narrative,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, <said>certainly bears
	      <lb/>an honorable testimony to the bravery and humanity of
	      <lb/><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>; yet I assure you, Colonel, I feel no
	      <lb/>greater fondness for the society of these scalping savag­
	      <lb/>es than I did before, and am rather inclined to believe
	      <lb/>from the uncivilized howl, with which this same <persName>Oh­
		<lb/>meina</persName> greeted us the other night, that he has relapsed
	      <lb/>into his original barbarity, since the descent of his savage
	      <lb/>brethren upon his colony.</said></p>
          <p><said>You are incorrigible, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,</said> said the Colonel
	    <lb/>laughing; <said>once adopt a belief, and it possesses you
	      <lb/>forever. But we must away, to see what movements
	      <lb/>the enemy are making,</said> he said, starting up and looking
	    <lb/>at his watch. <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> obeyed the summons
	    <lb/>of his superior officer, and, bidding <persName>Major Courtland</persName>
<lb/>good night, they went out together.</p>

          <p>The difficulties and distresses of the British army had
	    <lb/>been daily increasing, since the engagement of the <date when="1777-09-19">nine­
	      <lb/>teenth</date>, till the peril of its situation at last became
	    <lb/>alarmingly great. The expected intelligence, on which

	      <lb/>Clinton</persName>; and though <persName>General Burgoyne</persName> had agreed to

	    <lb/>wait till the <date when="1777-10-12">twelfth</date>, and nearly a week of the appointed
	    <lb/>time was yet to elapse, he found his present position no
	    <lb/>longer tenable, and he came to the resolution of giving
	    <lb/>battle to the enemy in the desperate hope of forcing a
	    <lb/>passage to <placeName>Albany</placeName>, or, in case of the worst, of dis­
	    <lb/>lodging him, and securing a safe and convenient retreat.</p>
          <p>On the morning of the <date when="1777-10-07">seventh of <name>October</name></date>, therefore,
	    <lb/>the whole army was ordered under arms. Every coun­
	    <lb/>tenance was animated with the expectation of an im­
	    <lb/>mediate engagement, and every heart palpitated with
	    <lb/>the hope, and some with the assurance of victory. A
	    <lb/>few there were who felt too keenly the hopelessness of
	    <lb/>their condition to look for aught but honorable death,
	    <lb/>and, in the expectation of meeting it, they went forth
	    <lb/>with the firm and undaunted cheerfulness of loyal and
	    <lb/>brave men, conscious that their own honor, and that of
	    <lb/>the sovereign whom they loved and served, was deeply
	    <lb/>involved in the conduct of the day.</p>
          <p><persName>Major Courtland</persName>, though scarcely recovered from his
	    <lb/>recent wounds, was deaf to the solicitations of his friends,
	    <lb/>who entreated that he would spare himself the danger
	    <lb/>and fatigue, to which his reduced strength was not
	    <lb/>adequate; and when he absolutely refused their request,
	    <lb/>they urged him at least to remain with the guard of the
	    <lb/>camp, and not expose himself to the heat and confusion
	    <lb/>of a close and immediate action. But he was equally
	    <lb/>unyielding on this point, and prepared, with all the
	    <lb/>eagerness of a young soldier, for the expected attack.</p>
          <p>And bravely in that desperate action, did he maintain
	    <lb/>the courage and the honor of a British officer. An­
	    <lb/>imated by the example of their leaders, the men, with
	    <lb/>dauntless hearts, urged on the dreadful work of death;
	    <lb/>they stood unmoved the deadly fire of the enemy, nor
	    <lb/>shrunk from the encounter, when the conflict became
	    <lb/>more fierce and sanguinary.</p>
          <p>Around <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, whose corps occupied the
	    <lb/>left wing of the army, it thickened with terrible rapidity.
	    <lb/>In the ardor of the fight, he pressed forward to pursue
	    <lb/>an advantage, which he imagined he was gaining over
	    <lb/>a corps of the enemy against which his own was par­
	    <pb n="83"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="7(6)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">83</mw>
	    <lb/>ticularly opposed; quite unconscious of the danger, to
	    <lb/>which he exposed himself, till he was suddenly remind­
	    <lb/>ed of it by a ball, which, though intended for him pierced
	    <lb/>the breast of his horse and killed him instantly. A
	    <lb/>soldier more daring than his comrades, immediately
	    <lb/>advanced with his bayonet fixed towards the Major,
	    <lb/>while he was striving to disentangle himself from his
	    <lb/>fallen steed; when, perceiving the peril of his situation,
	    <lb/>with admirable presence of mind, he snatched a pistol
	    <lb/>from the holster and shot his assailant through the heart.
	    <lb/>But before he could effect his retreat, for he had in­
	    <lb/>cautiously advanced several paces before his men, the
	    <lb/>rifle of a soldier took surer aim and he fell; rather stun­
	    <lb/>ned by the blow, than injured by the wound, however,
	    <lb/>for happily the ball was spent before it struck him.
	    <lb/>But the momentary insensibility came near proving
	    <lb/>fatal to him; for an <name>Indian</name>, to whom no particular
	    <lb/>place seemed assigned, but who was hovering around
	    <lb/>and dealing death wherever he could, no sooner per­
	    <lb/>ceived the Major's situation, than he rushed forward,
	    <lb/>and dragging him nearer to the American lines, was on
	    <lb/>the point of letting his uplifted tomahawk descend upon
	    <lb/>the head of the defenceless officer, when a commanding
	    <lb/>voice in a tone of authority suspended his design.</p>
          <p>
            <said><persName>Ohmeina</persName>! the person of a vanquished foe is sacred;
	      <lb/>we wage no savage warfare here, and, as you value my
	      <lb/>friendship, let my commands in the future be obeyed.</said>
          </p>
          <p>The <name>Indian</name> dropped his weapon, and crossing his
	    <lb/>hands upon his breast, stood motionless with a look of
	    <lb/>profound humility.</p>
          <p><said>Secure your prisoner, but harm not one hair of his
	      <lb/>head,</said> resumed the young officer, who had spoken, and
	  <lb/>perceiving, as he bent from his horse to look at <persName>Major
	  <lb/>Courtland</persName>, that he had recovered from his momentary
	    <lb/>insensibility, he said in a tone of politeness and human­
	    <lb/>ity. <said>The fortunes of war make you my prisoner,
	      <lb/>Sir, but I hope you have received no serious injury.</said></p>
          <p><said>One far more galling, Sir,</said> returned the Major, in
	    <lb/>a tone which expressed the depth of his chagrin and
	    <lb/>mortification, <said>than the tomahawk of that savage, from

	      <lb/>which you have twice saved me, could have inflicted.
	      <lb/>If I mistake not, I address the gallant <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>,
	      <lb/>and it is not necessary to remind him that life without
	      <lb/>honor is not worth preserving.</said></p>
          <p>The American officer was in the act of replying,
	    <lb/>when <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, perceiving the situation of his
	    <lb/>Major, pressed resolutely forward, and before the sud­
	    <lb/>den and impetuous charge of his corps that of <persName>Colonel
	    <lb/>Grahame</persName> instantly gave way. <persName>Major Courtland</persName> seized
	    <lb/>the moment of confusion to recover his place, and it
	    <lb/>was fortunate that he did so, for just at this crisis the
	    <lb/><name>Americans</name> were strongly reinforced, and the action
	    <lb/>was renewed with increased fury.</p>
          <p>Overpowe<choice><sic/><corr>re</corr></choice>d by numbers, the whole left wing of the
	    <lb/>British army at last gave way, and the spirited exertions
	    <lb/>of the officers were scarcely able to preserve it from
	    <lb/>utter ruin. They, however, effected the retreat in tol­
	    <lb/>erable order, but not without great loss both of men and
	    <lb/>cannon. The horses were most of them destroyed, and
	    <lb/>many of the bravest officers of the army here met their
	    <lb/>death. <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> was severely wounded, and
	    <lb/><persName>Major Courtland</persName> received the contents of a musket in his
	    <lb/>breast, while defending the works, which the enemy
	    <lb/>attacked after they had driven the <name>British</name> from the
	    <lb/>field.</p>
          <p>When <persName>Major Courtland</persName> was conveyed to the hospital,
	    <lb/>it was already crowded with the wounded and the dying.
	    <lb/>The apartment in which he was placed, contained a
	    <lb/>number of officers, who, like himself, had been deposit­
	    <lb/>ed there in haste of the moment. Several ladies
	    <lb/>also, the wives of officers, with their children and do­
	    <lb/>mestics, were forced to remain in this wretched shelter,
	    <lb/>surrounded by objects of distress and terror. But with
	    <lb/>the characteristic heroism of their soft and all-enduring
	    <lb/>sex, they seemed to have shaken off the shrinking
	    <lb/>delicacy and timidity peculiar to them; and with looks
	    <lb/>of pitying gentleness, they hung over the wounded
	    <lb/>officers that were filling the apartment, and administer­
	    <lb/>ed to them what cordials and comforts their melancholy
	    <lb/>situation could command.</p>

	    <lb/>though his dying eyes, raised to her face, eloquently
	    <lb/>expressed the grateful emotions of his heart. Once he
	    <lb/>feebly grasped her hand and said in a faint voice,</p>
          <p><said>May Heaven bless you for your kindness, Madam, and
	      <lb/>restore your husband to you safe from the perils of bat­
	      <lb/>tle.</said> Then after a brief pause he added with a convulsive
	    <lb/>sigh, <said>Oh, fatal ambition, these are thy bitter fruits!
	      <lb/>Alas! my poor wife! hundreds like thee will this day
	      <lb/>render desolate!</said></p>
          <p>The lady's tears flowed fast, and she sought to hide
	    <lb/>her overpowering emotion by carressing the children
	    <lb/>who were clinging around her. As she stooped forward,
	    <lb/>her eyes encountered the ghastly figure of <persName>Major Court­
	    <lb/>land</persName>, whom the soldiers had laid upon a mattress spread
	    <lb/>upon the floor. <said>Alas! our sad number is fast increas­
	      <lb/>ing,</said> she said, as she approached his side, and bent to
	    <lb/>look upon his features. His melancholy eyes met her's,
	    <lb/>and a faint flush crossed his pale cheek, as he said, in
	    <lb/>a voice whose feeble tones expressed deep and bitter
	    <lb/>feelings,</p>
          <p><said>Ah, madam, these wounds are nothing compared
	      <lb/>to those, this day inflicted upon my country. We are
	      <lb/>beaten,</said> he added, <said>vanquished, disgraced;—driven
	      <lb/>to our tents by the undisciplined militia of a rebel army.</said></p>
          <p>He turned his face from her, as he finished speaking,
	    <lb/>and covered it with his hands, to conceal the sense of
	    <lb/>degradation which appeared on every feature, and which,
	    <lb/>as he truely said, was more painful to his lofty spirit,
	    <lb/>than all the bodily anguish caused by his wounds.</p>
          <p>A deep groan from <persName>General Frazer</persName> drew the baroness
	    <lb/>again to his bedside, and when the Major next looked
	    <lb/>up, he saw the delicate figure and lovely countenance
	    <lb/>of <persName>Lady Harriet Ackland</persName>, bending over him with a look
	    <lb/>of sorrow and anxiety. The pity which appeared in
	    <lb/>her eyes was not more sincere than that, which the
	    <lb/>sight of her instantly awakened in <persName>Major Courtland's</persName>

	    <lb/>heart. He knew that her husband, who commanded
	    <lb/>the <name>Grenadiers</name>, was desperately wounded, though he
	    <lb/>was yet ignorant of his being a prisoner. But con­
	    <lb/>scious of the evil tidings which awaited this charming
	    <lb/>woman, whose heroic  tenderness had made her an ob­
	    <lb/>ject of respect and interest to the whole army, he felt
	    <lb/>for her the most lively compassion; and when her soft
	    <lb/>voice fell upon his ear, inquiring if she could do any
	    <lb/>thing to relieve his distress, he regarded her with a look
	    <lb/>so full of fatherly pity and affection, that she instantly
	    <lb/>became alarmed, and exclaimed in a voice of terror,</p>
          <p><said>Oh, I am sure by that look you must know some­
	      <lb/>thing of my husband. I entrreat you, <persName>Major Courtland</persName>,
	      <lb/>to tell me if he is yet alive, that I may go to him; if
	      <lb/>not</said>――</p>
          <p>She suddenly stopped as if overwhelmed by the an­
	    <lb/>guish of so dreadful an idea, and covered her face with
	    <lb/>her hands, while the tears, which she sought to conceal,
	    <lb/>trickled fast through her slender fingers.</p>
          <p><said>Comfort yourself, <persName>Lady Harriet</persName>,</said> said <persName>Major Court­
	      <lb/>land</persName>, deeply touched by her distress; <said>your husband
	      <lb/>is alive, but situated as we were in different parts of
	      <lb/>the army, I can give you no certain information respect­
	      <lb/>ing him. But is it not probable, if he were very badly
	      <lb/>wounded, that he would have been brought here, before
	      <lb/>this?</said></p>
          <p><said>Yes, I think—I hope he would,</said> she said in a doubt­
	    <lb/>ing accent. The question, however, seemed in some
	    <lb/>degree to compose her, and she added in a tone of
	    <lb/>humble and sweet resignation,</p>
          <p>
            <said>I am ungrateful to distrust the goodness of God,
	      <lb/>who has preserved him through so many dangers, and
	      <lb/>so often returned him from the midst of perils, in safety
	      <lb/>to my arms.</said>
          </p>
          <p>The surgeon at this moment approached to dress
	    <lb/>the Major's wounds, and <persName>Lady Harriet</persName> retired while he
	    <lb/>performed the duties of his office. She withdrew to the
	    <lb/>extremity of the small apartment, for there was no other
	    <lb/>spot more remote, where these delicate and high-bred
	    <lb/>females could retire, for privacy and refreshment. The

	    <lb/>servants had arranged some temporary curtains to screen
	    <lb/>them a little from observation, and there <persName>Lady Harriet
	      <lb/>Ackland</persName>, the <persName>Baroness Reidesel</persName>, and several other
	    <lb/>ladies, wrapt in bitter meditations, which the scenes they
	    <lb/>had witnessed were too fruitful in suggesting, passed the
	    <lb/>long and melancholy hours of this dreadful night.</p>
          <p><persName>Major Courtland</persName> had received several wounds, but
	    <lb/>only one which bore an unfavourable appearance. This
	    <lb/>was in the breast, and from the strictness of the sur­
	    <lb/>geon's injunctions, an apprehension of considerable dan­
	    <lb/>ger was inferred, not only by the attendants, but by the
	    <lb/>Major himself. When the ball was extracted, and the
	    <lb/>operation of dressing over, he was removed to another
	    <lb/>apartment of the small house, which formed the centre
	    <lb/>of the hospital, and was already filled with wounded
	    <lb/>officers.</p>
          <p>Among the rest was <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, whose excess­
	    <lb/>ive fatigue, together with a powerful anodyne, had con­
	    <lb/>spired to throw him into a profound sleep, which he
	    <lb/>enjoyed undisturbed, through the whole night, in spite
	    <lb/>of his wounds, and of the noise which was necessarily
	    <lb/>produced in the house by the continual passing and
	    <lb/>repassing of the surgeons and attendants. <persName>Major Court­
	      <lb/>land</persName> was not so easily lulled to rest; the anguish of
	    <lb/>his wound, the mortification of defeat, and the desperate
	    <lb/>state of the army, produced a train of sad reflections,
	    <lb/>which kept him waking nearly all night. The next
	    <lb/>day was one of feverish agitation; his wound was ex­
	    <lb/>ceedingly inflamed, and the worst fears of the faithful
	    <lb/><persName>Hugh</persName>, who kept a vigilant station beside his master, were
	    <lb/>awakened. Towards evening, however, <persName>Major Court­
	      <lb/>land</persName> greatly revived, and made many inquiries respect­
	    <lb/>ing the movements in the camp, the death of <persName>General
	    <lb/>Frazer</persName>, and the situation of the ladies. <persName>Hugh</persName>, delight­
	    <lb/>ed to hear again the sound of his master's voice, entered
	    <lb/>into a minute detail of all he knew, and was in the
	    <lb/>midst of his narration, when an attendant entered with
	    <lb/>a request from <persName>Lady Harriet Ackland</persName>, that she might
	    <lb/>be permitted to speak with <persName>Major Courtland</persName>.</p>
          <pb n="88"/>
          <milestone unit="sig" n="8(2)v"/>
          <mw type="pageNum">88</mw>
          <p>She was instantly admitted, and <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, as
	    <lb/>he answered her kind inquiries after his health, remark­
	    <lb/>ed with concern the paleness of her interesting counte­
	    <lb/>nance, and the agitation of her voice and manner.
	    <lb/>When these inquiries were ended, she said abruptly,</p>
          <p>
            <said><persName>Major Courtland</persName>, as the friend of my absent hus­
	      <lb/>band, I come to consult you on a step which I design
	      <lb/>to take. <persName>Major Ackland</persName> is wounded and a prisoner, and
	      <lb/>I wish to go to him, if <persName>General Burgoyne</persName> will grant me
	      <lb/>permission.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>Go to him!</said> repeated <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, gazing
	    <lb/>with surprise on the soft and gentle creature, who had
	    <lb/>dared to adopt so bold a resolution. <said><persName>Lady Harriet</persName>,
	      <lb/>you know not what you propose; your husband, if a
	      <lb/>prisoner, is probably in the very heart of the enemy's
	      <lb/>camp, and would you go to him there?</said></p>
          <p><said>Would I?</said> she replied with emotion; <said>I would
	      <lb/>go to him in the very heart of the most savage wilder­
	      <lb/>ness, though I knew it to be inhabited by wild beasts,
	      <lb/>and <name>Indians</name> wilder and fiercer even than the monsters
	      <lb/>of the desert, so I could be with him and alleviate his
	      <lb/>distress.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Major Courtland</persName> gazed on her a moment in silent
	    <lb/>admiration, then, unable to suppress his feelings, ex­
	    <lb/>claimed,</p>
          <p>
            <said>How does the heroic constancy and fortitude of
	      <lb/>weak, dependant woman put to shame the lordly boast­
	      <lb/>ing of our proud and self-confident sex!</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>Woman will dare and endure every thing for the
	      <lb/>husband she loves,</said> returned <persName><choice><sic>l</sic><corr>L</corr></choice>ady Harriet</persName>, with a faint
	    <lb/>smile. <said>But I come to ask your opinion, <persName>Major Court­
		<lb/>land</persName>, of this step. You have lived long among the
	      <lb/><name>Americans</name>, and are familiar with their character and
	      <lb/>habits. To us they have been represented as savage,
	      <lb/>brutal, and unfeeling. Even if they are such, I must
	      <lb/>venture among them; but, for his sake and my own, I
	      <lb/>would gladly hear of them a different character.</said></p>
          <p><said>I can assure your ladyship,</said> returned <persName>Major Court­
	      <lb/>land</persName>, <said>that you have nothing to fear from the incivility
	      <lb/>or inhumanity of the <name>Americans</name>. I know them well,
	      <pb n="89"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="8(3)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">89</mw>
	      <lb/>and greatly as I deprecate their unnatural rebellion, I
	      <lb/>cannot in justice withhold from them the character
	      <lb/>they deserve. They are brave, honorable, and gene­
	      <lb/>rous; and I doubt not will do all in their power to ren­
	      <lb/>der your situation one of ease and comfort.</said></p>
          <p><said>God bless you for this comforting assurance,</said> she
	    <lb/>replied; <said>and with <persName>General Burgoyne's</persName> permission, I
	      <lb/>will instantly depart. Farewell, <persName>Major Courtland</persName>; I
	      <lb/>should go with a lighter heart, were I not compelled to
	      <lb/>leave so many of the brave defenders of my country
	      <lb/>stretched on beds of pain. But may God restore you
	      <lb/>all, and grant that we may soon meet under happier
	      <lb/>auspices.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Major Courtland</persName> sighed, as he affectionately pressed
	    <lb/>her hand, and after a brief pause replied,</p>
          <p>
            <said>Farewell, madam, may the blessing of heaven rest
	      <lb/>upon you, and guide you in safety to your husband.
	      <lb/>Bear him my best wishes, and may your future union
	      <lb/>be as lasting, as it has been virtuous and happy.</said>
          </p>
          <p>She gently withdrew her hand, and, with a heart too
	    <lb/>full for utterance, glided silently away, while <persName>Major
	    <lb/>Courtland</persName>, with a feeling like parental tenderness, watch­
	    <lb/>ed her retreating form till the closing door shut it from
	    <lb/>his view. Her beauty and heroic tenderness recalled
	    <lb/>to his mind the image of his own lovely girl, and the
	    <lb/>soothing remembrances which her idea awakened, shed
	    <lb/>a placid calmness, unfelt for many hours, over his har­
	    <lb/>assed and agitated spirits. Dwelling with a father's
	    <lb/>fondness on the endearments of the past, he sunk
	    <lb/>gradually into a gentle slumber, which continued un­
	    <lb/>broken for an hour or two, when he was awakened by
	    <lb/>voices from below and sounds of confusion from all
	    <lb/>parts of the house.</p>
          <p>He looked around him with surprise; two officers
	    <lb/>who had occupied the same apartment though not dan­
	    <lb/>gerously wounded, were dressing themselves with the
	    <lb/>assistance of their servants, whose looks expressed
	    <lb/>haste and anxiety. <persName>Hugh</persName> with a surgeon was standing
	    <lb/>by the bedside of <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, who, half raised
	    <lb/>upon his elbow, was listening with an air of impatience
	    <mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(+3)">8*</mw>
	    <pb n="90"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="8(3)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">90</mw>
	    <lb/>to the earnest words of the latter, which seemed by
	    <lb/>their emphasis to be those of entreaty and persuasion.
	    <lb/>Hearing his master move, the watchful <persName>Hugh</persName> went di­
	    <lb/>rectly to his bedside.</p>
          <p><said>Are the enemy upon us,</said> asked <persName>Major Courtland</persName>,
	    <lb/><said>or what occasions the disturbance which I see and
	      <lb/>hear around me?</said></p>
          <p><said>They are not upon us yet, please your Honor,</said><lb/>answered <persName>Hugh</persName>, <said>but we hear they are coming, and
	      <lb/>the General has ordered a retreat. But these <name>Ameri­
		<lb/>cans</name>, sir, never do things by halves, and I think, go as
	      <lb/>far as we will, we shall hardly escape them.</said></p>
          <p><said>A retreat!</said> ejaculated <persName>Major Courtland</persName>. <said>Good
	      <lb/>heaven! what torrents of blood must flow before the
	      <lb/>shame of this campaign can be washed away. And
	      <lb/>why,</said> he added, glancing towards <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, who was
	    <lb/>still in earnest conversation with the surgeon, <said>why is
	      <lb/>not <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> preparing to follow with the
	      <lb/>rest?</said></p>
          <p><said>The surgeon is urging him to do so,</said> returned
	    <lb/><persName>Hugh</persName>, <said>but he says, though his life were at stake, he
	      <lb/>would not leave your Honor to fall alone into the power
	      <lb/>of the enemy.</said></p>
          <p><said>Generous young man!</said> exclaimed the Major,
	    <lb/>touched by this affecting proof of the warm-hearted
	    <lb/><persName>O'Carroll's</persName> attachment. <said>But go to him, <persName>Hugh</persName>; tell
	      <lb/>him from me, to fly; say to him, I am sure of kind
	      <lb/>treatment from the <name>Americans</name>, and that it matters little
	      <lb/>whether I draw my last breath among them, or in the
	      <lb/>midst of my vanquished countrymen.</said></p>
          <p><said>Ah, sir, you will not die,</said> exclaimed <persName>Hugh</persName>, alarm­
	    <lb/>ed by this suggestion; <said>indeed, sir, I cannot speak to
	      <lb/>the young Captain of such a thing, and I entreat your
	      <lb/>Honor not to send me with the message.</said></p>
          <p><said>Well, at least, tell <persName>Dr. Rennie</persName> I wish to speak with
	      <lb/>him,</said> said <persName>Major Courtland</persName>. <persName>Hugh</persName> obeyed, and the
	    <lb/>surgeon immediately followed him to the bedside of
	    <lb/>the Major.</p>
          <p>
            <said>Cannot you prevail on <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, Doctor, to follow
	      <lb/>the retreat of the troops!</said>
          </p>
          <pb n="91"/>
          <milestone unit="sig" n="8(4)r"/>
          <mw type="pageNum">91</mw>
          <p><said>No, he persists in remaining, though I have assur­
	      <lb/>ed him he may be removed without danger,</said> answered
	    <lb/>the surgeon. <said>But he declares, if <persName>Major Courtland</persName>
	      <lb/>must be left, he will not desert him, and as I candidly
	      <lb/>tell him, the fatigue of a removal, in your present situa­
	      <lb/>tion, would probably cost you your life, he resolutely
	      <lb/>resists every entreaty to quit the hospital.</said></p>
          <p><said>I cannot but be deeply gratified by this proof of
	      <lb/><persName>Captain O'Carroll's</persName> attachment,</said> said <persName>Major Courtland</persName>;
	    <lb/><said>but I value his friendship too highly to accept this
	      <lb/>sacrifice of his personal safety. I am attended by my
	      <lb/>faithful servant, and I have no doubt of meeting many
	      <lb/>friends in the American army. Oblige me then, <persName>Dr.
	      <lb/>Rennie</persName>, by informing him it is my earnest request that
	      <lb/>he will prepare, without longer delay, for his departure.
	      <lb/>The army will soon commence its march, and when
	      <lb/>too late, we shall both regret his unnecessary capture.</said></p>
          <p><said>I will renew my entreaties, though I fear they will
	      <lb/>prove unavailing,</said> replied the surgeon; and he again
	    <lb/>returned to the Captain, who occupied a mattress in the
	    <lb/>most remote corner of the apartment.</p>
          <p>At that instant <persName>Colonel Percy</persName> entered, and said
	    <lb/>quickly to <persName>O'Carroll's</persName> servant, <said>Haste, haste, <persName>Ronald</persName>;
	      <lb/>assist your master to rise; you have not a moment to
	      <lb/>lose, if you would be off with the troops.</said> He passed
	    <lb/>on, without waiting for an answer, to the bedside of
	    <lb/><persName>Major Courtland</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>We are under marching orders, Major,</said> said the
	    <lb/>Colonel, as he returned the pressure of his friend's
	    <lb/>hand. <said>The enemy are bearing down upon our right,
	      <lb/>and the General has judged it expedient to order an
	      <lb/>immediate retreat. Our hospital must of course be
	      <lb/>abandoned; but many of the wounded officers have
	      <lb/>prepared to join us in such conveyences as could be
	      <lb/>procured. I come to hasten you, for you must not
	      <lb/>be left. A cart, in which some clean straw has been
	      <lb/>placed is already occupied by three wounded officers,
	      <lb/>but there is yet sufficient room for yourself and <persName>Captain
		<lb/>O'Carroll</persName>. So let me beg of you to rise, for really
	      <lb/>there is no time to be lost.</said></p>

          <p><said>My surgeon tells me a removal would probably
	      <lb/>prove fatal to me,</said> returned the Major, calmly; <said>and
	      <lb/>though it would be only hastening a period which may,
	      <lb/>perhaps, soon arrive, I doubt, <persName>Colonel Percy</persName>, if I have
	      <lb/>a right to do any thing, which may, in the least, precipi­
	      <lb/>tate that event.</said></p>
          <p><said>Indeed, <persName>Major Courtland</persName>,</said> said the Colonel, look­
	    <lb/>ing at him with surprise, <said>I think you yield too quick­
	      <lb/>ly to despondency; our unfortunate situation has de­
	      <lb/>pressed your spirits, and induced you to dwell on
	      <lb/>gloomy and improbable events. It is not two hours
	      <lb/>since your surgeon informed me he considered you in
	      <lb/>a way to do well.</said></p>
          <p><said>My own feelings are a surer index to truth, than
	      <lb/>even the auguries of my surgeon,</said> returned the Major.
	    <lb/><said>But, setting aside the danger which a removal might
	      <lb/>occasion, I am an old soldier, <persName>Colonel Percy</persName>, who
	      <lb/>never yet turned my back upon the enemy, and I care
	      <lb/>not now to have it said that I fled from an army of
	      <lb/>rebels, powerful and victorious though they are. Let
	      <lb/>them come, we are vanquished by Heaven, rather than
	      <lb/>by them.</said></p>
          <p>
            <said>You disapprove our retreat then, said the Colonel,
	      <lb/><said>and regard it as an act of cowardice and fear!</said></said>
          </p>
          <p><said>I am far from pronouncing so severe a judgment,</said><lb/>said <persName>Major Courtland</persName>; <said>your situation is peculiar and
	      <lb/>desperate; and though an individual may yield his life,
	      <lb/>rather than his honor, a General is bound to consult the
	      <lb/>safety of his troops, even at the expense of private
	      <lb/>happiness and public fame.</said></p>
          <p><said>No censure, I think, can be attached to <persName>General
	      <lb/>Burgoyne</persName>,</said> returned <persName>Colonel Percy</persName>; <said>he has undoubt­
	      <lb/>edly been shackled by the commands of the ministry,
	      <lb/>who laid down a plan of the campaign, without any
	      <lb/>knowledge of the country where it was to be executed.
	      <lb/>Consequently we are reduced to this sad and mortify­
	      <lb/>ing dilemma. But I must leave you, since you com­
	      <lb/>pel me to do so; time presses, and I can delay no lon­
	      <lb/>ger.</said></p>

          <p><said>Go first to <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, and impose upon
	      <lb/>him your commands, as a superior officer, to follow the
	      <lb/>retreat,</said> said <persName>Major Courtland</persName>.</p>
          <p><persName>Colonel Percy</persName> did as he was desired, and the Cap­
	    <lb/>tain seeing him approach, raised himself to receive him.</p>
          <p><said>I entreat you to hasten,</said> said the Colonel; <said>the
	      <lb/>army will move in less than an hour, and you are
	      <lb/>aware that we can wait for no one.</said></p>
          <p><said>Are there positive orders issued,</said> asked <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,
	    <lb/><said>for all those officers to follow the army, who are able
	      <lb/>to do so?</said></p>
          <p><said>Orders to that effect are deemed superfluous,</said> said
	    <lb/>the Colonel, <said>as it is presumed all who are able will
	      <lb/>voluntarily accompany us.</said></p>
          <p><said>Does <persName>Major Courtland</persName> go?</said> inquired <persName>O'Carroll</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>He cannot be moved without endangering his life,</said><lb/>said the Colonel; <said>and though you appear reluctant
	      <lb/>to depart, <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, I cannot consent to your
	      <lb/>remaining, provide you are well enough to endure the
	      <lb/>fatigue of the night march. So do not oblige me to
	      <lb/>exert the authority of a superior officer, but call your
	      <lb/>servant to assist you, and rise immediately.</said></p>
          <p><said>Do not impose your commands upon me, sir,</said><lb/>said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, <said>for I would not have disrespect to my
	      <lb/>Colonel, added to the long list of disgraces, which we
	      <lb/>shall all carry to <placeName>England</placeName> as trophies of our American
	      <lb/>campaign; and I really think in this instance the obli­
	      <lb/>gations of friendship and humanity are more powerful,
	      <lb/>even than those of military duty.</said></p>
          <p><said>Then you will not go!</said> asked <persName>Colonel Percy</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>Why should I, sir!</said> returned <persName>O'Carroll</persName>. <said>Indepen­
	      <lb/>dently of the pain, which a removal would occasion me,
	      <lb/>my wounds must, for some time, render me a useless
	      <lb/>and troublesome appendage to the army. Here, per­
	      <lb/>haps, I may be able to alleviate the sufferings, and
	      <lb/>cheer the solitude of <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, who, since he
	      <lb/>must remain, it would be absolute barbarity to desert.</said></p>
          <p><said>But you do not leave him alone,</said> returned the
	    <lb/>Colonel; <said>there are several officers, who will also be
	      <lb/>compelled to remain.</said></p>

          <p><said>But there are none, beside myself, with whom he
	      <lb/>is at all intimate.</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>You are aware, however, if you remain,</said> said the
	    <lb/>Colonel, <said>that you must be made a prisoner, and of
	      <lb/>course lose the privilege of again serving in <placeName>America</placeName>.</said></p>
          <p><said>I may be exchanged, perhaps, when I am well
	      <lb/>enough for active service.</said> returned <persName>O'Carroll</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>True,</said> replied the Colonel; <said>and since you are
	      <lb/>absolutely incorrigible, I must even permit you to be­
	      <lb/>come the victim of your own generosity. Our situa­
	      <lb/>tion is so precarious, that we cannot look forward a
	      <lb/>single hour with any certainty. But our prospects may
	      <lb/>yet brighten, and at all events a soldier should never
	      <lb/>despond, <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>. Let the worst come that
	      <lb/>will, we have still the consoling consciousness of having
	      <lb/>performed our duty to the utmost extent of our ability.
	      <lb/>And now farewell; keep up your spirits, my dear fel­
	      <lb/>low, and hope for the best.</said></p>
          <p><said>I hope at least,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, affecting an air of
	    <lb/>gaiety, <said>the next time we fight these pale-face rebels,
	      <lb/>we shall teach them to kneel for pardon to the majesty
	      <lb/>they have insulted. And so God bless you, <persName>Colonel
	      <lb/>Percy</persName>, and send you many and brighter days.</said></p>
          <p>He wrung the Colonel's hand, as he spoke, who im­
	    <lb/>mediately left him, to take a hasty farewell of <persName>Major
	    <lb/>Courtland</persName>, and then without delay rejoined the troops.</p>
          <p>Within an hour the whole army were on their march.
	    <lb/>Fires were kindled and many tents left standing to de­
	    <lb/>ceive the enemy; but, otherwise, the late noisy and
	    <lb/>tumultuous camp was desolate and deserted, except
	    <lb/>where the tents of the hospital, emitting feeble gleams
	    <lb/>of light, betrayed the residence of the sick and woun­
	    <lb/>ed, who were left by their retreating comrades, to the
	    <lb/>mercy of the conquerors. The night was dark and
	    <lb/>tempestuous; the wind howled in tremendous gusts
	    <lb/>around the walls of the dwelling, which sheltered <persName>Major
	    <lb/>Courtland</persName> and his companions; and the rain poured in
	    <lb/>torrents against the narrow windows; while the swollen
	    <lb/>waves of the <placeName>Hudson</placeName> joined their hoarse and sullen
	    <lb/>murmurs to the discord of the elements, deepening the
	    <pb n="95"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="8(6)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">95</mw>
	    <lb/>gloomy horror of the night, and adding more terrific
	    <lb/>images to the anticipations of the wounded soldiers.</p>
          <p>When the noise of the retreat had at length died
	    <lb/>away, and the house became comparatively still, <persName>Cap­
	    <lb/>tain O'Carroll</persName> was removed so near to <persName>Major Courtland</persName>
	    <lb/>that he could converse with him, without effort.</p>
          <p><said>You have done wrong, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,</said> said the Major,
	    <lb/>aroused by the appearance of his friend beside him,
	    <lb/>from the torpor into which he was sinking. <said>You
	      <lb/>should have followed the troops; they need brave and
	      <lb/>able officers, and you will be greatly missed in their
	      <lb/>extremity.</said></p>
          <p><said>In my present condition,</said> returned the Captain,
	    <lb/><said>I should be a burthen, a mere dead weight to incum­
	      <lb/>ber their march, and not half so much worth the trouble
	      <lb/>of transportation, as a haversack well filled with provi­
	      <lb/>sions. Besides, Major, did you ever know an <name>Irishman</name>
	      <lb/>safely stowed in warm quarters, who was willing to ex­
	      <lb/>change them for foul skies and a frosty atmostphere?</said></p>
          <p><said>You cannot hope to conceal your real motives
	      <lb/>from me by this badinage,</said> returned the Major; <said>I
	      <lb/>know them well, and while I admire your generosity,
	      <lb/>and feel deeply gratified by the attachment which they
	      <lb/>evince for my person, I cannot but regret that you
	      <lb/>have yielded to them, at the expense of your own
	      <lb/>safety, and because the service is, for a time at least,
	      <lb/>deprived of a valuable and useful officer.</said></p>
          <p><said xml:id="q1">There are subalterns enough, longing to jump into
	      <lb/>my place;</said> said the Captain, <said xml:id="q2">and where so many
	      <lb/>brave are left, one disabled officer will scarcely be
	      <lb/>missed. I shall not complain, Major,</said> he said gaily,
	    <lb/><said xml:id="q3">to find my place well occupied; and shall not be
	      <lb/>disagreeably surprised, if my superior officer says to
	      <lb/>me, <said rend="post()">You will be pleased to accept the commission
		<lb/>of a Colonel or a Major</said> (I will not refuse either), <said rend="pre()">as a
		<lb/>mark of your sovereign's favor.</said></said></p>
          <p><persName>Major Courtland</persName> could not avoid smiling at the cha­
	    <lb/>racteristic gaiety of his friend, which no combination of
	    <lb/>events could long depress, but instantly resuming a
	    <lb/>grave air, he said,</p>
          <pb n="96"/>
          <milestone unit="sig" n="8(6)v"/>
          <mw type="pageNum">96</mw>
          <p>
            <said>None of us need hope for promotion after this cam­
	      <lb/>paign, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; censure and disgrace will doubtless
	      <lb/>follow us, and those who are even permitted to retain
	      <lb/>the commissions they now hold, may esteem themselves
	      <lb/>fortunate. For me it matters little; though my sun
	      <lb/>should set in clouds, it may not dawn less brightly on
	      <lb/>the morning of eternity.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>Do not cherish thoughts so melancholy, Sir,</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>they serve only to deepen the gloom
	      <lb/>which already involves us. Your wounds are not des­
	      <lb/>perate, and <persName>Dr. Rennie's</persName> care, I trust, will soon effect
	      <lb/>a complete cure.</said></p>
          <p><said><persName>Dr. Rennie</persName>, I doubt not, will do all in his power to
	      <lb/>restore me,</said> said the Major, <said>and though I would not
	      <lb/>unnecessarily alarm you, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, neither would I
	      <lb/>have you unprepared for what <emph>may</emph> happen. I there­
	      <lb/>fore candidly tell you, that I feel myself growing weak­
	      <lb/>er, and I greatly fear my wound affects a vital part.</said></p>
          <p><said>Let me send directly for the Surgeon,</said> said <persName>O'Car­
	      <lb/>roll</persName>, in alarm; <said>in the haste of the moment he may
	      <lb/>have thought too lightly of it; indeed it is not a matter
	      <lb/>which ought to be delayed.</said></p>
          <p><said>No, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,</said> returned the Major, <said>he can do
	      <lb/>nothing more than he has done, and quiet and repose
	      <lb/>are all that I require. I have only one wish which
	      <lb/>gives me pain. You have heard me speak of my
	      <lb/>daughter, and, in the hour of sickness or misfortune, a
	      <lb/>father's heart yearns for the endearments of his child,
	      <lb/>and looks forward with melancholy apprehension to the
	      <lb/>moment, which may deprive her of his paternal care
	      <lb/>and tenderness.</said></p>
          <p><said>And why cannot she come to you?</said> asked <persName>O'Car­
	      <lb/>roll</persName>; <said>you have told me she was at <placeName>Albany</placeName>, and <persName>Gen­
		<lb/>eral Gates</persName> will not surely have the inhumanity to refuse
	      <lb/>a child the melancholy satisfaction of administering to
	      <lb/>the comfort of a wounded parent.</said></p>
          <p><said>This is no place, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, for a young and inex­
	      <lb/>perienced female,</said> said the Major. <said>In the midst of
	      <lb/>enemies; an object of curiosity to a thousand insolent
	      <lb/>eyes, and the subject of impertinent remark to the
	      <pb n="97"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="9(1)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">97</mw>
	      <lb/>whole camp. No, cruel as is the alternative, I will
	      <lb/>rather renounce the dear hope of again embracing my
	      <lb/>child, than expose her retiring delicacy to the wounds
	      <lb/>it might receive in a situation so new and embarrass­
	      <lb/>ing.</said></p>
          <p><said>Pardon me, Sir,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>I feel the force
	      <lb/>of your objections, and can only apologize for my
	      <lb/>thoughtless proposal, by the wish which prompted it;
	      <lb/>that of gratifying a father's affection, and contributing
	      <lb/>to his comfort.</said></p>
          <p><said>I know it well, my dear <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,</said> answered the
	    <lb/>Major; <said>you are ever zealous in the cause of friendship
	      <lb/>and humanity; but you have never yet experienced
	      <lb/>the thousand cares and anxieties of parental love; though,
	      <lb/>were there none but spirits as manly and generous as
	      <lb/>your own around us, my girl should come to her father's
	      <lb/>arms to-morrow.</said></p>
          <p><said>Thank you, from my soul, sir!</said> replied <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,
	    <lb/>a flush of grateful feeling brightening the glow of his
	    <lb/>ingenuous countenance; and perceiving that the Major
	    <lb/>was fatigued by the effort of conversing, he relapsed
	    <lb/>into silence, which was not broken during the remain­
	    <lb/>der of the night.</p>
          <p>But, with <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, the hours passed slowly
	    <lb/>and tediously away. He was anxious and alarmed
	    <lb/>about <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, whose uneasy slumbers indicat­
	    <lb/>ed increasing illness, and he was several times on the
	    <lb/>point of sending his servant for the surgeon, whom he
	    <lb/>wished extremely to consult concerning the real situa­
	    <lb/>tion of the Major. But reluctant to disturb his repose,
	    <lb/>or, should he still be in attendance, to summon him
	    <lb/>from those who required his assistance, he relinquished
	    <lb/>his design; and, overpowered by weariness at length
	    <lb/>sunk into a sleep, which continued undisturbed till
	    <lb/>morning.</p>

          <p>A gentle noise in the apartment chased away the
	    <lb/>dream which had transported <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, in
	    <lb/>imagination, to the green fields of his native island, and
	    <lb/>awoke him to all the sad consciousness of his unfortu­
	    <lb/>nate situation. A low whisper caught his ear, and,
	    <lb/>raising his head to learn from whom it proceeded, he
	    <lb/>saw an American officer in conversation with the surgeon.
	    <lb/>His tall, athletic figure was strikingly graceful and dig­
	    <lb/>nified, and though he seemed to have passed the early
	    <lb/>period of manhood, the fire of youth was tempered,
	    <lb/>without being extinguished, by maturity of thought and
	    <lb/>intellect. His finely formed features were full of spirit
	    <lb/>and intelligence, though the flashing light of his dark
	    <lb/>and piercing eyes, and the somewhat haughty curve of
	    <lb/>his upper lip, denoted a soul possessed of those elevat­
	    <lb/>ed and proudly virtuous feelings which, during the
	    <lb/>stormy period of our revolution, characterized those
	    <lb/>fearless defenders of liberty, who guided the national
	    <lb/>help, or went forth with our armies to combat for the
	    <lb/>rights and privileges of freemen.</p>
          <p><persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> gazed with admiration on the no­
	    <lb/>ble figure of the officer, while an indefinite feeling of
	    <lb/>recognition filled his mind, and he continued to revolve,
	    <lb/>in silence, where and when he had met the individual,
	    <lb/>whose person seemed so familiar to him. He was
	    <lb/>watching, with interest, every gesture, and every varia­
	    <lb/>tion of the countenance which could tend to dispel his
	    <lb/>uncertainty, when a light step was heard at the door,
	    <lb/>and immediately the dark face of an <name>Indian</name> was thrust
	    <pb n="99"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="9(2)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">99</mw>
	    <lb/>into the apartment, with a gaze of anxious curiosity.
	    <lb/>The officer hastily motioned to him to retire, but his
	    <lb/>appearance had brightened the memory of <persName>Captain
	      <lb/>O'Carroll</persName>, and, by reminding him of the forage, and the
	    <lb/>narrative of <persName>Colonel Percy</persName>, identified, at once, the per­
	    <lb/>son of the unknown, who, he now recollected, had been
	    <lb/>pointed out to him by the Colonel, during the engage­
	    <lb/>ment of the <date when="1777-10-07">seventh</date>. In the moment of sudden con­
	    <lb/>viction he involuntarily expressed himself in an audible
	    <lb/>tone, and by pronouncing the officer's name, immedi­
	    <lb/>ately attracted his attention.</p>
          <p>He turned quickly round, and, without noticing the
	    <lb/>Captain's confusion, advanced towards him.</p>
          <p><said>I think I heard you pronounce my name, sir,</said> he
	    <lb/>said, bowing low and gracefully, as he spoke; <said>and,
	      <lb/>though ignorant of the manner in which it has become
	      <lb/>known to you, I esteem it a fortunate circumstance to
	      <lb/>be spared the embarrassment of a formal introduction.</said></p>
          <p><said>There are many ways of identifying the person
	      <lb/>of a brave enemy, <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>;</said> replied <persName>O'Car­
	      <lb/>roll</persName>, with all the gallantry of his national character.</p>
          <p><said>There are, indeed,</said> returned the officer, <said>and it is
	      <lb/>long since that of <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> became known to
	      <lb/>me, and many others, among whom his intrepid gallan­
	      <lb/>try is a theme of discourse and admiration.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> bent his head in token of reply,
	    <lb/>feeling for once, at least, he was outdone in the way of
	    <lb/>compliment. Entreating <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> to be seat­
	    <lb/>ed, he said with his characteristic frankness,</p>
          <p>
            <said>But even the united bravery and skill of more in­
	      <lb/>trepid men than I can claim to be, have availed us little
	      <lb/>in this battle; here we lie at your mercy, while those
	      <lb/>who could, have thought best to retire from the raking
	      <lb/>fire which you so unmercifully pour down upon us;
	      <lb/>not even allowing us to dine without rolling your can­
	      <lb/>non balls across the table, and spicing our viands with
	      <lb/>abundance of your grape and rifle shot.</said>
          </p>
          <p><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> looked with surprise upon the
	    <lb/>man, who could trifle on such a subject, and in a situa­
	    <lb/>tion so humiliating. But the fine manly countenance
	    <pb n="100"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="9(2)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">100</mw>
	    <lb/>of <persName>O'Carroll</persName> quickly banished this momentary con­
	    <lb/>tempt, and enable<choice><sic/><corr>d</corr></choice> him to penetrate, at once, through
	    <lb/>the air of reckless gaiety, which was thrown over a
	    <lb/>heart of exquisite sensibility.</p>
          <p><said>You have indeed been unfortunate,</said> he said, after
	    <lb/>a brief pause, <said>but even your enemies speak with ad­
	      <lb/>miration of your intrepid valor, and feel their own claim
	      <lb/>to merit more honorable and elevated, in having suc­
	      <lb/>cessfully resisted troops, who fought with such undaunt­
	      <lb/>ed bravery.</said></p>
          <p><said>We owe you thanks, sir, for granting us even this
	      <lb/>qualified praise,</said> returned <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>though it is
	      <lb/>rather humiliating, I confess, to be made the under­
	      <lb/>pinning, as it were, of that column, which I perceive
	      <lb/>you are already rearing to your own fame upon the
	      <lb/>ruin of ours.</said></p>
          <p><said>The column which we are rearing, sir,</said> said <persName>Colo­
	    <lb/>nel Grahame</persName>, <said>will require no foreign aid to support it.
	      <lb/>We pant not after the empty applause of the world,
	      <lb/>and we care for victory only as it brings us nearer to
	      <lb/>the end of our warfare, and puts us in possession of
	      <lb/>those rights, which are essential to our very existence,
	      <lb/>as a free and virtuous people. But I did not seek you,
	      <lb/>sir, to discuss political dissensions. I am deputed by
	      <lb/><persName>General Gates</persName>, to inquire into the state of the hospital,
	      <lb/>and to make such arrangements as may tend to amelio­
	      <lb/>rate the condition of those, whom the fortunes of war
	      <lb/>have thrown into his hands. Your accomodations
	      <lb/>here,</said> he continued, glancing round the desolate walls
	    <lb/>of the apartment, <said>are far from good, and if you will
	      <lb/>consent to a removal, I can promise you far better in
	      <lb/>our hospital at <placeName>Albany</placeName>.</said></p>
          <p><said>We are greatly indebted to the American General,
	      <lb/>and also to you, sir, for your humane attention,</said> re­
	    <lb/>turned <persName>O'Carroll</persName>. <said>There are many, I doubt not,
	      <lb/>who will gladly accept your offer, but, for myself, I
	      <lb/>must beg your permission to remain here for the pre­
	      <lb/>sent. I cannot desert my friend, who occupies the bed
	      <lb/>on your left, and he is too ill to bear a removal, or we
	      <lb/>should both of us, I assure you, sir, have taken up our

	      <lb/>line of march last night, and not have been left in this
	      <lb/>crazy trap, waiting for the sportsman to cut our meshes,
	      <lb/>and set us free when it pleased him.</said></p>
          <p><said>Speak only for yourself, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>!</said> exclaimed
	    <lb/><persName>Major Courtland</persName>, who had listened in silence to this
	    <lb/>conversation, and who, unaccountably averse to the
	    <lb/>idea of running from the conquerors, could not hear
	    <lb/>this assertion of the Captain's, without denying his
	    <lb/>own wish for escape. <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> turned quick­
	    <lb/>ly round at the unexpected sound of the Major's voice,
	    <lb/>and rising from his seat, remained gazing on his pale
	    <lb/>countenance, while <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, without noticing
	    <lb/>his gesture, continued speaking, with as much vehe­
	    <lb/>mence as his enfeebled state would permit.</p>
          <p><said>Yes, sir,</said> he said, <said>that brave and generous young
	      <lb/>man became a voluntary prisoner for my sake; that he
	      <lb/>might soften the rigors of my confinement, and render
	      <lb/>it more endurable by the presence of a friend. I do
	      <lb/>not intend, sir, to censure the conduct of <persName>General Bur­
		<lb/>goyne</persName>, though he consulted the safety of his troops
	      <lb/>rather than their honor; but <emph>I</emph> should have said, <said>The
		<lb/>judgments of Heaven have placed us in this situation,
		<lb/>and death or victory must set us free.</said> I should, per­
	      <lb/>haps, have said and acted wrong; but in my youth, I
	      <lb/>never turned from the face of an enemy, and it ill be­
	      <lb/>comes an old soldier, who has so long fought for his
	      <lb/>king, to flee from an army of rebels.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, crimsoned with indignation, and
	    <lb/>sternly bending his haughty eyes upon <persName>Major Cour­
	      <lb/>land</persName>, was about to reply and with some severity, when
	    <lb/>the Major, regretting the haste with which he had spoken,
	    <lb/>said quickly,</p>
          <p>
            <said>Pardon me, young man! I would not willingly
	      <lb/>wound the feelings of one, whom all regard, and to
	      <lb/>whom, if I mistake not, I am indebted for a life, twice
	      <lb/>preserved from the uplifted hatchet of a barbarous
	      <lb/>savage. Accept my thanks, and may Heaven reward
	      <lb/>you for your humanity to a fallen foe. Forgive also
	      <lb/>the warmth with which I just now expressed myself,
	      <lb/>and believe me, it was your cause, and not an indi­

	      <lb/>vidual, or even a particular body of men, whom I ven­
	      <lb/>tured to stigmatize.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>To speak contemptuously of our cause,</said> returned
	    <lb/><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, with an air of calm dignity, <said>touches
	      <lb/>me as nearly as an insult offered to my own person.
	      <lb/>But, sir, I freely pardon the warmth of your manners,
	      <lb/>and the obnoxious epithet, which, in common with your
	      <lb/>countrymen, you have seen fit to apply to men, who
	      <lb/>were driven by injustice and oppression to open resis­
	      <lb/>tance; and I will believe, that, like them, you are in­
	      <lb/>fluenced against us by the representations of a party, and
	      <lb/>consequently can be but imperfectly acquainted with
	      <lb/>the motives of our conduct, and the importance of our
	      <lb/>cause. Let us henceforth, sir, drop this subject; it is
	      <lb/>one upon which we must continue at variance, and it is
	      <lb/>sufficient that we contend for our opinions in the field,
	      <lb/>without carrying discord and contention into the scenes
	      <lb/>of private and domestic life.</said></p>
          <p><said>I greatly admire your moderation, sir,</said> said <persName>Major
	    <lb/>Courtland</persName>; <said>and, though much your senior in years and
	      <lb/>in experience, I confess myself not at all ashamed to take
	      <lb/>from it a lesson of instruction. We are thrown into
	      <lb/>your power by circumstances, and though the event is
	      <lb/>wounding to our feelings, as soldiers, and faithful sub­
	      <lb/>jects of a king whom we revere, it becomes us to bear
	      <lb/>it like men, who can endure shame and despise suffer­
	      <lb/>ing for a good cause.</said></p>
          <p><said>And it shall be our study, sir,</said> replied <persName>Colonel
	    <lb/>Grahame</persName>, <said>to relieve the unpleasantness of your situa­
	      <lb/>tion, by rendering the courtesies and attentions, which
	      <lb/>it is the wish of the American officers to pay to those
	      <lb/>brave enemies, whom the fortunes of war may have
	      <lb/>consigned to their care, and from whom, in similar cir­
	      <lb/>cumstances, they would doubtless experience the same
	      <lb/>kindness and humanity.</said></p>
          <p><said>Certainly, sir</said> returned <persName>Major Courtland</persName>; <said>I be­
	      <lb/>lieve the British nation has never yet been found defi­
	      <lb/>cient in courtesy or humanity, to any who may have
	      <lb/>fallen within her power.</said></p>

          <mw type="pageNum">103</mw>
          <p><said>If it had, sir,</said> replied <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, <said>we
	      <lb/>should not so freely, and though now at variance, I may
	      <lb/>add, with so much pride, boast of our descent from the
	      <lb/>land of our fathers. The unforeseen events of yester­
	      <lb/>day have thrown you, sir, and many of your country­
	      <lb/>men, into close connexion with us, and I trust the con­
	      <lb/>tact will have the favourable effect of softening if not of
	      <lb/>obliterating your prejudices, and producing a more just
	      <lb/>and impartial estimate of our character and conduct.
	      <lb/>Let us at least forget, awhile, that we are enemies, and
	      <lb/>as we pledge each other from the same cup, remember
	      <lb/>only that we are branches from the same trunk, that
	      <lb/>we revere the same principles of justice and humanity,
	      <lb/>and worship the same God of mercy and benevolence.</said></p>
          <p><said>That, sir, is all I wish to recollect,</said> returned <persName>Major
	    <lb/>Courtland</persName>; <said>though thoughts more bitter will often­
	      <lb/>times intrude. But I assure you, the sense of our mis­
	      <lb/>fortunes is alleviated by the knowledge we have obtain­
	      <lb/>ed of our foes; who, though we still censure their
	      <lb/>cause, are, if we may be allowed to judge from the
	      <lb/>bearing of their deputy, brave without arrogance, and,
	      <lb/>in the midst of victory, incapable of a wish to triumph
	      <lb/>over the fallen, or to remind them by a single look of
	      <lb/>the degradation which they feel with so much bitter­
	      <lb/>ness.</said></p>
          <p><said>Time, I trust, will convince you, that your judgment
	      <lb/>is not premature,</said> said <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>. <said>The pri­
	      <lb/>vate virtues of <persName>General Gates</persName> add lustre to the valor
	      <lb/>and intrepidity of the hero, and it is the earnest wish of
	      <lb/>his officers, to imitate a character so worthy of their
	      <lb/>love and admiration. But I must bid you a reluctant
	      <lb/>good morning ,gentlemen,</said> he said, looking at his watch,
	    <lb/>and hastily rising to depart; <said>you have made me forget
	      <lb/>that I had other duties to perform; and I hope while
	      <lb/>you remain here, you will allow me frequently to re­
	      <lb/>new the pleasure which I have now enjoyed in your
	      <lb/>society.</said></p>
          <p>They both assured him of the happiness which they
	    <lb/>should always derive from his visits, and gratified by
	    <lb/>the favorable impression which he had apparently pro­
	    <pb n="104"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="9(4)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">104</mw>
	    <lb/>duced on the minds of the prisoners, he took his leave,
	    <lb/>and went with the surgeon to visit the other part of the
	    <lb/>hospital.</p>
          <p><persName>Hugh</persName>, who, through every mutation of forutne, retain­
	    <lb/>ed his strong affection for the <name>Americans</name>, had listened
	    <lb/>with undisguised pleasure to the preceding conversation,
	    <lb/>and remarked, with secret triumph, the elegance and
	    <lb/>urbanity of <persName>Colonel Grahame's</persName> manners. <persName>Captain
	      <lb/>O'Carroll</persName> had been amusing himself in watching the
	    <lb/>expression of his honest countenance, and he said,
	    <lb/>with a smiling nod when the American officer had left
	    <lb/>them,</p>
          <p>
            <said>A very good rebel that, <persName>Hugh</persName>; as the Hessian
	      <lb/>soldiers said of <persName>General Washington</persName>.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>And they had good reason, your Honor, for saying
	      <lb/>so,</said> replied <persName>Hugh</persName>, glad of an opportunity to testify in
	    <lb/>favour of the <name>Americans</name>. <said>They little deserved such
	      <lb/>treatment, and the rebels cannot be so bad as some of
	      <lb/>us think them, or they would not have let those wood­
	      <lb/>en-headed <name>Germans</name> go free, without even a touch of
	      <lb/>the cat-o'-nine-tails, to settle on the rich lands and
	      <lb/>green meadows of the west.</said></p>
          <p><said>You are a rigid disciplinarian, I perceive, <persName>Hugh</persName>,</said><lb/>said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, laughing; <said>but here comes <persName>Dr. Rennie</persName>,
	      <lb/>who I hope is not of your opinion, or we shall stand a
	      <lb/>chance to be kept with short commons and long band­
	      <lb/>ages for a week to come.</said></p>
          <p>The surgeon pronounced <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> conva­
	    <lb/>lescent, but spoke unfavorably of <persName>Major Courtland</persName>,
	    <lb/>though he said he perceived no sympto<choice><sic>n</sic><corr>m</corr></choice>s that threaten­
	    <lb/>ed immediate danger, and gave it as his opinion, that, by
	    <lb/>proper care and attention, his recovery would in time
	    <lb/>be complete.</p>
          <p>Of the three hundred wounded, whom the <name>British</name>,
	    <lb/>in their retreat, had left to the mercy of the <name>Americans</name>,
	    <lb/>most of them were soon removed to the hospital at
	    <lb/><placeName>Albany</placeName>, and every attention, which could contribute to
	    <lb/>their comfort, was paid them by their generous captors.
	    <lb/><persName>Major Courtland</persName>, and <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, who still re­
	    <lb/>fused to leave him, were almost, if not the only ones
	    <pb n="105"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="9(5)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">105</mw>
	    <lb/>who remained; and every luxury which the American
	    <lb/>camp afforded, was lavished upon them; and from the
	    <lb/>General to the lowest officer, all were assiduous in their
	    <lb/>attentions. But none were more so, than <persName>Colonel Gra­
	      <lb/>hame</persName>, and it was doubtful whether he gave or received
	    <lb/>more pleasure, in the frequent visits, which, when­
	    <lb/>ever his professional duties would permit, he was in
	    <lb/>the habit of paying to the two capured officers.</p>
          <p><persName>Major Courtland</persName> however continued rapidly to grow
	    <lb/>worse; anxiety for his daughter, who, in case of his
	    <lb/>death, would be left desolate, and the corrosive influ­
	    <lb/>ence of shame, regret, and disappointment, united to
	    <lb/>irritate his wound, and depress his spirits, to a degree,
	    <lb/>which defied alike the fascinating powers of <persName>Colonel
	    <lb/>Grahame's</persName> highly gifted mind, and the animating gaiety,
	    <lb/>which marked the countenance and conversation of
	    <lb/><persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, who wished often <said>that the rebels
	      <lb/>could be made to swallow their own musket-balls, in­
	      <lb/>stead of forcing them into the stomachs of other peo­
	      <lb/>ple.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> forbore to increase the irritation
	    <lb/>of <persName>Major Courtland's</persName> mind, by speaking of the com­
	    <lb/>plete triumph which promised soon to crown the efforts
	    <lb/>of the American arms. The situation of the British
	    <lb/>army gave full assurance to this promise. In the po­
	    <lb/>sition which they had chosen, or rather, which they had
	    <lb/>been compelled to take, at <placeName>Saratoga</placeName>, they were soon
	    <lb/>surrounded by the continental troops, who kept up a
	    <lb/>continual fire, and harassed them by every possible
	    <lb/>means. Their retreat was entirely cut off by the vigi­
	    <lb/>lance of the enemy; their provisions were exhausted;
	    <lb/>their troops worn down by hardship and toil; and many
	    <lb/>of their ablest officers had fallen, or were rendered use­
	    <lb/>less by wounds and sickness. Thus weakened, and 
	    <lb/>disadvantageously situated, it would have been madness
	    <lb/>to hazard an engagement; a defeat would inevitably
	    <lb/>complete their ruin; but to remain any longer in their
	    <lb/>present position, was at all events impossible. Some
	    <lb/>rumors had to be sure reached them of <persName>Sir Henry
	      <lb/>Clinton's</persName> approach up the <placeName>North river</placeName>; but they were
	    <pb n="106"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="9(5)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">106</mw>
	    <lb/>not sufficiently authentic to claim any reliance, and ac­
	    <lb/>cordingly, with the approbation of a council of war, a
	    <lb/>treaty of surrender was opened with the American
	    <lb/>General.</p>
          <p>It was while this important negotation was still pend­
	    <lb/>ing, that <persName>Major Courtland</persName> began slowly, and almost
	    <lb/>imperceptibly, to discover some slight symptoms of
	    <lb/>amendment. For several days before, he had appear­
	    <lb/>ed to be in a state of lethargy, from which no efforts of
	    <lb/>his surgeon could rouse him, and which, from its long
	    <lb/>continuance, was apprehended to be the prelude of ap­
	    <lb/>proaching dissolution. <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> had frequent­
	    <lb/>ly heard <persName>Major Courtland</persName> express the most decided
	    <lb/>disapprobation of sending for his daughter, and both he
	    <lb/>and <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> were aware of the unpleasantness
	    <lb/>of the situation for a young female, and the painful em­
	    <lb/>barassment to which she would be subjected, in case
	    <lb/>of her father's death. But moved by the entreaties of
	    <lb/><persName>Hugh</persName>, and influenced by his assertion that <persName>Miss Court­
	      <lb/>land</persName> had expressly commanded him to send for her, if
	    <lb/>her father should be wounded, they were almost resolv­
	    <lb/>ed to send a messenger after her; and were one even­
	    <lb/>ing discussing the propriety of doing so, when <persName>Major
	    <lb/>Courtland</persName> appeared to revive, and to view, with an air
	    <lb/>of consciousness, those who were in the apartment.
	    <lb/>The name of his daughter, frequently pronounced by
	    <lb/>the two officers, caught his ear, and after listening with
	    <lb/>interest for a few moments, he said with effort,</p>
          <p>
            <said>No, no, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, she must not be sent for; you
	      <lb/>know I would not even have her informed of my situa­
	      <lb/>tion, lest it should distress her.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>But she will probably see your name among the
	      <lb/>wounded, in the public papers,</said> said <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>,
	    <lb/><said>and uncertainty will increase her uneasiness and her
	      <lb/>apprehensions.</said></p>
          <p><said>No, they will conceal it from her,</said> said the Major,
	    <lb/>in a feeble voice;<choice><sic>”</sic><corr/></choice> 
	    <said rend="pre()"><choice><sic/><corr>“</corr></choice>I will write to her when I am strong­
	      <lb/>er, but you must not bring her here.</said></p>
          <p>Perceiving that he was exhausted by the effort of
	    <lb/>speaking, but encouraged by his unexpected revival
	    <pb n="107"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="9(6)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">107</mw>
	    <lb/>from almost deathlike lethargy, they assured him they
	    <lb/>would acquiesce in his wishes, and entreated him to
	    <lb/>give himself no farther uneasiness on the subject.</p>
          <p>The following day confirmed the hope of <persName>Major
	    <lb/>Courtland's</persName> amendment, and in the course of it, he re­
	    <lb/>covered so much strength, as to be able to converse, at
	    <lb/>intervals, with his friends. Towards evening, as <persName>O'Car­
	      <lb/>roll</persName> and <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> sat beside him, seeking, by
	    <lb/>the assiduities of friendship, to beguile the languor of
	    <lb/>illness, the Colonel's servant entered, and delivered a
	    <lb/>whispered message to his master, who instantly rose and
	    <lb/>quitted the room. A subaltern was waiting to speak
	    <lb/>with him at the door.</p>
          <p><said>The daughter of the wounded officer, Colonel,
	      <lb/>whom you have been visiting, hearing of her father's
	      <lb/>situation, has arrived here from <placeName>Albany</placeName></said>――</p>
          <p><said>How unfortunate!</said> interrupted <persName>Grahame</persName>; <said>it was
	      <lb/>surely unwise in her father not to write, and prevent
	      <lb/>her taking such a step.</said></p>
          <p><said><persName>General Gates</persName>,</said> continued the subaltern, <said>desires
	      <lb/>her father may be prepared to receive her, lest her
	      <lb/>sudden appearance should produce fatal consequences.</said></p>
          <p><said>Most assuredly; the General is ever thoughtful and
	      <lb/>humane,</said> said <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>; <said>but where is the
	      <lb/>lady, and who accompanies her?</said></p>
          <p>
            <said>She has a female attendant, and is accompanied by
	      <lb/>an elderly <name>Quaker</name>; <persName>Richard Hope</persName>, I think <persName>General
	      <lb/>Schuyler</persName> called him.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>Ha! <persName>Ohmeina</persName>,</said> said the Colonel, turning to the
	    <lb/><name>Indian</name> who had followed him to the house; <said>is not
	      <lb/>that the name of him in whose hands you discovered

          <p><said><persName>Ohmeina</persName> has seen him, brother!</said> replied the <name>In­

	      <lb/>here, and thou mayest learn to love thy American
	      <lb/>brethren, and seek not again to betray them.</said></p>
          <p><said>Let him look to his safety if he does,</said> answered
	    <lb/><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>; <said>but where is the lady waiting,</said>
	    <lb/>he said, again addressing the subaltern.</p>

            <said>In front of the house, sir; I did not like to ask her
	      <lb/>in till I had spoken to you.</said>
          </p>
          <p><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> directed his servant to inform <persName>Cap­
	      <lb/>tain O'Carroll</persName> of <persName>Miss Courtland's</persName> arrival, and request
	    <lb/>him to communicate it as gently as possible to <persName>Major
	    <lb/>Courtland</persName>; and to let him know when the Major was
	    <lb/>ready to receive his daughter. He then went to the
	    <lb/>door to conduct the lady in.</p>
          <p>In front of it stood a clumsy Dutch vehicle, drawn by
	    <lb/>two horses, a man rather past the meridian of life, with
	    <lb/>a sedate and ruddy countenance, which indicated the
	    <lb/>gentle approach of a green and healthy old age, was
	    <lb/>walking with slow and measured steps beside it. A
	    <lb/>lovely figure rounded with the soft fullness of youth,
	    <lb/>hung upon his arm, and in silence shared his walk.
	    <lb/>They had just turned from the door as <persName>Colonel Gra­
	      <lb/>hame</persName> reached it, and he stood, for a moment, observ­
	    <lb/>ing the persons of the strangers. The precise form of
	    <lb/>the <name>Quaker</name>, his broad-brimmed hat, and his formal at­
	    <lb/>tire of light drab-colored cloth, together with the look
	    <lb/>of inexpressible horror with which he regarded the ves­
	    <lb/>tiges of recent warfare, that were strewed around, con­
	    <lb/>trasted singularly with the light and graceful figure of
	    <lb/>his companion, who, with head depressed, seemed lost
	    <lb/>in thought, and heedless of surrounding objects. As
	    <lb/>they turned to retrace their steps, a slight noise caused
	    <lb/>her to raise her head, and the sadness and anxiety,
	    <lb/>which had overspread her lovely and expressive fea­
	    <lb/>tures, gave place to a glow of expectancy, when she
	    <lb/>saw the American officer waiting, as she supposed, to
	    <lb/>conduct her to her father. It apparently cost her an
	    <lb/>effort to refrain from springing towards him. Instinct­
	    <lb/>ively her step became more rapid, and, with unconscious
	    <lb/>eagerness she drew her arm from the rigid hold of the
	    <lb/><name>Quaker</name>. <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> moved to meet her, and a
	    <lb/>sentiment of admiration and respect inspired him, as he
	    <lb/>remarked the impatience of her filial affection, and gaz­
	    <lb/>ed upon the youth and beauty of the delicate female,
	    <lb/>who had ventured among enemies, to watch beside the
	    <lb/>couch of a wounded father.</p>

          <p><said>I regret, madam,</said> he said, bending slightly to the
	    <lb/><name>Quaker</name>, and with an air of profound respect to <persName>Miss
	    <lb/>Courtland</persName>, <said>that you should have been detained a mo­
	      <lb/>ment, in this unpleasant situation; but your unexpected
	      <lb/>arrival must plead our excuse.</said></p>
          <p><said>No apology is necessary, sir,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>; <said>I
	      <lb/>did not look for ceremony here; only lead me to my
	      <lb/>father, sir, and all the embarrassments, which have at­
	      <lb/>tended my introduction into your camp, and all the anxi­
	      <lb/>eties of months that are passed, will be forgotten in the
	      <lb/>joy of again embracing him.</said></p>
          <p><said>The illness of <persName>Major Courtland</persName> has been so serious,</said><lb/>said <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, <said>that we have judged it prudent
	      <lb/>to communicate the news of your arrival with caution,
	      <lb/>but in the course of a few minutes, I hope to have the
	      <lb/>pleasure of conducting you to his apartment. In the
	      <lb/>meantime, <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>, I beg you will permit me to
	      <lb/>lead you from this chilly atmosphere, to the shelter of
	      <lb/>the house.</said></p>
          <p><said>Ah, I fear,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, <said>from the caution you
	      <lb/>have thought it necessary to use, that my father is worse,
	      <lb/>much worse, than even my fears would suffer me to
	      <lb/>believe.</said></p>
          <p><said>Do not alarm yourself, <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>,</said> said the
	    <lb/>Colonel; <said>your father for two days past has been de­
	      <lb/>cidedly better, though I will not conceal from you, that
	      <lb/>we have thought him dangerously ill; and, to save you
	      <lb/>from a sudden shock, I must warn you that owing to
	      <lb/>his confinement, you will find him somewhat changed
	      <lb/>in personal appearance.</said></p>
          <p>As <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> said this, he led <persName>Catherine</persName> into
	    <lb/>the house, and drawing forward a broken chair, the best
	    <lb/>that the apartment afforded, he begged her, humble as
	    <lb/>was the seat, to accept it, while waiting. But she de­
	    <lb/>clined, and stood looking through the narrow window,
	    <lb/>upon the field where the British army had been so re­
	    <lb/>cently encamped. The earth was torn up by the balls
	    <lb/>of the enemy, and melancholy traces of the late sangui­
	    <lb/>nary conflict every where met the view. <persName>Catherine's</persName>
	    <lb/>eyes filled with tears, as she gazed; and oppressed with
	    <mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(+3)">10</mw>
	    <pb n="110"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="10(1)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">110</mw>
	    <lb/>the gloomy associations which the scene naturally awak­
	    <lb/>ened, she spoke with feeling of the miseries of war, and
	    <lb/>the anguish, which, even when successful, it inflicted
	    <lb/>on a thousand hearts. Though a brave soldier in the
	    <lb/>hour when his country called for aid, <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>
	    <lb/>was not a lover of war, for its own sake; and he replied
	    <lb/>to <persName>Catherine's</persName> observation with as much sincerity as
	    <lb/>feeling.</p>
          <p><said>You are right, <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>; even in the moment
	      <lb/>of victory, the field of battle presents a scene, calculat­
	      <lb/>ed only to awaken horror and regret; and no feeling
	      <lb/>mind can reflect without a sensation of bitter anguish,
	      <lb/>upon the waste of human life, and the bereavement of
	      <lb/>human happiness, which are the necessary consequen­
	      <lb/>ces of a single engagement. But,</said> he added, and his
	    <lb/>eye kindled as he spoke, <said>these are not themes on which
	      <lb/>a soldier ought to dwell; he must reject all thoughts
	      <lb/>but those which nerve his arm for battle, by reminding
	      <lb/>him of liberties invaded, and rights insulted; which tell
	      <lb/>him he has a country to defend, an altar to protect,
	      <lb/>and the sanctity of a domestic hearth to preserve in­
	      <lb/>violate.</said></p>
          <p>Even in this moment of sorrow and anxiety, the
	    <lb/>patriotism of <persName>Catherine's</persName> heart for an instant predomi­
	    <lb/>nated over every other feeling, and she fixed her dark
	    <lb/>eyes, full of proud emotion and delight, upon the glow­
	    <lb/>ing countenance of <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>; but quickly re­
	    <lb/>collecting herself, she turned away with blushes, which
	    <lb/>deepened into crimson, when she caught his eye bent
	    <lb/>earnestly upon her. He had indeed remarked her
	    <lb/>thrilling glance, and, spell-bound by its fa<choice><sic/><corr>s</corr></choice>cinating influ­
	    <lb/>ence, he was intently regarding her, when he was
	    <lb/>aroused by the deep-toned voice of the <name>Quaker</name>, who
	    <lb/>with <persName>Martha</persName> had followed him to the house, and who
	    <lb/>could not let so good an opportunity for urging his
	    <lb/>pacific sentiments pass unimproved.</p>
          <p><said>These, young man,</said> he said, addressing <persName>Colonel
	    <lb/>Grahame</persName>, <said>are not the precepts of him whose altar
	      <lb/>thou sayest thou wouldst protect. He has enjoined on
	      <lb/>us to be merciful, peaceful, forbearing; to render good
	      <pb n="111"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="10(2)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">111</mw>
	      <lb/>for evil, and when we are smitten on the one cheek, to
	      <lb/>turn the other also. But thou, like the zealous Apostle
	      <lb/>of old, wouldst cut off the ears of those who insult thy
	      <lb/>master; thou wouldst close thy heart to the cry of the
	      <lb/>widow and orphan, lest they should melt thee to mercy,
	      <lb/>and deluge the land which thou lovest, with the blood
	      <lb/>of those, whom thy God has made in his own image,
	      <lb/>and after his own likeness.</said></p>
          <p><said>And wast thou obeying his precepts,</said> said the
	    <lb/><name>Indian</name> <persName>Ohmeina</persName>, stepping forward from the passage
	    <lb/>where he had remained unobserved, <said>was thou, <persName>Rich­
		<lb/>ard Hope</persName>, obeying his precepts, and treading in the
	      <lb/>path of the man of peace and wisdom, whom thou dost
	      <lb/>profess to honor, when thou didst purpose to betray thy
	      <lb/>brethren into the snares of the <name>English</name>, whose long
	      <lb/>knives were thirsting for their blood?</said></p>
          <p>A transient smile flitted over the lovely features of
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName> at this unexpected retort of the <name>Indian</name>, whom
	    <lb/>at the first glance she recognized. Nor could <persName>Colonel
	    <lb/>Grahame</persName> forbear smiling at the ingenious home thrust
	    <lb/>of <persName>Ohmeina</persName>, which in truth the <name>Quaker</name> richly deserv­
	    <lb/>ed; and he evinced his consciousness of that desert by a
	    <lb/>degree of agitation and embarrassment, which his placid
	    <lb/>countenance had seldom been seen to wear before.
	    <lb/>But without making any attempt to parry the assault of
	    <lb/>the <name>Indian</name>, he turned towards him with a gravity as in­
	    <lb/>vincible as his own, saying,</p>
          <p>
            <said>I did repent me of that deed, as thou well knowest,
	      <lb/>friend; and God, I trust, has pardoned the sin of his un­
	      <lb/>worthy servant.</said>
          </p>
          <p><persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> at this moment entered with a
	    <lb/>smiling countenance, and <persName>Catherine</persName>, observing the Bri­
	    <lb/>tish uniform, pressed eagerly towards him, and without
	    <lb/>waiting for an introduction, exclaimed,</p>
          <p>
            <said>You come to take me to my father, sir, I hope;
	      <lb/>indeed, indeed, I cannot be detained from him a mo­
	      <lb/>ment longer.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>You shall not, madam,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>it is not
	      <lb/>necessary; he has received the gratifying intelligence
	      <lb/>of your arrival with much more firmness than we ex­

	      <lb/>pected, and is as impatient for the meeting as your­
	      <lb/>self.</said></p>
          <p>He took her hand, as he spoke; and beckoning to
	    <lb/><persName>Martha</persName> to follow her, she was led by him to the door
	    <lb/>of her father's apartment. He bowed low as he open­
	    <lb/>ed it for her to enter, and instantly closing it after her,
	    <lb/>retreated to the room where he had left the Colonel,
	    <lb/>unwilling to intrude upon the sanctity of the touching
	    <lb/>scene which must, of course, ensue between the father
	    <lb/>and daughter, meeting under circumstances so peculiar
	    <lb/>and affecting.</p>
          <p>The <name>Quaker</name> had gone out, and <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>
	    <lb/>was standing alone with his arms folded, and his head
	    <lb/>depressed, in an attitude of deep meditation.</p>
          <p><said>Has the <persName>Circe</persName> transformed you to a statue, Colo­
	      <lb/>nel!</said> asked <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, gaily, as he passed his arm
	    <lb/>through <persName>Grahame's</persName>, and looked archly in his face.
	    <lb/><said>Come,</said> he added, <said>I am well enough to walk out
	      <lb/>to day, and we cannot have a better opportunity;
	      <lb/>though I would not be absent long either; this inter­
	      <lb/>view must not last too long, or our patient may have a
	      <lb/>relapse tomorrow. I never knew much good to come
	      <lb/>of a woman's tears, Colonel.</said></p>
          <p><said>But what say you of her smiles?</said> asked <persName>Grahame</persName>,
	    <lb/>playfully.</p>
          <p><said>Oh worse, far worse,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName> with unusual
	    <lb/>emphasis. <said>Never trust them, Colonel, they are dead­
	      <lb/>ly snares to entrap unwary hearts, sharp arrows tipt
	      <lb/>with the poison of asps. Upon my faith, I would
	      <lb/>rather, unarmed, encounter <persName>Morgan's</persName> whole corps of
	      <lb/>riflemen, than half the number of these fair enslavers,
	      <lb/>without some spell to preserve me from their enchant­
	      <lb/>ments.</said></p>
          <p><said>You would doubtless have a better chance of es­
	      <lb/>cape.</said> said <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, archly.</p>
          <p><said>I should, at least, meet a less merciless death,</said> re­
	    <lb/>turned <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>and that is all I should expect in
	      <lb/>either case. But why do we stand prating in this dark
	      <lb/>place: come, let us be going.</said></p>

          <p><said>I think it too damp for you to venture out this
	      <lb/>evening, Captain,</said> said <persName>Grahame</persName>; <said>besides, the <name>Qua­
		<lb/>ker</name> has some claim upon my attention, and of course
	      <lb/>I cannot have the pleasure of accompanying you.</said></p>
          <p><said>Oh, very well,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, <said>tomorrow will be
	      <lb/>just as pleasant, so do not let me detain you. <foreign xml:lang="fr">Bon soir</foreign>;
	    <lb/>and, Colonel, do call early in the morning, since I know
	    <lb/>you are dying for another glance at this <quote>miracle and
	      <lb/>queen of gems,</quote> that has fallen with such unexpected
	    <lb/>lustre amongst us. You, who shrink neither from the
	    <lb/>heathenish tomahawks of those gutteral dogs of the
	    <lb/>forest, nor from the ponderous sabres of our German
	    <lb/>dragoons, can safely stand the fire of a lady's eyes,
	    <lb/>though aided by the artillery of her smiles, and all the
	    <lb/>host of mining engines which, in the form of airs and
	    <lb/>graces, sap the fountain of our hearts, and light the
	    <lb/>train of explosion, before we have had the precaution
	    <lb/>to place a single sentinel at the gates.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> smiled at the humorous compari­
	    <lb/>son of the Captain, but was prevented from replying
	    <lb/>by the entrance of <persName>Richard Hope</persName>, who, wearied with
	    <lb/>waiting, had come in to see if he might now be admit­
	    <lb/>ted to <persName>Major Courtland's</persName> apartment. But as the sur­
	    <lb/>geon had prohibited any one else from seeing him before
	    <lb/>morning, <persName>Mr. Hope</persName> returned to pass the night with a
	    <lb/><name>Quaker</name>, who resided a few miles below <placeName>Stillwater</placeName>, and
	    <lb/><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> took leave of <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, and, mount­
	    <lb/>ing his horse, rode slowly to his quarters.</p>

	    <lb/>prevented from paying his customary visit to <persName>Major
	    <lb/>Courtland</persName>, by a message from <persName>General Gates</persName>, signify­
	    <lb/>ing his wish to speak with him as soon as convenient.</p>
          <p>The crisis of the northern campaign was rapidly ap­
	    <lb/>proaching, and it promised to shed new lustre on the
	    <lb/>cause of <placeName>America</placeName>, while it filled with fresh hope and
	    <lb/>courage the hearts of her defenders. The consideration
	    <lb/>of the treaty proposed by <persName>General Burgoyne</persName>, had occa­
	    <lb/>sioned a cessation of hostilities, which, owing to its final
	    <lb/>ratification, were not again resumed; and although the
	    <lb/>truce allowed to the weary soldiers time for that bodily
	    <lb/>repose, which their late active and unremitted warfare
	    <lb/>had prohibited, it fully occupied the minds of their
	    <lb/>leaders, and consumed the hours designed for sleep in
	    <lb/>long consultations and deliberate reflection.</p>
          <p>It was on some affairs connected with this subject,
	    <lb/>that <persName>General Gates</persName> now required the presence of <persName>Col­
	      <lb/>onel Grahame</persName>, who instantly obeyed the summons, and
	    <lb/>repaired, without delay, to his quarters. <persName>General Gates</persName>
	    <lb/>wished to send a verbal messenger to <persName>General Lincoln</persName>,
	    <lb/>who had been wounded in the battle of the <date when="1777-10-07">seventh</date>, and
	    <lb/>still remained in the hospital at <placeName>Albany</placeName>. <persName>Colonel Gra­
	      <lb/>hame</persName> received the commission as a mark of his Gene­
	    <lb/>ral's confidence, and felt too much honored by it, not
	    <lb/>to accept it with pleasure.</p>
          <p>Without delay he set out for <placeName>Albany</placeName>, delivered his
	    <lb/>message, and after passing some time in conversation
	    <lb/>with the General on the circumstances of the army, he

	    <milestone unit="sig" n="10(4)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">115</mw>
	    <lb/>left him to visit some other wounded officers, previous
	    <lb/>to his quitting the hospital. As he was hastily passing
	    <lb/>a half open door, he heard himself called by name, and
	    <lb/>stopping to ascertain by whom, he recognized the well
	    <lb/>known features of <persName>General Arnold</persName>, who was among the
	    <lb/>sufferers in the last engagement. Though not an ad­
	    <lb/>mirer of this officer, courtesy compelled him to stop
	    <lb/>and inquire after his health; but when he beheld the
	    <lb/>irritated and flushed face of the General, owing to the
	    <lb/>pain he had just suffered from the examination of his
	    <lb/>wound, he secretly wished that he had escaped unob­
	    <lb/>served.</p>
          <p><said>What brings you here, <persName>Grahame</persName>,</said> asked the Gen­
	    <lb/>eral, in a pettish tone; <said>I thought you had been at
	      <lb/><placeName>Saratoga</placeName>, receiving the dictation of those bull-dogs,
	      <lb/>whom we have beaten from the field, but who keep us
	      <lb/>at bay as if they, forsooth, and not we, were the conquer­
	      <lb/>ors.</said></p>

	    <lb/>without noticing the sarcastic remark of <persName>Arnold</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>Something about the treaty, I suppose,</said> said <persName>Ar­
	      <lb/>nold</persName>; <said>and he doubtless approves all the humane con­
	      <lb/>descension of the General.</said></p>
          <p><said>He does so most fully,</said> said <persName>Grahame</persName>, disregarding
	  <lb/>the sneer which accompanied these words.</p>
          <p><said>Oh, of course,</said> returned <persName>Arnold</persName>; <said>you Massachu­
		<lb/>setts people always remember mercy before sacrifice,
	      <lb/>and had much rather be pointed at as good, honest cit­
	      <lb/>izens, than brave and warlike soldiers.</said></p>
          <p><said>You forget, sir,</said> said <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, <said>that the
	      <lb/>men of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> were the first to draw the sword
	      <lb/>in this good cause; and though they may love and
	      <lb/>cultivate the arts of peace, they are not less prompt to
	      <lb/>obey the voice of their country, nor less efficient in her
	      <lb/>service, as the bravery of <persName>Lincoln</persName>, and the intrepid
	      <lb/>gallantry of <persName>Brooks</persName>, to mention no others, evince.</said></p>
          <p><said>Though you might have added the name of <persName>Gra­
		<lb/>hame</persName>, had your modesty permitted you to do so,</said><lb/>said the General, wishing to soften the harshness of his
	    <pb n="116"/><milestone unit="sig" n="10(4)v"/><mw type="pageNum">116</mw><lb/>observation. <said rend="post()">I certainly intended no reflection on the
	      <lb/>people of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, Colonel, though in the irrita­
	      <lb/>tion of the moment, I might have said what sounded
	      <lb/>like it; but it would be folly in me to dispute the cour­
	      <lb/>age which is self-evident, though I do think, in this
	      <lb/>crisis, there is too much consideration shown for the
	      <lb/>feelings of an enemy who has had none for ours. <persName>Gen­
		<lb/>eral Gates</persName>, in particular, whether it is that his heart
	      <lb/>yearns towards his countrymen I know not, but he is
	      <lb/>disposed to be far too lenient in his conduct to these
	      <lb/>spoilers, who have come, with fire and sword, to ravage
	      <lb/>our fair inheritance and crush us beneath the yoke of
	      <lb/>their barbarous oppression.</said></p>
          <p><said>You would not surely have us tarnish the glory of
	      <lb/>our victory, General,</said> said <persName>Grahame</persName>, <said>by an exercise
	      <lb/>of tyrannical power over those unfortunate soldiers,
	      <lb/>whom we have reduced to the cruel necessity of asking
	      <lb/>mercy at our hands.</said></p>
          <p><said>I would have them receive their deserts,</said> said the
	    <lb/>General, fiercely; <said>I would have them feel, and deeply
	      <lb/>too, that we are not to be insulted with impunity; that
	      <lb/>after they are vanquished, besieged, destitute of provi­
	      <lb/>sions, and reduced almost to actual misery, they may
	      <lb/>not hope to hide their degradation under an affectation of
	      <lb/>humanity, and in the very moment when they are suing
	      <lb/>for terms, audaciously declare they are <emph>only</emph> induced to
	      <lb/>resort to that measure from the wish to avoid a scene
	      <lb/>of carnage which must destroy many valuable lives.</said></p>
          <p><said>And why,</said> asked <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, <said>should we
	      <lb/>doubt this assertion? Is it incredible that men who
	      <lb/>have given us such convincing proofs of their courage,
	      <lb/>should choose rather to sacrifice a point of honor, than
	      <lb/>lavishly to waste the blood of their remaining troops?</said></p>
          <p><said>Preposterous!</said> exclaimed the General. <said>It is only
	      <lb/>a feint, <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, to hide their shame, and it is
	      <lb/>rendered the more ridiculous by the absurd declar­
	      <lb/>ation, that their retreat is not cut off, while they have
	      <lb/>arms in their hands! Yet with all this insolence, so
	      <lb/>unbecoming in the vanquished, <persName>General Gates</persName> is strong­
	      <lb/>ly inclined to soften every thing galling to their pride,
	      <pb n="117"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="10(5)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">117</mw>
	      <lb/>in the articles of capitulation, and to accept their sur­
	      <lb/>render, on terms as easy and as little humiliating as they
	      <lb/>choose to make them.</said></p>
          <p><said>Pardon me, sir, if I venture to dissent from you in
	      <lb/>opinion,</said> said <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>; <said>the humanity, which
	      <lb/><persName>General Gates</persName> displays in this and every other in­
	      <lb/>stance, adds lustre to the splendor of his conquests, and
	      <lb/>throws a softening veil over the horrors of war. We would
	      <lb/>not for our own fame's sake, were there no higher mo­
	      <lb/>tive, wish to treat our vanquished enemies like criminals.
	      <lb/>The very act of surrender must be sufficiently wound­
	      <lb/>ing to their feelings and their pride, without the aggra­
	      <lb/>vation of arrogant and contemptuous treatment.</said></p>
          <p><said>Surrender!</said> ejaculated <persName>Arnold</persName>; <said>call it a <emph>conven­
		<lb/>tion</emph>, Colonel; that is the dignified appellation the
	      <lb/>treaty is to receive, in order to save the fallen General
	      <lb/>all the mortification possible.</said></p>
          <p><said>It matters little what appellation it receives,</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>Grahame</persName>; <said>its nature will not be changed by the
	      <lb/>mere circumstance of a name; nor will the honor
	      <lb/>which it reflects on the victors be in the least degree
	      <lb/>sullied by the benevolence, which induces them to sof­
	      <lb/>ten the disgraces of their humbled foes.</said></p>
          <p><said>Humbled!</said> repeated the irascible and fiery Gen­
	    <lb/>eral; <said>would to God they were humbled in spirit, as
	      <lb/>well as in condition. Does their answer to the sixth
	      <lb/>article of the treaty savor of humility, <persName>Colonel Gra­
		<lb/>hame</persName>? And yet <persName>General Gates</persName>, notwithstanding their
	      <lb/>insolent threat, consents to grant their demands, and
	      <lb/>allows them to march out of their encampment with all
	      <lb/>the honors of war.</said></p>
          <p><said>And even if he has,</said> said the fearless <persName>Grahame</persName>,
	    <lb/>undaunted by the angry looks of the General, <said>will this
	      <lb/>indulgence lessen the glory he has won; or will he be
	      <lb/>at all degraded in the eyes of the captives, by exercising
	      <lb/>towards them a lenity, which only the most unciviliz­
	      <lb/>ed nations refuse to their unfortunate prisoners? For
	      <lb/>one moment, <persName>General Arnold</persName>, let us imagine ourselves
	      <lb/>in their situation. Is there one among us, who would
	      <lb/>submit to comply with the sixth article of the treaty?
	      <pb n="118"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="10(5)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">118</mw>
	      <lb/>You, I am sure, would sooner die; and Heaven is my
	      <lb/>witness that death in its most hideous form would be
	      <lb/>less terrible to me, than the fulfilment of a requisition
	      <lb/>so degrading. And from my soul, sir, I respect the
	      <lb/>foe, who, in the extremest hour of peril, has nobly re­
	      <lb/>sisted a demand, which would have fixed a lasting stig­
	      <lb/>ma on his country, and rendered him contemptible
	      <lb/>even in the eyes of his enemy.</said></p>
          <p><said>All this parade might do, were their cause a
	      <lb/>worthy one,</said> returned the General; <said>but it is so in­
	      <lb/>compatible with noble feelings, that I marvel, <persName>Colonel
	      <lb/>Grahame</persName>, a mind of so nice discernment as yours, can
	      <lb/>place any reliance in their affected scruples of delicacy
	      <lb/>and honor. I would treat a generous foe with all the
	      <lb/>consideration and forbearance consistent with military
	      <lb/>discipline, but I confess these lawless oppressors appear
	      <lb/>to me to merit little mercy.</said></p>
          <p><said>They are the agents of a king,</said> replied <persName>Grahame</persName>,
	    <lb/><said>who regards us as his lawful subjects, and, as rebel­
	      <lb/>lious ones, asserts his right to chastise us. And those
	      <lb/>whom he employs for the purpose, doubtless, believe
	      <lb/>themselves doing God and their prince service, in at­
	      <lb/>tempting to quell the turbulent and unnatural commo­
	      <lb/>tion, excited against the rightful authority of a virtuous
	      <lb/>sovereign.</said></p>
          <p><said>But they will find it no easy task,</said> said the Gene­
	    <lb/>ral, <said>to quell the spirit of a free and valiant people.
	      <lb/>They may league with the savages of our forests, more
	      <lb/>terrible in their fierce array than so many legions of
	      <lb/>devils; they may burn our cities, destroy our villages,
	      <lb/>and bring their German barbarians to plunder our citi­
	      <lb/>zens and violate our wives and daughters; yet they
	      <lb/>shall find us undismayed, and, in the end, we will com­
	      <lb/>pel them, like this proud General whom we have just
	      <lb/>now vanquished, to entreat us for terms of mercy.</said></p>
          <p><said>And we shall, I trust, rejoice to grant it, when that
	      <lb/>moment of good fortune shall arrive,</said> said <persName>Colonel
	    <lb/>Grahame</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>We shall be in no haste to do it, I trust,</said> said the
	    <lb/>General; <said>at least if we would not give our enemies
	      <pb n="119"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="10(6)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">119</mw>
	      <lb/>the idea, that they may offend again with impunity,
	      <lb/>and that we are so very glad to be at peace with them,
	      <lb/>as to concede it on any conditions which they may
	      <lb/>choose to dictate.</said></p>
          <p><said>We can concede it on none,</said> returned the Colo­
	    <lb/>nel, <said>which may endanger our future liberties, or les­
	      <lb/>sen our national dignity; but as far as is consistent with
	      <lb/>these, we shall, I hope, be ever ready to exercise the
	      <lb/>virtues of forbearance and humanity; virtues which
	      <lb/>have a much happier influence on the character and
	      <lb/>prosperity of a nation than it is possible for the most
	      <lb/>splendid victories of warlike ambition to produce.</said></p>
          <p><said>Do you claim any affinity to the disciples of
	      <lb/><persName>George Fox</persName> and <persName>William Penn</persName>, Colonel?</said> asked the
	    <lb/>General, with a sarcastic smile. <said>That pacific speech
	      <lb/>half inclines me to believe that the fiery current of your
	      <lb/>blood is tempered by the milky stream which curdles
	      <lb/>in the veins of those peace-loving people.</said></p>
          <p><said>Though I can claim no affinity to them, sir,</said> re­
	    <lb/>turned the Colonel, <said>I am not ashamed to acknowl­
	      <lb/>edge that even they cannot love peace, and enjoy the
	      <lb/>tranquillizing pleasures of benevolence, more than I
	      <lb/>should, did not the interests of my country demand the
	      <lb/>sacrifice of private feeling, in this hour of her danger
	      <lb/>and tribulation. The heart, <persName>General Arnold</persName>, round
	      <lb/>which the milk of human kindness never circles, must
	      <lb/>be dead to all the sweet sympathies of humanity, false
	      <lb/>to its own honor, and treacherous to the interests of
	      <lb/>others.</said></p>
          <p><said>It is but a stagnant pool at best,</said> said the General
	    <lb/>in a scornful tone. <said>Give me the arts of war; the
	      <lb/>spirit-stirring scenes of the camp have more attractions
	      <lb/>than all the soft and enervating luxuries of peace. The
	      <lb/>pompous array of battle is enlivening; nay even the
	      <lb/>shrieks of the wounded and the dying, the roar of artil­
	      <lb/>lery, the hurry and the rush of men and steeds, as the
	      <lb/>dreadful combat thickens, fill the soul with a wild and
	      <lb/>fearful delight, which only the heart of the warrior can
	      <lb/>conceive. But in the last engagement, Colonel, these
	      <lb/>thrilling sensations were somewhat deranged by this
	      <pb n="120"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="10(6)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">120</mw>
	      <lb/>cursed wound, just as sword in hand we had forced our
	      <lb/>way into the works of the flying enemy. I thought it
	      <lb/>mortal; and in that moment of glory and victory I
	      <lb/>would have yielded, without reluctance, to the grasp of
	      <lb/>death, if, like the warlike <name>Danes</name>, I could have believed
	      <lb/>that henceforth I should quaff nectar in heaven from
	      <lb/>the skulls of our vanquished foes.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> recoiled with involuntary horror,
	    <lb/>shocked by the profane levity, and savage fierceness
	    <lb/>expressed in these words. But in the animation of
	    <lb/>speaking, <persName>General Arnold</persName> had disarranged his wound­
	    <lb/>ed leg, and, agonized by the pain which it gave him,
	    <lb/>he did not observe the gesture of the Colonel. After
	    <lb/>a few moments spent in muttering curses, which seem­
	    <lb/>ed to alleviate his suffering, he turned to <persName>Grahame</persName>, and
	    <lb/>said, in a fretful and angry tone,</p>
          <p>
            <said>It maddens me that this gasconading General, who
	      <lb/>has made us all suffer, more or less, should be let off
	      <lb/>so easily. His insolence is insufferable. We have a
	      <lb/>report here, which I had forgotten to mention, that he
	      <lb/>has demanded more time for the settlement of prelimi­
	      <lb/>naries, and that he has said, he is willing, <emph>willing</emph> in­
	      <lb/>deed, to appoint two officers who may meet with two
	      <lb/>of ours to discuss and settle the subordinate articles of
	      <lb/>the treaty.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>The report is authentic,</said> returned <persName>Grahame</persName>. <said>And
	      <lb/>really, sir,</said> he added, scarcely able to conceal his dis­
	    <lb/>gust at the ferocity of the General, <said>really, sir, I can
	      <lb/>discern nothing either insolent or unreasonable in the
	      <lb/>proposition. <persName>General Burgoyne</persName> owes it to his king,
	      <lb/>to his soldiers, and to himself, to render as favourable as
	      <lb/>possible the terms of the surrender which he is com­
	      <lb/>pelled to make.</said></p>
          <p><said>And the spot, which he has chosen for the propos­
	      <lb/>ed meeting,</said> observed the General, <said>is not one which
	      <lb/>can tend to soften the hearts of the American officers
	      <lb/>towards him. The ruined walls of <persName>General Schuyler's</persName>
	      <lb/>house, will not awaken a train of associations the most
	      <lb/>favorable to the interests of the spoilers.</said></p>
          <pb n="121"/>
          <milestone unit="sig" n="11(1)r"/>
          <mw type="pageNum">121</mw>
          <p><said>I trust,</said> returned <persName>Grahame</persName>, <said>the minds of the
	      <lb/>American officers are too free from prejudice and party
	      <lb/>feeling, to yield to the influence of recollections, which
	      <lb/>the desolated scene may momentarily awaken. It has
	      <lb/>been said, and I know not that we have any right to
	      <lb/>doubt the truth of the report, that the house was de­
	      <lb/>stroyed from motives of policy. Sentiments of re­
	      <lb/>venge had nothing to do with it; it was burned merely
	      <lb/>to prevent its affording shelter to our troops. If then
	      <lb/>it was not a deed of wanton outrage, we can and ought
	      <lb/>to pardon it. <persName>General Schuyler</persName>, who is certainly in a
	      <lb/>private point of view the only sufferer by the loss, has
	      <lb/>generously done so, and speaks of it not merely as a
	      <lb/>pardonable, but as a justifiable act, warranted by the
	      <lb/>laws of war, and if not absolutely necessary, at least
	      <lb/>prudent, considering the desperate situation of the Bri­
	      <lb/>tish commander.</said></p>
          <p><said>Well, if he is contented,</said> said the General, <said>to
	      <lb/>have his lands destroyed and his houses pillaged and
	      <lb/>burned by the hands of these Vandals, I have not the
	      <lb/>slightest objection. But if they had thus despoiled my
	      <lb/>property, I should not brook the injury with all the
	      <lb/>smiling patience, which the good General thinks proper
	      <lb/>to display upon the occasion.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> was stung by the taunting man­
	    <lb/>ners of <persName>Arnold</persName>, and by the lurking sarcasm, which was
	    <lb/>directed against the upright and excellent man whom
	    <lb/>all loved and respected, and he replied with a haughty
	    <lb/>severity, which he intended should repel any farther
	    <lb/>ebullition of spleen.</p>
          <p>
            <said><persName>General Schuyler's</persName> heart glows with the purest pa­
	      <lb/>triotism, sir, and he thinks lightly of private losses or
	      <lb/>acquirements, in comparison with the momentous inter­
	      <lb/>ests of his country, whose fate, notwithstanding our late
	      <lb/>successes, is still involved in clouds of doubt and ob­
	      <lb/>scurity. Would to God that every heart among us
	      <lb/>were as pure, as free from dissimulation, as zealous in
	      <lb/>the cause, for which we are contending, as that of the
	      <lb/>brave and virtuous <persName>General Schuyler</persName>!</said>

          <p><said>No one doubts his virtue or his patriotism, <persName>Colonel
	      <lb/>Grahame</persName>,</said> returned <persName>Arnold</persName>, who felt the reproof in­
	    <lb/>tended, though he was master of an address too artful
	    <lb/>and consummate, to discover that he did so. <said>A sincere
	      <lb/>and patriotic love of liberty is the motive, which actu­
	      <lb/>ates each one of us, I trust; and though on minor
	      <lb/>points our opinions may vary, the difference can never
	      <lb/>be so essential as to affect the public good. I have
	      <lb/>private wrongs as well as others, <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>;
	      <lb/>but I endeavour to stifle the recollection of them, to for­
	      <lb/>get that men from whom I expected other things, have
	      <lb/>proved themselves ungrateful and unjust. I feel that I
	      <lb/>am the servant of my country, and for her sake I endure
	      <lb/>all; I even see the laurels, which I have ventured life
	      <lb/>to pluck with my own sword from fields deluged in
	      <lb/>blood, encircling the brows of others, and I ask not a
	      <lb/>leaf from the garland I have won, to preserve as a me­
	      <lb/>mento of the past.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> knew that <persName>Arnold</persName> alluded to the
	    <lb/>recent coolness between himself and <persName>General Gates</persName>,
	    <lb/>but anxious to avoid all discussion of the subject, he
	    <lb/>only said,</p>
          <p>
            <said>There are few men, <persName>General Arnold</persName>, who have not
	      <lb/>either real or imaginary injuries to complain of; and
	      <lb/>those whose consciences can bear testimony to the in­
	      <lb/>tegrity of their motives, and the uprightness of their
	      <lb/>conduct, may rise superior to the petty grievances of
	      <lb/>life, and enjoy a serentiy, which neither injustice nor
	      <lb/>ingratitude can destroy. But I must leave you, sir;
	      <lb/>time wears away, and I must be at my quarters before
	      <lb/>night.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>There is time enough, even if you remain another
	      <lb/>half hour,</said> said the General; <said>this cursed leg of mine
	      <lb/>keeps me tied in one position, and so shut out from the
	      <lb/>world, that it is really a deed of charity to indulge me
	      <lb/>with your society.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, however, excused himself, on the
	    <lb/>plea that he must immediately quit <placeName>Albany</placeName>, and, glad
	    <lb/>to be released from the society of a man whose feelings

	    <pb n="123"/><milestone unit="sig" n="11(2)r"/><mw type="pageNum">123</mw><lb/>and left the room. At the door, he met a young officer
	    <lb/>who, having been slightly wounded, was now convales­
	    <lb/>cent.</p>
          <p><said>Ah Colonel,</said> he exclaimed, as <persName>Grahame</persName>, wrapped
	    <lb/>in his own reflections, was passing him, without recog­
	    <lb/>nition, <said>what brings you among us? though I need not
	      <lb/>ask, for I perceive you have been holding a council
	      <lb/>with the gallant General.</said></p>
          <p><said>Gallant!</said> repeated the Colonel, scornfully; <said>call
	      <lb/>him any thing but gallant, <persName>Budworth</persName>; no man is gallant,
	      <lb/>unless he possesses generous and noble qualities.</said></p>
          <p><said>Shall I call him brave then?</said> asked the young
	    <lb/>officer with a smile.</p>
          <p><said>If you please,</said> said <persName>Grahame</persName>. <said>He has a kind of
	      <lb/>animal ferocity, which may pass with some for bravery.
	      <lb/>He loves the battle, for its carnage, and conquest, that he
	      <lb/>may humble and degrade his unfortunate captives. You
	      <lb/>may think me swayed by personal prejudice, <persName>Captain
	      <lb/>Budworth</persName>, but I have just witnessed the display of a
	      <lb/>revengeful and polluted mind, from the recollection of
	      <lb/>which my very soul revolts. But go, I will not detain
	      <lb/>you; go and learn to hate vice, though disguised be­
	      <lb/>neath the becoming garb of patriotism and courage.</said></p>
          <p>The Colonel passed on, as he finished speaking, and
	    <lb/><persName>Captain Budworth</persName>, after a moment's hesitation turned
	    <lb/>to enter the apartment of the wounded General.</p>

          <p><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> reached <placeName>Saratoga</placeName> that evening, and
	    <lb/>on the following morning, as soon as circumstances
	    <lb/>would permit, proceeded to inquire after the health of
	    <lb/><persName>Major Courtland</persName>. <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> was lingering
	    <lb/>about the door, and his face brightened when he saw
	    <lb/>the Colonel approaching.</p>
          <p><said>You are truly welcome,</said> he said, as he advanced
	    <lb/>to meet him; <said>we passed a tiresome day without you,
	      <lb/>yesterday, though in the hope of discerning you in the
	      <lb/>distance, I made a watch-tower of yonder blackened
	      <lb/>tree, and sat demurely perched among its leafless branch­
	      <lb/>es, straining my eyes, like sister <persName>Anne</persName> in the nursery
	      <lb/>tale, looking for the approach of <persName>Blue-beard</persName>.</said></p>
          <p><said>And did you maintain that comfortable station all
	      <lb/>day?</said> asked <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, smiling.</p>
          <p><said>No,</said> returned <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, gravely; <said>that knave of
	      <lb/>a sentinel unfortunately mistook me for the scientific
	      <lb/>biped, vulgarly ycleped the owl, and levelled his musket
	      <lb/>at me; so to save the ruffling of my plumage, and con­
	      <lb/>front the popular belief, that the bird of wisdom never
	      <lb/>flies by day, I vacated my perch, with all convenient
	      <lb/>speed. But come, let us go to the Major; he will not
	      <lb/>forgive me if I detain you a moment longer; to say
	      <lb/>nothing of the fair lady, who has turned her eyes, bright
	      <lb/>with expectation, towards the door, every time it has
	      <lb/>opened, and turned them away again, with a most flat­
	      <lb/>tering look of disappointment, when they encountered
	      <lb/>only the unusually awkward length of visage, which
	      <lb/>I have thought it decorous to wear in complaisance to
	      <lb/>the stranger, since her arrival.</said></p>

          <p><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> smiled at the irrepressible gaiety of
	    <lb/>the Captain; but as they reached the door of <persName>Major
	    <lb/>Courtland's</persName> apartment at this instant, he did not attempt
	    <lb/>a reply. <persName>O'Carroll</persName> rapped gently, and the door was
	    <lb/>opened by <persName>Catherine</persName> herself, who was sitting alone with
	    <lb/>her father. She smiled and blushed as she welcomed
	    <lb/>them, and the Colonel, as he entered, stopped a moment
	    <lb/>to inquire how she found herself after the fatigue of her
	    <lb/>ride. He then followed her to the side of her father's
	    <lb/>bed, who, supported by pillows, sat half upright, and
	    <lb/>his cheerful and animated countenance evinced the ra­
	    <lb/>pidity of his amendment, since the arrival of his daugh­
	    <lb/>ter. He smiled with pleasure as the Colonel approach­
	    <lb/>ed, and extended towards him his hand with an air of
	    <lb/>cordial welcome.</p>
          <p><said>I am, indeed, most happy, sir,</said> said <persName>Grahame</persName>, as he
	    <lb/>pressed it affectionately, <said>to witness this change for
	      <lb/>the better. I scarcely thought, when I last saw you,
	      <lb/>that a whole month of careful nursing would renovate
	      <lb/>your feeble frame, as two short days have done.</said></p>
          <p><said>Under the blessing of God, it is my sweet <persName>Kate</persName>,
	      <lb/>who has restored me,</said> said the Major, turning his eyes,
	    <lb/>full of doting affection, upon the lovely countenance of
	    <lb/>his daughter. <said>Though I did chide her for coming,</said>
	    <lb/>he added <said>her smiles have brought peace and healing
	      <lb/>with them.</said></p>
          <p><said>Ah, dear father!</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, <said>your gentle chid­
	      <lb/>ings were mingled with words of such fond welcome,
	      <lb/>that I regarded them not; and you cannot regret my
	      <lb/>coming, since it has contributed so greatly to my hap­
	      <lb/>piness.</said></p>
          <p><said>I trust I shall have no cause to regret it,</said> said her
	    <lb/>father; <said>should it please Heaven to restore me to
	      <lb/>health, we shall neither of us be detained here much
	      <lb/>longer, probably; for though a prisoner,</said> and a slight
	    <lb/>shade for a moment saddened his countenance at the
	    <lb/>recollection, <said>though a prisoner, I may presume to
	      <lb/>hope my parole will be allowed me.</said></p>
          <p><said>Undoubtedly sir,</said> said <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>; <said>and
	      <lb/>for your sake, as well as for <persName>Miss Courtland's</persName>, I shall feel

	      <lb/>happy, when you can be with safety removed. These
	      <lb/>accommodations are miserable indeed, and I fear, Ma­
	      <lb/>dam, you can scarcely make yourself comfortable in
	      <lb/>them.</said></p>
          <p><said>I am a soldier's daughter, sir; and though,</said> she
	    <lb/>added with a smile, <said>this is the first active service I
	      <lb/>have seen, I find no difficulty in accommodating myself
	      <lb/>to whatever circumstances the fortunes of war may
	      <lb/>render necessary.</said></p>
          <p><said>Do not make yourself uneasy, <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>,</said><lb/>said the Major; <said>we are very commodiously situated,
	      <lb/>and have not a wish ungratified, which the humane
	      <lb/>and courteous attentions of the American officers have
	      <lb/>been able to supply. To them I am deeply indebted,
	      <lb/>but more peculiarly so to you, who have endured my
	      <lb/>pettish infirmities with such manly and generous for­
	      <lb/>bearance, and so kindly shared with my friend <persName>O'Car­
		<lb/>roll</persName>, the cares and attentions which are so soothing and
	      <lb/>grateful in the season of illness and misfortune. The
	      <lb/>hours of my captivity, which I dreaded as the most
	      <lb/>wearisome and humbling of my life, have been cheered
	      <lb/>by your society, and the feeling of degradation, which
	      <lb/>at first nearly overpowered me, has been softened by
	      <lb/>a more intimate acquaintance with the characters of
	      <lb/>our generous conquerors.</said></p>
          <p><said>The American officers, sir,</said> replied <persName>Colonel Gra­
	      <lb/>hame</persName>, <said>are ever desirous to render as easy as possible
	    <lb/>the condition of their prisoners, and in doing so, they
	    <lb/>but obey the dictates of that benevolence which, I am
	    <lb/>proud to think, is characteristic of their nation. The
	    <lb/>trifling attentions which personally I have been so hap­
	    <lb/>py as to bestow, you estimate too highly, sir. You
	    <lb/>know not how much of self there is, in the motive
	    <lb/>which brings me daily to enjoy the society I find in
	    <lb/>this apartment.</said></p>
          <p><said>Ah, sir,</said> exclaimed <persName>Catherine</persName>, no longer able to
	    <lb/>repress her grateful feelings, <said>you cannot hope to per­
	      <lb/>suade us that self was the origin of all those benevo­
	      <lb/>lent actions which have imposed on us such deep and
	      <lb/>lasting obligations. I can never forget that I owe to
	      <pb n="127"/>

	      <mw type="pageNum">127</mw>
	      <lb/>you my father's life, that you have soothed his suffer­
	      <lb/>ings and softened the mortifications of my captured
	      <lb/>countrymen; and, in so doing, have acted like a true
	      <lb/>son of that virtuous band, which is valiantly struggling
	      <lb/>for liberty and life.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> was hurried by excess of feeling into this
	    <lb/>partial avowal of her opinions, and it was not till she
	    <lb/>caught <persName>Captain O'Carroll's</persName> glance of comic surprise,
	    <lb/>that she became conscious of having said any thing,
	    <lb/>which was not consonant with the feelings of all pre­
	    <lb/>sent. The deepest blushes instantly suffused her face;
	    <lb/>but she made an effort to appear unconcerned, and
	    <lb/>looked up with an intention of adding some qualifying
	    <lb/>observation, when she encountered the piercing glance
	    <lb/>of <persName>Colonel Grahame's</persName> dark eyes, fixed full upon her,
	    <lb/>with an expression of astonishment, not unmingled
	    <lb/>with pleasure, and with increased confusion she turned
	    <lb/>towards her father. Embarrasment was visible upon
	    <lb/>his countenance, but a lurking smile betrayed his sym­
	    <lb/>pathy with <persName>Captain O'Carroll's</persName> evident propensity to
	    <lb/>mirth.</p>
          <p><said>You are rightly caught, <persName>Kate</persName>,</said> he said, reading her
	    <lb/>appealing look, and, though half provoked, yet secretly
	    <lb/>compassionating her confusion; <said>you are rightly caught,
	      <lb/>girl; I always told you, your whiggish principles would
	      <lb/>bring you into difficulty, and now my words are veri­
	      <lb/>fied.</said></p>
          <p><said>Father, I am not ashamed of them,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>,
	    <lb/>resolved, since she had inadvertently betrayed them,
	    <lb/>not meanly to retract the avowal; <said>I never yet disown­
	      <lb/>ed them, and you would have cause to blush for me,
	      <lb/>were I to deny them now, in presence of their brave
	      <lb/>defender, to whom we owe so much.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> bowed low, and colored with ex­
	    <lb/>cess of pleasure. <said>It increases my confidence in the
	      <lb/>justice of my cause,</said> he said, <said>to find it espoused by
	      <lb/>the lovely and virtuous of your sex, <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>.
	      <lb/>The soldier's arm is nerved with fresh valor by the
	      <lb/>smiles and encouragements of woman, whose gentle but
	      <lb/>unshaken constancy cheers him in dangers, and sup­

	      <mw type="pageNum">128</mw>
	      <lb/>ports him in difficulties, from which his bolder but less
	      <lb/>enduring courage would otherwise shrink.</said></p>
          <p><said>I espouse no cause, sir,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, blushing;
	    <lb/><said>and I regret that the feelings of the moment should
	      <lb/>have betrayed me into any expression indicative of the
	      <lb/>opinions I may entertain respecting the quarrel, which
	      <lb/>now agitates this unhappy country. But I will not
	      <lb/>disavow the sentiments I have incautiously uttered, nor
	      <lb/>deny that the land which has sheltered me from infan­
	      <lb/>cy, is the land of my affection, and a hundred times
	      <lb/>endeared to me by the free and noble spirit, with
	      <lb/>which she rises in her might, to shake off the thraldom
	      <lb/>of oppression.</said></p>
          <p><said><persName>Catherine</persName>, <persName>Catherine</persName>, say no more, if you love
	      <lb/>me,</said> exclaimed <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, in an accent of dis­
	    <lb/>pleasure. <said>Methinks your prejudices have acquired
	      <lb/>new strength, instead of softening, towards the cause
	      <lb/>which your father honors.</said></p>
          <p><said>Pardon me, dearest father,</said> she replied; <said>but do
	      <lb/>not degrade, by the name of prejudices, those gentle
	      <lb/>affections which you yourself implanted in my infant
	      <lb/>bosom. <placeName>America</placeName> has loved and cherished every thing
	      <lb/>which is dear to me. Even the simple wild flowers,
	      <lb/>which I have gathered in her forests, seemed to me
	      <lb/>fairer and more fragrant than the rarest exotics, which
	      <lb/>were brought from other climes; and how often have
	      <lb/>you smiled upon me when I said, I love these wild blos­
	      <lb/>soms because they have expanded in the air of my
	      <lb/>country, and been nurtured in the soil of the brave.
	      <lb/>Dear father,</said> she continued, forgetting, in the enthusi­
	    <lb/>asm of the moment, the presence of those who were
	    <lb/>gazing in silent admiration on the impassioned elo­
	    <lb/>quence of her glowing countenance; <said>dear father,
	      <lb/>every event of my life links me, with fond associations,
	      <lb/>to this land; its rivers, its forests, its mountains, every
	      <lb/>feature of its lovely landscapes are like those of a dear
	      <lb/>familiar friend, whom death itself cannot shut from the
	      <lb/>affections and the memory. How then can I wish evil
	      <lb/>to her cause! How, when I speak of her afflictions,
	      <lb/>can I repress the feelings which overflow my heart!</said></p>

          <p><said>Go, go, you are an enthusiast, <persName>Kate</persName>,</said> said her father,
	    <lb/>touched by her earnest appeal, but striving to resist its
	    <lb/>influence. <said>Your fond, foolish sex have always some
	      <lb/>darling theme to rave about, and it is fortunate for us,
	      <lb/>that your fancies are only suffered to waste themselves
	      <lb/>in words, or the world would be kept forever in an up­
	      <lb/>roar.</said></p>
          <p><said>Alas! dear father,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, laughing, <said>since
	      <lb/>it is the only way in which they are permitted to waste
	      <lb/>themselves, we may be pardoned for making a good
	      <lb/>use of our privelege; though, I think, were we less limit­
	      <lb/>ed, we should soon disprove the assertions of those
	      <lb/>who predict misrule and anarchy, as a necessary con­
	      <lb/>sequence of suffering us to exercise power.</said></p>
          <p><said>The prediction has stood the test of experience,
	      <lb/><persName>Kate</persName>,</said> said the Major; <said>we have only to look into the
	      <lb/>history of the past, to see it verified in a hundred in­
	      <lb/>stances.</said></p>
          <p><said>In a thousand, Major, you should have said,</said> ex­
	    <lb/>claimed <persName>O'Carroll</persName>;
	    <said><quote><lg type="poem" subtype="indeterminate"><l>Who lost <persName>Mark Antony</persName> the world? a woman.</l><l>Who was the cause of a long ten years' war,</l><l>And laid at last old <placeName>Troy</placeName> in ashes? a woman.</l></lg></quote></said></p>
          <p><said>I thought you a more gallant man, <persName>Captain O'Car­

	      <lb/>upon that sex, who are the inspirers of the soldier's
	      <lb/>courage, and the rewarders of his toil and danger.</said></p>
          <p><said>I thought so too, <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>,</said> said <persName>Cathe­
	      <lb/>rine</persName>, <said>and should not have expected my father to have
	      <lb/>found a supporter of his opinions, in a native of your
	      <lb/>island, whose sons, with such frank courage, are ever
	      <lb/>ready to draw the sword in our defence.</said></p>
          <p><said>And none, madam, will be found more ready than

	      <lb/>policy often dictates measures, at which the feelings
	      <lb/>revolt. An occasional skirmish between our pickets
	      <lb/>may possibly prevent the danger of my defection; but
	      <lb/>in case of a long armistice, I greatly fear my loyalty
	      <lb/>may be shaken by the eloquence, which none can hear

	      <lb/>unmoved, and I would not, for the honor of my profes­
	      <lb/>sion, prove a traitor at this crisis.</said></p>
          <p><said>I use no efforts to make traitors, I assure you, <persName>Cap­
		<lb/>tain O'Carroll,</persName>,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>; <said>nor would I be thought
	      <lb/>a partisan, because I love my country, and speak warm­
	      <lb/>ly in its behalf.</said></p>
          <p><said>Not a partisan, but a patriot, madam,</said> said <persName>O'Car­
	      <lb/>roll</persName>; <said>and there is fascination even in the name.</said></p>
          <p><said>Yes,</said> said the Major, <said>to <name>Irishmen</name> who love re­
	      <lb/>bellion, and are always getting up some lawless riot,
	      <lb/>there is a charm in any thing which is a signal for fight­
	      <lb/>ing and revolt.</said></p>
          <p><said>Though some of us even forego the pleasure of a
	      <lb/>riot, for the honor of fighting under the banners of loy­
	      <lb/>alty,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, in a tone half playful and half
	    <lb/>reproachful.</p>
          <p><said>Indeed you do,</said> returned the Major, <said>and there
	      <lb/>are none, my dear fellow, more brave and zealous than
	      <lb/>yourself in the good cause.</said></p>
          <p><said>There are none more loyal, I can truly say,</said> re­

	      <lb/>and wounds, and disgraces, should now yield to the

          <p><said>That is not half I would say, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,</said> returned

          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> had been conversing apart with <persName>Colonel
	    <lb/>Grahame</persName>, but her attention was caught by hearing her
	    <lb/>own name, and, turning with a playful air towards her
	    <lb/>father, she said,</p>
          <p>
            <said>And am I to be banished, father, lest <persName>Captain
		<lb/>O'Carroll</persName> should break his faith? I will endure any

	      <lb/>penance rather than incur so unwelcome a sentence;
	      <lb/>I will even immure myself, when he is present, in
	      <lb/>what <persName>Martha</persName> terms our cell, if my absence is necessary
	      <lb/>to avert the apprehended danger.</said>
          </p>
          <p>She retreated a few steps towards a small apartment,
	    <lb/>or rather large closet, where a bed for herself and one
	    <lb/>for her attendant had been placed, when <persName>Colonel Gra­
	      <lb/>hame</persName> catching a view of its interior, exclaimed with a
	    <lb/>look of mortification,</p>
          <p>
            <said>A cell indeed! <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>, and of dimensions
	      <lb/>so narrow that I greatly fear you could enjoy no repose
	      <lb/>in its stifled atmosphere.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>It is but for a short time that she will have to oc­
	      <lb/>cupy it,</said> said the Major; <said>as, unless she chooses to get
	      <lb/>a commission under <persName>General Gates</persName>, we shall soon, I
	      <lb/>trust, be at liberty to quit this place. But the foolish
	      <lb/>thing,</said> he added, looking fondly at her, <said>might have
	      <lb/>rested very well, had she not chosen rather to hover
	      <lb/>round my bed half the night, though I constantly urged
	      <lb/>her to retire. But I am not the worse for it; she strew­
	      <lb/>ed my pillow with flowers, and inspired me with happy
	      <lb/>dreams; though I fear she has not been benefited by her
	      <lb/>wakefulness.</said></p>
          <p><said>I slept very well, my dear father,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>,
	    <lb/><said>and was only once or twice by your bed side, to know
	      <lb/>if you wanted any thing. If all were as well accom­
	      <lb/>modated as myself, they would have no cause for com­
	      <lb/>plaint; but I fear <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> has reason to wish
	      <lb/>me again beneath the Dutch-tiled roof of <persName>Richard Hope</persName>,
	      <lb/>since I have obliged him to vacate your apartment and
	      <lb/>seek a lodging elsewhere.</said></p>
          <p><said>I found a very good one hard by,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,
	    <lb/><said>and slept without disturbance. A soldier's life, <persName>Miss
	      <lb/>Courtland</persName>, is one of constant mutation, and he be­

	      <lb/>them, even when they happen for the worse.</said></p>

          <p><said>Yes,</said> returned <persName>O'Carroll</persName> <said>I recollect when the
	      <lb/>army was at <placeName>Skenesborough</placeName>, we had many of us, for
	      <lb/>some reason, changed our quarters, and I was awaken­
	      <lb/>ed the first morning after doing so, by a most unceremo­
	      <lb/>nious shake. On looking up to learn the meaning of
	      <lb/>this unprovoked attack, I saw that automaton of a sur­
	      <lb/>geon, Major, who, you know, was attached to <persName>Harcourt's</persName>
	      <lb/>corps, and who walked about, without knowing that he
	      <lb/>did so, and examined his patients, when he had any,
	      <lb/>without seeing them, standing by my bedside with his
	      <lb/><persName>Cyclops</persName> eye, for he had but one, and that, if I recollect
	      <lb/>right, was in the centre</said>—</p>
          <p><said>Be less ridiculous, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,</said> interrupted <persName>Major
	    <lb/>Courtland</persName>, <said>and give us the story, if there is one, with
	      <lb/>fewer embellishments.</said></p>
          <p><said>This <persName>Polyphemus</persName>, Major,</said> pursued the Captain,
	    <lb/>with a smile, <said>held forth a pair of iron tongs, almost
	      <lb/>as uncouth as himself. I had been reading the story of
	      <lb/><persName>Ulysses</persName> and his companions, till late, on the preceding
	      <lb/>evening, my dreams had been impressed with their
	      <lb/>adventures, and as between sleeping and waking I gaz­
	      <lb/>ed on the horrible apparatus of the surgeon, I verily
	      <lb/>thought the monster of the cavern stood before me, and
	      <lb/>that my turn to be devoured had arrived.</said></p>
          <p><said>But I never heard before,</said> said <persName>Major Courtland</persName>,
	    <lb/><said>that this renowned <persName>Cyclops</persName> of old, made use of any
	      <lb/>apparatus to dissect his victims, before demolishing them.</said></p>
          <p><said>Oh, <emph>he</emph> might not,</said> returned <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, <said>but you
	      <lb/>must recollect that this was a modern <persName>Polyphemus</persName> of
	      <lb/>whom I speak, and who, like us, had improved in the
	      <lb/>humane art of devouring people; at all events, he began
	      <lb/>with appalling solemnity to advance his twisted tongs
	      <lb/>towards my visage, which completely aroused me, and
	      <lb/>him too, I think; for in the flight, which I caused them
	      <lb/>to take in an opposite direction, they grazed the project­
	      <lb/>ing angle of his proboscis, with a force which threatened
	      <lb/>to annihilate a portion of that conspicuous promontory,
	      <lb/>and, stretching open his huge eye in utter amazement,
	      <lb/>he begged to be informed if I did not wish to have a
	      <lb/>tooth extracted. I threatened to make him swallow all
	      <pb n="133"/>

	      <mw type="pageNum">133</mw>
	      <lb/>his own, if he did not evacuate my tent with what speed
	      <lb/>he could make; and then first discovering that I was not
	      <lb/>the mannerly ensign, who had before occupied the
	      <lb/>place and requested his attendance, he jostled off, with
	      <lb/>all convenient haste, and, by the time he was out of
	      <lb/>sight, had forgotten, I dare say, but what he left me as
	      <lb/>toothless as old <persName>Peter</persName> the drummer.</said></p>
          <p><said>A most edifying narration, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,</said> said the
	    <lb/>Major, <said>and told with becoming gravity, though my
	      <lb/>saucy <persName>Kate</persName> looks rather sceptical, and even <persName>Colonel
	      <lb/>Grahame</persName> smiles somewhat incredulously.</said></p>
          <p><said>If they wish for ocular demonstration of my
	      <lb/>veracity,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, <said>I doubt not the proboscis of
	      <lb/>the surgeon will afford it to them; for the mark of the
	      <lb/>tooth-drawer, I think, has left an indelible impression
	      <lb/>upon that unwieldy organ.</said></p>
          <p><said>Oh, your recital is too amusing to be doubted,
	      <lb/>Captain,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>Or if it were not,</said> said <persName>Grahame</persName>, <said>its ingenuity
	      <lb/>would readily atone for its extravagance.<choice><sic>”</sic><corr/></choice> But time
	    <lb/>has passed so pleasantly here, <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, that
	      <lb/>we have quite forgotten our intended walk, and the
	      <lb/>morning is so fine, I am desirous to have you improve
	      <lb/>it. If you are inclined to enjoy the exercise, I shall
	      <lb/>be happy to accompany you.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> assented, and bidding <persName>Major Court­
	      <lb/>land</persName> and his daughter good morning, they went out
	    <lb/>together.</p>

          <p>That part of <placeName>New York</placeName> which in the year <date when="1777">1777</date> was
	    <lb/>the scene of contest between the two experienced
	    <lb/>generals, <persName>Burgoyne</persName> and <persName>Gates</persName>, exhibited at that period
	    <lb/>few marks of cultivation or improvement, except such
	    <lb/>as might be occasionally observed around the log hut
	    <lb/>of some enterprising settler, who had ventured to in­
	    <lb/>vade the solitary wilderness. The remains of several
	    <lb/>forts also, on the borders of those mighty rivers and
	    <lb/>inland seas, which intersect our country with a magnifi­
	    <lb/>cence and grandeur, unknown in any other region of
	    <lb/>the globe, gave evidence that restless and destroying
	    <lb/>man had early tracked the untilled soil with steps of
	    <lb/>blood, and awakened the startled echoes of this new
	    <lb/>world, with the discord of his mad ambition.</p>
          <p>Villages and towns now rise on the site of those
	    <lb/>forests which, forty-five years since, witnessed the fierce
	    <lb/>encounter of two adverse armies; and churches, and
	    <lb/>seminaries for the instruction of future patriots and
	    <lb/>statesmen, occupy the spot, where the cruel savage
	    <lb/>immolated his unfortunate captive, or performed the
	    <lb/>superstitious rites of his untutored worship. The
	    <lb/>frowning wilderness has become a scene of gaiety and
	    <lb/>splendor, where the bloom and brightness of beauty,
	    <lb/>the enchanting vagaries of fashion, and the luxurious
	    <lb/>reginements of wealth, unite their witching influence;
	    <lb/>where the graceful dance, the ravishment of music, and
	    <lb/>every varying pleasure, which invention can devise,
	    <lb/>conspire to charm away the hours of the gay and idle
	    <lb/>throng, who annually resort to taste the far-famed
	    <lb/>waters of <placeName>Saratoga</placeName>.</p>

          <p>Nor can the foot of the <name>American</name> press this soil,
	    <lb/>mingled, as it is, with the dust of the great and the
	    <lb/>brave, without a thrill of national pride, as he recalls
	    <lb/>the events of the year so glorious in the annals of his
	    <lb/>country, and which have shed a tinge of romantic, we
	    <lb/>had almost said of classic interest over the wild scenery
	    <lb/>of the north.</p>
          <p>At no great distance from the house at present occu­
	    <lb/>pied by <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, was a beautiful glen, which
	    <lb/>continued, for nearly half a mile, to wind through the
	    <lb/>intricacies of the forest. Its banks rose precipitously,
	    <lb/>and were thickly clothed with shrubbery, while their
	    <lb/>summits were crowned with stately trees, among which
	    <lb/>the pine, towering magnificently to the height of seven­
	    <lb/>ty and a hundred feet, was chiefly conspicuous, though
	    <lb/>others, less aspiring, were freely interspersed, which
	    <lb/>stretched their leafy arms across the narrow glen, and
	    <lb/>inter<choice><sic>v</sic><corr>w</corr></choice>ove their branches so as to form an almost imper­
	    <lb/>vious canopy. A brawling rivulet, swollen by the recent
	    <lb/>rains, gave freshness to the spot, and soothed the ear with
	    <lb/>the music of its gushing waters, as it foamed impetuous­
	    <lb/>ly over the little obstacles which marked its course, im­
	    <lb/>patient to pour its tributary stream into the bosom of
	    <lb/>the lordly <placeName>Hudson</placeName>; while a thousand dancing leaves,
	    <lb/>the spoils of autumn, gay with the colors of the rain­
	    <lb/>bow, floated on its surface, seeming to the eye of fancy,
	    <lb/>like fairy barks, speeding on their voyage to regions of
	    <lb/>brighter warmth and beauty.</p>
          <p>It was on the evening succeeding the memorable
	    <lb/><date when="1777-10-17">seventeenth of <name>October</name></date>, when the final surrender of
	    <lb/><persName>General Burgoyne</persName> had crowned the victorious gallan­
	    <lb/>try of his brave adversary with honor, that two person­
	    <lb/>ages of our narrative met in this lonely glen. The sun
	    <lb/>was declining with a mild splendor unusual to the sea­
	    <lb/>son, and his rays, as they glanced through the gay
	    <lb/>autumnal foliage upon the still green turf of the shelter­
	    <lb/>ed little valley, and crimsoned the foam of the spark­
	    <lb/>ling rivulet, seemed to promise, on the morrow, one of
	    <lb/>those soft and balmy days which, at this period of the
	    <pb n="136"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="12(2)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">136</mw>
	    <lb/>year, are not unfrequent in our climate, and come with
	    <lb/>all the sweet and healing influences of spring, to refresh
	    <lb/>and animate the spirits.</p>
          <p>The persons, of whom we speak walked slowly up
	    <lb/>the glen, one of them, the taller of the two, often stop­
	    <lb/>ping and looking upward, and around, as if to inhale
	    <lb/>the fragrance which floated on the air, and enjoy the
	    <lb/>serenity which reigned throughout the scene. The
	    <lb/>dark blue dress and crimson facings announced an
	    <lb/>American officer; and the gestures, so full of ease and
	    <lb/>military grace, the proud decisive step, the quick
	    <lb/>glancing of the eagle eye, the lofy motion of the war­
	    <lb/>rior's crest, identified the admired and gallant <persName>Colonel
	    <lb/>Grahame</persName>.</p>
          <p>Beside him walked his Indian friend, <persName>Ohmeina</persName>,
	    <lb/>decked out in savage pomp. Yet in his barbarous
	    <lb/>attire there was a mixture of tasteful elegance, that
	    <lb/>harmonized well with his finefigure and noble and ex­
	    <lb/>pressive countenance. His moccasins of deer skin,
	    <lb/>were richly embroidered with the quills of the porcu­
	    <lb/>pine, and the sort of <mcr>kilt</mcr>, or short petticoat, which reach­
	    <lb/>ed to his knees, was formed of the same materials, and
	    <lb/>ornamented in a similar manner. Several strings of
	    <lb/>wampum were suspended round his neck, intermixed
	    <lb/>with ornaments of silver, and beads of various colors.
	    <lb/>His long black hair was parted on his forehead, and
	    <lb/>decorated with a plume of eagle feathers. Over his
	    <lb/>right shoulder was thrown a cloak, or robe, formed of
	    <lb/>the plumage of birds, and glittering with a thousand
	    <lb/>vivid colors; and on his left was fastened a quiver, well
	    <lb/>filled with arrows which he would never consent to ex­
	    <lb/>change for the musket or the rifle, though they were
	    <lb/>becoming in common use among his brethren of the
	    <lb/>forest, by whom they were eagerly and gladly received.
	    <lb/>He carried his bow in his hand, and walked with an
	    <lb/>air of grave dignity beside the Colonel, though with so
	    <lb/>light a step, that he scarcely depressed the slender
	    <lb/>blade, which bent but for an instant beneath his elastic
	    <lb/>tread.</p>

          <p>Suddenly breaking from the meditations which had,
	    <lb/>for some time, deeply absorbed him, <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>
	    <lb/>turned abruptly towards the chief, and glancing his
	    <lb/>quick eye over his person said, after a moment's obser­
	    <lb/>vation,</p>
          <p>
            <said>Methinks, <persName>Ohmeina</persName>, you are adorned with more
	      <lb/>than usual care this evening; needlessly so, at least, con­
	      <lb/>sidering the toils and, perhaps, the perils of the journey
	      <lb/>you are about to undertake.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>The toils are nothing, brother,</said> answered the
	    <lb/><name>Indian</name>; <said>the perils many, and it is therefore that I
	      <lb/>have thus adorned myself. I will die in the faith
	      <lb/>which I have learned from the people of thy nation;
	      <lb/>but I would meet death, in the dress which becomes a
	      <lb/>warrior of the <name>Mohawks</name>.</said></p>
          <p><said>Then, <persName>Ohmeina</persName>,</said> said the Colonel, <said>you are
	      <lb/>adorned only like a victim for the sacrifice. I will not
	      <lb/>be the means of endangering your life, and, if you ap­
	      <lb/>prehend so much peril, this journey must not be per­
	      <lb/>formed.</said></p>
          <p><said>I fear nothing, brother,</said> returned the chief;
	    <lb/><said>there are no dangers, which I have not braved a
	      <lb/>thousand times. And shall the foot of <persName>Ohmeina</persName> fear
	      <lb/>to tread the mazes of the forest, to climb the steep
	      <lb/>precipice, or ford the swollen torrent, when it is the
	      <lb/>voice of his friend and his avenger, which bids him
	      <lb/>go?</said></p>
          <p><said>Yes,</said> answered <persName>Grahame</persName>, <said>if there is danger in
	      <lb/>the path, your life must not be sacrificed. I cannot
	      <lb/>suffer you to tempt it.</said></p>
          <p><said>Brother,</said> said the <name>Indian</name>, proudly, <said>the warriors
	      <lb/>of the <name>Mohawks</name> know not fear, and never shrink from
	      <lb/>the open or the secret foe. These arrows are dipped
	      <lb/>in deadly poison, and they seldom miss their aim.
	      <lb/>But if they should, what have I to care? Death is not
	      <lb/>terrible to me; for thy religion has taught me to hope,
	      <lb/>that, when it is past, I shall meet my <persName>Yurac</persName> and be
	      <lb/>happy with her, in the bright blue heaven which is
	      <lb/>above us.</said></p>

          <p><said>And so I trust you will, <persName>Ohmeina</persName>,</said> replied the
	    <lb/>Colonel; <said>but still it would be wrong to throw away
	      <lb/>the life, which God has given you. But tell me, if you
	      <lb/>have heard any thing that threatens your safety.</said></p>
          <p><said>My brethren of the forest may entrap me,</said> said
	    <lb/>the Chief; <said>they lie in wait for me, and are thirsting
	      <lb/>for my blood.</said></p>
          <p><said>How know you this?</said> inquired <persName>Grahame</persName>, earnestly.</p>
          <p><said>The soldier whom we met at the log house in the
	      <lb/>forest, and bribed to betray his comrades,</said> answered
	    <lb/><persName>Ohmeina</persName>, <said>bade me beware of the vengeance of <persName>Ka­
		<lb/>maset</persName>, for the torture was prepared, and my footsteps
	      <lb/>were watched.</said></p>
          <p><said><persName>Ohmeina</persName>, this warning must not be disregarded,</said><lb/>said the Colonel. <said>Neither your poisoned arrows,
	      <lb/>your courage, nor you<choice><sic/><corr>r</corr></choice> strength, will avail you against
	      <lb/>the cunning ferocity of these bloodthirsty savages, who
	      <lb/>hate you for your friendship to us, and are resolved
	      <lb/>upon your death. No, I cannot permit you to endan­
	      <lb/>ger your life, for my sake; we will defer this journey,
	      <lb/><persName>Ohmeina</persName>, till it can be performed with more safety.</said></p>
          <p><said>Brother, suffer me to go,</said> said the <name>Indian</name>; <said>those
	      <lb/>to whom thou wouldst send me, may require my servi­
	      <lb/>ces, and thou knowest not how long before thou wilt
	      <lb/>be with them thyself. Thy friend is feeble with sick­
	      <lb/>ness, and his weak arm cannot bring the soaring bird
	      <lb/>to earth, nor pierce the swift beast of the forest, which
	      <lb/>falls only beneath the skillful arrow of the wary hunter.
	      <lb/>And the fair lily too, thinkest thou she will not droop,
	      <lb/>because our steps return no more to her? Detain me
	      <lb/>not, brother; I fear no snares, I have the sharp eye of
	      <lb/>the hawk, and thou knowest I am fleet and sure as the
	      <lb/>young deer of the wilderness. Bid me then haste on
	      <lb/>my way; the lily will not revive, till I bear her tidings
	      <lb/>of thee.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> colored slightly, but said after a
	    <lb/>momentary pause,</p>
          <p>
            <said>Go then, <persName>Ohmeina</persName>; I know you may walk safely,
	      <lb/>where it would be death for another to venture. I can
	      <lb/>only commend you to the protection of Heaven, and

	      <lb/>entreat you to be cautious and vigilant. I have many
	      <lb/>fears for those to whom I send you, and, as I know
	      <lb/>not how long before I may return to them, your service
	      <lb/>may be indispensable during my absence. Had you
	      <lb/>continued on your way, when I sent you before, the
	      <lb/>journey at this wet season might have been avoided.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>And did I not do better service, brother,</said> asked
	    <lb/>the chief, <said>in bringing to thee the papers, which
	      <lb/><persName>Richard Hope</persName> would have sent to the <name>English</name>?</said></p>
          <p><said>You did, indeed, <persName>Ohmeina</persName>,</said> replied the Colonel;
	    <lb/><said>and, by that act, gave me a proof of your zeal and
	      <lb/>fidelity, which I shall not soon forget. Those papers
	      <lb/>were invaluable, and you effectually frightened the
	      <lb/><name>Quaker</name> out of his treasonable projects; I only regret­
	      <lb/>ted, on your account, that your journey was de­
	      <lb/>layed till now.</said></p>
          <p><said>Brother,</said> said the <name>Indian</name>, <said>the skies are bright,
	      <lb/>the winds soft; <persName>Ohmeina's</persName> eye is keen, his step light
	      <lb/>and fleet, and before three nights have passed he will
	      <lb/>stand beside the grey rock, and refresh, with tidings of
	      <lb/>peace, the wan lily which blooms under its shelter.</said></p>
          <p><said>Guard well the papers, with which I have charged
	      <lb/>you,</said> said the Colonel, <said>and destroy them if they are
	      <lb/>endangered. And now, God speed you on your way;
	      <lb/>I hear footsteps approaching, and you must be gone.</said></p>
          <p>They had once measured the length of the glen, and
	    <lb/>returned again to where it opened upon a cleared
	    <lb/>space, from which the trees had been felled, for the
	    <lb/>use of fuel to the camp. The glowing tints of twilight
	    <lb/>were fading into the grey and sombre hue of darkness,
	    <lb/>yet sufficient light still remained, to render visible the
	    <lb/>surrounding objects, when, as they stopped beneath the
	    <lb/>jutting crag of a rock, which half hid the entrance to
	    <lb/>the narrow glen, and the <name>Indian</name> was about to reply to
	    <lb/>the injunction of his friend, his quick eye caught a
	    <lb/>glimpse of some one approaching; and, pressing the
	    <lb/>Colonel's hand for a moment to his heart, in token that
	    <lb/>he would obey him, he sprang to the top of the bank
	    <lb/>and disappeared among the thick trees of the forest.</p>

          <p><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> turned, as the chief quitted him
	    <lb/>to examine the person of the intruder, who had now
	    <lb/>approached within a few paces of him, when the gay
	    <lb/>voice of <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> at once terminated the
	    <lb/>uncertainty with which he had, for a few moments,
	    <lb/>regarded him.</p>
          <p><said>I hope I am not so unfortunate, Colonel, as to in­
	      <lb/>terrupt a gentle tete-a-tete,</said> he said, archly. <said>Nay,</said> he
	    <lb/>continued, as <persName>Grahame</persName> was about to speak, <said>never deny
	      <lb/>it, man; I heard the rustling of her robes, as I approach­
	      <lb/>ed, and even now the branches wave, through which
	      <lb/>she so hastily forced her retreat.</said></p>
          <p><said>I assure you,</said> returned the Colonel with a smile,
	    <lb/><said>I have no idea of denying that you interrupted a tete-
	      <lb/>a-tete, though not exactly such an one as you seem to
	      <lb/>imagine.</said></p>
          <p><said>Ah, ha, Colonel,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, <said>this witching
	      <lb/>glen seems made on purpose for tender meetings. I
	      <lb/>might have caught a glimpse of the enchantress, had I
	      <lb/>not, in my haste, unluckily tripped over one of the
	      <lb/>devilish stumps, which are left on purpose, I think, to
	      <lb/>endanger the necks of honest fellows in the dark.</said></p>
          <p><said>Your haste was peculiarly ill-judged to-night, <persName>Cap­
	      <lb/>tain O'Carroll</persName>,</said> said the Colonel, laughing, <said>and will
	      <lb/>teach you to use more moderation the next time you sit
	      <lb/>at the table until it is too dark to see your way from
	      <lb/>it.</said></p>
          <p><said>Ah, Colonel,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, <said>I believe you are
	      <lb/>right, and that the stumps were less to blame than the
	      <lb/>bottle, after all. To confess the truth, I have been
	      <lb/>dining to-day with half a dozen merry fellows, whom
	      <lb/>this surrender has thrown in my way again, and who
	      <lb/>were resolved I should make amends for my unusual
	      <lb/>abstinence this ten days past; so just to oblige them,
	      <lb/>I drained a glass or two extra, till my head began to
	      <lb/>revolve like the wheel of a scissors-grinder, when I
	      <lb/>broke away from their toasts and chorusses, and came
	      <lb/>out to shake off the fumes of the wine, in the cool air.
	      <lb/>And I thought that cursed somerset over the pine stump
	      <lb/>yonder, had completely restored me to my sober senses

	      <lb/>again; though it seems your penetrating eye, Colonel,
	      <lb/>has detected traces of the recent revel, which I fancied
	      <lb/>were quite dissipated. But I have honestly confessed;
	      <lb/>so now it is your turn; and will you please inform
	      <lb/>me who the damsel was, that fled so hastily at my ap­
	      <lb/>proach? Perhaps some wood-nymph, or water naiad;
	      <lb/>or what is far more probable, a mere <quote>mortal mixture of
		<lb/>earth's mould,</quote> who has surrendered at discretion to the
	      <lb/>prowess of the conquering <persName>Grahame</persName>.</said></p>
          <p><said>It was in truth,</said> answered the Colonel, <said>only a
	      <lb/><quote>mortal mixture of earth's mould,</quote> and not her finest
	      <lb/>mould either, mere potter's clay, dark and unpolished.</said></p>
          <p><said>Ah, a nut-brown nymph! The princess of one of
	      <lb/>those log castles, I will vouch for it,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>.
	    <lb/><said>But I dare swear she had

	      <lb/>in despite of her sun-burnt complexion; or she might
	      <lb/>have hung herself upon the highest log of her castle,
	      <lb/>ere she would have won a single glance from the fas­
	      <lb/>tidious Colonel.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Grahame</persName> saw that the Captain was much excited, or
	    <lb/>he would not have brooked the most distant hint of a
	    <lb/>suspicion so inconsistent with his high feelings of honor,
	    <lb/>so averse from his principles and his practice. In his
	    <lb/>estimation, the virtue of the simplest maiden, whose
	    <lb/>humble lot was cast in the depths of poverty and ob­
	    <lb/>scurity, was as sacred, as that of the elegant and high-
	    <lb/>bred females, who graced the polished circles of wealth
	    <lb/>and fashion; and to have made himself master of the
	    <lb/>world, he would not have trifled a moment with the
	    <lb/>affections of the most lowly cottager, at the expense of
	    <lb/>her future peace and happiness. He was not, however,
	    <lb/>so foolish as to resent the light raillery of the Captain;
	    <lb/>and, answering him in his own manner, he said,</p>
          <p>
            <said>And what if I should tell you, <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>,
	      <lb/>that your eyes, as well as your feet, have betrayed you;
	      <lb/>and that this fair vision, whom you have dignified with

	      <lb/>and cares for that of no woman?</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>Absurd!</said> exclaimed <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>tell me no such
	      <lb/>thing, for I will not believe that you have left the gay
	      <lb/>and bustling camp, and sought this lonely glen to hold
	      <lb/><emph>sweet converse</emph> with a fellow of six feet and more, who flies
	      <lb/>at the sound of footsteps, with the fleetness of a <persName>Camilla</persName>,
	      <lb/>and whom you soliloquize, for half an hour after, with all
	      <lb/>the passion of an ancient knight of romance</said>――</p>
          <p><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> interrupted him with a loud laugh;
	    <lb/><said>Upon my honor,</said> he said, <said>your imagination is
	      <lb/>imbued with the very essence of the sparkling cham­
	      <lb/>paigne, which you have quaffed so freely, and has trans­
	      <lb/>formed the swarthy <name>Indian</name> <persName>Ohmeina</persName>, with his savage
	      <lb/>ornaments of beads and feathers, into a matchless dam­
	      <lb/>sel, rivalling the exquisite <persName>Dulcinea del Toboso</persName> herself,
	      <lb/>for whom another knight errant, were there one to be
	      <lb/>found in these degenerate and unchivalrous days, might
	      <lb/>be proud to fight all the windmills in the country.</said></p>
          <p><said>The <name>Indian</name> <persName>Ohmeina</persName> indeed!</said> ejaculated <persName>O'Car­
	      <lb/>roll</persName>, incredulously; then, after a brief pause, passing
	    <lb/>his arm through the Colonel's, he added, <said>come, let us
	      <lb/>walk up this glen; it is scarcely dark yet, and the sound
	      <lb/>of this babbling rivulet cools my feverish brain. And
	      <lb/>now tell me, Colonel, if you are not deceiving me?
	      <lb/>Though to be sure it is no concern of mine; but if ever
	      <lb/>I saw a woman's petticoat in my life, I could take my
	      <lb/>oath it was while I lay grappling with those devilish
	      <lb/>stumps yonder.</said></p>
          <p><said>In very truth then,</said> returned the Colonel, <said>it was
	      <lb/>the <name>Indian</name> <persName>Ohmeina</persName> himself, and no one fairer or more
	      <lb/>feminine. And now tell me if you have seen <persName>Major
	      <lb/>Courtland</persName> to day?</said></p>
          <p><said>Only for a few minutes in the morning,</said> said

	    <said rend="pre()"><choice><sic/><corr>“</corr></choice>I should have gone directly there this

	      <lb/>Colonel; and I had no mind to be reprimanded before

	      <lb/>in fact, I believe he dined there. He is a resistless

	      <lb/>onel, in the good graces of <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>, if you pass
	      <lb/>your evenings in this dark glen, and suffer him to charm
	      <lb/>her solitude, with all his eloquence of eye and tongue.</said></p>
          <p><said>And what then,</said> asked <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, with ap­
	    <lb/>parent carelessness. <said>I have made no pretensions to
	      <lb/>the lady's favor, and, of course, cannot fear to be super­
	      <lb/>seded.</said></p>
          <p><said>You have as yet made none,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>but
		<lb/>that is no evidence that you never design to do so; nor
		<lb/>does it prove that you are not already high in the lady's
		<lb/>estimation. I wish only to place you on your guard,
		<lb/>Colonel; for a gem so beautiful will not remain long
		<lb/>unappropriated, and I know of none more worthy to
		<lb/>wear it than yourself.</said></p>
          <p><said>Thank you, <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>; indeed you are truly
	      <lb/>disinterested,</said> exclaimed <persName>Grahame</persName>, his fine features
	    <lb/>crimsoning with pleasurable emotion. <said>But how can
	      <lb/>I be assured, that, while, according to your directions,
	      <lb/>I am endeavouring to rival <persName>Colonel Percy</persName>, I may not, if
	      <lb/>successful, disappoint you also, in the affections of a
	      <lb/>lady, for whom I have repeatedly heard you profess the
	      <lb/>warmest admiration?</said></p>
          <p><said>If I were so deeply interested, think you I should
	      <lb/>bestow this advice unasked?</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>. <said>No;
	      <lb/>combustible as my Irish nature may appear to you, Col­
	      <lb/>onel, my heart is not of such tinder as to be kindled by
	      <lb/>every stray glance from the bright eyes of a pretty
	      <lb/>maiden; they warm the surface but penetrate no deep­
	      <lb/>er; the core is adamant, and, having <quote>twice or thrice
		<lb/>cut <persName>Cupid's</persName> bowstring, the little hangman dares not shoot
		<lb/>at me again.</quote></said></p>
          <p><said>This is quite a new view of your character,</said> said
	    <lb/>the Colonel; <said>and you are certainly the first <name>Hiberni­
		<lb/>an</name>, whom I had ever the honor of knowing, that pre­
	      <lb/>tended indifference for the charms of female beauty,
	      <lb/>but did not rather glory in the susceptibility, which is,
	      <lb/>pardon me, a trait of your national character.</said></p>
          <p><said>They were more fond of <quote>wooing, wedding, and
		<lb/>repenting,</quote> than I am,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>or they would

	    <lb/>he continued in a tone of deep feeling, utterly inconsistent
	    <lb/>with the usual reckless gaiety of his manner, and therefore
	    <lb/>the more impressive; <said>the heart which has been once
	      <lb/>betrayed cannot soon forget it. Its native warmth is
	      <lb/>chilled, and it becomes ossified, if I may so express it,
	      <lb/>by disappointment and suspicion, till it is no longer
	      <lb/>susceptible of gentle impressions, and learns to distrust
	      <lb/>the fairest and the loveliest promises.</said></p>
          <p><said>You shock me by this picture,</said> said <persName>Colonel Gra­
	      <lb/>hame</persName>; <said>it must surely be imaginary; no heart, at least
	      <lb/>no heart like yours, my dear <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, could, for a
	      <lb/>moment, harbor feelings so misanthropic, and place an
	      <lb/>eternal bar before the avenues of those gentle and kind­
	      <lb/>ly affections, which are the sweetest solace of human­
	      <lb/>ity,—and all, because one frail object proved herself
	      <lb/>treacherous and unworthy.</said></p>
          <p><said>But if that object was the dearest and the loveliest,</said><lb/>said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, in a tone of vehement emotion, <said>the
	      <lb/>very sun of your existence, the centre of every cherish­
	      <lb/>ed hope, an idol consecrated by the purest homage of a
	      <lb/>doting heart,—if almost in the very moment of possess­
	      <lb/>ion, you found yourself betrayed, deceived, deserted, for
	      <lb/>another,—and such an one—good Heaven! the shame
	      <lb/>and agony of that moment will never fade from my re­
	      <lb/>membrance. <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, pride and resentment
	      <lb/>sustained me; but to you, firm, lofty, and aspiring as your
	      <lb/>spirit is, I do believe, life, from that hour, would have
	      <lb/>become a dark and gloomy scene, and every soft feel­
	      <lb/>ing have been forever excluded from your heart.</said></p>
          <p>In the excessive agitation of the moment, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>
	    <lb/>had quitted his hold of the Colonel's arm, and now, in
	    <lb/>emotion which seemed to defy control, he buried his
	    <lb/>face in his hands, and leaned against the broad trunk
	    <lb/>of a tree, which grew beside the path. <persName>Colonel Gr­
	    <lb/>hame</persName> forbore to intrude upon the sacredness of his sor­
	    <lb/>row by a single word of sympathy or advice, and he
	    <lb/>stood silently beside him, his arms folded, and his eyes
	    <lb/>bent upon the earth, touched by the impassioned grief
	    <lb/>of the seemingly gay and thoughtless young man,
	    <pb n="145"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="13(1)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">145</mw>
	    <lb/>whom he had believed free from the withering touch of
	    <lb/>early disappointment and misfortune.</p>
          <p>But he was not suffered long to indulge his silent
	    <lb/>meditations; the passions of <persName>O'Carroll</persName> were strong and
	    <lb/>violent; but when the first burst of frenzied feeling had
	    <lb/>subsided, it was not unfrequently succeeded by those of
	    <lb/>a directly opposite nature. After a few moments of
	    <lb/>agonized regret, he turned towards <persName>Grahame</persName>, and taking
	    <lb/>his arm, said in a hurried voice,</p>
          <p>
            <said>I am a fool, a very fool, <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, to put
	    <lb/>myself in such a turmoil about a faithless woman; as if
	    <lb/>there were but one in the world, and they were not things
	    <lb/>to be met with every day; though may I forfeit my
	    <lb/>commission, if I am ever caught in their toils again.
	    <lb/>There is mirth and enjoyment enough without them;
	    <lb/>and so we find it among ourselves, what need we search
	    <lb/>beneath their gilded coils for the fatal sweets which we
	    <lb/>taste at the peril of our lives; the folds of the serpent
	    <lb/>involve us while in the act, and we find, too late, the
	    <lb/>bitter price, which we are doomed to pay for the fond
	    <lb/>indulgence of a moment.</said>
          </p>
          <p>The assumed gaiety of <persName>Captain O'Carroll's</persName> air could
	    <lb/>not disguise the bitterness of feeling, which his words
	    <lb/>implied, and which had awakened <persName>Colonel Grahame's</persName>
	    <lb/>sympathy and compassion. But he already knew
	    <lb/><persName>O'Carroll</persName> sufficiently well, to feel assured that, by
	    <lb/>dwelling on this painful topic, he should only increase
	    <lb/>the poignancy of his regrets, and prolong the moment
	    <lb/>of painful retrospection. He of course sought rather
	    <lb/>to divert his thoughts, and draw him from the misan­
	    <lb/>thropic gloom, so uncongenial to his nature, and he said
	    <lb/>cheerfully, in reply to his last observation,</p>
          <p>
            <said>A truly philosophic resolution, my dear fellow!
	    <lb/>We, the lords of the creation, sadly forget our dignity,
	    <lb/>when we sink into despondency, because a fickle wo­
	    <lb/>man frowns. She who can deliberately betray a fond
	    <lb/>and trusting heart, is not worthy a single sigh of remem­
	    <lb/>brance or regret.</said>
          </p>

	    <lb/>rupted <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>but it has afforded me abundant
	      <lb/>relief, Colonel; and now again shall <quote>mirth admit me
		<lb/>of her crew,</quote> and none shall even dream that the black
	      <lb/>ox has ever trod on the foot of the laughter-loving
	      <lb/><persName>O'Carroll</persName>. And now for other subjects; and firstly,
	      <lb/>what thought you of the interview between the two
	      <lb/>Generals this morning?</said></p>
          <p><said>Of course, it was a scene of pride and interest to
	      <lb/>every American heart,</said> replied <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>Ah, indeed it has been as proud a day for you, as
	      <lb/>it has been humiliating for us,</said> returned <persName>O'Carroll</persName>.
	    <lb/><said>But we have nothing to complain of in your country­
	      <lb/>men. On the contrary, we may truly declare, that
	      <lb/>the conquest, which valor has won, humanity and
	      <lb/>courtesy have secured. <persName>General Gates</persName> is an insinuating
	      <lb/>man, and it was thought by many, that he even surpas­
	      <lb/>sed our dignified commander, in the easy and unaffect­
	      <lb/>ed grace of his demeanor, during the interview. Then,
	      <lb/>too, the generosity and delicacy of his conduct, in spar­
	      <lb/>ing us the mortification of piling our arms, before his
	      <lb/>whole army, demands our warmest gratitude and admi­
	      <lb/>ration. Every tongue is loud in praise of this act, and
	      <lb/>in spite of our misfortunes and humiliations, we shall
	      <lb/>be constrained to remember <placeName>America</placeName> with affection and
	      <lb/>respect.</said></p>
          <p><said>Thank you, <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>,</said> returned <persName>Grahame</persName>,
	    <lb/>touched by this voluntary tribute to the virtues and gal­
	    <lb/>lantry of his countrymen. <said>The favorable impres­
	      <lb/>sion,</said> he added, <said>which we have been so happy as to
	      <lb/>make on the minds of those, whom the fortunes of war
	      <lb/>have thrown into our power, is nearly as gratifying to
	      <lb/>our private feelings, as the success, which has crowned
	      <lb/>the effort of our arms, is to us, as soldiers and defend­
	      <lb/>ers of a country which we love. And may the friendly
	      <lb/>sentiments produced by this unexpected association, be
	      <lb/>the first step towards effecting a permanent union be­
	      <lb/>tween the two great nations, now unfortunately at
	      <lb/>issue.</said></p>
          <p><said>Heaven grant it may be so!</said> replied <persName>O'Carroll</persName>.

	      <lb/>ed in the struggle. So says the treaty, and I confess I
	      <lb/>am not sorry for this stipulation. Your faces look so
	      <lb/>like those of friends and countrymen, that, when I first
	      <lb/>met you in the field, I really shrunk from the idea of
	      <lb/>disfiguring them. And when, now and then, a broad
	      <lb/>Irish phiz was seen grinning with true Hibernian ex­
	      <lb/>pression, in your ranks, I was forced to recollect, that
	      <lb/>it was turned against the land which I love, before I
	      <lb/>could calmly see it become the mark for an Irish mus­
	      <lb/>ket.</said></p>
          <p><said>These feelings are perfectly natural,</said> returned
	    <lb/><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, <said>and such as almost every heart has
	      <lb/>experienced, more or less frequently, since the com­
	      <lb/>mencement of this unhappy contest.</said></p>
          <p>The Colonel forbore to make any farther remark, lest
	    <lb/>it should lead to an unpleasant discussion of rights and
	    <lb/>motives, in which it was impossible they should agree;
	    <lb/>and, hoping to change the conversation, he inquired if
	    <lb/><persName>Colonel Percy</persName> designed to follow the troops.</p>
          <p><said>Yes, he goes to-morrow,</said> returned <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,
	    <lb/><said>though he was pressed by <persName>General Schuyler</persName> to accom­
	      <lb/>pany <persName>General Burgoyne</persName>, with several other officers and
	      <lb/>their ladies, to his residence in <placeName>Albany</placeName>.</said></p>
          <p><said><persName>Major Courtland</persName> and his daughter were included
	      <lb/>in the invitation, I understand,</said> said the Colonel; <said>but
	      <lb/>he declined under the plea that he was not sufficiently
	      <lb/>recovered to bear the fatigue of the ride.</said></p>
          <p><said>And besides,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, <said>he has a nice so­
	      <lb/>journing with our friend <persName>Richard Hope</persName>, whom <persName>Miss
	      <lb/>Courtland</persName> is impatient to rejoin, and they are both
	      <lb/>anxious to get quietly settled on the banks of the <placeName>Schuyl­
		<lb/>kill</placeName>, before the cold weather sets in; where, through
	      <lb/>your instrumentality, for which I am greatly indebted,
	      <lb/>I have obtained permission to accompany them. And
	      <lb/>if the troops do not sail before spring, as it is not pro­
	      <lb/>bable they will, I promise myself a winter of much en­
	      <lb/>joyment.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> half suppressed a sigh, and inquir­
	    <lb/>ed in an absent tone, if <persName>Major Courtland</persName> had friends in
	    <lb/>that part of the country.</p>

          <p><said>Not many now, I fancy,</said> returned the Captain;
	    <lb/><said>but he has a house there, in which he has lived these
	      <lb/>sixteen years past, and where he hopes to find as com­
	      <lb/>fortable quarters as he left.</said></p>
          <p><said>It is somewhat doubtful if he does,</said> said <persName>Grahame</persName>,
	    <lb/>thoughtfully; <said>the house of a known royalist is in no
	      <lb/>safe hands when abandoned to the mercy of an exaspe­
	      <lb/>rated enemy.</said></p>
          <p><said>But he was aware of this danger,</said> returned <persName>O'Car­

	    <said rend="pre()"><choice><sic/><corr>“</corr></choice>and has guarded against it, by transferring his
	    <lb/>property to a friend, who has ever preserved a strict
	    <lb/>neutrality, and of course it will remain unmolested by
	    <lb/>either party.</said></p>
          <p><said>Yes, if the present occupant escapes suspicion,</said><lb/>said the Colonel, <said>and I sincerely hope he may. But
	      <lb/>can you tell me where the estate is situated?</said></p>
          <p><said>Not exactly; some ten or fifteen miles from <placeName>Phila­
		<lb/>delphia</placeName>, I believe,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>. <said>But I am so
	      <lb/>imperfectly acquainted with the topography of your
	      <lb/>country, that I can give you no accurate information;
	      <lb/>if you will accompany me to <persName>Major Courtland's</persName> lodg­
	      <lb/>ings, he will not only be gratified by the visit, but an­
	      <lb/>swer, with pelasure, any inquiries, which may enable
	      <lb/>you, when in that part of the country, to find his resi­
	      <lb/>dence.</said></p>
          <p><said>I fear it will not do to intrude upon him, at this
	      <lb/>hour,</said> said <persName>Grahame</persName>; <said>you are not aware, Captain,
	      <lb/>how long a time we have been pacing up and down
	      <lb/>this dark place.</said></p>
          <p><said>Then we must renounce the hope of seeing those
	      <lb/>witching dark eyes of <persName>Miss Courtland's</persName>
	      to-night,</said>, said
	    <lb/><persName>O'Carroll</persName>. <said>But I hope you will bear the deprivation,
	      <lb/>of which I am in part the cause, with all proper resig­
	      <lb/>nation, Colonel.</said></p>
          <p><said>Do not make yourself uneasy; my sleep will not
	      <lb/>be at all the less sound for it,</said> replied <persName>Grahame</persName>, smi­
	    <lb/>ling and slightly coloring.</p>
          <p><said>No, I dare swear to the truth of that,</said> said <persName>O'Car­
	      <lb/>roll</persName>; <said>for nothing sets a man's eyes open so effectual­
	      <lb/>ly, as the bright glances and smiles of a pretty woman,
	      <pb n="149"/>

	      <mw type="pageNum">149</mw>
	      <lb/>from whom he has parted just at the hour of bed time.
	      <lb/>They haunt his pillow, disturb his slumbers, and he
	      <lb/>rises in the morning, with the worn-out feelings of a
	      <lb/>wretch, who has been dragged through a mill stream,
	      <lb/>and just escaped without drowning.</said></p>
          <p><said>Then, indeed, the disappointment must be consid­
	      <lb/>ered a fortunate one,</said> returned the Colonel. <said>Though
	      <lb/>for myself I apprehend no evil consequences from that,
	      <lb/>or from the indulgence which you are inclined to think
	      <lb/>so dangerous. We are both soldiers, and though we
	      <lb/>may jest upon affairs of gallantry, we have but little
	      <lb/>time, at present, to devote to its trifling observances.</said></p>
          <p><said>I have none,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>at least, not till I
	      <lb/>see a beautiful cheek crimson with pleasure at my ap­
	      <lb/>proach, and fade to the lily's hue, when I speak of my
	      <lb/>removal.</said></p>
          <p><said>You speak in enigmas, Captain</said> said <persName>Grahame</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>Which you, I suppose, have not ingenuity enough
	      <lb/>to solve;</said> returned <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, gaily. <said>But let it pass,</said>
	    <lb/>he added, <said>you will be able to puzzle them out ere long,
	    <quote><lg type="poem" rend="indent(+3)" subtype="indeterminate"><l>And tire the hearer with a book of words</l></lg></quote>
	    <lb/>by way of exposition. Come, let us away now; that
	    <lb/>hooting owl, yonder, is warning us from his dominions,
	    <lb/>and she has good reason to complain of our encroach­
	    <lb/>ment, who idly

          <p><said>She mistakes your oracular wisdom probably, for
	      <lb/>the solemn note of a comrade,</said> said the Colonel.</p>
          <p><said>And is confirming it, by the sanction of her own
	      <lb/>prophetical hoot,</said> returned <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, whom a jest
	    <lb/>seldom discomposed. <said>But do let us retreat from her
	      <lb/>discordant screech, Colonel; she seems trying her ut­
	      <lb/>most to disconcert us, and will be about our ears short­
	      <lb/>ly; so we had better be off, unless you have a mind
	      <lb/>to endure the flapping of her unclean wings.</said></p>
          <p><said>Wait an instant,</said> said the Colonel, as <persName>O'Carroll</persName>
	    <lb/>was endeavouring to draw him forward, <said>I miss one of
	      <lb/>my pistols, and must have left it on a flat rock, where
	      <mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(+3)">13*</mw>

	      <milestone unit="sig" n="13(3)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">150</mw>
	      <lb/>I recollect to have laid it, while examining the other,
	      <lb/>before you joined me. I will just step for it and be
	      <lb/>back directly.</said></p>
          <p><said>You had better leave it till morning, Colonel,</said><lb/>said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>. <said>It will be safe in this unfrequented
	      <lb/>place, and it is impossible that you should be able to
	      <lb/>find it now.</said></p>
          <p><said>Oh, I think I know exactly where I laid it,</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>Grahame</persName>; <said>on a broad flat rock, about twenty paces
	      <lb/>up the glen. I can put my hand directly upon it, and
	      <lb/>will rejoin you instantly; or if you grow weary with
	      <lb/>waiting, walk on and I will overtake you.</said></p>
          <p>He quitted him abruptly, as he finished speaking, and
	    <lb/><persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> sat down on a projecting point of
	    <lb/>the rock, which overshadowed the entrance of the glen,
	    <lb/>to wait for his return. The minutes passed away un­
	    <lb/>noted, while he amused himself by watching the fires
	    <lb/>of the camp. The groups of soldiers passing to and
	    <lb/>fro, and gathered about them, seemed, in the distance,
	    <lb/>like shadowy forms, performing their unearthly orgies
	    <lb/>around the huge fires which shot their spiry flames
	    <lb/>high in the dark atmostphere, and partially illuminated,
	    <lb/>with their lurid glare, every indistinct object which
	    <lb/>caught the bright and unsteady reflection.</p>
          <p>Wearying, at length, of this solitary pleasure, he be­
	    <lb/>came impatient of the Colonel's absence, which had,
	    <lb/>indeed, been much longer than he imagined; and, sur­
	    <lb/>prised that he did not return, the Captain at last walk­
	    <lb/>ed up the glen with the hope of meeting him. But all
	    <lb/>was silent, not a footstep rustled the withered leaves,
	    <lb/>and the discordant hooting of the owl alone disturbed the
	    <lb/>gloomy stillness of the forest. Alarm and anxiety, lest
	    <lb/>some accident had befallen his friend, now banished
	    <lb/>every other emotion from the mind of <persName>O'Carroll</persName>. He
	    <lb/>listened, he groped around with his hands, though he
	    <lb/>scarcely knew why or wherefore, and he called again
	    <lb/>and again upon the Colonel's name. But the damp
	    <lb/>earth and the seared foliage of autumn only met his
	    <lb/>touch, and the deep echoes of the forest alone repeated,
	    <lb/>as if in mockery, the name of <persName>Grahame</persName>. For a mo­

	    <lb/>ment doubt and despair oppressed him, but he was too
	    <lb/>sanguine to be long subdued by either, and the thought
	    <lb/>soon occurred that the Colonel must have passed him
	    <lb/>unobserved, while he sat absorbed in the occupation of
	    <lb/>watching the distant fires of the camp. Instantly ad­
	    <lb/>mitting a belief which dispelled his anxiety, he retraced
	    <lb/>his steps down the glen, and walked hastily towards
	    <lb/>the quarters of <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> to laugh with him
	    <lb/>about the fright, which his long absence had occasioned.</p>

          <p><persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> was greatly surprised, on reaching
	    <lb/>the quarters of <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, to learn that he had
	    <lb/>not returned, nor had been seen, since early in the
	    <lb/>evening; and, utterly at a loss to account for the mys­
	    <lb/>tery of his sudden disappearance, he could not resolve
	    <lb/>to retire to his own lodgings, without first consulting
	    <lb/>some of the officers on the course which it was most
	    <lb/>advisable to pursue.</p>
          <p><persName>Captain Budworth</persName>, with whom his acquaintance was
	    <lb/>of the longest standing, was the first, to whom he com­
	    <lb/>municated his intelligence, and from him it soon ex­
	    <lb/>tended to others, till the whole camp was thrown into
	    <lb/>a state of excitement and alarm. The regularity and
	    <lb/>strict discipline, which <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> uniformly ob­
	    <lb/>served, as well as enforced, convinced every one, that
	    <lb/>some fatal accident must have occurred to occasion his
	    <lb/>sudden and mysterious absence; and a party of officers,
	    <lb/>guided by <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, immediately proceeded to
	    <lb/>explore the glen. They were accompanied by a band
	    <lb/>of soldiers, bearing flaming torches of pine knots, and
	  <pb n="152"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="13(4)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">152</mw>
	    <lb/>among them was <persName>Grahame's</persName> servant with a flambeau
	    <lb/>larger and brighter, than any of the others. Distracted
	    <lb/>with grief and anxiety by the loss of a master most
	    <lb/>deservedly dear to him, he pressed eagerly forward,
	    <lb/>thrusting his torch behind every bush, and enlightening
	    <lb/>every dark nook of the glen, where it was possible a
	    <lb/>human form might lie concealed. But the Colonel
	    <lb/>was not to be found. The pistol was gone from the
	    <lb/>flat rock, on which he informed <persName>O'Carroll</persName> he had left
	    <lb/>it;—still, in the hope of tracing him, the party pursued
	    <lb/>their way through the whole length of the glen, holding
	    <lb/>their torches close to the ground, and often stopping to
	    <lb/>listen for some sound, which might guide them to the
	    <lb/>object of their search. They even penetrated into the
	    <lb/>depths of the forest, and were confirmed in the belief
	    <lb/>that some violence had been used, by finding an end
	    <lb/>of the crimson sash, which <persName>Grahame</persName> had worn, and
	    <lb/>which appeared to have been torn forcibly from the
	    <lb/>rest; the ground, too, in many places, was trampled
	    <lb/>and broken, as if by the struggles of men, and the moss
	    <lb/>and leaves were dragged into heaps, as though some
	    <lb/>one had been forced rudely along. But it was in vain
	    <lb/>that they endeavoured to follow these traces; they soon
	    <lb/>disappeared entirely, and, after a toilsome search, they
	    <lb/>were constrained to give it up, as fruitless, and return
	    <lb/>anxious and dispirited to the camp.</p>
          <p><persName>Captain O'Carroll's</persName> ardent feelings were greatly ex­
	    <lb/>cited, and though he retired to rest, he neither slept,
	    <lb/>nor attempted to sleep, during the whole of the weari­
	    <lb/>some night. As soon as the morning dawned, a de­
	    <lb/>tachment of troops was sent out to search the country,
	    <lb/>and <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, after again exploring the glen
	    <lb/>without success, returned to inform <persName>Major Courtland</persName>,
	    <lb/>whom he had not yet seen, of the singular and melan­
	    <lb/>choly occurrence.</p>
          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> was reading to her father, when he knock­
	    <lb/>ed gently at the door. She arose immediately to open
	    <lb/>it, and her bright face became yet brighter and more
	    <lb/>lovely, as, with frank and unaffected cordiality, she wel­
	    <lb/>comed him to their humble abode.</p>

          <p><said>Come in, my dear <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,</said> cried the Major;
	    <lb/><said>I am right glad to see you. But what in the name
	      <lb/>of wonder became of you and the Colonel yesterday?
	      <lb/>You both played me the truant, and, had it not been
	      <lb/>for <persName>Colonel Percy</persName>, who brought me all the news, <persName>Kate</persName>
	      <lb/>and I should have been as humdrum, as two owls in a
	      <lb/>cage. But how now, man! What mean these pale
	      <lb/>looks of thine?</said> exclaimed the Major, suddenly struck
	    <lb/>and alarmed by the anxiety visible in the Captain's
	    <lb/>usually gay countenance.</p>
          <p><said>Can you tell me any thing of <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>,
	      <lb/>sir?</said> inquired <persName>O'Carroll</persName> in a voice of emotion, which

          <p><said>What is the meaning of this agitated inquiry,

	      <lb/>not seen the Colonel, since the evening before the last,
	      <lb/>when he left me in company with yourself.</said></p>
          <p><persName>O'Carroll</persName> made no reply, but walked across the
	    <lb/>apartment with an air of so much disturbance, that
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName>, convinced he had evil tidings to communi­
	    <lb/>cate, laid her hand upon his arm, with a degree of
	    <lb/>emotion of which she seemed utterly unconscious, and
	    <lb/>turning towards him a countenance, from which the
	    <lb/>bloom had faded, and the glowing animation fled, she
	    <lb/>exclaimed, in a voice of tremulous earnestness,</p>
          <p>
            <said>What fatal intelligence have you to impart! Do
	      <lb/>not keep us longer in suspense, but tell us what mis­
	      <lb/>fortune has befallen <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>.</said>
          </p>
          <p><persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> instantly related the events of the
	    <lb/>preceeding evening, the mysterious disappearance of
	    <lb/><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, the fruitless search, which had al­
	    <lb/>ready been made after him, and the attempts which
	    <lb/>they were still pursuing, in the hope of at last tracing
	    <lb/>him, or at least discovering the cause of his singular
	    <lb/>and prolonged absence.</p>
          <p><persName>Major Courtland</persName> listened with unfeigned astonish­
	    <lb/>ment to <persName>O'Carroll's</persName> recital, and not without conside­
	    <lb/>rable agitation; for he had imbibed a sincere and strong
	    <lb/>attachment to the Colonel, and was truly concerned to
	    <lb/>learn that any disaster had befallen him. He poured
	    <pb n="154"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="13(5)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">154</mw>
	    <lb/>forth a thousand inquiries, devised as many expedients
	    <lb/>for tracing the person of <persName>Grahame</persName>, and hinted at every
	    <lb/>circumstance, which, to his awakened imagination,
	    <lb/>seemed at all probable, or even possible. But none
	    <lb/>were satisfactory to himself, or to <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>,
	    <lb/>who, to speak the truth, scarcely bestowed on them
	    <lb/>the slightest degree of attention. A low and half
	    <lb/>breathed ejaculation from the lips of <persName>Catherine</persName>, had
	    <lb/>reached his ears, as he finished his strange recital, and,
	    <lb/>for a few minutes, forgetting even the lost <persName>Grahame</persName>, he
	    <lb/>bent his eye earnestly upon her, to read, if possible,
	    <lb/>what was passing in her mind.</p>
          <p>Her pale cheek and downcast eye evinced extreme
	    <lb/>emotion; but of what nature, <persName>O'Carroll</persName> felt himself
	    <lb/>unskilled to determine; at least, he could not decide
	    <lb/>whether any softer emotion mingled with the alarm,
	    <lb/>which was visibly depicted on her features.</p>
          <p><said>We intended to have left here tomorrow, or by
	      <lb/>the day after, at farthest,</said> said <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, still
	    <lb/>continuing to speak without observing the abstraction
	    <lb/>of his companions; <said>but, indeed, I am reluctant to go,
	      <lb/>before I am assured of <persName>Colonel Grahame's</persName> safety.</said></p>
          <p><said>Father, we must not think of it!</said> exclaimed
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName>, aroused by these words from her painful
	    <lb/>reverie, and starting up with an air of sudden anima­
	    <lb/>tion, while the blood, which had forsaken her cheeks,
	    <lb/>rushed tumultuously back, dying them with the deepest
	    <lb/>tint of crimson, and her dark eyes glanced like those
	    <lb/>of a young <name>Pythoness</name> in the moment of inspiration,
	    <lb/>with a resolute and lofty expression,</p>
          <p><said>Dear father,</said> she said, <said>you will not surely go,
	      <lb/>while the fate of him, to whom you owe your life, and
	      <lb/>I the happiness which your death would have wrested
	      <lb/>from me, remains involved in mystery! Heaven for­
	      <lb/>bid that we should thus repay those beneifts. Rather
	      <lb/>will I myself explore these forests and the caves, where
	      <lb/>the brave and unfortunate <persName>Grahame</persName> may be lingering
	      <lb/>out the remnant of his gallant life, than have it said,
	      <lb/>they who owed him so much, with cold and selfish
	      <lb/>indifference, sought their own peaceful home, regard­

	      <lb/>less of the welfare of that generous friend, who had
	      <lb/>given them their lives, and kindly softened the pains
	      <lb/>and sorrows of their captivity.</said></p>
          <p><said>My dear girl,</said> replied the Major, <said>your feelings
	      <lb/>are natural, though you will excuse me for saying I
	      <lb/>think them somewhat extravagant; but this is constitu­
	      <lb/>tional with you, and, therefore, I make all due allow­
	      <lb/>ance. I should be as unwilling as yourself, <persName>Catherine</persName>,
	      <lb/>to quit this place, while the fate of <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>,
	      <lb/>to whom I deeply feel my obligations, remains uncer­
	      <lb/>tain, were there a probability that any efforts of ours
	      <lb/>could ensure his safety, or hasten his discovery. But,
	      <lb/>situated as we are, the hope of rendering any assistance
	      <lb/>is vain. I am still feeble from my long confinement,
	      <lb/>and, of course, incapable of exertion; and you a timid
	      <lb/>—no I will not say timid, <persName>Kate</persName>, but a powerless maiden,
	      <lb/>—what can you do to aid the search, which others are
	      <lb/>so active in making? Unless indeed you resolve to
	      <lb/>put you<choice><sic/><corr>r</corr></choice> threat in execution, and beat the bushes and
	      <lb/>explore the forest caves, for our lost hero.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> blushed deeply at her father's raillery, and
	    <lb/>when she raised her eyes, they were suffused with tears.
	    <lb/>The Major perceived that he had unintentionally given
	    <lb/>her pain, and to atone for it he drew her gently towards
	    <lb/>him and kissing her, said,</p>
          <p>
            <said>Forgive me, my love; my levity was ill timed, I
	      <lb/>allow; you know I would not for the world say what
	      <lb/>should purposely wound your feelings, or breathe a word
	      <lb/>in ridicule against that exquisite and generous sensibil­
	      <lb/>ity, which I am so happy to see you possess. And to
	      <lb/>prove to you, <persName>Kate</persName>, that I am equally interested with
	      <lb/>yourself in the welfare of <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, I will con­
	      <lb/>sent to remain here till he is found, or all hope of his
	      <lb/>recovery is given over.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>Thank you, dearest father,</said> she replied, tenderly
	    <lb/>returning his caress, while her beautiful countenance
	    <lb/>shone with renovated smiles. <said>He must soon be found,
	      <lb/>I think,</said> she added; <said>for who can bear him any
	      <lb/>malice? or who, if they did, could be so dastardly as
	    <pb n="156"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="13(6)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">156</mw>
	      <lb/>to seek revenge in a mode which all, save the veriest
	      <lb/>coward, must despise.</said></p>
          <p><said>There are those mean enough to do it , who call
	      <lb/>themselves brave men,</said> said the Major. <said>But where,
	      <lb/>Captain, is the <name>Indian</name>, <persName>Ohmeina</persName>, who is so strongly at­
	      <lb/>tached to the person of <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>? Perhaps
	      <lb/>he may be able to afford us some clue to this mystery.</said></p>
          <p><said>He parted from the Colonel,</said> returned <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,
	    <lb/><said>just before I joined him in the glen last evening; and
	      <lb/><persName>Grahame's</persName> servant informed me, this morning, that he
	      <lb/>had gone to <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>, on some business for his
	      <lb/>master.</said></p>
          <p><said>The circumstance of his absence just at this mo­
	      <lb/>ment, however, has rather a suspicious appearance,</said><lb/>said the Major. <said>These treacherous <name>Indians</name> are not
	      <lb/>to be trusted, and I greatly fear that <persName>Grahame's</persName> confi­
	      <lb/>dence has been fatally abused.</said></p>
          <p><said><persName>Ohmeina</persName> is as true as the polestar,</said> exclaimed the
	    <lb/>Captain, <said>and, cordially as I detest the whole of his
	      <lb/>copper-colored generation, I am constrained to respect
	      <lb/>the virtues and fidelity of this wonderful savage. His
	      <lb/>name must not be coupled with treachery, for I am
	      <lb/>persuaded some other hand has done this deed of dark­
	      <lb/>ness.</said></p>
          <p><said>And whose can it possibly be?</said> asked the Major;<choice><sic>”</sic><corr/></choice>
	    <lb/><said rend="pre()"><choice><sic/><corr>“</corr></choice>do your suspicions, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, or those of others, rest
	      <lb/>upon any one in particular?</said></p>
          <p><said>Mine do not,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>for I assure you I
	      <lb/>know not the individual, so base as to be capable of in­
	      <lb/>juring the generous and high-minded <persName>Grahame</persName>. I have
	      <lb/>in my perplexity, it is true, sometimes thought of those
	      <lb/>devils who sacked and burned <persName>Ohmeina's</persName> colony, and
	      <lb/>murdered all the inhabitants, like so many helpless
	      <lb/>sheep; but then <persName>Colonel Percy</persName> told us that <persName>Grahame</persName>
	      <lb/>made crow's meat of most of them, and the few who
	      <lb/>escaped, cannot be such incarnate fiends, even if they
	      <lb/>had the courage, as to venture in this manner upon
	      <lb/>him.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Major Courtland</persName> shook his head doubtingly, as he
	    <lb/>said</p>
          <pb n="157"/>

          <p>
            <said rend="post()">They dare do almost any thing for the gratification
	      <lb/>of their malice. Revenge, in the estimation of an <name>Indian</name>,
	      <lb/>is a paramount virtue, and he is never known to forget
	      <lb/>an injury. I fear exceedingly, that <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>
	      <lb/>has fallen into the power of these savages.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>Then he is lost indeed!</said> exclaimed <persName>Catherine</persName>,
	    <lb/>with emotion. She had learned from her father the
	    <lb/>story of <persName>Ohmeina</persName>, and, though the suggestion of <persName>Cap­
	      <lb/>tain O'Carroll</persName> had occurred to her the moment she
	    <lb/>received the intelligence of <persName>Grahame's</persName> sudden disap­
	    <lb/>pearance, she had not yet found resolution to mention
	    <lb/>a suspicion so horrible, and which if correct must de­
	    <lb/>stroy almost every hope of his rescue; since the cruel­
	    <lb/>ty of a savage is alike fierce and cunning; and it is sel­
	    <lb/>dom indeed, that the unhappy victim escapes from the
	    <lb/>dreadful fate which awaits him.</p>
          <p><said>I cannot admit so dreadful a belief,</said> said <persName>O'Car­
	      <lb/>roll</persName>; <said>no, I am sure they would have found opportunities
	      <lb/>before this, had they wished to revenge themselves. At
	      <lb/>all events, I will hope better things, till I have stronger
	      <lb/>grounds for this frightful supposition. But I will go out
	      <lb/>to learn what tidings I can gather.</said></p>
          <p><said>And return, as soon as convenient,</said> said the Ma­
	    <lb/>jor, <said>to relieve our anxiety. We shall wish to know
	      <lb/>how matters are going on.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> promised to do as the Major
	    <lb/>desired; and, hastily quitting them, he bent his steps
	    <lb/>almost instinctively towards the glen, which had been
	    <lb/>the scene of his conference with <persName>Grahame</persName>, on the pre­
	    <lb/>ceding evening. As he approached it, he perceived a
	    <lb/>small party advancing towards him, and, upon a nearer
	    <lb/>view, he recognized <persName>Captain Budworth</persName>, who, with a
	    <lb/>Lieutenant and ten or twelve men, was going to explore
	    <lb/>the forest in the hope of proving more successful, than
	    <lb/>in their former search. <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> instantly at­
	    <lb/>tached himself to this party, and they proceeded cau­
	    <lb/>tiously up the glen, looking with diligence around them,
	    <lb/>and often stopping, as they fancied the tones of a human
	    <lb/>voice were borne on the autumnal gale, which sighed
	    <lb/>through the seared and withered foliage of the forest.</p>
          <mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(+3)">14</mw>

          <mw type="pageNum">158</mw>
          <p>But no living object met their view, nor any vestige
	    <lb/>of a human being, till they reached the spot, where the
	    <lb/>bruised and trampled turf had, on the preceding even­
	    <lb/>ing, engaged their attention. After examining it with
	    <lb/>close attention, they pursued their course without dis­
	    <lb/>covering any other traces, which might afford a clue
	    <lb/>to the destiny of <persName>Grahame</persName>, till they reached a low,
	    <lb/>moist spot of ground, of about an acre in extent, which
	    <lb/>bore a growth of tall, straight pines; and seemed quite
	    <lb/>free from the tangling underwood, which had heretofore
	    <lb/>embarrassed their progress. On the boundary of this
	    <lb/>swampy ground, they stopped to hold a consultation, on
	    <lb/>the expediency of attempting to cross it.</p>
          <p><said>It appears to me quite useless to venture over this
	      <lb/>wet place,</said> cried <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>there are no lurking
	      <lb/>places for villains, among those straight trees, and we
	      <lb/>may be mired, if we adventure on it.</said></p>
          <p><said>The straight trees will serve us to cling by, in case
	      <lb/>we find ourselves sinking,</said> said <persName>Lieutenant Wilmot</persName>,
	    <lb/>gravely.</p>
          <p><said>They might, <persName>Wilmot</persName>, if there were any branches
	      <lb/>on them,</said> said <persName>Captain Budworth</persName>; <said>but since there
	      <lb/>are none within arms length, and we are not gifted with
	      <lb/>the talons of wild-cats to cling by, their huge trunks
	      <lb/>will afford us little service. But here is certainly a
	      <lb/>man's track,</said> he said, stooping down to examine a print
	    <lb/>which bore a resemblance to the human foot; <said>and
	      <lb/>here is another,</said> he added, looking still around him;
	    <lb/><said>it may be worth our while, <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, to go
	      <lb/>over this marshy spot; I apprehend no danger, and, at
	      <lb/>all events, there are enough of us to help each other in
	      <lb/>case of difficulty.</said></p>
          <p>While he was speaking, one of the soldiers had dis­
	    <lb/>covered some drops of blood among the withered
	    <lb/>leaves, and they all now gathered round to view them,
	    <lb/>with looks of horror and dismay. They argued a fatal
	    <lb/>termination to the career of the unhappy <persName>Grahame</persName>;
	    <lb/>but those, who were engaged in the search after him,
	    <lb/>refused to receive this evidence as certain; and, by
	    <lb/>mutual consent, resolved to press forward and learn, if
	    <pb n="159"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="14(2)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">159</mw>
	    <lb/>possible, whether their labors and hopes were destined
	    <lb/>to prove futile. The tracks induced them to believe
	    <lb/>they were in the right course, and, with renewed cour­
	    <lb/>age, they boldly adventured on the marshy soil. Con­
	    <lb/>trary to their expectations, however, they found it per­
	    <lb/>fectly firm and safe;—moist, but not miry, and present­
	    <lb/>ing an even surface, over which they walked with ease
	    <lb/>and convenience. In crossing it, they once or twice
	    <lb/>perceived the same tracks, though they were not able to
	    <lb/>trace them far; but on gaining the opposite side they
	    <lb/>discerned one, still more distinct, and which <persName>William</persName>,
	    <lb/><persName>Colonel Grahame's</persName> servant, who had accompanied the
	    <lb/>party, declared to be the very print of his master's foot.</p>
          <p>With unwearying patience, they climbed a steep, wood­
	    <lb/>ed bank, which rose abruptly from the low, wet soil
	    <lb/>they had been traversing, and, having attained the sum­
	    <lb/>mit, they stopped to look around them, and determine,
	    <lb/>in what direction it was best to proceed. The bank,
	    <lb/>on which they stood, sloped gradually downward into
	    <lb/>a deep ravine, choked with shrubbery and tangling un­
	    <lb/>derwood; but <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, as he gazed attentive­
	    <lb/>ly into it, perceived something, which, he imagined,
	    <lb/>bore some resemblance to a human habitation. He
	    <lb/>pointed it out to <persName>Captain Budworth</persName>, and, followed by
	    <lb/>the rest of the party, they cautiously descended the
	    <lb/>slope and proceeded to reconnoitre the ravine. The
	    <lb/>object, which had attracted their attention, proved to be
	    <lb/>an Indian wigwam. It was constructed of stakes driven
	    <lb/>into the ground in a circular form, while smaller sticks
	    <lb/>crossed transversely; and the whole was covered with
	    <lb/>slender twigs firmly interwoven, and overlaid with dried
	    <lb/>moss and leaves. A mat of plaited grass was suspend­
	    <lb/>ed before a small opening, which served for a door,
	    <lb/>but no appearance of any living being was to be seen;
	    <lb/>and, leaving <persName>Lieutenant Wilmot</persName> with the soldiers to
	    <lb/>watch against a sudden surprise, <persName>Captains Budworth</persName>
	    <lb/>and <persName>O'Carroll</persName> gently raised the mat and entered this
	    <lb/>singular habitation. It presented no novelty to <persName>Captain
	    <lb/>Budworth</persName>, who had seen more, as he said, <said rend="pre(‘)post(’)">of these
	      <lb/>dwellings of <persName>Satan</persName>, than he ever wished to see again;</said> and,
	  <pb n="160"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="14(2)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">160</mw>
	    <lb/>of course, in assisting <persName>O'Carroll</persName> to examine the interior
	    <lb/>of this, he was only stimulated by the hope of finding
	    <lb/>something, which might lead to the discovery of <persName>Col­
	      <lb/>onel Grahame</persName>.</p>
          <p>The inside of the hut was hung round with mats,
	    <lb/>similar to that which served as a door, curiously plaited
	    <lb/>with coarse grass, or the slender twigs of the willow;
	    <lb/>and, like the hall of a feudal chieftain, was garnished
	    <lb/>with trophies of sylvan and warlike prowess. Several
	    <lb/>deer's heads, still bearing their proud and branching
	    <lb/>antlers, were disposed about the walls, besides the tusk
	    <lb/>of a wild boar and the beak and claws of an enormous
	    <lb/>eagle, with various other spoils of a similar kind.</p>
          <p>In the centre of the dwelling, some flat stones were
	    <lb/>so arranged as to form a not inconvenient fireplace,
	    <lb/>from which the smoke escaped, in no very direct man­
	    <lb/>ner, as may well be supposed, through a hole in the
	    <lb/>roof. A number of mats, and skins of wild beasts, were
	    <lb/>spread around the fireplace, though fire there was none;
	    <lb/>but the white ashes and half decayed brands showed
	    <lb/>that it had not long been extinct. There were also
	    <lb/>other tokens, which indicated that the place had been
	    <lb/>recently deserted. <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> discovered a
	    <lb/>wooden bowl full of freshly dug ground-nuts, and in an
	    <lb/>iron pot, suspended over the fire by a stick placed upon
	    <lb/>two upright stones, were some culinary preparations,
	    <lb/>which from the crudeness of their present state seemed
	    <lb/>to have been left suddenly, and in haste.</p>
          <p><persName>O'Carroll</persName> had the curiosity to remove the broad cab­
	    <lb/>bage-leaf which covered it, and examine the ingredi­
	    <lb/>ents, of which it was composed. They consisted of
	    <lb/>thin slices of venison, intermixed with strips of pump­
	    <lb/>kin, and probably designed to form a savory and favor­
	    <lb/>ite mess.</p>
          <p>But that which chilled <persName>O'Carroll's</persName> heart with horror,
	    <lb/>was a string of human scalps, suspended across the ant­
	    <lb/>ler<choice><sic>'</sic><corr/></choice>s of a deer, and which, among the multiplicity of
	    <lb/>other objects had, till now, escaped his observation.
	    <lb/>They were dried and hideously painted, but evidently
	    <lb/>those of white men; and, after pointing them out to

	    <mw type="pageNum">161</mw>
	    <lb/><persName>Captain Budworth</persName>, <persName>O'Carroll</persName> turned, with a revolting
	    <lb/>heart, from the shocking spectacle.</p>
          <p>At this instant, a movement was heard on the outside
	    <lb/>of the wigwam, and, before the two officers had time to
	    <lb/>escape through the narrow aperture, which served for a
	    <lb/>door, the voice of <persName>Lieutenant Wilmot</persName> was heard ex­
	    <lb/>claiming,</p>
          <p>
            <said>Seize him! seize the villain!</said>
          </p>
          <p><persName>O'Carroll</persName> and his companion rushed through the
	    <lb/>small door, their swords already drawn, just in time to
	    <lb/>see an <name>Indian</name> disappear from the summit of the bank,
	    <lb/>which rose above the wigwam. They joined in the
	    <lb/>rapid pursuit of the soldiers, who, led by <persName>Wilmot</persName>, had
	    <lb/>nearly reached the spot where the savage appeared,
	    <lb/>for a moment; and at the sight of the military array
	    <lb/>around his dwelling, had turned suddenly round, and
	    <lb/>vanished like a flash of lightning.</p>
          <p>On reaching the top of the eminence, he was no
	    <lb/>where visible. The cunning and agility of his savage
	    <lb/>nature, together with the familiar acquaintance, which
	    <lb/>he might be supposed to have with every lurking-place
	    <lb/>in the forest, and the ease with which habit enabled
	    <lb/>him swiftly to tread its intricate mazes, rendered it no
	    <lb/>difficult matter for him to avoid his pursuers, which it
	    <lb/>seemed that he had now effectually done.</p>
          <p><said>The tormenting demon!</said> muttered the incensed
	    <lb/><persName>O'Carroll</persName>, as he looked vainly round to catch a glimpse
	    <lb/>of the fugitive. <said>Would to Heaven we had clutched
	      <lb/>him,</said> he added; <said>but the devil shall not be cheated
	      <lb/>of his due; so now let's start the game.</said></p>
          <p><said>We will bring him to confession, before we deliver
	      <lb/>him over to his master,</said> said <persName>Budworth</persName>, as they began,
	      <lb/>some with caution, and others with violence, to beat
	      <lb/>among the bushes, and explore the littel hollows and
	      <lb/>thickets, which were numerous in this part of the forest.
	      <lb/>They continued their search for a long time, although
	      <lb/>it still proved fruitless; and the lengthening shadows
	      <lb/>warned them that the day had begun to decline, before
	      <lb/>they thought of the necessity of hastening their depart­
	      <lb/>ure from the forest. With all convenient speed they
	    <mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(+3)">14*</mw>

	      <lb/>prepared for their return, and though they at first
	      <lb/>thought of stationing spies around the wigwam, the
	      <lb/>plan was upon reflection, rejected, as useless and dan­
	      <lb/>gerous. <persName>Grahame's</persName> servant, however, impressed with
	      <lb/>the belief that his master was concealed somewhere in
	      <lb/>the vicinity of the wigwam, declared it his intention to
	      <lb/>secrete himself among the bushes, and remain all night
	      <lb/>near the place, in the hope of being able to discover
	      <lb/>him. <persName>Captains Budworth</persName> and <persName>O'Carroll</persName> strenuously
	      <lb/>protested against this rash resolution, till convinced by
	      <lb/>their arguments, of the great danger attending it, poor
	      <lb/><persName>William</persName> consented to relinquish his design.</p>
          <p>The party then recrossed the marshy ground, and
	    <lb/>finding sufficient time yet remained to enable them to
	    <lb/>clear the forest before night-fall they stopped to rest
	    <lb/>themselves in a sunny glade, which opened to the west;
	    <lb/>for the air had grown damp and chilly, and the wearied
	    <lb/>soldiers felt the cheering rays of the sun peculiarly
	    <lb/>grateful after the labors of the day.</p>
          <p><said>We have performed hard duty, to-day,</said> said <persName>O'Car­
	      <lb/>roll</persName>, as he threw himself at full length upon the soft
	    <lb/>green moss, which carpeted the ground, in the spot,
	    <lb/>where himself and the two American officers had stopped
	    <lb/>a little apart from the soldiers; <said>but I wish,</said> he add­
	    <lb/>ed, <said>our search had not proved fruitless, and then the
	      <lb/>toil would have been nothing. Poor <persName>Grahame</persName>! I fear
	      <lb/>we have seen the last of him.</said></p>
          <p><said>I do not yet give him up</said> said <persName>Budworth</persName>. <said>If
	      <lb/>those savage wretches have entrapped him, as seems
	      <lb/>but too probable, they dare not, for their lives, put him
	      <lb/>to death; they might as safely murder our bravest
	      <lb/>General, <persName>Arnold</persName> himself, for instance, and the cry for
	      <lb/>vengeance would not be louder.</said></p>
          <p><said>Many a voice would be mute in that case,</said> mut­
	    <lb/>tered <persName>Wilmot</persName>. Then, as if afraid of a reproof for hav­
	    <lb/>ing spoken with so much freedom before a British offi­
	    <lb/>cer, he hastily added,</p>
          <p>
            <said>We shall have a late dinner to-day, if we stay here
	      <lb/>much longer, Captain</said>

          <mw type="pageNum">163</mw>
          <p><said>Dinner!</said> repeated <persName>Budworth</persName>; <said>it would not be
	      <lb/>amiss, at this moment; and now I think of it, <persName>Ned</persName>,
	      <lb/>some of those fellows are well laden with provisions,
	      <lb/>which I wonder thou shouldst forget, who art ever
	      <lb/>ready to unlock thy jaws at the sound of the platter.</said></p>
          <p><said>And right glad should I be to hear the merry clat­
	    <lb/>ter of knives and dishes in the wilderness, after fasting
	    <lb/>all day,</said> said the Lieutenant.</p>
          <p><said>Yes, yes, it will suit thy courage far better than
	      <lb/>more warlike din,</said> said <persName>Budworth</persName>; <said>so if it please
	      <lb/>thee, <persName>Ned</persName>, thou mayest order <persName>Rawson</persName> hither with our
	      <lb/>basket, and bid them keep their own to dispose of at
	      <lb/>pleasure, if indeed they have not already demolished
	      <lb/>its contents.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Wilmot</persName> did as he was desired, and a grateful repast
	    <lb/>was soon spread upon the turf, of which the three
	    <lb/>young men eagerly partook; though the intense inte­
	    <lb/>rest, with which they had pursued their fruitless search,
	    <lb/>had rendered them absolutely forgetful of the refresh­
	    <lb/>ments, which they now found so palatable.</p>
          <p><said>It is a banquet fit for the gods!</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,
	    <lb/>who, indeed, did ample justice to the feast.</p>
          <p><said>It would be vastly better though, provided we had
	      <lb/>a sip of their Olympian nectar instead of this villanous
	      <lb/>wine,</said> said <persName>Budworth</persName>. <said>Upon my faith, I believe
	      <lb/>we have nothing but the lees to drain, it is so devilish
	      <lb/>thick.</said></p>
          <p><said><quote>Wine upon the lees, and a feast of fat things,</quote> as
	      <lb/><persName>St. Paul</persName> said,</said> mumbled the wooden-headed Lieuten­
	    <lb/>ant, with the gravity of a profound divine.</p>
          <p><said><persName>St. Paul</persName> indeed!</said> echoed <persName>Budworth</persName> with a look
	    <lb/>of contempt.—<said>Thy brains, <persName>Ned</persName>, are not so thick as
	      <lb/>this wine, or thou wouldst not have made an epicure of
	      <lb/>the Apostle, when it was <persName>king Solomon</persName> who</said>—</p>
          <p><said>No, <persName>David</persName>, his father,</said> interrupted <persName>O'Carroll</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>Ah, right,</said> exclaimed <persName>Budworth</persName>, not dreaming
	    <lb/>that <persName>O'Carroll</persName> was as far from the truth as himself.
	    <lb/><said>Art not ashamed, <persName>Ned</persName>, to be no better read in thy
	      <lb/>Bible, than to abuse the self-denying Apostle in this
	      <lb/>manner? But since thou art so fond of fat things and
	    <pb n="164"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="14(4)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">164</mw>
	      <lb/>wine upon the lees, that thou wouldst stuff them down
	      <lb/>the throats of other people, thou shalt even have the
	      <lb/>drainings of the bottle to cobweb thine own with.</said></p>
          <p>So saying, he filled <persName>Wilmot's</persName> glass with the remnant
	    <lb/>of the wine, which indeed resembled a thick mixture of
	    <lb/>brickdust and water, rather than the clear, rich juice
	    <lb/>of the grape.</p>
          <p><said>But in good truth,</said> added <persName>Budworth</persName>, gaily, as the
	    <lb/>Lieutenant, with a sullen look, turned from the unin­
	    <lb/>viting draught, <said>thy heavy eyes belie thee, if thou hast
	      <lb/>not already had enough, and so here goes a libation to
	      <lb/>the jolly god of the grape,</said> and, as he spoke, he threw
	    <lb/>the contents of the glass over <persName>Wilmot's</persName> head.</p>
          <p><persName>O'Carroll</persName> could not forbear laughing at the grimace,
	    <lb/>and endeavour of the Lieutenant to avoid the sudden
	    <lb/>shower, which, however, did not pass over without
	    <lb/>giving him a slight sprinkling, and seemed to excite
	    <lb/>something like indignation in his rather stupid counte­
	    <lb/>nance.</p>
          <p><said>Upon my honor, <persName>Ned</persName>, it was an accident,</said> ex­
	    <lb/>claimed <persName>Budworth</persName>, parrying the protest which <persName>Wilmot</persName>
	    <lb/>was about to make. <said>Thy round phiz could never
	      <lb/>be mistaken for that of the jolly old <persName>Bacchus</persName>; though
	      <lb/>it might serve to represent the redoubtable <persName>Sancho
		<lb/>Panza</persName>, so it were decorated with the pewter helmet of
	      <lb/>his master. But a truce to trifling; and now tell me,
	      <lb/>for I hear you were with <persName>General Arnold</persName> when he re­
	      <lb/>ceived the tidings of <persName>Colonel Grahame's</persName> disappearance,
	      <lb/>—what said he of the affair!</said></p>
          <p><said>Why do you ask me?</said> said <persName>Wilmot</persName>; <said>you know
	      <lb/>he is not a friend to the Colonel.</said></p>
          <p><said>That is the very reason why I do ask thee, <name>Will­
		<lb/>o'-the-wisp</name>,</said> said <persName>Budworth</persName>; <said>he is the friend of no
	      <lb/>one, whom he cannot make the dupe of his own base­
	      <lb/>ness.</said></p>
          <p><said>But you will only be angry, <persName>Captain Budworth</persName>, if
	      <lb/>I repeat what he said of <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>,</said> said <persName>Wil­
	      <lb/>mot</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>I shall be more angry if you do not,</said> returned

	      <lb/>near an end, and farewell to speaking, when we begin
	      <lb/>to fight again with the underbrush of this dark forest.
	      <lb/>So speak out, man; I know the good General's malice
	      <lb/>well, and will do him the justice to declare, he has a
	      <lb/>heart which would not disgrace <persName>Beelzebub</persName> himself. You
	      <lb/>may think us over free, <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, in censuring
	      <lb/>a superior officer; but we are among the few, who have
	      <lb/>found out his metal, and none of those blind worship­
	      <lb/>pers, who are ready to fall down and kiss the dust of
	      <lb/>the idol's feet. So now, <persName>Wilmot</persName>, what said he of <persName>Gra­
		<lb/>hame</persName>?</said></p>
          <p><said>That this sudden decampment savored of the
	      <lb/>spice of treachery,</said> answered the Lieutenant; <said>that it
	      <lb/>would be an ill wind, if it did not blow the enemy
	      <lb/>good.</said></p>
          <p><said>Curse him for a false loon, as he is,</said> exclaimed
	    <lb/><persName>Budworth</persName>; <said>he speaks what he wishes may be true,
	      <lb/>for he would rejoice to hear that <persName>Grahame</persName> had fallen
	      <lb/>from the proud height, on which he stands, and to
	      <lb/>which <emph>he</emph> can no more raise his grovelling eyes, than
	      <lb/>the hooting bird of night can gaze undazzled at the
	      <lb/>noonday sun. But what reasons did he adduce for
	      <lb/>the infamous libel which he has dared to utter?</said></p>
          <p><said>That <persName>Colonel Grahame's</persName> intimacy with several
	      <lb/>British officers, who were our prisoners,</said> returned
	    <lb/><persName>Wilmot</persName>, <said>justified the suspicion that treason had been
	      <lb/>hatching between them; and that his disappearance,
	      <lb/>immediately after a long interview with one of them,
	      <lb/>would add strength to the evidence of any, who might
	      <lb/>choose to accuse him.</said></p>
          <p><said>Were he not beneath the notice of an honorable
	      <lb/>man,</said> exclaimed <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, no longer able to suppress
	    <lb/>his rising indigantion, <said>I would teach him to be more
	      <lb/>sparing of his hints and accusations. Even were the
	      <lb/>character of <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> other than it is, the
	      <lb/>honor of British officers in our situation would have
	      <lb/>forbidden us to tamper with his faith.</said></p>
          <p><said>Cool yourself, my dear sir,</said> said <persName>Captain Bud­
	      <lb/>worth</persName>; <said>you are on your parole, and we can have no
	      <lb/>fighting; it is for <persName>Grahame</persName>, when we find him, to chas­
	      <lb/>tise this insolence, and he would do it in good earnest,
	    <pb n="166"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="14(5)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">166</mw>
	      <lb/>if he did not despise it too much to honor it with a
	      <lb/>moment's notice. But have you no more to tell us,
	      <lb/><persName>Wilmot</persName>? It is warm spice, and lends these cold viands a
	      <lb/>relish!</said></p>
          <p><said>I think then I have given you seasoning enough,</said><lb/>said the Lieutenant.</p>
          <p>
            <said>No, let us have another dust, just to sprinkle the
	      <lb/>wing of this fowl. Had the General no other pithy
	      <lb/>reasons to assign for <persName>Colonel Grahame's</persName> apostacy?</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>None,</said> returned the Lieutenant, <said>except that the
	      <lb/>Colonel's boasted patriotism had always a hollow
	      <lb/>sound; with a sneer at the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> men.</said></p>
          <p><said>Now may the foul fiend light on him!</said> exclaim­
	    <lb/>ed the exasperated <persName>Budworth</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>And bear him off in his talons!</said> responded <persName>O'Car­
	      <lb/>roll</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>With all my heart, to the very centre of his hot
	      <lb/>dominions!</said> cried <persName>Budworth</persName>. <said>Thus to vilify the
	      <lb/>spotless character of <persName>Grahame</persName>, and sneer, with the
	      <lb/>malice of a demon, at the valiant men of <placeName>Massachu­
	      <lb/>setts</placeName>! They who from the moment of their birth have
	      <lb/>been rocked in the arms of liberty, and were the first,
	      <lb/>who spurned the gilded chains of slavery held forth to
	      <lb/>fetter them! I could bring a hundred names from that
	      <lb/>one noble State, which will brighten the page of our
	      <lb/>national annals, and descend with glory to the most
	      <lb/>remote posterity. Who has forgotten that in the last
	      <lb/>fearful battle, one of the youngest of her sons perform­
	      <lb/>ed such prodigies of valor as seem almost incredible.
	      <lb/>You well know, <persName>Wilmot</persName>, with what undaunted bravery
	      <lb/>the gallant <persName>Brooks</persName> led on his men, with what intrepidi­
	      <lb/>ty he plunged into the thickest of the fight, and was
	      <lb/>the last, on that victorious day, to quit the field, from
	      <lb/>which he plucked unfading garlands of renown.</said></p>
          <p>In the earnestness of defending <persName>Grahame's</persName> native
	    <lb/>state and his own, <persName>Budworth</persName> had wrought himself into
	    <lb/>a fever of enthusiasm, from which he was suddenly re­
	    <lb/>covered by the sound of an arrow, that, at this instant,
	    <lb/>whizzed over his head, and quivered in the tree against
	    <lb/>which he sat. The party were, in a moment, on their
	    <lb/>feet.</p>

          <p><said>One inch lower, and you were pinned fast enough
	      <lb/>to the tree, Captain,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>and as it is,
	      <lb/>the heathen dart has taken off the tip of your plume.</said></p>
          <p><said>True, by Heaven!</said> said <persName>Budworth</persName>, as he snatched
	    <lb/>off his hat, and, instantly replacing it, called aloud to the
	    <lb/>soldiers who were making merry over their repast,</p>
          <p><said>Ho! my boys, up and away,</said> he said; <said>the arrows
	      <lb/>of <persName>Beelzebub</persName> are about our ears, and all his imps will
	      <lb/>be let loose upon us in a twinkling.</said></p>
          <p><said>We have caroused here unconscionably long,</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>and may thank Heaven, if it does not
	      <lb/>prove our last meal; though I wish it had been a less
	      <lb/>hearty one, for with so much ballast on board, we shall
	      <lb/>be a long time clearing the breakers of this wilder­
	      <lb/>ness.</said></p>
          <p><said>If I knew the force of the foe, I would be at them,
	      <lb/>in spite of their cunning,</said> said <persName>Budworth</persName>. <said>But, as
	      <lb/>we may encounter a whole tribe of the howling devils,
	      <lb/>it will be hardly safe to venture upon them at hazard;
	      <lb/>though we will give them a touch of gunpowder; at
	      <lb/>least, they shall have the smell of it, before we bid
	      <lb/>them good night, provided, <persName>Wilmot</persName>, you can tell me
	      <lb/>from what direction the arrow came.</said></p>
          <p><said>You mightas well expect me to tell you whether
	      <lb/>the moon is inhabited,</said> said the Lieutenant. <said>Why,
	      <lb/>Captain, the arrow buzzed past my ear like a hum­
	      <lb/>ming bird, before I could tell what it was, or see
	      <lb/>whence it came.</said></p>
          <p><said>And if it had taken a piece of thy ear with it,
	      <lb/><persName>Ned</persName>,</said> said <persName>Budworth</persName>, <said>thou wouldst have lost no
	      <lb/>more than many a rogue has done before thee; and I
	      <lb/>could better have spared it than the gallant tip of my
	      <lb/>plume; but, by the sticking of the dart,</said> and he pluck­
	    <lb/>ed it from the tree as he spoke, <said>it must have been
	      <lb/>sent from the south; so give them a parting salute, my
	      <lb/>brave fellows, and then march, with all the speed you
	      <lb/>can make.</said></p>
          <p>The soldiers obeyed, and fired in the direction de­
	    <lb/>signated by their Captain; but the rocks and caverns
	    <lb/>of the forest alone answered, with a thousand echoes,
	    <pb n="168"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="14(6)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">168</mw>
	    <lb/>the loud volley of musketry which disturbed the silence
	    <lb/>of the wilderness. The men then reloaded their pieces
	    <lb/>and marched rapidly after their leaders. The near ap­
	    <lb/>proach of night prevented their endeavors to discover
	    <lb/>the savage, or savages, who were certainly lurking near
	    <lb/>them. But unacquainted with the intricacies of the
	    <lb/>forest, and aware that the <name>Indians</name> could, if they chose,
	    <lb/>rally a formidable body, which must inevitably destroy
	    <lb/>their feeble force, it was the opinion of both <persName>Captains
	    <lb/>Budworth</persName> and <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, that they ought immediately
	    <lb/>to quit the forest; since their remaining might not
	    <lb/>only occasion their own destruction, but, if <persName>Colonel
	    <lb/>Grahame</persName> were indeed in the power of the savages,
	    <lb/>provoke them to treat him with aggravated cruelty, and
	    <lb/>perhaps to put him to instant death.</p>
          <p>They reached the confines of the forest before night
	    <lb/>closed in, without any farther incident. The various
	    <lb/>parties, which had been employed in the same search,
	    <lb/>had most of them returned already. The others came
	    <lb/>in soon after, equally unsuccessful, and all of them per­
	    <lb/>suaded that <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> had been conveyed away
	    <lb/>by the wily <name>Indians</name>, and was probably murdered.</p>
          <p><persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, however, still refused to admit
	    <lb/>this belief, and in order to strengthen the fading hope
	    <lb/>which he cherished, as well as to fulfil his promise to
	    <lb/><persName>Major Courtland</persName>, he repaired to his lodgings to relate
	    <lb/>the occurrences of the day, and converse upon the pro­
	    <lb/>bable fate of <persName>Grahame</persName>. The recital which he gave,
	    <lb/>occasioned much surprise and apprehension, both to
	    <lb/>the Major and <persName>Catherine</persName>, and led to many wild and
	    <lb/>melancholy conjectures. But they were, of course,
	    <lb/>vague and unsatisfactory. <persName>O'Carroll</persName> was surprised to
	    <lb/>find how much <persName>Major Courtland</persName> appeared interested
	    <lb/>and affected by the affair; and he thought the elo­
	    <lb/>quence of <persName>Catherine's</persName> saddened countenance far more
	    <lb/>expressive, than all she could have uttered, and more
	    <lb/>flattering to <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, than the deepest lamen­
	    <lb/>tations of regret which could have fallen from her lips.</p>
          <p>At a late hour, he quitted them, more desponding
	    <lb/>than when he first sought their society, though with
	    <pb n="169"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="15(1)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">169</mw>
	    <lb/>characteristic versatility, he rose, on the following morn­
	    <lb/>ing, buoyant with hope, and, joining the same party
	    <lb/>which he had accompanied on the preceding day, set
	    <lb/>out for the wigwam, which they had discovered in the
	    <lb/>forest.</p>
          <p>Judging it prudent to observe great caution in ap­
	    <lb/>proaching the dwelling, they chose another route; and,
	    <lb/>while <persName>Captains Budworth</persName> and <persName>O'Carroll</persName> glided through
	    <lb/>matted bushes, and under spreading boughs, with their
	    <lb/>pistols cocked and their hands on their sword-hilts, the
	    <lb/>soldiers followed silently at a short distance, ready, at
	    <lb/>a given signal, to rush forward and seize any one who
	    <lb/>should appear to offer resistance or attempt to escape.</p>
          <p>But great was their surprise when on reaching the
	    <lb/>place unmolested, they found the wigwam destroyed,
	    <lb/>and every vestige of it removed; even the holes where
	    <lb/>the stakes had been driven into the earth, were not
	    <lb/>discernible; the withered leaves of autumn strewed the
	    <lb/>ground, and all around was as silent, and as wild, as if
	    <lb/>the foot of man had never pressed the soil. The
	    <lb/>soldiers were ordered to commence a search, and after
	    <lb/>several hours, vainly spent in exploring the forest, the
	    <lb/>party again quitted it, almost convinced, that it would
	    <lb/>be folly ever more to enter it. But <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>
	    <lb/>was too much beloved by every heart to be willingly
	    <lb/>resigned, and for a number of days the search was
	    <lb/>eagerly pursued. It however proved fruitless, and af­
	    <lb/>ter every possible means had been used for his dis­
	    <lb/>covery, those most interested in it were constrained to
	    <lb/>renounce the cherished hope of finding him, and to
	    <lb/>give him up as inevitably lost. The army was about
	    <lb/>quitting <placeName>Saratoga</placeName>, and, though many a heart mourned
	    <lb/>for the gallant individual, who, in the moment of victo­
	    <lb/>ry, was so mysteriously snatched from view; yet the
	    <lb/>new scenes which were about to open before them,
	    <lb/>and the pressing duties which devolved on every one,
	    <lb/>forbade the indulgence of private sorrow, and obliged
	    <lb/>them to sacrifice even the claims of consanguinity and
	    <lb/>friendship, to the interests of their suffering country.</p>

          <p><persName>Major Courtland</persName>, also, and his daughter, had left
	    <lb/><placeName>Saratoga</placeName>, the former firmly persuaded that <persName>Grahame</persName><lb/>was no longer in existence, though <persName>Catherine</persName> still cher­
	    <lb/>ished the hope of his being found, and looked forward
	    <lb/>with impatience to the return of the <name>Indian</name> <persName>Ohmeina</persName>,
	    <lb/>whose sagacity she thought would be able to trace his
	    <lb/>lost friend. The departure of <persName>Major Courtland</persName> had
	    <lb/>been somewhat hastened by intelligence received from
	    <lb/><placeName>Albany</placeName>, of <persName>Colonel Dunbar's</persName> death, who was killed in
	    <lb/>the battle of <placeName>Germantown</placeName>.</p>
          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> was extremely anxious to rejoin her cousin,
	    <lb/>to whom, in this season of affliction, the society and
	    <lb/>sympathy of a friend would be peculiarly grateful; and
	    <lb/>they accordingly bade adieu, for the present, to <persName>Cap­
	    <lb/>tain O'Carroll</persName>, and set out on their return to <placeName>Albany</placeName>.</p>
          <p><persName>O'Carroll</persName> had received permission to remain and
	    <lb/>prosecute the search, which, fruitless as it had hitherto
	    <lb/>been, he was not yet inclined to abandon. Like <persName>Cath­
	      <lb/>erine</persName>, he had strong faith in the fidelity, as well as the
	    <lb/>sagacity, of the <name>Indian</name> <persName>Ohmeina</persName>; and, as the time of
	    <lb/>his expected return drew near, he resolved to await it
	    <lb/>in his present situation; and, if the <name>Indian's</name> endeavors
	    <lb/>to discover the Colonel should likewise prove unavail­
	    <lb/>ing, to give up the search as hopeless, and hasten to
	    <lb/>rejoin <persName>Major Courtland</persName> and his daughter, on the banks
	    <lb/>of the <placeName>Schuylkill</placeName>.</p>

          <p>The period appointed for <persName>Ohmeina's</persName> return at length
	    <lb/>arrived, but without bringing him; though <persName>Captain
	      <lb/>O'Carroll</persName>, supposing it possible something unusual
	    <lb/>might have occurred to detain him, still continued to
	    <lb/>defer his departure from <placeName>Saratoga</placeName>, and lingered, day
	    <lb/>after day, in the glen and about the outskirts of the
	    <lb/>forest, as if he fancied the shade of his friend haunted
	    <lb/>these scenes of his favorite resort. The ravine in
	    <lb/>which the wigwam had stood, was also several times
	    <lb/>explored, with the same ill success as formerly; and,
	    <lb/>wearied at length by <persName>Ohmeina's</persName> protracted absence,
	    <lb/>suspicion began to mingle with the impatience of his
	    <lb/>feelings, and he was strongly inclined to distrust the
	    <lb/>good faith and zealous attachment, which had seemed
	    <lb/>to bind the <name>Indian</name> so firmly to his master.</p>
          <p><persName>Colonel Grahame's</persName> servant, however, who also re­
	    <lb/>mained at <placeName>Saratoga</placeName>, intent on the same object with
	    <lb/>himself, would by no means admit the possibility of
	    <lb/><persName>Ohmeina's</persName> treachery. The grateful and affectionate
	    <lb/>creature had so wound himself around the honest heart
	    <lb/>of <persName>William</persName>, that he was, upon all occasions, his warm
	    <lb/>defender, and he now persisted in declaring that some
	    <lb/>fatal accident must have happened to prevent the <name>In­
	      <lb/>dian's</name> return, since he had promised to be back sooner,
	    <lb/>and he was never known voluntarily to break his word.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, <name>November</name>, with its wintry skies
	    <lb/>and driving storms, arrived. The forest became bare,
	    <lb/>the streams swollen, and the last trace of verdure dis­
	    <lb/>appeared, even from the warmest and most sheltered
	    <pb n="172"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="15(2)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">172</mw>
	    <lb/>spots. <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> began to feel the discomforts
	    <lb/>of his situation, and to long for the society of <persName>Major
	    <lb/>Courtland</persName>, who had written, urging him to renounce all
	    <lb/>farther search after <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, and hasten from
	    <lb/>the dreary place, where he had located himself, to en­
	    <lb/>liven their family circle, over which an unusual gloom
	    <lb/>had been cast by the melancholy death of <persName>Colonel
	    <lb/>Dunbar</persName>. The invitation was resistless to <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,
	    <lb/>and he resolved only once again to examine the ravine,
	    <lb/>and, if without success, to quit <placeName>Saratoga</placeName> on the follow­
	    <lb/>ing morning.</p>
          <p>While his own servant and <persName>Grahame's</persName> went forward,
	    <lb/>in the track which they had so often trod before, he
	    <lb/>followed, silent and alone, recalling with melancholy
	    <lb/>pleasure those manly and endearing qualities of <persName>Gra­
	      <lb/>hame's</persName> heart and mind, which had won his warmest
	    <lb/>admiration and regard, and revolving, not without a
	    <lb/>slight tincture of superstitious awe, the mysterious cir­
	    <lb/>cumstance, which had snatched his brave and gallant
	    <lb/>friend so suddenly from the busy theatre, where he was
	    <lb/>performing a part of such vast interest and importance.</p>
          <p>As they approached the precipitous bank which
	    <lb/>bounded the ravine, the servants fell back, and <persName>O'Car­
	      <lb/>roll</persName> pressed forward, with as much caution, as his im­
	    <lb/>petuous nature would permit him to observe. Several
	    <lb/>days had elapsed, since his last visit to the spot; but
	    <lb/>every thing remained the same, except that the trees
	    <lb/>and shrubs, which had then retained some portion of
	    <lb/>their seared and faded foliage, were now despoiled;
	    <lb/>and, as their leafless branches waved in the clear at­
	    <lb/>mosphere of the morning, they gave an air of increased
	    <lb/>desolation to the scene, and deepened the unusual mel­
	    <lb/>ancholy, which <persName>O'Carroll</persName> felt creeping over his spirits.
	    <lb/>He stood for some time upon the top of the bank, his
	    <lb/>arms folded, and his eyes glancing earnestly around, in
	    <lb/>the hope of detecting some wily savage crouching be­
	    <lb/>neath the bushes, whom it might be in his power to
	    <lb/>secure. But no such object presented itself, and he
	    <lb/>was about to descend into the ravine, when suddenly
	    <lb/>his steps were arrested by a strain of wild, sweet melody,
	    <pb n="173"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="15(3)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">173</mw>
	    <lb/>which seemed, to arise from beneath his very feet, and
	    <lb/>which caused the pulses of his heart to throb in a tumult
	    <lb/>of surprise and hope.</p>
          <p>Motioning the servants to keep still, he bent eagerly
	    <lb/>forward to ascertain, if possible, the point from whence
	    <lb/>the sounds had proceeded; when the strange chant,
	    <lb/>which had ceased for a moment, was renewed, and its
	    <lb/>soft melody was like the touching tone of a female
	    <lb/>voice. One moment it swelled into a full, rich cadence,
	    <lb/>then died away, like the last sound of an Eolian harp, and
	    <lb/>again rose with a wild and thrilling pathos, which made
	    <lb/>the listener shiver with undefinable sensations.</p>
          <p><persName>O'Carroll</persName> thought in this strange music he could dis­
	    <lb/>tinguish an articulation of words, though they seemed
	    <lb/>to him disconnected and imperfect; and, unable to
	    <lb/>restrain his impatient curiosity, he was on the point of
	    <lb/>leaping into the ravine, in order to discover the being
	    <lb/>who awakened these mysterious strains; and had ac­
	    <lb/>tually advanced several steps with that intention, when
	    <lb/>the voice rose almost to a scream, and the words, <said>For­
	      <lb/>bear! forbear!</said> distinctly pronounced, and in an accent
	    <lb/>of mingled entreaty and command, arrested his progress.
	    <lb/>It then murmured in a low and melancholy tone, words
	    <lb/>so intelligible, that it was impossible to mistake them.</p>
          <p><said>Return! return!</said> it said. <said>Death lurks in the
	      <lb/>dark valley!</said> And this warning, several times repeat­
	    <lb/>ed, inspired <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> with feelings of awe and
	    <lb/>astonishment. By no means free from the superstitious
	    <lb/>feelings which characterize his nation, he felt himself
	    <lb/>yielding to the belief that he was addressed by an un­
	    <lb/>earthly being, and, impressed with momentary solem­
	    <lb/>nity, he remained silent and motionless as a statue.</p>
          <p><persName>Ronald</persName>, his servant, pale with terror, was already on
	    <lb/>his knees, crossing himself, and muttering prayers and
	    <lb/>spells against the power of evil spirits, while <persName>William</persName>, a
	    <lb/>native of sturdy <placeName>New-England</placeName>, looked at him, with in­
	    <lb/>expressible contempt, and was only restrained by the
	    <lb/>fear of <persName>Captain O'Carroll's</persName> displeasure, from rushing
	    <lb/>boldly into the ravine, and attempting to discover the
	    <lb/>invisible musician.</p>

          <p>The reverential feeling, which threatened to subdue
	    <lb/><persName>O'Carroll's</persName> daring, was of transient continuance, and,
	    <lb/>rousing himself to encounter whatever it was that ad­
	    <lb/>dressed him, he resolutely exclaimed, in answer to the
	    <lb/>exhortation of the invisible being,</p>
          <p>
            <said>And why should I return? I fear not death, and
	      <lb/>am resolved to search the valley.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>Return! return, friend of the dark-eyed warrior,</said><lb/>again chanted the voice. <said>Return, before thou art
	      <lb/>taken in the toils which are spread for thee!</said></p>
          <p><said>Answer me, whoever thou art,</said> exclaimed <persName>O'Car­
	      <lb/>roll</persName>, again yielding to the influence of superstitious
	    <lb/>emotions, as he listened to the mysterious warning,
	    <lb/>which issued from among the pointed rocks and thick
	    <lb/>underbrush of the ravine. <said>Speak!</said> he continued, in
	    <lb/>a tone of eager yet fearful inquiry, <said>and inform me if
	      <lb/>you know aught of <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, and where I may
	      <lb/>hope to find him?</said></p>
          <p><said>Depart! depart!</said> chanted the low, sweet voice.
	    <lb/><said>Death lurks in the dark valley! Seek it not again, if
	      <lb/>thou dost love his life or thine own!</said></p>
          <p><said>He lives then!</said> cried <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>tell me but
	      <lb/>where, and I will encounter danger and death itself to
	      <lb/>rescue him.</said></p>
          <p>The voice did not, as before respond to this entreaty;
	    <lb/>and, after waiting a few moments, <persName>O'Carroll</persName> repeated
	    <lb/>the question. But still it remained mute, nor uttered
	    <lb/>any reply either to this, or any other of the numerous
	    <lb/>demands which the Captain put, in rapid succession, to
	    <lb/>the unseen spirit. Irritated by this unexpected silence,
	    <lb/>which gave so sad a check to his suddenly excited
	    <lb/>hopes, the awe, which had transiently subdued his na­
	    <lb/>tive impetuosity fled, and no longer master of himself,
	    <lb/>he drew his sword from its scabbard, and rushed into
	    <lb/>the ravine, exclaiming, <said>now, be thou man, woman, or
	      <lb/>fiend, I will know why it is that thou mockest me thus!</said></p>
          <p><persName>William</persName> boldly followed him, and <persName>Ronald</persName>, though pale
	    <lb/>with fear, grasped the rifle which he carried, and kept
	    <lb/>within view of his master.</p>

          <mw type="pageNum">175</mw>
          <p><persName>O'Carroll</persName> sprang upon the broad point of a jutting
	    <lb/>crag, which was partially concealed by a clump of alders
	    <lb/>that grew thickly before it, and from among which, as
	    <lb/>well as he could judge, the voice had seemed to pro­
	    <lb/>ceed. With his sword he cut away the matted boughs
	    <lb/>of the alders, and plunged into the centre of the tangled
	    <lb/>copse; but not a vestige of any human being was dis­
	    <lb/>coverable, and though he investigated every spot in the
	    <lb/>ravine, which he imagined might serve for a lurking-
	    <lb/>place, all were as tranquil and as still, as if now for the
	    <lb/>first time invaded by the daring steps of man. In the
	    <lb/>most impassioned accents he alternately threatened and
	    <lb/>implored the invisible being, who had addressed him,
	    <lb/>again to utter some word which might reveal to him its
	    <lb/>own nature, or direct him in his search after the lost
	    <lb/><persName>Grahame</persName>. But all was vain; the voice remained ob­
	    <lb/>stinately mute; and dispirited and agitated by contend­
	    <lb/>ing emotions, he at length quitted the ravine, resolved
	    <lb/>never again to return to it. The longer, however,
	    <lb/>he dwelt upon the singular occurrence which had befall­
	    <lb/>en him, the stronger became his desire once more to
	    <lb/>revisit the scene of his adventure; and accordingly on
	    <lb/>the following morning he repaired thither, attended by
	    <lb/><persName>William</persName>, whose firm heart and stout limbs rendered
	    <lb/>him a stranger to fear, and made him ever ready and
	    <lb/>willing to encounter man or ghost in open combat.
	    <lb/><persName>Ronald</persName>, notwithstanding his strong attachment to his
	    <lb/>master, could not be prevailed on to accompany him.
	    <lb/>He was firm in the belief that an unearthly being had
	    <lb/>addressed them from the ravine, whose wrath it was pre­
	    <lb/>sumptuous, in mortal man, to provoke by despising its
	    <lb/>warnings, and adventuring there again in violation of
	    <lb/>its injunction.</p>
          <p><persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, however, received no reproof from
	    <lb/>the unknown being for his temerity; and, though his
	    <lb/>visit was unavailing, for the voice was not again heard,
	    <lb/>he returned unharmed from the forest. His mind was
	    <lb/>deeply occupied with the affair, and, full as it was of
	    <lb/>mystery, he found all his endeavors to explain it ineffectual.
	    <lb/>It might, perhaps, be only a foolish trick, which some
	    <pb n="176"/><milestone unit="sig" n="15(4)v"/><mw type="pageNum">176</mw><lb/>one had played off upon him: or it <emph>might</emph> be,—and he
	    <lb/>laughed at himself for yielding to an impression so im­
	    <lb/>probable,—and yet it was possible it might be a super­
	    <lb/>natural warning, to preserve him from some threatened
	    <lb/>danger. Such things had been; and, prone as his
	    <lb/>nation were to a belief in the superstitious relative to
	    <lb/>beings of another world, it is no matter of wonder, that
	    <lb/>the fervid imagination of <persName>O'Carroll</persName> should attach ideas
	    <lb/>of such a nature, to the wild and thrilling voice, which
	    <lb/>had so impressively commanded him to forbear his
	    <lb/>visits to the valley, where danger and death awaited
	    <lb/>him. But he communicated these feelings of awe to
	    <lb/>no one; and, though they deepened with every new
	    <lb/>retrospect of the occurrence, he affected to ridicule the
	    <lb/>superstitious fears of <persName>Ronald</persName>, and hinted, that, in all
	    <lb/>probability, it was the contrivance of some mischievous
	    <lb/>person, who wished to amuse himself at their expence.</p>
          <p>Wearied with his residence at <placeName>Saratoga</placeName>, and hopeless
	    <lb/>of discovering <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, though secretly per­
	    <lb/>suaded that he was still in existence, <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>
	    <lb/>at length took his departure for <placeName>Albany</placeName>; and, having
	    <lb/>passed a couple of days under the hospitable roof of
	    <lb/><persName>Richard Hope</persName>, embarked on board an armed sloop,
	    <lb/>which was to convey some other officers, who by the
	    <lb/>late surrender had become prisoners of war, to <placeName>New
	    <lb/>York</placeName>, whither they were permitted to go on their parole.
	    <lb/>He remai<choice><sic>m</sic><corr>n</corr></choice>ed in that city but a few hours, when he
	    <lb/>quitted it for <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, then in possession of the
	    <lb/><name>British</name>, from whence, on the day succeeding his arrival,
	    <lb/>he proceeded to the residence of <persName>Major Courtland</persName>.</p>
          <p>It was a bright day near the middle of <date when="1777-11"><name>November</name></date>,
	    <lb/>mild and pleasant for the season, that <persName>Captain O'Car­
	      <lb/>roll</persName> approached the dwelling of his friend. As he rode
	    <lb/>up the long avenue of stately trees, which led to the
	    <lb/>house, he perceived two ladies on the piazza, one of
	    <lb/>whom he soon recognized as <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>, while
	    <lb/>the other, by her deep mourning dress, he imagined to
	    <lb/>be <persName>Miss Dunbar</persName>. The moment she observed the horse­
	    <lb/>man, she retired precipitately into the house, but <persName>Cath­
	      <lb/>erine</persName> did not accompany her; she advanced to the edge of
	    <pb n="177"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="15(5)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">177</mw>
	    <lb/>the piazza and stood watching, with interest and anxiety,
	    <lb/>his progress up the avenue, which by its frequent wind­
	    <lb/>ing concealed him one moment from her view, and the
	    <lb/>next presented him full before her. <persName>O'Carroll</persName> urged
	    <lb/>forward his horse, and soon reached the termination of
	    <lb/>his ride; when, leaping from the saddle, he threw the
	    <lb/>reins to his servant, and advanced hastily towards <persName>Miss
	    <lb/>Courtland</persName>.</p>
          <p><said><persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, is it indeed you?</said> she exclaim­
	    <lb/>ed, while a glow of pleasure crimsoned her cheek, and
	    <lb/>she extended her hand towards him, with a smile of
	    <lb/>affectionate welcome.</p>
          <p><said>Yes, I am, at last, so happy as to see you again,</said><lb/>he replied, accepting her offered hand, and pressing it,
	    <lb/>with the fervor of sincere pleasure, between his own.</p>
          <p><said>I thought, I hoped, it must be you,</said> said <persName>Cathe­
	      <lb/>rine</persName>; <said>indeed, we have long impatiently expected you,
	      <lb/>and wondered at your continued absence; and now you
	      <lb/>have at last arrived, I hope you will not weary of our
	      <lb/>quiet life, and wish to quit us for more bustling scenes.</said></p>
          <p><said>Trust me for that, <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>;</said> returned
	    <lb/><persName>O'Carroll</persName>. <said>Dearly as I love bustle and variety, I
	      <lb/>have had enough of them in the course of my last
	      <lb/>campaign, to make me willing now to endure a winter
	      <lb/>of warmth and quiet. There is danger of my learning
	      <lb/>to love it better than a soldier has a right to do. But
	      <lb/>how is the Major, <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>? well, I hope, after
	      <lb/>his hard service.</said></p>
          <p><said>Not quite so well as I could wish, <persName>Captain O'Car­
		<lb/>roll</persName>,</said> answered <persName>Catherine</persName>; <said>but all I trust will be right
	      <lb/>now you have come to cheer him with your presence.
	      <lb/>He has ridden out this morning, though he went rather
	      <lb/>reluctantly; for he seemed to cherish a presentiment of
	      <lb/>your arrival; but he will return soon, I think.</said></p>
          <p><said>I have much to say to him,</said> returned <persName>O'Carroll</persName>;
	    <lb/><said>much that will deeply interest him.</said></p>
          <p>He stopped abruptly and looked at <persName>Catherine</persName>; her
	    <lb/>eyes were bent upon the ground, and the glow had
	    <lb/>faded from her cheek. He was thinking of <persName>Grahame</persName>,
	    <lb/>and he saw that her mind was filled with the same ob­
	    <pb n="178"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="15(5)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">178</mw>
	    <lb/>ject; yet she did not inquire concerning him, and
	    <lb/><persName>O'Carroll</persName> was reluctant to inform her, that the fate of
	    <lb/>their gallant friend was still shrouded in mystery. But
	    <lb/>while he hesitated in what manner to communicate his
	    <lb/>unwelcome intelligence, <persName>Catherine</persName> raised her eyes to
	    <lb/>his face, as if to read there the tidings, which she dar­
	    <lb/>ed not ask to hear. But when she encountered his
	    <lb/>troubled glance, her color rapidly varied, and making
	    <lb/>a sudden effort she said in a hurried and anxious voice,</p>
          <p><said>I fear I read in your countenance, <persName>Captain O'Car­
		<lb/>roll</persName> the fruitlessness of your continued residence at
	      <lb/><placeName>Saratoga</placeName>. He—<persName>Colonel Grahame</persName></said>—she stopped, and
	    <lb/>blushing deeply at her embarrassment, resumed in a
	    <lb/>calmer tone,—<said>Have you, sir, during this long interval,
	      <lb/>been able to discover <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, or to gain any
	      <lb/>intelligence, which may throw light on the mystery of
	      <lb/>his singular disappearance!</said></p>
          <p><said>None, not the least, my dear <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>;
	      <lb/>and it makes me miserable to say so;</said> replied <persName>O'Car­
	      <lb/>roll</persName>, and turning from her he walked hastily to the op­
	    <lb/>posite end of the piazza. The trampling of horses,
	    <lb/>and the appearance of <persName>Major Courtland</persName> riding up the
	    <lb/>avenue, followed by his faithful <persName>Hugh</persName>, recalled <persName>O'Car­
	      <lb/>roll</persName> to the side of <persName>Catherine</persName>. The Major no sooner
	      <lb/>recognized his young friend, than he put spurs to his
	      <lb/>horse, and, in a minute more, reached the bottom of
	    <lb/>the steps, on which the Captain was standing to receive
	    <lb/>him.</p>
          <p><said>My dear fellow, I am heartily rejoiced to see you,</said><lb/>he exclaimed, as he threw himself almost with youthful
	    <lb/>agility from his horse, and embraced <persName>O'Carroll</persName> with
	    <lb/>the joy and tenderness of a father.</p>
          <p><said>Upon my word, my dear boy,</said> he continued, <said>the
	      <lb/>sight of you has already taken ten years from my age;
	      <lb/>for I could not yesterday, as <persName>Kate</persName> well knows, have
	      <lb/>leaped from my gay steed with so much youthful grace
	      <lb/>and vigor, as I have now done, to testify my joy at
	      <lb/>your long wished for arrival.</said></p>
          <p><said>Thank you, sir,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>but you for­
	      <lb/>get,</said> he added, smiling, <said>the fox hunt at <placeName>Skenesbo­

	      <lb/>rough</placeName>, Major; when the most noted sportsman in
	      <lb/>the three kingdoms would have made a stand at the
	      <lb/>formidable root fences, which you cleared at a single
	      <lb/>leap, in despite of the hundred heads and arms, which,
	      <lb/>like the famed <persName>Briareus</persName> of old, they reared to oppose
	      <lb/>your passage.</said></p>
          <p><said>I have borne the brunt of battle since that time,</said><lb/>said the Major, <said>and reaped none of its laurels to
	      <lb/>shade the locks, which time has whitened. But a
	      <lb/>truce to this grating theme, and tell us where you have
	      <lb/>been this age, and what tidings you bring us of <persName>Gra­
		<lb/>hame</persName>.</said></p>
          <p><said rend="post()">None, sir;<choice><sic/><corr>”</corr></choice></said> <choice><sic>”</sic><corr/></choice>said 
	    <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>all my endeavors
	      <lb/>to trace him have been ineffectual. What involves the
	      <lb/>affair in still greater darkness, is that the <name>Indian</name>
	      <lb/><persName>Ohmeina</persName> has also disappeared, and we can only con­
	      <lb/>jecture that he has proved treacherous, or that they
	      <lb/>have both fallen into the power of malignant enemies.</said></p>
          <p><said>It is all an exceedingly strange affair,</said> said <persName>Major
	    <lb/>Courtland</persName>; then after a few moments of silent musing
	    <lb/>he added. <said>But come in, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, and we will hear
	      <lb/>your adventures. I know not why we stand here so
	      <lb/>long; the air is growing chilly, and your eyes, <persName>Kate</persName>, are
	      <lb/>red with the cold; or it may be, girl,</said> he added, looking
	    <lb/>earnestly at her,<choice><sic>”</sic><corr/></choice> <said rend="pre()"><choice><sic/><corr>“</corr></choice>you have been shedding tears of joy
	      <lb/>for <persName>Captain O'Carroll's</persName> arrival.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> blushed, but replied with gaiety,</p>
          <p>
            <said>And since you came so near it yourself, father, you
	      <lb/>cannot wonder at my sensibility. But let us go in, be­
	      <lb/>fore this cold wind forces me to a farther display of it.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>It is indeed quite time to perform the rites of
	      <lb/>hospitality,</said> said the Major; <said>for I see by <persName>O'Carroll's</persName>
	      <lb/>riding dress, that he has not crossed our threshold yet.
	      <lb/>So lead the way, <persName>Kate</persName>, and order refreshments; my
	      <lb/>ride has given a sharp edge to my appetite, and I
	      <lb/>well remember the Captain's dread of famine, while at
	      <lb/><placeName>Saratoga</placeName>.</said></p>
          <p><persName>O'Carroll</persName> smiled, and followed the Major into a
	    <lb/>large parlor, where a bright fire was blazing high to re­

	    <lb/>ceive them. The books, the work table, and the
	    <lb/>musical instruments, proclaimed it the usual sitting­
	    <lb/>room of the family. The beautiful plants which lined
	    <lb/>the windows, and were disposed about the apartment,
	    <lb/>filled it with fragrance, and gave to it an air of cheer­
	    <lb/>ful elegance, which the finest decorations of art could
	    <lb/>not so gracefully have bestowed. These sweet and
	    <lb/>simple children of <persName>Flora</persName> bring the odours of spring
	    <lb/>into our houses, and by every silken petal which un­

          <p>While partaking of the refreshments, which <persName>Cathe­
	      <lb/>rine</persName> had ordered, <persName>Major Courtland</persName> resumed the subject
	    <lb/>of <persName>Colonel Grahame's</persName> disappearance.</p>
          <p><said>I thought,</said> he said, <said>after writing us word that
	      <lb/>you should be with us soon, to have seen you before
	      <lb/>we left <placeName>Albany</placeName>; and, induced by that hope, we pro­
	      <lb/>tracted the period of our departure, till the increasing
	      <lb/>cold reminded me of our long journey; when I was
	      <lb/>compelled, from prudential motives, to come off with
	      <lb/>my two girls, and leave you to follow at leisure.</said></p>
          <p><said>The hope of discovering the fate of <persName>Colonel Gra­
		<lb/>hame</persName>,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, <said>beguiled me from day to
	      <lb/>day, and induced me frequently to explore the ravine,
	      <lb/>where, as you may recollect, we discovered the Indian
	      <lb/>wigwam, and also to penetrate into other parts of the
	      <lb/>forest, where it was possible we might find some clue
	      <lb/>to the fate of the unfortunate <persName>Grahame</persName>.</said></p>
          <p><said>But you met with no success?</said> asked the Major.</p>
          <p><said>With no positive success,</said> returned <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,
	    <lb/><said>but, in one of my last visits to the ravine, with an
	      <lb/>adventure so singular, that I wish to ask your opinion
	      <lb/>of what has caused me no little perplexity.</said></p>
          <p><said>Let us hear it, without farther preface, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,</said><lb/>said the Major. <said>By that look of solemnity, so un­
	      <lb/>usual with you, and which sits but ill on your merry
	      <lb/>countenance, I am already prepared to expect some
	      <lb/>wonderful relation.</said></p>

          <milestone unit="sig" n="16(1)r"/>
          <mw type="pageNum">181</mw>
          <p><said>Wonderful as it may appear to you,</said> returned
	    <lb/><persName>O'Carroll</persName>, <said>I promise to relate only what I heard, and
	      <lb/>that without exaggeration. If my ears deceived me,
	      <lb/>those too of <persName>Ronald</persName> and <persName>William</persName> were equally false;
	      <lb/>for they listened with surprise to the same mysterious
	      <lb/>sounds.</said></p>
          <p>He then proceeded to give an account of his visit to
	    <lb/>the ravine, of the music, and the warning words of the
	    <lb/>invisible being, though in relating the facts, he threw
	    <lb/>over them all that height of coloring, with which his
	    <lb/>excited imagination was inclined to invest the occur­
	    <lb/>rence.</p>
          <p><persName>Major Courtland</persName> heard him through in silence, and
	    <lb/>though a lurking smile betrayed his desire to burst
	    <lb/>forth into ridicule, he restrained himself till <persName>O'Carroll</persName>
	    <lb/>ceased speaking: and then, unable any longer to sub­
	    <lb/>due his risable propensity, indulged himself, to the ex­
	    <lb/>treme chagrin and mortification of the Captain, in a
	    <lb/>violent fit of laughter.</p>
          <p><said>Upon my honor,</said> he exclaimed, so soon as he had
	    <lb/>recovered sufficient composure to speak intelligibly—
	    <lb/><said>Upon my honor, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, this is a tale worthy to
	      <lb/>grace the legends of the nursery! Why, man, the
	      <lb/>wonderful history of <persName>Aladdin's</persName> Lamp, or the still more
	      <lb/>edifying and instructive relation of the <name>White Cat</name>,
	      <lb/>who was transformed into the most beautiful princess
	      <lb/>of the age, cannot be compared to it. <said>The Invisible
		<lb/>Lady of the Glen, a true relation of a marvellous oc­
		<lb/>currence in <placeName>North America</placeName>, witnessed and attested by
		<lb/><persName>Philip O'Carroll</persName>, Captain in his Majesty's――regi­
		<lb/>ment of foot, and dedicated, by special permission, to</said>
	      <lb/>――whomsoever you may choose. What say you
	      <lb/>to this, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>. It will tell well of the American
	      <lb/>forests, and make you as renowned as</said>――</p>
          <p><said>Dear father!</said> interrupted <persName>Catherine</persName>, looking, first
	    <lb/>at <persName>O'Carroll's</persName> crimsoned face, with concern, and then
	    <lb/>at her father, with amazement; <said>you do not right to
	      <lb/>treat with so much ridicule what <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>
	      <lb/>has related. Indeed, sir, I see nothing improbable in
	      <lb/>it; nothing but what may readily be believed, after the
	    <mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(+3)">16</mw>

	      <lb/>still more surprising mystery of <persName>Colonel Grahame's</persName> dis­
	      <lb/>appearance.</said></p>
          <p><said>Improbable and extravagant as it may appear, <persName>Miss
	      <lb/>Courtland</persName>, I assure you it is strictly true,</said> said <persName>O'Car­
	      <lb/>roll</persName>; <said>and even the Major, when he has amused him­
	      <lb/>self long enough at my expense, will not refuse to yield
	      <lb/>it the credit it certainly deserves.</said></p>
          <p><said>And have I yet attempted to deny its truth or pro­
	      <lb/>bability?</said> asked the Major, smoothing his features into
	    <lb/>composure. <said>Have I not rather placed it at the head
	      <lb/>of all the marvels of this or preceding ages, and de­
	      <lb/>clared it worthy to be bound in gilt and morocco, for
	      <lb/>the edification of future generations?</said></p>
          <p><said>You have thought proper to turn it into perfect
	      <lb/>ridicule, sir,</said> said the Captain, with an air of pique;
	    <lb/><said>but you cannot alter the facts which I have related,
	      <lb/>or induce me to believe that I was imposed upon by
	      <lb/>the delusion of an over-wrought imagination.</said></p>
          <p><said>Nor do I believe so myself,</said> returned the Major,
	    <lb/>with a countenance which had recovered its natural
	    <lb/>seriousness of expression. <said>But I do think it the trick
	      <lb/>of some blockhead, who had a mind, either to end
	      <lb/>your search, or else to amuse himself at your expense.
	      <lb/>Depend upon it, my dear fellow, this is the true secret
	      <lb/>of the mystery. The sprites who dwell in our Ameri­
	      <lb/>can forests are not so civil, as those which haunt the
	      <lb/>dells and thickets of the mother country. They warn
	      <lb/>and prophesy, from their murky recesses, till they are
	      <lb/>hoarse, while ours like ill-bred goblins, as they are,
	      <lb/>flee from the face of mortal man, and preserve a
	      <lb/>silence so invincible, that, till now, I never saw the
	      <lb/>ears, which had drunk in the sound of their voices.</said></p>
          <p><persName>O'Carroll</persName> looked displeased, and the Major, observ­
	    <lb/>ing it, checked the vein of satire, in which he was again
	    <lb/>involuntarily indulging, and said in a serious tone,</p>
          <p>
            <said>Really, <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, I see no reason why
	      <lb/>you should reflect, with any mixture of awe, upon this
	      <lb/>occurrence. Strange as it may appear to you, still I
	      <lb/>cannot, for a moment, believe that any unearthly
	      <pb n="183"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="16(2)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">183</mw>
	      <lb/>agency has been employed in it. Take my word for
	      <lb/>it, the whole will prove a mere farce.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>Perhaps so, sir,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, coloring at the
	    <lb/>consciousness of having betrayed his superstitious feel­
	    <lb/>ings to the observance of the Major. <said>And yet I do
	      <lb/>and must believe, that this warning, from whomsoever
	      <lb/>it might come, had some intimate connexion with the
	      <lb/>fate of <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, since the voice distinctly re­
	      <lb/>plied in answer to my interrogations, <quote>If you regard
		<lb/>his life or your own, come not here again.</quote></said></p>
          <p><said>And yet you went the next day,</said> said the Major,
	    <lb/><said>and here you are alive and merry; or, at least, you
	      <lb/>ought to be merry; for you have made me so. And
	      <lb/>now fill your glass, and drink confusion to the enemies
	      <lb/>of the gallant <persName>Grahame</persName>, and then come with me to my
	      <lb/>library; I have something there to show you.</said></p>
          <p><persName>O'Carroll</persName> smiled, and glad to drop a subject, which
	    <lb/>had afforded the Major so much food for satire, said,
	    <lb/>as he filled his glass,</p>
          <p>
            <said>The toast has rather a treasonable import, Major;
	      <lb/>or perhaps you liked the confusion made among us by
	      <lb/>the rebels at <name>Saratoga</name> so well, that you are willing they
	      <lb/>should be as successful elsewhere.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>Confusion to yourself, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, for such a suspi­
	      <lb/>cion,</said> said the Major; <said>you know well, I mean only
	      <lb/>his personal enemies; and, were they <persName>Howe</persName>, <persName>Bur­
		<lb/>goyne</persName>, or <persName>Clinton</persName>, I would as soon wish their plans of
	      <lb/>evil against this brave fellow might be foiled, as if he
	      <lb/>were the sternest loyalist among us; and <persName>Gates</persName> or
	      <lb/><persName>Washington</persName> himself, were striving to injure and de­
	      <lb/>grade him.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> had risen, when her father began to speak,
	    <lb/>and stood at a window apparently engaged in training
	    <lb/>the slender shoots of a geranium upon a small trellis
	    <lb/>frame. But <persName>O'Carroll</persName> observed her deeply attentive
	    <lb/>to her father's words; he saw a richer glow mantle on
	    <lb/>her cheek, and remarked the expression of pleasure
	    <lb/>with which she fixed her eloquent eyes upon his face,
	    <lb/>as he concluded. The Major caught the look, and
	    <lb/>said with a smile,</p>

          <p>
            <said>My <persName>Kate</persName> approves that declaration, I know; or does
	      <lb/>she think it too liberal for a man, who has been beaten
	      <lb/>by these rebels, and is even now their prisoner?</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>Not too liberal for my dear father,</said> replied <persName>Cathe­
	      <lb/>rine</persName>. <said>He can admire, and do justice to the virtues of
	      <lb/>an enemy, and is too candid, and too generous to be
	      <lb/>swayed by the narrow prejudices of party, or the petty
	      <lb/>dislikes and jealousies of personal animosity.</said></p>
          <p><said>Thank you, <persName>Kate</persName>; and you will drink my toast,
	      <lb/>without cavilling about it as <persName>O'Carroll</persName> did,</said> said the
	    <lb/>Major.</p>
          <p><said>We will both drink confusion to the enemies of
	      <lb/><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, <said>and <quote>confusion
		<lb/>worse confounded</quote> to them, provided they are rebels.</said></p>
          <p><said>That is a superfluous addition, <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>,</said><lb/>said <persName>Catherine</persName>, as she raised her glass and repeated her
	    <lb/>father's toast.</p>
          <p><persName>O'Carroll</persName> slightly colored, but said with a smile,</p>
          <p>
            <said>It is so, I confess, <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>. I stand reprov­
	      <lb/>ed, and I would rather face the fire of a garrison, than
	      <lb/>merit the reproof of a lady.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>A harmless thing!</said> said the Major. <said>Mere words,
	      <lb/>at worst. At all events, never make so serious a matter
	      <lb/>of it, unless you mean my saucy <persName>Kate</persName> shall frown every
	      <lb/>time you chance to hum, <quote>God save the King,</quote> or huzza
	      <lb/>at the defeat of the rebels. See, the girl is laughing
	      <lb/>now at your humility; so come with me, or the staunch
	      <lb/>little rebel will do her best to make you ashamed of
	      <lb/>your loyalty.</said></p>
          <p>The Major hurried him from the room, without giv­
	    <lb/>ing him time for any reply, and conducted him to the library,
	    <lb/>where they passed the remainder of the morning till
	    <lb/>dinner time. <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> had formerly some
	    <lb/>slight acquaintance with <persName>Colonel Dunbar</persName>, and he felt a
	    <lb/>desire to see his daughter, of whom he had often heard
	    <lb/>his friend, <persName>Captain Talbot</persName>, speak. He was, therefore,
	    <lb/>disappointed, when, on being summoned to dinner, he
	    <lb/>found <persName>Miss Courtland</persName> alone at the table. The Major
	    <lb/>inquired why his niece was not present, and <persName>Catherine</persName>,
	    <pb n="185"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="16(3)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">185</mw>
	    <lb/>in reply, said she was not quite well, and begged that
	    <lb/>her absence might be excused.</p>
          <p><said>Certainly,</said> said the Major,<choice><sic>”</sic><corr/></choice> <said rend="pre()"><choice><sic/><corr>“</corr></choice>if she prefers her own
	      <lb/>solitary room, she must be indulged in the whim, though
	      <lb/>I really think she would feel vastly better, if she would
	      <lb/>not so sedulously seclude herself from society, and
	      <lb/>every rational enjoyment.</said></p>
          <p><said>I hope,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName> <said>it is not my presence,
	      <lb/>which banishes <persName>Miss Dunbar</persName> from the family circle.</said></p>
          <p><said>She will soon learn to consider you, as an inmate,</said><lb/>said the Major; <said>but indeed, the poor girl has been so
	      <lb/>deeply depressed, since the death of her father, that
	      <lb/>we have scarcely been able to draw her from her apart­
	      <lb/>ment. She is just beginning to revive from the first
	      <lb/>violence of grief, and I hope soon to see her restored
	      <lb/>to her accustomed serenity, though her loss was, in­
	      <lb/>deed, a heavy one, and to her it must be irreparable.</said></p>
          <p><said>Was not <persName>Colonel Dunbar</persName> killed in the battle of
	      <lb/><name>Germantown</name>?</said> asked <persName>O'Carroll</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>He was,</said> returned the Major, <said>and he died like a
	      <lb/>brave and gallant soldier. By the way, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, that
	      <lb/>attack upon <placeName>Germantown</placeName> was a daring thing, so soon
	      <lb/>after the beating our troops gave the rebels on the
	      <lb/><placeName>Brandywine</placeName>.</said></p>
          <p><said>But they were beaten, were they not?</said> asked the
	    <lb/>Captain.</p>
          <p><said>Yes, at last,</said> said the Major; <said>but not till they had
	      <lb/>given us a sound drubbing, and killed some of our best
	      <lb/>officers.</said></p>
          <p><said>And did they lose none themselves?</said> inquired
	    <lb/><persName>O'Carroll</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>They <emph>say</emph> their loss was inconsiderable,</said> replied
	    <lb/>the Major, <said>but it is known that several names of note
	      <lb/>were among the slain; and of this number was <persName>General
	      <lb/>Nash</persName> of <placeName>Carolina</placeName>, one of their ablest and most valuable
	      <lb/>officers.</said></p>
          <p><said>But you are aware father,</said> interrupted <persName>Catherine</persName>,
	    <lb/><said>that the royalists had every advantage over the conti­
	      <lb/>nental troops; for besides being perfectly familiar with
	      <lb/>the ground, they made a garrison of every house in the
	      <mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(+3)">16*</mw>
	      <pb n="186"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="16(3)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">186</mw>
	      <lb/>town, from whence they took good aim at the enemy,
	      <lb/>and remained in comparative security themselves.</said></p>
          <p><said>That statement may be correct, <persName>Kate</persName>,</said> said her
	    <lb/>father, <said>but I have some doubts concerning its authen­
	      <lb/>ticity. The brave <persName>Colonel Musgrave</persName>, I know, threw
	      <lb/>himself into a large stone house, and battered the enemy
	      <lb/>manfully through the windows; and maintained his
	      <lb/>post too, in despite of the cannon which was brought to
	      <lb/>the assault, till <persName>Generals Grey</persName> and <persName>Agnew</persName> came up to
	      <lb/>his relief; the latter of whom was unhappily slain in the
	      <lb/>contest. But, that they made a garrison of every house
	      <lb/>in the town, remains to be proved.</said></p>
          <p><said>Well, sir,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName> laughing, <said>since you
	      <lb/>have bestowed such high encomiums on the conduct of
	      <lb/><persName>Colonel Musgrave</persName>, you ought, in order to support your
	      <lb/>character for impartiality, to bestow a share of praise
	      <lb/>on the bravery of the <name>Americans</name>, who, if report says
	      <lb/>true, earned many laurels in that bloody conflict.</said></p>
          <p><said>I know little about that, <persName>Kate</persName>,</said> said the Major;
	    <lb/><said>let those who will, give credence to every flying rumor;
	      <lb/>I am slow of belief. But I know this, that the <name>Ameri­
	      <lb/>cans</name> were completely routed, and driven many miles
	      <lb/>by our victorious troops.</said></p>
          <p><said>But they were not so much terrified, as to desert
	      <lb/>their cannon,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, <said>which they took good
	      <lb/>care to bring off with them. And you know, father, it
	      <lb/>is said that, had it not been for the thick fog, and the
	      <lb/>smoke occasioned by the burning of some stubble fields,
	      <lb/>which our troops had set on fire, the republicans would
	      <lb/>have gained a complete victory.</said></p>
          <p><said>No I do not know any such thing,</said> said the Major,
	    <lb/>provoked at her defence of the <name>Americans</name>, <said>and since
	      <lb/>you seem so familiar with all the minutiæ of the affair,
	      <lb/>I will thank you to inform me what the smoke and fog
	      <lb/>had to do with the defeat of the <name>Americans</name>.</said></p>
          <p><said>It enabled the British troops to recover from the
	      <lb/>surprise of an attack so unexpected,</said> returned the un­
	    <lb/>daunted girl, <said>and prevented the <name>Americans</name> from dis­
	      <lb/>covering their true situation. And what was worse it
	      <lb/>rendered it almost impossible for the <name>Americans</name> to dis­
	      <pb n="187"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="16(4)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">187</mw>
	      <lb/>tinguish their own troops from those of the enemy, and
	      <lb/>thus prevented the possibility of their different parties
	      <lb/>acting in concert; and in other ways also greatly embar­
	      <lb/>rassed them.</said></p>
          <p><said>Upon my word, <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>,</said> exclaimed
	    <lb/><persName>O'Carroll</persName>, <said>this defeat of the rebels, as you discribe it,
	      <lb/>is as glorious as a victory. Would you be equally favor­
	      <lb/>able to us, in an account of the <date when="1777-10-07">seventh of <name>October</name></date> at
	      <lb/><placeName>Saratoga</placeName>, we might yet deserve a few leaves of the lau­
	      <lb/>rel to bind on our dishonored brows.</said></p>
          <p><said>If the girl denies our right to them, when really
	      <lb/>victorious,</said> said the Major, <said>not even a stalk will she
	      <lb/>grant us, when defeated and prisoners too. But how
	      <lb/>know you, <persName>Kate</persName>,</said> he added, addressing her, <said>that there
	      <lb/>was the least chance for the rebels to gain a victory in
	      <lb/>this affair of <name>Germantown</name>, had the fog and smoke not
	      <lb/>given them so good an excuse for running away.</said></p>
          <p><said>Why sir,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, <said>the advanced party of
	      <lb/>the <name>Americans</name>, commanded by <persName>General Sullivan</persName>, I
	      <lb/>think, attacked the pickets of the <name>British</name>, with such
	      <lb/>determined bravery and spirit, that they were soon
	      <lb/>forced, and the troops stationed near them were oblig­
	      <lb/>ed to retreat. This first and great advantage gained,
	      <lb/>would probably have decided the contest in their favor,
	      <lb/>had the morning been clear, so as to have given them
	      <lb/>a distinct view of the number and situation of the
	      <lb/>enemy.</said></p>
          <p><said>And who was so kind as to give you all this in­
	      <lb/>formation?</said> asked the Major. <said>One would almost
	      <lb/>suspect you of holding secret correspondence with the
	      <lb/>enemy; you seem so well acquainted with particulars,
	      <lb/>which, I am sure, are quite new to me.</said></p>
          <p><said>But had you as much curiosity as I have, father,</said><lb/>she replied, <said>you might have known all, and more than
	      <lb/>I do, a week ago. I am indebted to the American
	      <lb/>officer who was here, one morning, when you were out,
	      <lb/>for the particulars which I have detailed.</said></p>
          <p><said>And an insolent booby for his pains!</said> exclaimed
	    <lb/>the Major. <said>To come boasting, forsooth, to the daugh­
	      <lb/>ter of a British officer, of his valiant deeds in arms, and
	    <pb n="188"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="16(4)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">188</mw>
	      <lb/>insulting her by the declaration, that he would have
	      <lb/>beat her countrymen, had they not hidden themselves
	      <lb/>in a fog!</said></p>
          <p><said>Father, you do the young man great injustice,</said><lb/>said <persName>Catherine</persName> warmly. <said>He did not even speak of
	      <lb/>the affair, till I questioned him concerning it. For, as
	      <lb/>my uncle <persName>Dunbar</persName> lost his life at <name>Germantown</name>, I felt
	      <lb/>more than usual interest in the action which took place
	      <lb/>there; but it was only from the short and general ac­
	      <lb/>count which the officer gave me, that I drew the in­
	      <lb/>ference, which I have named.</said></p>
          <p><said>A most natural inference truly!</said> said the Major;
	    <lb/><said>at least, natural enough for any little whig, like you,
	      <lb/><persName>Kate</persName>, who think you can never sufficiently admire the
	      <lb/>valor of these fighting rebels. But I am rather inclin­
	      <lb/>ed to believe they are much indebted to this friendly
	      <lb/>fog, which gave them so good an excuse for quitting
	      <lb/>the field alive; which, I much doubt, if they could
	      <lb/>have done in clear day-light; not that they cannot
	      <lb/>fight,</said> he hastily added, conscious of the illiberality of
	    <lb/>his remark, <said>but the attack, in this instance, was, as I
	      <lb/>think, impolitic, and the odds against them so great,
	      <lb/>that their chance of success, even had they fought like
	      <lb/>lions, could have been but small.</said></p>
          <p><said>And is this all the fighting, which has happened of
	      <lb/>late?</said> asked the Captain. <said>And what is doing, or
	      <lb/>about to be done now?</said></p>
          <p><said>We have not been at home, long enough to have
	      <lb/>gathered much information,</said> returned the Major. <said>In­
	      <lb/>deed, nothing worthy of note has occurred, that I know
	      <lb/>of, except it be a movement of part of the royal army,
	      <lb/>across the <placeName>Delaware</placeName>, to a place called <placeName>Billingsport</placeName>,
	      <lb/>where their cooperation with other forces indicating
	      <lb/>some offensive measure, the republicans sent <persName>General
	      <lb/>Greene</persName>, with a strong detachment, to bring them back.
	      <lb/>And he unfortunately succeeded in his attempt. They
	      <lb/>returned immediately to <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, when the rebels
	      <lb/>also came back to their camps and are now preparing
	      <lb/>to go into winter quarters. At least so I have heard;
	      <lb/>but I will not vouch for the correctness of my inform­
	      <pb n="189"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="16(5)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">189</mw>
	      <lb/>ation, as I am so conscientious a prisoner, that I make
	      <lb/>few inquiries, even when I have an opportunity, which
	      <lb/>is, indeed, not often. You must go to <persName>Kate</persName>, if you
	      <lb/>want to know these things; she gets all the news, in
	      <lb/>some way or other, and will make you believe that the
	      <lb/>cause of rebellion is the one, which will at last win
	      <lb/>the palm of victory.</said></p>
          <p><said>Triumph, while you may, <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>,</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>for, notwithstanding the <emph>honorable</emph> retire­
	      <lb/>ment, which we veterans of <name>Saratoga</name> are permitted to
	      <lb/>enjoy, it will surely be our turn at last. The forces of
	      <lb/>his Britannic Majesty are not always to be repulsed,
	      <lb/>and they have yet the shame of our defeat to wash
	      <lb/>away with the blood of these rebels, before they quit
	      <lb/>the continent. Indeed, their present situation, seems
	      <lb/>to me an earnest of complete success;—lodged in the
	      <lb/>very capital of the confederation, from whence they
	      <lb/>have driven the rebels to seek for quarters where they
	      <lb/>can find them, while the dignified Congress itself has
	      <lb/>been forced to flee for safety to the northern extremity
	      <lb/>of the state!</said></p>
          <p><said>Yes, and a glorious entry our loyal troops made into
	      <lb/>the city,</said> said <persName>Major Courtland</persName>. <said><persName>Captain Talbot</persName> told
	      <lb/>me, the British and Hessian grenadiers, with a detach­
	      <lb/>ment of royal artillery and a party of light dragoons,
	      <lb/>accompanied by <persName>Lord Cornwallis</persName> and many other
	      <lb/>officers of distinction, entered it in triumph, and took
	      <lb/>formal possession, with great pomp; while the music
	      <lb/>played <quote>God save the king,</quote> and the ladies showered
	      <lb/>flowers, and waved white handkerchiefs from the win­
	      <lb/>dows, to welcome the approach of the conquerors.</said></p>
          <p><said>And yet,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, <said>I doubt if there was
	      <lb/>half the real glory in this triumphal entrance of the
	      <lb/>royal army into a conquered, or rather a deserted city,
	      <lb/>that there was in that one simple act of the American
	      <lb/>General, <persName>Gates</persName>, who with a noble delicacy of feeling,
	      <lb/>which did him more honor than the victory he had
	      <lb/>won, withdrew his troops into their lines, that they
	      <lb/>might not even <emph>seem</emph> to triumph, in the humiliation of
	      <lb/>their conquered foes, by gazing on them while they
	    <pb n="190"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="16(5)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">190</mw>
	      <lb/>performed the mortifying ceremony of piling the arms,
	      <lb/>which by the laws of war they had justly forfeited.</said></p>
          <p><said>It was a noble act, <persName>Kate</persName>, and it received a tribute
	      <lb/>of gratitude from every heart,</said> said the Major; <said>but I
	      <lb/>did not expect you would have it ready for a retort
	      <lb/>now; though I might have known your invention, if
	      <lb/>not your memory, would have furnished you with one.
	      <lb/>But without comparing the merits of the two parties,
	      <lb/>which we never can agree in doing, what say you to
	      <lb/><persName>Captain O'Carroll's</persName> suggestion, that it will shortly be
	      <lb/>our turn to triumph?</said></p>
          <p><said>That I hope and trust you will do so with modera­
	      <lb/>tion, when the moment arrives,</said> returned <persName>Catherine</persName>,
	    <lb/>smiling. <said>But really, father, I see no prospect of it
	      <lb/>very near. I confess myself an incompetent judge of
	      <lb/>these things, though I have interested myself enough in
	      <lb/>public events to know, that all the victories gained by
	      <lb/>the royal arms, during the past season, have been pro­
	      <lb/>ductive of no important results, and that even the pos­
	      <lb/>session of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, though it furnishes comfortable
	      <lb/>winter quarters for the army, is otherwise a matter of
	      <lb/>very small moment.</said></p>
          <p><said>Well, girl, enjoy your own opinion,</said> said the Ma­
	    <lb/>jor, <said>so you will not argue us out of ours, which strikes
	      <lb/>me as the more reasonable of the two.</said></p>
          <p><said>But not quite so strenuously defended, father,</said><lb/>said, <persName>Catherine</persName>, archly, <said>as it was wont to be, before
	      <lb/>these gallant rebels of the north softened your prejudi­
	      <lb/>ces, and</said>――</p>
          <p><said>Not an iota! not a particle, <persName>Kate</persName>!</said> interrupted the
	    <lb/>Major. <said>So never seek to persuade <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, that
	      <lb/>my loyalty has gone after my honor, or that these rebels
	      <lb/>have won my good wishes, because they suffered me
	      <lb/>to keep my sword, and come quietly home, under
	      <lb/>promise of peaceable behaviour for the future.</said></p>
          <p><said>Well, father,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName> still smiling, <said>I will
	      <lb/>not displease you by attempting to discover the reason,
	      <lb/>why you listen with so much more complacency, than
	      <lb/>you were wont to, when I bestow praises on the <name>Amer­
		<lb/>icans</name>; and do not even contradict me when I say they

	      <lb/>are both brave and virtuous; I will content myself with
	      <lb/>the humiliating supposition, that it is because you think
	      <lb/>me not worth the <emph>trouble</emph> of contradiction.</said></p>
          <p><said>True, <persName>Kate</persName>,</said> said her father, <said>you have hit upon
	      <lb/>the right reason. Your prattle is as harmless, as the
	      <lb/>silver bells with which you used to beat your nurse.</said></p>
          <p><said>But not as empty, father,</said> interrupted <persName>Catherine</persName>.
	    <lb/><said>Do not mortify me by saying so, and before <persName>Captain
	      <lb/>O'Carroll</persName> too.</said></p>
          <p><said>He can judge for himself, by this time, <persName>Kate</persName>,</said> said
	    <lb/>her father; <said>and I am greatly mistaken, if he is not
	      <lb/>already wearied by your whiggism.</said></p>
          <p><said>Pardon me, sir,</said> said the Captain, <said>I only fear,
	      <lb/>that my loyalty may be shaken by the arguments of so
	      <lb/>fair and eloquent a champion. No wonder the stand­
	      <lb/>ard of rebellion gathers its thousands around it, when
	      <lb/>the lips of beauty plead its cause, and repeat the praises
	      <lb/>of its brave and warlike leaders. Indeed, <persName>Major Court­
		<lb/>land</persName>, you must lend me your aid to resist the tempta­
	      <lb/>tions which beset me, or I had better follow the troops
	      <lb/>to <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, or even return to the deserted plain
	      <lb/>of <placeName>Saratoga</placeName>, and preserve my fidelity to my sovereign
	      <lb/>by dwelling on the remembrance of those disgraces,
	      <lb/>which the victorious rebels there brought upon his sol­
	      <lb/>diers.</said></p>
          <p><said>I will not force you to adopt either of these alter­
	      <lb/>natives, <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, laughing.
	    <lb/><said>I assure you, had I the power, I have not the wish to
	      <lb/>seduce you from your allegiance. Your sword is
	      <lb/>sheathed; and I should shudder as much to see it turn­
	      <lb/>ed against the hearts of your countrymen, as I have to
	      <lb/>know that my father's was red with the blood of those
	      <lb/>I call mine. Both must now remain inactive, and I
	      <lb/>only ask you to think without harshness, of the <name>Amer­
		<lb/>icans</name> and their cause.</said></p>
          <p><said>Of the <name>Americans</name> I think with admiration and res­
	      <lb/>pect,</said> returned <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>and there are individuals
	      <lb/>among them, for whom I entertain the most affection­
	      <lb/>ate regard. But you must pardon me, <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>,
	      <lb/>if I venture to deprecate their rebellion, and express
	      <pb n="192"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="16(6)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">192</mw>
	      <lb/>my wish that it may speedily be quelled by the power,
	      <lb/>to which they have been, and still ought to be in sub­
	      <lb/>jection.</said></p>
          <p><said>We will not discuss the merits of this question
	      <lb/>now,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, <said>but reserve it till a period of
	      <lb/>more leisure; for I see my father is about to broach a
	      <lb/>choice bottle, if I may judge from its coat of dust; and,
	      <lb/>leaving you to enjoy it in uninterrupted tranquillity, I
	      <lb/>will go for a short time, and enliven my cousin's soli­
	      <lb/>tude. But remember, while you sip, Captain, that you
	      <lb/>have challenged me to a game of chess this evening.</said></p>
          <p><said>Then we must brush the cobwebs from another
	      <lb/>bottle,</said> he said, as he rose and held open the door for
	    <lb/>her to pass through. <said>A true son of <persName>Erin</persName>, <persName>Miss Court­
		<lb/>land</persName>, always fights and plays best, when warmed by the
	      <lb/>ruddy nectar of the grape. However, I will strive to
	      <lb/>meet you on equal ground, though another treaty of
	      <lb/>surrender should be the consequence.</said> He bowed low
	    <lb/>as she glided from the room, and closing the door after
	    <lb/>her, returned to the table, to enjoy the rich contents of
	    <lb/>the bottle, from which the Major had just extracted the
	    <lb/>cork, and which had been mellowing for twenty long
	    <lb/>years, in his well stored wine cellar.</p>

	    <lb/>resist the contagion of gaiety so innocent, and exhila­
	    <lb/>rating. Even <persName>Amelia Dunbar</persName> was beguiled from the
	    <lb/>indulgence of that deep sorrow which had depressed
	    <lb/>her, and she began to share, with interest, the walks
	    <lb/>and amusements of her cousin, which were enlivened
	    <lb/>by the participation of <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, and diversified by the
	    <lb/>numerous plans, which he devised to vary and give
	    <lb/>new zest to their pleasures.</p>
          <p>Within doors, books, music, conversation, and games
	    <lb/>of various sorts, beguiled the stormy days of winter;
	    <lb/>and the genial warmth of the apartments, and the fra­
	    <lb/>grant breath of <persName>Catherine's</persName> roses and geranium's, which
	    <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)"><lg type="poem" rend="align(center)" subtype="indeterminate"><l>Bloomed in exotic beauty, warm and snug,</l></lg></quote>
	    <lb/>and with a brilliancy rivalled only by the soft tints
	    <lb/>which glowed on the cheeks of their lovely mistress,
	    <lb/>permitted them to enjoy the mild temperature and de­
	    <lb/>licious odors of spring. When abroad, all nature was
	    <lb/>despoiled of verdure, and a brown and leafless waste
	    <lb/>stretched in melancholy dreariness where lately the
	    <lb/>brightness and luxuriance of summer gave interest and
	    <lb/>beauty to the landscape.</p>
          <p>But the rigors of the season did not prevent the ladies
	    <lb/>from enjoying frequent exercise in the open air. The
	    <lb/>unsettled state of the country, however, forbade their
	    <lb/>making long excursions from home. Two large armies
	    <lb/>were encamped within twenty miles of each other, and
	    <lb/>their foraging parties and scouts were so often travers­
	    <lb/>ing in various directions, as to render it not only un­
	    <lb/>pleasant, but unsafe, to run the risk of encountering
	    <lb/>them. The gentlemen allowed themselves more license,
	    <lb/>and, attended by their servants, rode as often, and as
	    <lb/>far, as it pleased them. <persName>Catherine</persName> sometimes accom­
	    <lb/>panied them, but not so often as she wished, since
	    <lb/>she found it impossible to prevail on <persName>Amelia</persName> to join
	    <lb/>the party. From the period of her father's death
	    <lb/>she had studiously avoided every individual and every
	    <lb/>scene, that could remind her of his fate; and she not
	    <lb/>unfrequently quitted the room in tears, when the mili­
	    <lb/>tary events of the day chanced to be the subject of
	    <lb/>discussion, and these, of course, were not unfrequent

	    <mw type="pageNum">194</mw>
	    <lb/>topics, at a time, when, as might be supposed, they
	    <lb/>were of all others the most interesting.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, nothing was heard of <persName>Colonel Gra­
	      <lb/>hame</persName>. The days passed on, and <date when="1777-12"><name>December</name></date> drew to­
	    <lb/>wards a close; but still no tidings came. It was under­
	    <lb/>stood, that in the American camp there were none
	    <lb/>who any longer indulged the expectation of his return,
	    <lb/>and the opinion generally entertained was, that he had
	    <lb/>fallen a sacrifice to the treachery of the <name>Indian</name> <persName>Ohmei­
	      <lb/>na</persName>.</p>
          <p><persName>Major Courtland</persName> gave implicit faith to this suspi­
	    <lb/>cion. <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, too, was almost ready to admit it,
	    <lb/>and by degrees they ceased to speak of him as any
	    <lb/>longer in existence. When they mentioned his name,
	    <lb/>it was to lament his early fate, and extol, with feelings
	    <lb/>of melancholy regret, the noble and attaching qualities
	    <lb/>of his uncommon mind.</p>
          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> usually heard these remarks in silence,
	    <lb/>but <persName>O'Carroll</persName> thought, not without emotion. He fanci­
	    <lb/>ed he could, at such moments, detect a shade of sad­
	    <lb/>ness stealing over her animated features; and once he
	    <lb/>caught the echo of a low-breathed sigh, as, with appa­
	    <lb/>rent inattention to what was said, she carelessly turned
	    <lb/>over the leaves of a music book. He had himself been
	    <lb/>too deeply wounded, not to sympathize in the affliction
	    <lb/>of others, and when he believed <persName>Miss Courtland</persName> yield­
	    <lb/>ing involuntarily to the softened feelings which <persName>Gra­
	      <lb/>hame's</persName> image awoke, he longed to pour into her heart
	    <lb/>all the kind and warm feelings of his own, and whisper
	    <lb/>the hope, unfounded as it was, that he she mourned
	    <lb/>might not be utterly lost. But the transient gloom of
	    <lb/>her countenance, if such there was, fled, even while
	    <lb/>these thoughts passed through the mind of the enthusi­
	    <lb/>astic <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; and the instant gaiety, which succeed­
	    <lb/>ed perhaps, the lively sally, which broke from her
	    <lb/>lips, not only surprised and perplexed him, but banish­
	    <lb/>ed his suspicions and destroyed the feeling, which had
	    <lb/>induced him secretly to lavish on her his tenderest pity
	    <lb/>and concern.</p>

          <p>In truth, though <persName>Catherine</persName> imparted her thoughts to
	    <lb/>no one, she had ever cherished the belief that <persName>Colonel
	    <lb/>Grahame</persName> lived, and would return. She scarcely knew
	    <lb/>on what she had founded this belief; and indeed she
	    <lb/>did not seek to know. It was one of those mysterious
	    <lb/>presentiments, which sometimes haunt the mind, and
	    <lb/>for which we vainly endeavour to account, and which
	    <lb/>we as vainly strive to dispel. It impressed her with the
	    <lb/>reality of truth; and, though not inclined to superstition,
	    <lb/>she almost fancied, in this instance, that some superior
	    <lb/>power had inspired her with a confident hope, which
	    <lb/>she nurtured like a promise, whose fulfilment she might
	    <lb/>anticipate with perfect certainty.</p>
          <p>Thus, although the subject was seldom mentioned,
	    <lb/>it was often the theme of secret meditation, and par­
	    <lb/>ticularly so with <persName>Catherine</persName>. But whatever she might
	    <lb/>feel, no cloud was suffered to gather on her brow, or
	    <lb/>to cast a shade over the enjoyments of the domestic
	    <lb/>circle. All was bright and animating in her counte­
	    <lb/>nance, and none seemed to enjoy more highly a ride,
	    <lb/>a walk, or any other amusement, of which they were
	    <lb/>accustomed to partake.</p>
          <p>One uncommonly fine afternoon for the season, the
	    <lb/>two cousins, with <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, had been indulg­
	    <lb/>ing in a walk of unusual length, from which they were
	    <lb/>obliged to hasten their return home, in consequence of
	    <lb/>a sudden change in the weather, so common in the
	    <lb/>variable climate of the middle and northern states.</p>
          <p>The sun was setting in stormy clouds, and the rising
	    <lb/>wind swept, in fitful and tremendous gusts, through the
	    <lb/>leafless trees. The whole aspect of nature betokened
	    <lb/>an approaching tempest, and, with the utmost speed
	    <lb/>they could make, the little party were scarcely able to
	    <lb/>reach home, before the last ray of light had faded from
	    <lb/>the blackening horizon.</p>
          <p>When they entered the sitting room, <persName>Major Court­
	      <lb/>land</persName> was reclining on the sofa, enjoying that soothing
	    <lb/>hour of <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">parlor twilight,</quote> so inimitably described by
	    <lb/>the sweet moralist, <persName>Cowper</persName>. Nor did he appear to
	    <lb/>notice their entrance, but remained wrapped in musing
	  <pb n="196"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="17(2)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">196</mw>
	    <lb/>melancholy, till disturbed by the glare of lights, with
	    <lb/>which <persName>Hugh</persName> shortly illuminated the apartment.</p>
          <p><said>You light us up early to-night, <persName>Hugh</persName>,</said> he said,
	    <lb/>raising his hand to shade his eyes; <said>place that screen
	      <lb/>before me; this sudden blaze is enough to blind one,
	      <lb/>and has chased away all the dreams I was so quietly
	      <lb/>indulging.</said></p>
          <p><said>Perhaps it was the noise of our entrance that dis­
	      <lb/>turbed them, father,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>; <said>but we were
	      <lb/>driven home by the appearance of a storm, much
	      <lb/>sooner than we wished.</said></p>
          <p><said>No matter, child,</said> said the Major with a sigh; <said>it
	      <lb/>was time for them to be disturbed. Leave that shutter
	      <lb/>half open, <persName>Hugh</persName>, that we may watch the weather now
	      <lb/>and then. <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, what are you gazing at from that
	      <lb/>window, which <persName>Hugh</persName> has been waiting to fasten up
	      <lb/>this half hour!</said></p>
          <p><said>At the sky, Major,</said> replied the Captain, retreating
	    <lb/>as he spoke, to make room for the servant. <said>There
	      <lb/>will be wild work in the Heaven's to-night, if I mistake
	      <lb/>not. It is all confusion there now, the clouds are
	      <lb/>scudding before the wind, like the van of a routed
	      <lb/>army. Yea, as our friend <persName>Richard Hope</persName> would say,
	      <lb/>much like unto the beaten remnant of the <name>British</name>, who
	      <lb/>did flee into their entrenchments before the might of
	      <lb/>the rebels.</said></p>
          <p><said>An unseemly comparison,</said> said the Major; <said>and
	      <lb/>fitter for <persName>Richard Hope's</persName> mouth than for your's, who,
	      <lb/>I believe, were not the very last to seek for safety in
	      <lb/>the entrenchments.</said></p>
          <p><said>I was kindly dragged in,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, with
	    <lb/>affected gravity, <said>by a fellow, who well nigh broke his
	      <lb/>neck over me first, and stuck his sharp-toed shoe so
	      <lb/>far into my ear, that he could not well get it out, with­
	      <lb/>out taking me with him.</said></p>
          <p><said>I fear,</said> said the Major, <said>the sharp point touched
	      <lb/>the brain, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, for it often seems disordered, and
	      <lb/>this is the most rational way of accounting for it. But
	      <lb/>come, I am ready to beat you at a game of chess, pro­
	      <lb/>vided you have no objection.</said></p>

          <p><said>Well added, sir,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, as he arranged
	    <lb/>the men upon the board, <said>and I will endeavour to
	      <lb/>convince you that my brain is in too good order to
	      <lb/>consent to such a proposition.</said></p>
          <p>They placed themselves at the table, where <persName>Amelia</persName>
	    <lb/>was already engaged with a book, and <persName>Catherine</persName> with
	    <lb/>her needle; though her attention often wandered from
	    <lb/>her employment, to watch the progress of the game,
	    <lb/>which, for a time, inclined in favor of her father. It,
	    <lb/>however, continued doubtful so long, that, wearied
	    <lb/>with the slow movements of the combatants, she took
	    <lb/>up a book and was becoming interested in its pages,
	    <lb/>when <persName>O'Carroll</persName> broke the silence, which had prevailed
	    <lb/>for many minutes, by exclaiming in a tone of triumph,
	    <lb/>which drew the attention of <persName>Catherine</persName> again to the
	    <lb/>game,</p>
          <p>
            <said>Check, to your king, sir!</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>But not check-mate, sir,</said> said the Major, delibe­
	    <lb/>rately placing a knight before the threatened mon­
	    <lb/>arch.</p>
          <p><said>Check-mate now, Major, <emph>provided you have no ob­
		<lb/>jection</emph>,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, pushing forward his queen,
	    <lb/>and displacing the knight. <said>No retreat, sir,</said> he pur­
	    <lb/>sued, as the Major cast his eye in silence over the
	    <lb/>board; <said>cut off as fairly, and as completely too, as
	      <lb/>ever <persName>Burgoyne</persName> was at <name>Saratoga</name>.</said></p>
          <p><said>But your triumph more than beseems a brave con­
	      <lb/>queror, <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, sorry for
	    <lb/>her father's defeat; <said>you forget how much you admir­
	      <lb/>ed the forbearance of the brave <persName>General Gates</persName>.</said></p>
          <p><said>We cannot always imitate what we admire, <persName>Miss

	      <lb/>to become my antagonist, I will strive to be as mag­
	      <lb/>nanimous, as the brave <persName>Gates</persName>, and say, with as courtly
	      <lb/>an air as he did, when addressing the vanquished <persName>Bur­
		<lb/>goyne</persName></said>――</p>
          <p><said>Do have done with that nonsense, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,</said> ex­
	    <lb/>claimed the Major, sweeping the men from the board
	    <lb/>with an air of chagrin, and retreating to his former

	      <lb/>no other topics half so pleasing in the world. One

	      <lb/>forever on the subject; instead of which, you sing it in
	      <lb/>our ears, on every possible occasion.</said></p>
          <p><said>I wish to lessen its horror by familiarity, sir,</said> said
	    <lb/>the Captain, while he deliberately replaced the fallen
	    <lb/>men, and challenged the Major to another game.</p>
          <p><said>No, <persName>Catherine</persName> may revenge me,</said> said the Major;
	    <lb/><said>and I know she can if she chooses, so <foreign xml:lang="fr">prenez garde</foreign>,
	      <lb/>Captain, or your towering crest will be lowered before

          <p><said>With your leave, Captain, we will defer the game

	    <lb/>could not instantly fix her attention, so much was she
	    <lb/>agitated by the increasing violence of the tempest,
	    <lb/>which raged without. As yet it was unaccompanied
	    <lb/>by rain, and the tremendous gusts of wind came only
	    <lb/>at intervals; but with a fury, which threatened to up­
	    <lb/>root the ancient trees, that had braved the tempests of
	    <lb/>a century. Then succeeded a perfect calm, and then
	    <lb/>again all nature seemed in commotion.</p>

          <p><persName>O'Carroll</persName>, however, began to read; but had scarcely

	    <lb/>dy rose on the sullen murmurs of the blast, which, after
	    <lb/>a short interval of profound silence, seemed striving
	    <lb/>again to collect itself, with redoubled violence. <persName>O'Car­
	    <lb/>roll</persName> started from his chair; the Major half rose from
	    <lb/>his recumbent posture, and leaning on his elbow listen­
	    <lb/>ed for a renewal of the sounds; while <persName>Catherine</persName> sprang
	    <lb/>eagerly towards the window, and <persName>Amelia</persName>, dropping her
	    <lb/>work, looked from one to another, with a glance of
	    <lb/>amazement and surprise.</p>
          <p><said>Who is so kind as to serenade us on such a night
	      <lb/>as this, and what is the meaning of it?</said> at length ex­
	    <lb/>claimed the Major. <said><persName>Catherine</persName>, my dear, do you see
	      <lb/>any thing from the window?</said></p>
          <p><said>Nothing, father,</said> she replied. <said>It is too dark to
	      <lb/>distinguish any object; but hush, there is the voice
	      <lb/>again.</said></p>
          <p><persName>O'Carroll</persName> threw open another shutter, while the
	    <lb/>voice, for such it seemed to be, swelled into a clear,
	    <lb/>soft, and melodious strain, which continued, for a
	    <lb/>minute or two, and then died into profound silence.</p>
          <p><said>By Heaven! the very tones I heard at <name>Saratoga</name>,
	      <lb/>and I will solve the mystery,</said> exclaimed <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,
	    <lb/>rushing towards the door.</p>
          <p><said>Not yet, I entreat you,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, laying her
	    <lb/>hand on his arm to detain him. <said>The voice is again
	      <lb/>commencing, and I think I can distinguish words. Let
	      <lb/>us listen a moment; I have raised the sash a little, so
	      <lb/>that we may hear without difficulty; and by violence
	      <lb/>we shall defeat our own wishes.</said></p>
          <p><choice><sic>“</sic><corr/></choice><persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> complied, though not without
	    <lb/>secret reluctance, and stationed himself beside her at
	    <lb/>the window, which she had opened an inch, in order
	    <lb/>to admit the sounds.</p>
          <p>The voice, which seemed to be at no great distance,
	    <lb/>was clear and sweet, exactly resembling that, which
	    <pb n="200"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="17(4)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">200</mw>
	    <lb/><persName>O'Carroll</persName> had heard in the ravine at <placeName>Saratoga</placeName>, and the
	    <lb/>song too, like that, was continually broken by pauses
	    <lb/>of unequal length. As they listened in breathless si­
	    <lb/>lence, they plainly distinguished these words, chanted
	    <lb/>with an emphasis, which was full of meaning and ex­
	    <lb/>pression;</p>
          <p>
            <said>Rejoice! rejoice, friend of the dark-eyed warrior!
	      <lb/>Rejoice! for his people have embraced him! The
	      <lb/>fire of the sacrifice was preparing, but the victim had
	      <lb/>fled, before it was lighted! Rejoice! rejoice, friend
	      <lb/>of the dark-eyed warrior!</said>
          </p>
          <p>The wind, which had been gradually rising into fury,
	    <lb/>at this moment blew with a violence that drowned the
	    <lb/>mysterious voice, though ever and anon a wild and
	    <lb/>thrilling note, mingled distinctly with the tumult of the
	    <lb/>elements. <persName>O'Carroll</persName> was no longer to be restrained;
	    <lb/>and both he and <persName>Major Courtland</persName> rushed in silence
	    <lb/>from the house. <persName>Catherine</persName> followed them to the
	    <lb/>piazza, where she continued standing, though <persName>Amelia</persName>
	    <lb/>earnestly entreated her not to expose herself on such a
	    <lb/>night, for the sake of discovering a mad creature; for
	    <lb/>it could be no other, who chose to sing in the tempest.</p>
          <p>The gentlemen's familiarity with the grounds ena­
	    <lb/>bled them, notwithstanding the darkness of the night,
	    <lb/>to explore every corner, but without success. The
	    <lb/>servants were ordered out with lanterns, and while the
	    <lb/>search was diligently proceeding <persName>Catherine</persName> observed a
	    <lb/>dark figure glide from a thicket of firs, and swiftly dart­
	    <lb/>ing forward, it disappeared in an instant, in a copse of
	    <lb/>locusts which skirted the southern boundary of the
	    <lb/>lawn. She called to <persName>O'Carroll</persName> and pointed after the
	    <lb/>figure, which was, at that moment, visible by the glare
	    <lb/>of the domestics' lanterns; bu<supplied reason="flawed-reproduction">t</supplied>, although he followed to
	    <lb/>a considerable distance, his pursuit was in vain. Not a
	    <lb/>footstep was to be heard, and the perfect darkness
	    <lb/>which surrounded him, made him sensible of the folly
	    <lb/>of adventuring farther. He therefore retraced his way
	    <lb/>home, and it may be imagined with what feelings of
	    <lb/>perplexity, the whole party reentered the house.</p>

          <p><persName>Major Courtland</persName>, however, seemed inclined to treat
	    <lb/>the affair with ridicule, and rallied <persName>Catherine</persName> on the
	    <lb/>seriousness of her countenance and manner.</p>
          <p><said>You look, <persName>Kate</persName>,</said> he said, <said>as if you were really
	      <lb/>inclined to make an important affair of this nonsense.</said></p>
          <p><said>And why should I not, father?</said> she replied. <said>It
	      <lb/>seems to have meaning in it, though not as yet an in­
	      <lb/>telligible one to us.</said></p>
          <p><said>Nor ever will be, girl,</said> said her father. <said>All that
	      <lb/>I can make of it is, that some squaw or wild woman of
	      <lb/>the woods, has fallen in love with <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, and
	      <lb/>chooses to follow him up, till with true womanly in­
	      <lb/>trigue, she has him safe in her snares.</said></p>
          <p><said>Pshaw,</said> ejaculated the Captain, pettishly, while
	    <lb/>he continued hastily to traverse the apartment, evident­
	    <lb/>ly much agitated by the occurrence of the evening.</p>
          <p><said>It is rather provoking, I allow,</said> resumed the teaz­
	    <lb/>ing Major, <said>to be dogged from north to south by you
	      <lb/>know not whom, and, what is worse, are never like to
	      <lb/>know.</said></p>
          <p><said>It is a mysterious circumstance, ridicule it as much
	      <lb/>as you will, Major,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, suddenly stopping
	    <lb/>in his walk, <said>that the same voice, for I am positive it
	      <lb/>is the same, should be heard by me in two distinct
	      <lb/>places, so remote from each other, singing words of the
	      <lb/>same import, and which evidently have a reference to
	      <lb/>the fate of <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>.</said></p>
          <p><said>I confess, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, it <emph>is</emph> rather singular,</said> said the
	    <lb/>Major. <said>If you wish it, I will write a note to-morrow,
	      <lb/>to some of the American officers, with whom I have a
	      <lb/>slight acquaintance, and inquire if any tidings have
	      <lb/>been received of <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>. If not, I shall be
	      <lb/>inclined to view this affair as a foolish trick upon us,
	      <lb/>and advise you to do so too.</said></p>
          <p><said>I shall know better how to view it, when I have
	      <lb/>discovered the actor,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>and if it is any
	      <lb/>thing which wears a human shape, it shall not long re­
	      <lb/>main concealed.</said></p>
          <p>The remainder of the evening was passed in alter­
	    <lb/>nate raillery and conjecture, on the part of <persName>Major Court­

	      <lb/>land</persName>, who, though a little surprised and perplexed by
	      <lb/>the occurrence, had no mind to deepen the serious im­
	      <lb/>pression it had evidently made on the superstitious feel­
	      <lb/>ings of the Captain. <persName>O'Carroll</persName> was unusually irritable;
	      <lb/>but, though continually provoked by the <emph>badinage</emph> of the
	    <lb/>Major, he could not forbear laughing at the whimsical
	    <lb/>conceits by which he affected to solve the mystery of
	    <lb/>the evening. He went continually to the windows and
	    <lb/>the door, in expectation of again hearing the invisible
	    <lb/>musician; but he listened in vain.</p>
          <p>The violence of the tempest had gradually abated;
	    <lb/>but the clouds were pouring out a mixture of rain and
	    <lb/>sleet, which rendered it improbable that any human
	    <lb/>being would continue exposed to so uncomfortable a
	    <lb/>shower; and, at length, relinquishing the hope of again
	    <lb/>hearing the voice, the Captain was persuaded, at a late
	    <lb/>hour, to retire to his apartment. His imagination, how­
	    <lb/>ever, was too much excited to permit the approach of
	    <lb/>sleep, and the morning sun darted into his room before
	    <lb/>his harassed thoughts would suffer him to enjoy repose.</p>
          <p>It was so late when he awoke, after the refreshing
	    <lb/>slumbers of the morning, that the family had all dis­
	    <lb/>persed before he entered the parlor. <persName>Major Courtland</persName>
	    <lb/>was in his library, and the young ladies had gone out
	    <lb/>to walk. <persName>O'Carroll</persName> made a hasty breakfast, and order­
	    <lb/>ing his horse directly after, rode out to enjoy the pure
	    <lb/>and bracing air of the morning, and to shake from his
	    <lb/>mind, the burden of thought, which agitated and per­
	    <lb/>plexed it. In this he was fortunately successful; for,
	    <lb/>notwithstanding the mysterious recollections of the past,
	    <lb/>and the uncertain anticipations of the future, he was
	    <lb/>imperceptibly drawn from painful contemplations, to the
	    <lb/>beautiful appearance of nature, which he could not ob­
	    <lb/>serve, without feelings of admiration and delight. Every
	    <lb/>object was arrayed in a covering of ice, which sparkled
	    <lb/>in the bright beams of the morning sun with indescriba­
	    <lb/>ble splendor. The trees and shrubs were completely
	    <lb/>encased in crystal, and every slender twig, even the
	    <lb/>minutest bud, was visible through the transparent coat­
	    <lb/>ing; while the weight of ice declined the branches with
	    <pb n="203"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="17(6)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">203</mw>
	    <lb/>more than their natural grace, towards the earth; re­
	    <lb/>flecting all the prismatic colors of the rainbow.</p>
          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> and her cousin, having risen much earlier
	    <lb/>than the Captian, had for some time admired the beau­
	    <lb/>tiful appearance of nature from the piazza; but, wish­
	    <lb/>ing to enjoy it abroad before the ice began to fall from
	    <lb/>the trees, they had taken their morning repast, and gone
	    <lb/>out just before <persName>O'Carroll</persName> quitted his apartment.</p>
          <p>Crossing the garden, they passed through a small
	    <lb/>gate at the lower extremity of the principal walk, which
	    <lb/>opened on a foot-path that traversed the borders of a
	    <lb/>forest, occupying many acres of <persName>Major Courtland's</persName> es­
	    <lb/>tate, and which, as yet, he had preserved with care,
	    <lb/>from the sacrilegious axe of the woodman. It was the
	    <lb/>scene of many a delightful ramble, and now, from its
	    <lb/>retirement and security, the frequent resort of the fair
	    <lb/>cousins; though they never adventured into its mazes,
	    <lb/>but contented themselves with treading the circuitous
	    <lb/>path which wound along its borders, unless, when oc­
	    <lb/>casionally attracted by a bright moss or a curious
	    <lb/>lichen, or, in warmer seasons, by the gay flowers which,
	    <lb/>but for this timely notice, had been doomed

	    <lb/>Arm in arm, <persName>Catherine</persName> and <persName>Amelia</persName> now trod this
	    <lb/>sequestered spot; sometimes speaking of the occurrence
	    <lb/>of the past evening, and again, as accident or occasion
	    <lb/>suggested, reverting to other topics of discourse;
	    <lb/>now stopping to admire some fantastic conformation of
	    <lb/>the ice, and then to view through a sudden opening,
	    <lb/>the windings of the river, and the beautiful appearance
	    <lb/>of the landscape on its opposite shore.</p>
          <p><said>How prettily the grey moss, which clothes that
	      <lb/>long branch, is fringed with icicles!</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, as
	    <lb/>they stopped beneath a venerable oak, which seemed
	    <lb/>laden with a double portion of the glittering burden.</p>
          <p><said>Yes, and how delicate they are,</said> said <persName>Amelia</persName>.
	    <lb/><said>They are not larger than a cambric needle, and so
	      <lb/>bright and exquisitely pointed, that they resemble small

          <p><said>Or rather <persName>Plutus</persName>, when he shoots for him,</said> return­
	    <lb/>ed <persName>Amelia</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>Which is too frequently the case,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>;
	    <lb/><said>but I would rather,</said> she added, laughing, <said>that our
	      <lb/>hearts should be pierced by the sharpest of <persName>Cupid's</persName>
	      <lb/>dove-fledged arrows, than that they should be vulner­
	      <lb/>able to the darts of gold or diamonds used by that
	      <lb/>low and sordid deity, who has, alas! and I blush to
	      <lb/>acknowledge it, but too many votaries, even among the
	      <lb/>soft and lovely of our sex. But that moss, cousin, is
	      <lb/>just such as I was wishing for a few days since, to ar­
	      <lb/>range with my shells, and now it is beyond my reach!</said></p>
          <p><said>I see a rock, however, just through those trees,</said><lb/>said <persName>Amelia</persName>, <said>which is covered with a species of moss
	      <lb/>very much resembling this. Supposing we go and ex­
	      <lb/>amine it, perhaps it may answer your purpose as well.</said></p>
          <p><said>With all my heart, provided you do not fear to en­
	      <lb/>ter the forest,</said> returned <persName>Catherine</persName>. <said>I have often
	      <lb/>explored its recesses alone, without meeting any one,
	      <lb/>and it contains many delightful spots, which I have
	      <lb/>loved from childhood, and which are known only to
	      <lb/>myself.</said></p>
          <p><said>I should not like to venture far within its limits,</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>Amelia</persName>;<choice><sic>”</sic><corr/></choice> 
	    <said rend="pre()"><choice><sic/><corr>“</corr></choice>but I am quite willing to go to that rock, or
	      <lb/>even beyond it, so we do not lose sight of the path.</said></p>
          <p>The cousins, accordingly advanced to the rock, which,
	    <lb/>though of considerable extent, was low and flat. <persName>Cath­
	      <lb/>erine</persName> gathered a handful of moss which clothed its
	    <lb/>sides, and, as she stepped upon its craggy ledges, she
	    <lb/>observed the top to be covered with a beautiful variety
	    <lb/>of the most vivid hues.</p>
          <p><said>I have a strong inclination to climb to the summit,
	      <lb/><persName>Amelia</persName>,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, as she stood looking , with a
	    <lb/>wishful eye, upon the richly variegated surface of the
	    <lb/>rock. <said>It is but two or three steps, and here is good
	      <lb/>footing; will you wait for me?</said></p>
          <p><said>Yes, if you will hasten,</said> returned her cousin. <said>I
	      <lb/>see the path, and can regain it in a moment in case of

	      <lb/>alarm, though you could not so quickly descend from
	      <lb/>your elevated station.</said></p>
          <p><said>Oh, there can be no cause for alarm,</said> said <persName>Cathe­
	      <lb/>rine</persName>; and with the lightness of a fawn, she ascended
	    <lb/>the craggy side of the rock, and began to gather with
	    <lb/>eagerness the gay mosses which the shade and humid­
	    <lb/>ity of the forest preserved in continued brightness.
	    <lb/>The ardor of her character led her to engage in every
	    <lb/>pursuit and occupation with enthusiasm; and while,
	    <lb/>with the eye of a connoisseur, and the taste of a lover
	    <lb/>of natural beauties, she selected the finest specimens of
	    <lb/>the vegetable she was collecting, she became so inter­
	    <lb/>ested in her employment, as quite to forget that <persName>Amelia</persName>
	    <lb/>was waiting for her, and that she had promised not to
	    <lb/>detain her long. The voice of her cousin calling her
	    <lb/>softly by name, restored her recollection, and she ap­
	    <lb/>proached the brow of the rock, to say, she would
	    <lb/>rejoin her directly.</p>
          <p><said>Come <emph>now</emph> I entreat you,</said> said <persName>Amelia</persName>, with a ve­
	    <lb/>hemence altogether unusual; <said>I hear a rustling in the
	      <lb/>forest and we ought not to remain here.</said></p>
          <p><said>My dear girl, you may hear a rustling at any time
	      <lb/>where there are half a dozen trees together,</said> said <persName>Cath­
	      <lb/>erine</persName>. <said>I suppose it is some poor squirrel, that has
	      <lb/>exhausted his store of nuts, and come abroad for a fresh
	      <lb/>supply; or perhaps, a harmless racoon that has popped
	      <lb/>out his nose, to smell the fresh air of this fine morning.
	      <lb/>It can be nothing else, you may rest assured, <persName>Amelia</persName>;
	      <lb/>so wait, one moment longer, till I get a superb speci­
	      <lb/>men, which I left, when you called me.</said></p>
          <p><said>Dear <persName>Catherine</persName>, you are rash to trifle thus, when I

	    <lb/>same tone of earnest entreaty. <said>I certainly heard foot­
	      <lb/>steps in the forest, and we do wrong to linger here.</said></p>
          <p><said>Just wait for me in the path then,</said> said the fearless
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName>, <said>and I will come in half a minute. You
	      <lb/>know there is not a creature in the country, who can

          <p><said><persName>Catherine</persName>! dear <persName>Catherine</persName>! I beg of you to
	      <lb/>come!</said> she exclaimed, after an instant's silence. <said>Do
	      <lb/>not delay, I hear the steps</said>――</p>
          <p>She finished with a loud scream; for a large black
	    <lb/>dog, at that moment, sprang barking towards her, and
	    <lb/>she directed her flight towards the path. The animal
	    <lb/>followed, and was on the point of seizing the affrighted
	    <lb/>girl, when a loud voice called, <said><persName>Victor</persName>! here, sir, here,</said>
	    <lb/>and he obeyed, instantly quitting his prey, and spring­
	    <lb/>ing into the forest. <persName>Catherine</persName>, reproaching herself for
	    <lb/>remaining so long, and exposing <persName>Amelia</persName> to this alarm,
	    <lb/>had already descended from the rock, and was by her
	    <lb/>cousin's side, at the moment the dog left her. The
	    <lb/>tones of the voice, which summoned him away, were
	    <lb/>familiar to her ear, and anxious to see the person, from
	    <lb/>whom they proceeded, she pressed forward in the hope
	    <lb/>of obtaining a glimpse, which might satisfy her curios­
	    <lb/>ity. The sound of his footsteps was still audible, but
	    <lb/>they seemed to be rapidly retreating; and <persName>Catherine</persName>
	    <lb/>almost despaired of obtaining her wish, when, through
	    <lb/>a narrow vista in the forest, the tall figure and savage
	    <lb/>attire of an <name>Indian</name> were for a moment visible; but long
	    <lb/>enough for <persName>Catherine</persName> to recognize the person and
	    <lb/>features of the lost <persName>Ohmeina</persName>!</p>
          <p>Astonishment for a minute, overpowered every facul­
	    <lb/>ty of her mind; but other emotions were instantly
	    <lb/>blended with it, and, recollecting what important in­
	    <lb/>telligence might probably be gathered from the <name>Indian</name>,
	    <lb/>relative to the fate of his master, she darted swiftly for­
	    <lb/>ward, and called him loudly by name. But he had
	    <lb/>already disappeared amidst the intricacies of the forest,
	    <lb/>while the falling ice, which in his rapid progress he
	    <lb/>had shaken from the trees, rattled upon the frozen earth,
	    <lb/>and prevented the voice of <persName>Catherine</persName>, though raised
	    <lb/>to its utmost height, from being heard.</p>

          <p><persName>Amelia</persName>, notwithstanding the timidity which had
	    <lb/>caused her to hasten from the forest, was so much sur­
	    <lb/>prised at the gestures of her cousin, that she eagerly
	    <lb/>followed her, exclaiming,</p>
          <p>
            <said>You are mad, <persName>Catherine</persName>, to run into the very dan­
	      <lb/>ger, from which we have just escaped. Who is that
	      <lb/>frightful <name>Indian</name>, and why do you pursue him, and call
	      <lb/>after him with such earnestness? Speak to me quick­
	      <lb/>ly; your wild looks terrify me.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>Do not hold me,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, striving to break
	    <lb/>from her cousin's grasp. <said>I must speak with that <name>In­
		<lb/>dian</name>; let me go, <persName>Amelia</persName>, that I may yet overtake him.</said></p>
          <p><said>You cannot!</said> said <persName>Amelia</persName>, still firmly retaining the
	    <lb/>struggling hand of <persName>Catherine</persName>. <said>Overtake an <name>Indian</name>,
	      <lb/>who is swifter of foot than the fleetest rein-deer of
	      <lb/><placeName>Lapland</placeName>! Impossible! And if you should, what have
	      <lb/>you to say to him, and how dare you trust yourself in
	      <lb/>his power?</said></p>
          <p><said>I fear nothing;</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, <said>I know this <name>In­
		<lb/>dian</name>, and I must speak with him.</said></p>
          <p><said>You must not, <persName>Catherine</persName>,</said> said <persName>Amelia</persName>. <said>Look
	      <lb/>around; here is nothing but trees and rocks; no human
	      <lb/>being to aid us, and the fate of the murdered <persName>Jane McRea</persName>
	      <lb/>may be ours, if you persist in following the steps of this
	      <lb/>savage.</said></p>
          <p><said><persName>Amelia</persName>,</said> replied <persName>Catherine</persName>, somewhat impatiently,
	    <lb/><said>the <name>Indian</name>, whom you have just seen, is not a savage.
	      <lb/>He is humanized by the influence of that same religion,
	      <lb/>which we have been taught to reverence, and I would
	      <lb/>rather trust myself with him, than with many a boasting
	      <lb/>hero, who has less cause for triumph, and fewer virtues
	      <lb/>to ennoble him, than fall to the lot of this poor <name>Indian</name>.
	      <lb/>In a word <persName>Amelia</persName>,</said> and <persName>Catherine</persName> blushed slightly, as
	    <lb/>she said it, <said rend="post()">he is the <foreign xml:lang="fr">protégé</foreign> of <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, and
	      <lb/>I would have inquired concerning the fate of that un­
	      <lb/>fortunate officer; but you have detained me so long,
	      <lb/>that at my utmost speed, I could not now overtake him.
	      <lb/>The only opportunity, which will ever occur, of satisfy­
	      <lb/>ing our doubts on this mysterious subject, is probably
	      <lb/>lost to us forever.</said></p>

          <p><said>I shall indeed be sorry,</said> said <persName>Amelia</persName> thoughtfully,
	    <lb/><said>if my ungrounded fears have prevented your obtain­
	      <lb/>ing this so much desired information. But if you re­
	      <lb/>flect a moment upon the cunning and deceit of the In­
	      <lb/>dian character, I think you cannot regret the disap­
	      <lb/>pointment, which may possibly have been the means
	      <lb/>of saving you from danger. Besides, highly as you think
	      <lb/>of this <persName>Ohmeina</persName>, you are aware, <persName>Catherine</persName>, that both my
	      <lb/>uncle and <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> are suspicious that he has
	      <lb/>played a treacherous part, and should it prove so, I shall
	      <lb/>have no reason to regret my caution in the present in­
	      <lb/>stance.</said></p>
          <p><said>Perhaps you may be right, <persName>Amelia</persName>,</said> said her
	    <lb/>cousin. <said>At all events, it would be useless now for
	      <lb/>me to force my way through the forest in search of
	      <lb/>the <name>Indian</name>, whom it would be impossible to trace.
	      <lb/>Notwithstanding your suggestions, however, I cannot
	      <lb/>but regret that I did not succeed in gaining his atten­
	      <lb/>tion. But it is too late now, so let us hasten home,
	      <lb/>and relate our adventure. I am sure my father will
	      <lb/>cause this forest to be searched, and keep a watch here,
	      <lb/>till the <name>Indian</name> can be found.</said></p>
          <p>They regained the path as she finished speaking,
	    <lb/>and proceeded towards home, with as much rapidity
	    <lb/>as <persName>Amelia's</persName> fear of falling upon the slippery ground,
	    <lb/>would permit. <persName>Catherine</persName>, accustomed to frequent ex­
	    <lb/>ercise upon the snow and ice, walked as steadily upon
	    <lb/>the glassy surface of the earth, as if it had been spread
	    <lb/>with a carpet of the softest verdure, and could with
	    <lb/>difficulty conform her impatient steps to the slow and
	    <lb/>careful pace of her timid companion. Anxious to com­
	    <lb/>municate the reappearance of <persName>Ohmeina</persName> to her father,
	    <lb/>she often left her cousin far behind, and then again re­
	    <lb/>turned to assist and urge her to more speed. In this
	    <lb/>manner they approached the house, but were surpris­
	    <lb/>ed to observe an appearance of great confusion around
	    <lb/>it. The servants were running in various directions;
	    <lb/><persName>Major Courtland</persName> was walking hastily across the lawn;
	    <lb/>and as they gained the piazza, <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> rush­
	    <lb/>ed quickly past them, without even stopping to speak.

	    <lb/>At the same moment a loud report of musketry seem­
	    <lb/>ingly, at no great distance, filled them with new won­
	    <lb/>der and alarm; and they eagerly entered the house, to
	    <lb/>seek a solution of the mystery.</p>

          <p><persName>Hugh</persName> was the first person <persName>Catherine</persName> encountered
	    <lb/>on entering the hall, and he was hasting after his mas­
	    <lb/>ter, with all the speed he could make. But he stop­
	    <lb/>ped to answer the inquiries which she put to him,
	    <lb/>informing her that the firing was occasioned by an ac­
	    <lb/>cidental encounter between a foraging party of <name>Ameri­
	      <lb/>cans</name> and a detachment of British troops; and that the
	    <lb/>Major, with <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, had gone to the hill,
	    <lb/>beyond the mulberry grove, to witness the skirmish. Af­
	    <lb/>ter a few more particular inquiries, <persName>Catherine</persName> dismissed
	    <lb/><persName>Hugh</persName>, and followed <persName>Amelia</persName> to the parlor, whither she
	    <lb/>had withdrawn immediately upon hearing the state­
	    <lb/>ment of the old servant.</p>
          <p>When <persName>Catherine</persName> entered the apartment, she was
	    <lb/>traversing it, in excessive agitation. The image of her
	    <lb/>father, whom she had most tenderly loved, was present
	    <lb/>to her, and pale, trembling, and in tears, she shudder­
	    <lb/>ed at the battle sounds which reached her, as if he
	    <lb/>were still living, and among the combatants. <persName>Cathe­
	      <lb/>rine</persName> strove to soothe her, but all her efforts were vain;
	    <lb/>they seemed rather to increase her agitation. Yet she
	    <lb/>remained with her, till <persName>Amelia</persName> entreated to be left
	    <lb/>alone; and then, anxious to gain the earliest intelli­
	    <lb/>gence concerning the issue of the action, she walked
	    <lb/>from the house, with the hope of meeting her father,
	  <mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(+3)">18*</mw>

	    <mw type="pageNum">210</mw>
	    <lb/>or some other person, who could give her the informa­
	    <lb/>tion she desired.</p>
          <p>She continued her walk, however, without encounter­
	    <lb/>ing an individual, till she reached the summit of a small,
	    <lb/>wooded eminence, from whence, on a hill beyond, she
	    <lb/>discerned her father, with <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, and seve­
	    <lb/>ral of the servants, who, she imagined, had a full view
	    <lb/>of the engagement, as they appeared to be looking
	    <lb/>in a direction, from whence thick volumes of smoke
	    <lb/>ascended, and the noise of the firing proceeded. For
	    <lb/>some minutes, she continued to watch the gestures of
	    <lb/>her father and the Captain. They were exceedingly
	    <lb/>animated, and it seemed to her as if they could scarce­
	    <lb/>ly restrain themselves from rushing to the combat.
	    <lb/>Once, indeed, she saw <persName>O'Carroll</persName> put his hand to his
	    <lb/>side, and step suddenly forward, when the Major
	    <lb/>caught his arm, and he turned from the scene, as
	    <lb/>though he feared to trust himself any longer with a
	    <lb/>sight, which filled him with irrepressible ardor. <persName>Cathe­
	      <lb/>rine</persName> felt herself tinctured with the same enthusiasm,
	    <lb/>and before she was aware of doing so, she had de­
	    <lb/>scended from the eminence, and was moving towards
	    <lb/>the spot on which her father stood. Suddenly arous­
	    <lb/>ed to recollection, she stopped—hesitated—and again
	    <lb/>walked slowly forward.</p>
          <p><said>Why,</said> she asked herself, <said>should I not go!
	      <lb/>True, it is a fearful spectacle, but I am a soldier's
	      <lb/>daughter, and I should not shrink from beholding it.</said></p>
          <p>While these and similar thoughts passed through her
	    <lb/>mind, she still proceeded, though with slow and unde­
	    <lb/>cided steps; when she perceived that her father was
	    <lb/>beckoning her to advance; and, the next moment,
	    <lb/><persName>O'Carroll</persName> descended the hill and ran forward to meet
	    <lb/>her. He was breathless with haste, when he reached
	    <lb/>her, but he said gaily,</p>
          <p>
            <said>Come, <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>, and take your first lesson
	      <lb/>in arms; we have marked, with some interest, your
	      <lb/>hesitation, and seen without surprise, the rare courage
	      <lb/>and independence, which you so eminently possess,
	      <lb/>triumph over the native timidity of your sex. Upon

	      <lb/>my faith, there is not more than one woman, among
	      <lb/>ten thousand, who would not have run and buried her
	      <lb/>head in pillows to shut out the sound of this fighting.
	      <lb/>But hasten, and see how we beat the rebels; they will
	      <lb/>all take flight before we reach the hill, if we do not
	      <lb/>mend our speed; for they were on the point of it, when
	      <lb/>I came to you.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>Nay then,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, drawing back, <said>my
	      <lb/>labor is lost, and I would not add to it, merely to see a
	      <lb/>party of cowardly soldiers beaten from the field by the
	      <lb/>enemy. So good morning <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, and
	      <lb/>thanks for saving me the trouble of climbing the hill.</said></p>
          <p><said>Oh, but it is worth climbing the highest peak of
	      <lb/><placeName>Skiddaw</placeName>, to see how the gallant red coats fight,</said> ex­
	    <lb/>claimed <persName>O'Carroll</persName>. <said>My sword leaped from the scab­
	      <lb/>bard, and I had been in the thickest of the action, in
	      <lb/>spite of my parole, had not the Major taken the pre­
	      <lb/>caution to whisper the word <mentioned>honor</mentioned> in my ear; and it
	      <lb/>never came with such a grating and unwelcome sound
	      <lb/>before, thanks to the pacific treaty of <placeName>Saratoga</placeName>.</said></p>
          <p><said>And the rebels do not fight as well this morning,
	      <lb/>as they did on that memorable occasion?</said> asked
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName>, with arch simplicity.</p>
          <p><said>You shall judge for yourself, <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>,</said> re­
	    <lb/>turned <persName>O'Carroll</persName>. <said>And I trust, you will shortly have
	      <lb/>the pleasure to see them run faster, than they were
	      <lb/>ever known to do before.</said></p>
          <p><said>But I am willing to relinquish that pleasure,</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName>. <said>You will enjoy it sufficiently, without
	      <lb/>my participation; only return, as soon as possible, to
	      <lb/>the house, and let us know if the rebels bear their de­
	      <lb/>feat with as good a grace, as</said>――</p>
          <p><said>As we did at <name>Saratoga</name>, you were about to say,
	      <lb/><persName>Miss Courtland</persName>,</said> interrupted <persName>O'Carroll</persName>. <said>But, in­
	      <lb/>deed, you must excuse me, if I refuse, in case you turn
	      <lb/>back now, to tell you any thing about it. Here we
	      <lb/>are, just at the foot of the hill, and on the top of it, we
	      <lb/>can see the whole engagement. Really, <persName>Miss Court­
		<lb/>land</persName>, I do not think I could have prevailed on you to
	      <pb n="212"/>

	      <mw type="pageNum">212</mw>
	      <lb/>return home, without ascending it, if I had told you it
	      <lb/>was the <name>British</name>, who were flying.</said></p>
          <p><said>That would have been such a rare thing,</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName>, <said>and you know ladies are famed for their
	      <lb/>love of novelty, Captain.</said></p>
          <p><said>Yes, and justly so, as I know but too well,</said> an­
	    <lb/>swered <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, in an accent of bitterness. <said>And
	      <lb/>they love rebellion too,</said> he added, <said>or the cause
	      <lb/>would not find so many wellwishers. But, if I mis­
	      <lb/>take not, the Major is calling to us.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> looked up, and saw her father, standing
	    <lb/>on the brow of the hill, and as they approached nearer,
	    <lb/>he cried out in an impatient accent,</p>
          <p>
            <said><persName>O'Carroll</persName>, why do you loiter there so long! the
	      <lb/>rogues will be off in an instant; they are just on the
	      <lb/>wing; and if <persName>Kate</persName> has ever a mind to see a spice of
	      <lb/>fighting, now is her time.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>But I have no mind for it at all,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName> to
	    <lb/>the Captain. <said>Go on without me, I will return. I
	      <lb/>was foolish to approach a scene, which I now find I
	      <lb/>have not courage to look upon.</said></p>
          <p><said>It is nothing, nothing at all, my dear <persName>Miss Court­
		<lb/>land</persName>,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, urging her gently forward.
	    <lb/><said>They are not very near, and of course you can see
	      <lb/>nothing to shock you; only the flashing of the bayo­
	      <lb/>nets, and the rapid motions of the men. Were I a
	      <lb/>lady, I would rather see twenty such genteel skirmishes,
	      <lb/>as this, than read one detailed account of a battle, in
	      <lb/>which all the wounds and danger are described with
	      <lb/>a minuteness that aggravates its real horrors.</said></p>
          <p><said><persName>Catherine</persName>, <persName>Catherine</persName>, my dear girl, why do you
	      <lb/>delay?</said> exclaimed <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, from the hill; <said>I
	      <lb/>entreat you to come up here, with <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, this
	      <lb/>instant.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> heartily repented having yielded to the
	    <lb/>momentary impulse, which had led to her present situa­
	    <lb/>tion; but it was too late to recede, and unwilling to
	    <lb/>incur her father's displeasure, she again took the Cap­
	    <lb/>tain's offered arm, and ascended the hill in silence.
	    <lb/>The Major advanced to meet her, and his countenance

	    <mw type="pageNum">213</mw>
	    <lb/>glowed with paternal pride, as he hastily saluted her,
	    <lb/>exclaiming, at the same moment,</p>
          <p><said>Bravo! my <persName>Kate</persName>! this is like yourself, and I de­
	      <lb/>sire to thank God, who has made you superior to the
	      <lb/>silly weakness of your sex, and gifted you with as
	      <lb/>brave a soul, as ever animated a hero. But how now!
	      <lb/>have I been too hasty in my praises? Or whence that
	      <lb/>pale cheek,</said> he added, gazing earnestly upon her. <said>I
	      <lb/>will not ask if it is the battle sound, which has faded
	      <lb/>the roses that are wont to bloom there.</said></p>
          <p><said>Father, I have done wrong in coming here,</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName>, resting her forhead, a moment, on his
	    <lb/>shoulder. <said>I thought myself heroic, but I fear I am a
	      <lb/>very coward.</said></p>
          <p><said>No, that you are not, my girl,</said> said her father,
	    <lb/>leading her, as he spoke, to the opposite edge of the
	    <lb/>hill. <said>So now, look up, and tell me which fight best,
	      <lb/>the loyal soldiers of our good <persName>king George</persName>, or the blue­
	      <lb/>coated rebels, who would fain rule themselves.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> raised her eyes from the ground, on which
	    <lb/>they had been rivetted; but when she saw the tumult
	    <lb/>of the fight, which seemed directly below her, a more
	    <lb/>deadly paleness overspread her beautiful features, and
	    <lb/>she covered her face with both hands, to shut the fear­
	    <lb/>ful spectacle from her view. But almost instantly she
	    <lb/>raised her eyes, and strove to look steadily upon the
	    <lb/>combatants, a<choice><sic>t</sic><corr>s</corr></choice> if shamed of her emotion; or perhaps,
	    <lb/>apprehensive that it might appear like weakness, in the
	    <lb/>eyes of her father and <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> to whom the
	    <lb/>present skirmish seemed like mere child's play, com­
	    <lb/>pared to the mighty battles, in which they had both
	    <lb/>been engaged.</p>
          <p>The scene of action, lay in a stubble field, some dis­
	    <lb/>tance beyond the hill; so that the smoke from the fire
	    <lb/>arms, concealed the horrors of the fight. But the
	    <lb/>quick and animated movements of the parties, and the
	    <lb/>rapid glancing of their arms, were visible; and though
	    <lb/>the frequent vollies of musketry involved them in ob­
	    <lb/>scurity, yet the clouds of smoke rose so swiftly in the
	    <lb/>pure atmosphere of the morning, that the bustling and
	  <pb n="214"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="18(5)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">214</mw>
	    <lb/>active scene was at one instant disclosed, and the next
	    <lb/>shrouded again in darkness. The parties engaged,
	    <lb/>were small, and apparently equal, in point of numbers.
	    <lb/>But the <name>British</name> had evidently gained the advantage,
	    <lb/>which they were vigorously pursuing; for the <name>Ameri­
	      <lb/>cans</name>, though obstinately defending themselves, were
	    <lb/>gradually retreating towards the forest, in their rear.</p>
          <p><persName>Major Courtland</persName> watched his daughter's countenance,
	    <lb/>with interest, as, after the first undecided moment, she
	    <lb/>continued earnestly to gaze upon this scene. Her
	    <lb/>kindling eye, her flushed cheek, her profound silence,
	    <lb/>and motionless attitude, evinced the intense and fer­
	    <lb/>vent feeling, with which the spectacle inspired her.</p>
          <p><persName>O'Carroll's</persName> frequent exclamations of <said rend="pre(‘)post(’)">Bravo!</said> <said rend="pre(‘)post(’)">Huz­
	      <lb/>za for <persName>king George</persName></said> and, <said rend="pre(‘)post(’)">The royalists have won the
	      <lb/>day!</said> were seemingly unheard by her; and it was not
	    <lb/>till the ranks of the <name>Americans</name>, which had hitherto re­
	    <lb/>mained firm and unbroken, suddenly gave way, and
	    <lb/>they began to retreat in confusion, that she moved, or
	    <lb/>uttered a word. But then, her color heightened to
	    <lb/>crimson, and, clasping her hands, she exclaimed with
	    <lb/>emotion,</p>
          <p>
            <said>Shame! Shame! They fly, and from a force no
	      <lb/>larger than their own!</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>And they seem to understand it too,</said> said <persName>O'Car­
	      <lb/>roll</persName>. <said>I rather suspect from their gestures, that this is
	      <lb/>not the first time the foe has seen their backs. The
	      <lb/>officer who is endeavouring to rally them, however, is a
	      <lb/>brave fellow. But I fear, he has fought his last field;
	      <lb/>for the devil himself could not get clear of <persName>Talbot's</persName>
	      <lb/>manœuvring, in such a predicament.</said></p>
          <p><said>Does <persName>Captain Talbot</persName> command the royalists?</said><lb/>asked <persName>Catherine</persName>, aroused by <persName>O'Carroll's</persName> observation.</p>
          <p><said>Yes, I met him as I was riding this morning,</said> re­
	    <lb/>turned the Captain. <said>It seems they were informed
	      <lb/>by a deserter, who had grown weary of the hard fare
	      <lb/>and cold quarters of <placeName>Valley Forge</placeName>, that this foraging
	      <lb/>party was to leave the camp this morning; and <persName>Talbot</persName>
	      <lb/>and his men were lying in wait for them, behind the
	      <lb/>group of maples yonder, when I encountered him.

	      <lb/>The <name>Americans</name> were coming up, when I left him, and
	      <lb/>I had just time to ride home, and leave my horse, be­
	      <lb/>fore the first musket shot gave the signal, that the en­
	      <lb/>gagement had commenced. But upon my faith, the
	      <lb/>rebels have nearly gained the forest; all except that
	      <lb/>foolish officer, who will lose his life by seeking to rally
	      <lb/>the cowards.</said></p>
          <p><choice><sic>“</sic><corr/></choice>While <persName>O'Carroll</persName> spoke, scarcely heeded either by
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName> or her father, the <name>Americans</name> continued to
	    <lb/>retrreat in great disorder, unmindful of the threatenings
	    <lb/>or persuasions of their commanding officer, who used
	    <lb/>every exertion in his power to induce them to renew
	    <lb/>the contest. But it was all in vain; they seemed com­
	    <lb/>pletely panic-struck, and eager only to escape the pur­
	    <lb/>suit of their conquerors, when suddenly their flight was
	    <lb/>arrested.</p>
          <p>A single horseman, wearing the uniform of the con­
	    <lb/>tinental army, sprang from behind a small copse of
	    <lb/>trees, and leaping the slight barrier of rails which en­
	    <lb/>closed the field of action, waved his sword, with an
	    <lb/>air of defiance, and called aloud upon the flying troops
	    <lb/>to rally, and act like men. The tones of his com­
	    <lb/>manding voice were heard distinctly on the hill, where
	    <lb/>the party of observation were stationed, and they seem­
	    <lb/>ed like magic to arrest the course of the defeated
	    <lb/>soldiers; for they instantly stood still, and the officer,
	    <lb/>placing himself at their head, they collected, and with
	    <lb/>inconceivable rapidity formed a compact body, pre­
	    <lb/>senting a firm and dauntless front.</p>
          <p>The sudden movement produced a visible sensation
	    <lb/>in the enemy. They slackened their fire, and retreat­
	    <lb/>ing a few steps, drew up again in order of battle. The
	    <lb/>attack recommenced with new fury; the <name>British</name> fight­
	    <lb/>ing as if resolved to win a second victory, and the
	    <lb/><name>Americans</name>, as if determined to atone for the shame of
	    <lb/>their premature flight.</p>
          <p><said>Confound those rebels!</said> exclaimed <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,
	    <lb/>who, with his companions, had anxiously watched the
	    <lb/>progress of this unexpected revolution; <said>they have
	      <lb/>always some <foreign xml:lang="fr">corps de reserve</foreign>, some slashing hero, or

	      <lb/>cunning stratagem, to turn the fortune of fight. We
	      <lb/>had fairly won the field, when that tall fellow came,
	      <lb/>Heaven knows from whence, to pluck back our
	      <lb/>laurels, and bind them on his own rebel brows.</said></p>
          <p><said>Do not begin your lamentation too soon, <persName>O'Car­
		<lb/>roll</persName>,</said> said the Major. <said>Our laurels, perhaps, may
	      <lb/>bloom the brighter for this fresh attack; if we beat
	      <lb/>them from the field again, it is a double victory, you
	      <lb/>know.</said></p>
          <p><said><mentioned>If</mentioned></said>—repeated <persName>O'Carroll</persName>. <said>There is a great deal
	      <lb/>depending on the little word <mentioned>If</mentioned>, Major. <mentioned>if</mentioned> this knight
	      <lb/>errant had not leaped into the field, his rebel followers
	      <lb/>would before now have leaped out of it; and <mentioned>if</mentioned> the
	      <lb/>next musket ball knocks him from his horse, the vic­
	      <lb/>tory may be ours; but <mentioned>if</mentioned> not, Major,</said>――</p>
          <p><said>Have done with your <mentioned>ifs</mentioned>, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,</said> interrupted
	    <lb/>the Major hastily. <said>By Heaven, this champion has
	      <lb/>put the very devil into his soldiers, and in spite of <persName>Tal­
		<lb/>bot</persName>, and all his men, they will beat us hollow.</said></p>
          <p><said>Our fellows are giving way,</said> exclaimed <persName>O'Carroll</persName>.
	    <lb/><said>By <persName>St. Patrick</persName>, they might have held out longer.
	      <lb/>Were it not for the cursed treaty, that so fetters our
	      <lb/>valor, Major, we might leap to the rescue, with as
	      <lb/>valiant an air as this same doughty hero, who has
	      <lb/>so steeled the courage of his own villains, and melted
	      <lb/>that of ours. How the fellow bears himself! As
	      <lb/>haughtily as if he had conquered a host, and were about
	      <lb/>to dictate another treaty of surrender!</said></p>
          <p><said>The treaty of surrender again!</said> exclaimed the
	    <lb/>Major, impatiently. <said>You round off every sentence,
	      <lb/><persName>O'Carroll</persName>, with this detestable treaty; and begin with
	      <lb/>what you will, the Great Mogul, the Pope of <placeName>Rome</placeName>,
	      <lb/>the usurpation of the round-headed <persName>Cromwell</persName>, or any
	      <lb/>thing else equally foreign to the subject, you are sure
	      <lb/>to rack your ingenuity, in order to name this treaty of
	      <lb/><placeName>Saratoga</placeName>, the remembrance of which seems to afford
	      <lb/>you the most exquisite pleasure.</said></p>
          <p><said>Have patience, Major,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, his whole
	    <lb/>attention direccted to the movements of the combatants;

	    <lb/><said>and look, look quick, by <persName>St. George</persName>, <persName>Talbot</persName> is down,
	      <lb/>and his soldiers are flying!</said></p>
          <p><persName>Major Courtland's</persName> attention was instantly directed
	    <lb/>to the scene of action, and he saw at once, that the
	    <lb/>issue of the contest was decided. The second assault
	    <lb/>of the <name>Americans</name> had been far more furious and de­
	    <lb/>termined than the first. Animated by the presence of
	    <lb/>a leader, whom they idolized, and solicitous to retrieve
	    <lb/>their tarnished honor, they fought with intrepid bold­
	    <lb/>ness, till the enemy, discouraged by this fierce attack,
	    <lb/>began to falter, and at length gave way. It is possible
	    <lb/>they might have recovered themselves, had not the fall
	    <lb/>of <persName>Captain Talbot</persName>, served to complete their confusion;
	    <lb/>when they instantly took to flight, leaving a number
	    <lb/>dead on the field, and several, beside their Captain,
	    <lb/>desperately wounded.</p>
          <p><persName>Major Courtland</persName> seeing the engagement at an end,
	    <lb/>and the <name>Americans</name> masters of the field, proposed that
	    <lb/>they should descend the hill, and offer what assistance
	    <lb/>was in their power to the wounded; and also, if <persName>Cap­
	      <lb/>tain Talbot</persName> yet lived, obtain permission from his con­
	    <lb/>querors, to convey him to the house. <persName>O'Carroll</persName> readi­
	    <lb/>ly acceded to the Major's poposition. Though deeply
	    <lb/>chagrined by the issue of the contest, he was desirous,
	    <lb/>he said, to return some of the civilities he had received
	    <lb/>at <placeName>Saratoga</placeName>. <persName>Major Courtland</persName> frowned at this ill timed
	    <lb/>allusion, which did not at all tend to soften his vexa­
	    <lb/>tion, and bidding <persName>Catherine</persName> return to the house, and
	    <lb/>have a room prepared for <persName>Captain Talbot</persName>, he walked
	    <lb/>sullenly down the hill, preceded by <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, whose
	    <lb/>eager curiosity subdued, for a time at least, the morti­
	    <lb/>fication, which the sudden turn of fortune in favor of
	    <lb/>the <name>Americans</name> had given him.</p>
          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> walked slowly homeward, dwelling on the
	    <lb/>singular appearance of the brave champion, who had so
	    <lb/>suddenly changed the fortunes of the fight. There
	    <lb/>was something in the proud tossing of his crest, in the
	    <lb/>bold waving of his sword, in the grace, with which he
	    <lb/>reined the motions of his impatient war-horse, that in­
	    <lb/>spired her with the deepest admiration; and she could

	    <lb/>not reflect upon the gallantry and spirit, with which he
	    <lb/>rallied the panic-struck soldiers, without a glow of en­
	    <lb/>thusiasm, and a feeling of strongly excited interest.</p>
          <p>Her cheek was flushed with the richest bloom, and
	    <lb/>her eye kindled into unusual brilliancy by the scene,
	    <lb/>which she had just witnessed, and the meditations
	    <lb/>which had arisen from it, when she entered the parlor,
	    <lb/>where <persName>Amelia</persName>, pale and sad, reclined upon the sofa,
	    <lb/>in an attitude of deep and melancholy abstraction.</p>
          <p><said>Are you alone, cousin!</said> asked <persName>Catherine</persName>, as she
	    <lb/>entered; <said>I thought <persName>Martha</persName> had been with you, or I
	      <lb/>should not have left you so long.</said></p>
          <p><said>She was, till I sent her away,</said> replied <persName>Amelia</persName>.
	    <lb/><said>Solitude is never disagreeable to me, <persName>Catherine</persName>.</said></p>
          <p><said>Ah, you love it but too well,</said> returned her cousin,
	    <lb/><said>though I should not now have indulged you in it so
	      <lb/>long, had I not gone</said>――</p>
          <p><said>Do not tell me where you have been,</said> hastily in­
	    <lb/>terrupted <persName>Amelia</persName>. <said>The dreadful sounds which I
	      <lb/>have heard this morning are enough to inform me of
	      <lb/>the scene, which you have witnessed.</said></p>
          <p><said>And do you feel no interest in it, <persName>Amelia</persName>, not
	      <lb/>even so much as to ask how it has terminated!</said> said
	    <lb/>her cousin.</p>
          <p><said>I wish to hear nothing concerning it,</said> she replied.
	    <lb/><said>I have been too severe a sufferer by a similar event,
	      <lb/>not to shudder at the very mention of this.</said></p>
          <p><said>My dear girl,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, <said>you are surely
	      <lb/>wrong in indulging this excess of feeling, which must
	      <lb/>cause you so much pain. Situated as we are, we may
	      <lb/>be often exposed to sounds and sights of war, and we
	      <lb/>should prepare ourselves to meet with fortitude the
	      <lb/>events which may befall us, and not shrink, in an hour
	      <lb/>or trial, from any duty, however painful, which may
	      <lb/>serve our friends, our country, or ourselves.</said></p>
          <p><said>You, who have not a father's loss to mourn,</said> repli­
	    <lb/>ed <persName>Amelia</persName>, with emotion, <said>may act, in any exigence,
	      <lb/>with firmness and self possession. But I, who, by this
	      <lb/>cruel war, am robbed of my dearest earthly friend, can
	      <lb/>only deprecate the sanguinary conflict, which blasts the
	      <pb n="219"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="19(2)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">219</mw>
	      <lb/>fairest blossoms of affection, and desolates so many
	      <lb/>happy homes.</said></p>
          <p>The tears gushed from her eyes, as she spoke, and
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName>, affected by her sorrow, threw her arm ten­
	    <lb/>derly around her, and said, in a soothing tone,</p>
          <p>
            <said>My dearest <persName>Amelia</persName>, do not thus afflict yourself.
	      <lb/>You have many things to console you under this be­
	      <lb/>reavement. Your father died, as he often wished he
	      <lb/>might, and as mine would a thousand times rather have
	      <lb/>done, than have become a prisoner, under circumstances
	      <lb/>so galling and disgraceful.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>But though a prisoner, he is still with you,</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>Amelia</persName>; <said>and you are permitted to enjoy his love and
	      <lb/>his society. You gladly resign an empty honor, for the
	      <lb/>sake of substantial happiness.</said></p>
          <p><said>Affection is but too selfish,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, <said>and I
	      <lb/>cannot but rejoice that my father is yet spared to me,
	      <lb/>though<choice><sic>t</sic><corr/></choice> conquered and a prisoner, and regret that it had
	      <lb/>not pleased Heaven to prolong the life of yours, though
	      <lb/>he died in the arms of victory. But let us change this
	      <lb/>painful theme; we shall soon be called upon to exert
	      <lb/>our fortitude, and I would not have you sunk in sadness
	      <lb/>and grief, at a moment, when the utmost self-command
	      <lb/>may be necessary.</said></p>
          <p><said>What has happened?</said> asked <persName>Amelia</persName>, wiping her
	    <lb/>eyes, and looking up, with a countenance of anxious
	    <lb/>inquiry. <said>Has any accident befallen my uncle or
	      <lb/><persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>? Speak, <persName>Catherine</persName>; why have you
	      <lb/>kept me so long in ignorance?</said></p>
          <p><said>There is nothing to alarm you,</said> said her cousin,
	    <lb/><said>but an occurrence which may deeply try your feelings,
	      <lb/>and for which I wished to prepare you, when I spoke
	      <lb/>of the events of the morning.</said></p>
          <p><said>Do not fear to speak of them again,</said> said <persName>Amelia</persName>;
	    <lb/><said>I will hear you with firmness, and strive to perform
	      <lb/>whatever duty the occasion shall impose upon me.</said></p>
          <p><said>I know you will do all you can and ought to do,
	      <lb/>my dearest cousin,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, affectionately kiss­
	    <lb/>ing the still wet cheek of <persName>Amelia</persName>; <said>I much regret that
	      <lb/>this unlucky skirmish has occurred so near as to involve

	      <lb/>us in its consequences; but it was unforseen, and if it
	      <lb/>had been otherwise, it would have been unavoidable by
	      <lb/>us. The <name>Americans</name>, <persName>Amelia</persName>, are victorious, and the
	      <lb/>retreating party, having left their wounded, and among
	      <lb/>them <persName>Captain Talbot</persName>, on the field, my father is giving
	      <lb/>directions to have him brought here, where he can be
	      <lb/>properly attended to.</said></p>
          <p><said><persName>Captain Talbot</persName>!</said> ejaculated <persName>Amelia</persName>, in a voice of
	    <lb/>strong emotion; and, turning paler than marble, she
	    <lb/>sunk back upon the sofa, and covered her face with her
	    <lb/>handkerchief. <persName>Catherine</persName> gazed anxiously upon her,
	    <lb/>surprised by her excessive agitation, but before she
	    <lb/>could address her, <persName>Amelia</persName>, by a powerful effort, recov­
	    <lb/>ered herself, and said, though not without embarras­
	    <lb/>ment,</p>
          <p>
            <said>He is the son of my dear father's most favorite
	      <lb/>friend, <persName>Catherine</persName>. Alas! that one so young, so brave,
	      <lb/>so amiable, should be thus early snatched from life!</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>We hope he is not badly wounded,</said> said <persName>Cathe­
	      <lb/>rine</persName>; <said>at all events, my love, preserve your self-pos­
	      <lb/>session. And now that I have told you all, I will go
	      <lb/>and order a room to be made ready for his reception.</said></p>
          <p><said>But will no one else come?</said> inquired <persName>Amelia</persName>,
	    <lb/>roused by the dread of meeting strangers, from the sad
	    <lb/>abstraction into which <persName>Catherine's</persName> intelligence had
	    <lb/>plunged her.</p>
          <p><said>I cannot tell,</said> replied <persName>Catherine</persName>. <said>Possibly my
	      <lb/>father may invite the American officers home with
	      <lb/>him; and if so, you must be mistress of ceremonies,
	      <lb/><persName>Amelia</persName>, as I expect to be fully occupied with my
	      <lb/>wounded hero.</said></p>
          <p><said>No, I cannot!</said> exclaimed <persName>Amelia</persName>, shuddering at
	    <lb/>the idea of meeting, perhaps, those very men who had
	    <lb/>robbed her father of life. <said>Indeed, I cannot see them,</said>
	    <lb/>she repeated; <said>let me go with you, dear <persName>Catherine</persName>, or
	      <lb/>any where, rather than remain here.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> was half vexed by her cousin's want of
	    <lb/>self-command, but sincerely compassionating that ex­
	    <lb/>cessive sensibility, which, from the errors of her educa­
	    <lb/>tion, often degenerated into weakness, she said to her,
	    <lb/>with gentleness,</p>

          <p>
            <said>Retire, if you choose, my dear girl; I would not,
	      <lb/>for the world, by any wish of mine, impose restraint
	      <lb/>upon your inclinations. It is not very probable that the
	      <lb/>American officers will call here; but they may, and if
	      <lb/>they do, I will be at liberty to receive them; so go to
	      <lb/>your own room, my sweet coz, and I will come to you,
	      <lb/>when they are gone.</said>
          </p>
          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> quitted the parlor, as she finished speak­
	    <lb/>ing, and went to direct the preparations for <persName>Captain
	    <lb/>Talbot's</persName> reception. <persName>Amelia</persName> remained for several min­
	    <lb/>utes, standing in the same position, anxious to retire,
	    <lb/>and yet ashamed to yield to the weakness which prompt­
	    <lb/>ed her to do so. The contrast between her own char­
	    <lb/>acter, and that of her cousin struck her more forcibly
	    <lb/>than it had ever done before; and while she felt and
	    <lb/>lamented her own imperfections, she did full justice to
	    <lb/>the loveliness and superiority of <persName>Catherine</persName>, who, though
	    <lb/>gifted with the most exquisite tenderness and sensibility,
	    <lb/>rose above the weakness and timidity of her sex, ever
	    <lb/>sacrificing her selfish feelings to the happiness of others,
	    <lb/>and possessing, on every occasion, that cool and perfect
	    <lb/>self-command, which enabled her to decide and act
	    <lb/>with promptitude and judgment.</p>
          <p>Occupied with these reflections, <persName>Amelia</persName> forgot her
	    <lb/>design of retiring, till reminded of it by the appearance
	    <lb/>of <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, who was advancing towards the
	    <lb/>house, followed by a rude litter, on which <persName>Captain Tal­
	      <lb/>bot</persName>, apparently insensible, was borne by a number of
	    <lb/>American soldiers. <persName>Amelia</persName> became extremely pale,
	    <lb/>and sunk, almost fainting, upon a chair; but her solici­
	    <lb/>tude to retire before the entrance of the party had re­
	    <lb/>vived with new earnestness, and by a strong exertion
	    <lb/>she rose and escaped through a side door into the libra­
	    <lb/>ry, from whence she passed to her own apartment.</p>
          <p>In the mean time, <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> entered the hall,
	    <lb/>followed by the litter of the wounded officer, who, though
	    <lb/>deprived of sense for a time by a deep cut upon his
	    <lb/>temple, was not thought to be severely wounded. But
	    <lb/>his inanimate form, and his pallid countenance disfig­
	    <lb/>ured with blood, rendered him a spectacle so shocking
	    <mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(+3)">19*</mw>
	    <pb n="222"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="19(3)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">222</mw>
	    <lb/>to female sensibility, that few would have gazed upon
	    <lb/>it without fainting. <persName>O'Carroll</persName> feared it might produce
	    <lb/>that consequence on <persName>Catherine</persName>, and when he saw her
	    <lb/>enter the hall, he exclaimed in a hurried tone,</p>
          <p>
            <said>For heaven's sake, my dear <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>, retire;
	      <lb/>you will be shocked beyond measure, by poor <persName>Talbot's</persName>
	      <lb/>ghastly appearance.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>I am prepared for it, Captain,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, still
	    <lb/>moving towards the litter. <said>Shall I,</said> she continued,
	    <lb/><said>who have witnessed a battle, turn pale at the sight of
	      <lb/>blood, or shrink from those duties which woman was
	      <lb/>formed to fulfil? You do not yet know<choice><sic>n</sic><corr/></choice> me, <persName>Captain
	      <lb/>O'Carroll</persName>, if you imagine a wounded soldier can in­
	      <lb/>spire me with any other sensations than those of pity
	      <lb/>and regret. But order your charge into this apartment,
	      <lb/>if you please;</said> and she threw open a side door as she
	    <lb/>spoke. <said>You see I have assumed the office of nurse,
	      <lb/>and come with all my credentials to the scene of action;
	      <lb/>here are bandages, and lint, and cordials, and balsams
	      <lb/>of various kinds, as the nature of the case may require.</said></p>
          <p><said>And where, may I ask,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, smiling, as
	    <lb/>she held up her little basket furnished with the articles
	    <lb/>she had named, <said>where did you obtain the skill, which
	      <lb/>has taught you to dress the wounds of the soldier?</said></p>
          <p><said>At <name>Saratoga</name>, you know, I had some experience,</said><lb/>she said, as she led the way into the apartment prepar­
	    <lb/>ed for <persName>Captain Talbot</persName>. The soldiers followed with the
	    <lb/>litter, and when they had placed him gently on the bed,
	    <lb/>she approached and gazed with a steady eye upon him.
	    <lb/><said>Poor <persName>Talbot</persName>,</said> she said, after a brief pause, <said>how
	      <lb/>changed from the bright and animated face which I be­
	      <lb/>held, when we last met!</said></p>
          <p>In raising him from the litter, the motion had caused
	    <lb/>his wound to bleed afresh, and alarmed at the conse­
	    <lb/>quences which the effusion of so much blood might
	    <lb/>produce, <persName>Catherine</persName> eagerly sought to staunch it, and by
	    <lb/>various applications, she at length succeeded. She then
	    <lb/>carefully wiped the clotted blood from his face, and
	    <lb/>with a courage far superior to her sex and years, she
	    <lb/>bathed the wound upon his forehead, and placed upon
	    <pb n="223"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="19(4)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">223</mw>
	    <lb/>it some lint wet with a balsam, the efficacy of which
	    <lb/>she had experienced during the illness of her father.</p>
          <p>With the assistance of <persName>Martha</persName>, she bandaged his head,
	    <lb/>and having smoothed his pillow, sat down beside him
	    <lb/>to watch for the moment of his revival.</p>
          <p><persName>O'Carroll</persName> observed her motions with interest and
	    <lb/>surprise; and at length, overpowered by feelings of ad­
	    <lb/>miration, he exclaimed with unchecked enthusiasm,</p>
          <p>
            <said><persName>Miss Courtland</persName>, you deserve to be the wife of a
	      <lb/>hero! No inferior mortal can be worthy of you.
	      <lb/><persName>Talbot</persName> is a happy fellow to be the object of such gentle
	      <lb/>assiduities; though, he is so slightly wounded, I wonder
	      <lb/>your cares have not revived him.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>I wish, indeed, they might restore him to conscious­
	      <lb/>ness,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, scarcely regarding the words of
	    <lb/>the ever gay <persName>O'Carroll</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>The surgeon will be here soon, I think,</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>the fellow went off for him before we left
	      <lb/>the field. But I wonder where the Major and</said>――</p>
          <p>He quitted the room abruptly without concluding
	    <lb/>what he had begun to say, and when a few minutes
	    <lb/>afterward <persName>Catherine</persName> went out on some errand, he was
	    <lb/>hastily traversing the hall, humming in a low tone, but
	    <lb/>so that the words were distinctly intelligible,
	    <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)"><lg type="poem" rend="indent(+3)" subtype="indeterminate"><l>None but the brave</l><l>None but the brave,</l><l>None but the brave deserve the fair.</l></lg></quote></p>
          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> looked earnestly upon him, and remarked
	    <lb/>with surprise his flushed cheek and sparkling eye.</p>
          <p><said>You are unusually gay,</said> she said, after observ­
	    <lb/>ing him a moment in silence; <said>mysteriously so, con­
	      <lb/>sidering the events of the day. May I ask if any thing
	      <lb/>has occurred to afford you pleasure?</said></p>
          <p><said>Has not <persName>Talbot</persName> revived yet?</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,
	    <lb/>evading a reply; and suddenly reentering his apartment,
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine's</persName> attention was at once diverted from him,
	    <lb/>and she followed to look upon her patient, but he still
	    <lb/>remained insensible, and she said with anxiety,</p>
          <p>
            <said>I see no symptoms of returning consciousness; have
	      <lb/>you observed any, <persName>Martha</persName>?</said>
          </p>

          <mw type="pageNum">224</mw>
          <p><said>No Ma'am, and I have not once lifted my eyes
	      <lb/>from his face,</said> she replied.</p>
          <p><said>The poor fellow seems still almost lifeless;</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName>. <said>Can we do nothing for him till the sur­
	      <lb/>geon arrives? At least reach me that bottle of laven­
	      <lb/>der, <persName>Martha</persName>, the scent may possibly revive him.</said></p>
          <p>While bending over her inanimate patient with a ten­
	    <lb/>der assiduity, which heightened her natural loveliness,
	    <lb/><persName>O'Carroll</persName> continued for some minutes to regard her
	    <lb/>with deep and admiring attention; he then walked to­
	    <lb/>wards the door; opened and closed it, apparently without
	    <lb/>design; stopped to examine the pictures which hung
	    <lb/>upon the walls; and in short, exhibited so many symp­
	    <lb/>toms of restlessness and unusual excitement, that, not­
	    <lb/>withstanding her anxiety respecting <persName>Captain Talbot</persName>,
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName> could not fail to observe it. She looked up
	    <lb/>with a smile of much meaning, as, after one of these
	    <lb/>hasty walks through the apartment, he stopped at the foot
	    <lb/>of the bed, and began twisting the curtain with uncon­
	    <lb/>scious earnestness around the post. He caught her
	    <lb/>smile, and read its expression; but he only said with
	    <lb/>an air of affected impatience,</p>
          <p>
            <said><persName>Miss Courtland</persName>, you are wearing yourself by exer­
	      <lb/>tions so new and painful, and wasting both your trouble
	      <lb/>and your lavender. Permit me to take your place, I
	      <lb/>am more used to wounds and fatigues than you can be.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>Thank you, Captain, I do not doubt your skill,</said><lb/>she said; <said>but I have the vanity to think a female hand
	      <lb/>is skilled above all others, and that mine acquired un­
	      <lb/>common experience, during my campaign at <name>Saratoga</name>.
	      <lb/>Besides,</said> she added, smiling, <said>you know that many an
	      <lb/>illustrious dame of ancient days has contended for the
	      <lb/>honor of nursing a wounded hero, and I would not have
	      <lb/>it said, that those who suffered in <placeName>America</placeName> were neg­
	      <lb/>lected by its daughters. They boast of spirits as fear­
	      <lb/>less and as lofty, as those which characterized the vir­
	      <lb/>tuous matrons of <placeName>Rome</placeName>, in the days of her pride and
	      <lb/>power.</said></p>
          <p><said>That speech, <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, laugh­
	    <lb/>ing, <said>has produced the effect upon your patient, which
	      <pb n="225"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="19(5)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">225</mw>
	      <lb/>all the balsams and perfumes in your basket failed to
	      <lb/>do; for see, he actually open his eyes!</said></p>
          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> turned quickly to assure herself, that an
	    <lb/>event so much desired had really taken place, and was
	    <lb/>filled with pleasure, when she observed a faint color
	    <lb/>brighten <persName>Talbot's</persName> pale lips, and saw his eyes fixed upon
	    <lb/>her countenance, though with a dim vacancy of express­
	    <lb/>ion, which denoted a continued absence of conscious­
	    <lb/>ness. Wholly engrossed, however, by her endeavors
	    <lb/>to aid the efforts of reviving nature, <persName>Catherine</persName> neither
	    <lb/>noticed a considerable bustle in the hall; nor the ab­
	    <lb/>rupt departure of <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> from the room;
	    <lb/>and was holding a glass to the lips of <persName>Talbot</persName>, from which
	    <lb/>he eagerly drank, when she heard her father, who had
	    <lb/>entered unperceived, exclaim,</p>
          <p>
            <said>Upon my word, <persName>Kate</persName>, you have grown a very hero­
	      <lb/>ine to-day. First marching off to see a battle, and now
	      <lb/>binding up the wounds, and administering cordials, with
	      <lb/>as much <foreign xml:lang="fr">sang froid</foreign>, as if you had been born in a camp.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>You mistake, father, the delicate nerves of a <emph>true</emph>
	      <lb/>heroine could not have endured the sights which I
	      <lb/>have looked upon to-day,</said> she said, as she withdrew
	    <lb/>the glass from the lips of her patient, and shaking back
	    <lb/>the clustered hair which, while she bent forward had
	    <lb/>fallen over her face, looked up with a smile at her fa­
	    <lb/>ther. Beside him stood <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, his eyes sparkling
	    <lb/>with pleasure and his face all smiling eagerness; and
	    <lb/>she was no longer at a loss to account for his extreme
	    <lb/>gaiety, when standing at her father's right hand, she be­
	    <lb/>held, with inexpressible surprise, the majestic figure of
	    <lb/>the long lost and deeply regretted <persName>Grahame</persName>. His fine
	    <lb/>countenance was glowing with delight, and his eyes,
	    <lb/>full of ardent admiration, and ill restrained impatience,
	    <lb/>were fixed earnestly upon her.</p>
          <p>Vivid blushes overspread her features, at this unex­
	    <lb/>pected sight, and as if rivetted to the floor, she remain­
	    <lb/>ed for a moment immoveable and silent. <persName>Grahame</persName>
	    <lb/>involuntarily stepped forward, and at this gesture, <persName>Cathe­
	      <lb/>rine's</persName> suspended faculties awoke; the glass fell from
	    <lb/>her hand, and she sprang eagerly to meet him. He

	    <mw type="pageNum">226</mw>
	    <lb/>clasped her passive hands fervently between his own,
	    <lb/>and for a few moments, emotion seemed to deprive
	    <lb/>them both of the power of utterance. <persName>Colonel Gra­
	      <lb/>hame</persName> was the first to break the embarrassing silence,
	    <lb/>and he said, though in no very passionless tone,</p>
          <p>
            <said>I find you, as I left you, <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>, hovering
	      <lb/>like some kind angel around the couch of the suffering
	      <lb/>soldier, and soothing his anguish with the healing balm
	      <lb/>of sympathy and kindness, which woman administers
	      <lb/>so sweetly.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>And I find you,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, subduing her
	    <lb/>emotion, and striving to speak with gaiety, <said>I find you
	      <lb/><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, still conquering my countrymen,
	      <lb/>and supplying me with patients, on whom to exercise
	      <lb/>my skill.</said></p>
          <p><said>And you take it for granted, <persName>Kate</persName>,</said> exclaimed her
	    <lb/>father,<choice><sic>”</sic><corr/></choice> <said rend="pre()"><choice><sic/><corr>“</corr></choice>that you need look no farther to find the gal­
		<lb/>lant champion, who turned the fortune of the fight!</said></p>
          <p><said>I think, father, I cannot be mistaken,</said> she replied.</p>
          <p><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> smiled, but, before he could speak,
	    <lb/>the Major interrupted him.</p>
          <p><said>You are not, <persName>Kate</persName>,</said> he said. <said>We are indebted
	      <lb/>to the Colonel for having snatched away our victory,
	      <lb/>to-day, though we almost forrget the chagrin which it
	      <lb/>occasioned us, in the pleasure of seeing him again re­
	      <lb/>stored to life. But we have a long story to hear, and
	      <lb/>many mysteries to be explained, before <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, after
	      <lb/>so many warnings and intimations, will be convinced
	      <lb/>that this is really <foreign xml:lang="la">bonâ fide</foreign> <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, and not
	      <lb/>some visionary spirit, who has assumed his form, and
	      <lb/>come among us on his own errand.</said></p>
          <p><said>I shall be happy to prove my identity, as soon as
	      <lb/>possible,</said> said <persName>Grahame</persName>; <said>but first, I should wish to
	      <lb/>have my gallant adversary's wounds inspected, and re­
	      <lb/>ceive the assurance of his safety.</said></p>
          <p><said>You have no cause for uneasiness, Colonel,</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>for you perceive the wounded man has
	      <lb/>not suffered for want of surgical attendance.</said></p>
          <p><said>And pray who has bound up this bloody head in
	      <lb/>such a surgeon-like style,</said> asked the Major. <said>Is it

	      <mw type="pageNum">227</mw>
	      <lb/>you, my brave <persName>Kate</persName>, who have ventured to dabble your
	      <lb/>pretty fingers in this poor fellow's blood?</said></p>
          <p><said>With <persName>Martha's</persName> assistance, father, I attempted to
	      <lb/>bandage the wound,</said> she replied; <said>though rather
	      <lb/>awkwardly I fear, as I was apprehensive of causing
	      <lb/>pain. But the blood flowed freely, and uncertain how
	      <lb/>long it might be before the arrival of the surgeon, I
	      <lb/>thought it necessary to check the effusion, and there­
	      <lb/>fore applied lint and balsam, as I had seen your wound
	      <lb/>treated at <name>Saratoga</name>.</said></p>
          <p><said>You are a dear girl for your pains,</said> said her father,
	    <lb/>pressing her fondly against his heart; <said>and have dis­
	      <lb/>covered more fortitude to-day, than I, at your age and
	      <lb/>with your inexperience, should have been capable of
	      <lb/>exerting.</said></p>
          <p><said>But had you seen her courage, her self-command,
	      <lb/>her</said>―― <persName>O'Carroll</persName> began with his accustomed fervor
	    <lb/>of feeling and expression, when <persName>Catherine</persName> hastily in­
	    <lb/>terrupted him.</p>
          <p><said>Nay, Captain,</said> she said, smiling, <said>I have seen
	      <lb/>you laugh more than once this morning, at my awkward
	      <lb/>inexperience, and now I cannot be appeased, by this
	      <lb/>vain sacrifice of flattery, offered to my wounded
	      <lb/>vanity.</said></p>
          <p><said>Flattery!</said> exclaimed <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>I should be
	      <lb/>unworthy of your friendship, were I capable of thus
	      <lb/>insulting you; you, <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>, who are superior
	      <lb/>to ever weakness, exalted in every virtue, far above
	      <lb/>your sex.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Catherine's</persName> face was instantly suffused with a bright
	    <lb/>blush, but whether it was occasioned by the sincere
	    <lb/>and undisguised warmth of <persName>O'Carroll's</persName> praise, or by
	    <lb/>the admiring glance of <persName>Colonel Grahame's</persName> eloquent
	    <lb/>eye, which expressed even more than the Captain had
	    <lb/>unhesitatingly uttered, it might be rather difficult to de­
	    <lb/>termine. The Major, however, who delighted in teaz­
	    <lb/>ing <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, laughed heartily, and said, as soon as he
	    <lb/>could speak composedly,</p>
          <p>
            <said>We shall not call this flattery, Captain, but sober,

	    <lb/>perbole to season it. <persName>Kate</persName>, I hope you will not grow
	    <lb/>vain, when you find out what a rare paragon you are.</said>

          <p><said>I think I hear the surgeon in the hall,</said> said <persName>O'Car­
	      <lb/>roll</persName>, glad of an opportunity to escape from the Major's
	    <lb/>ridicule; <said>shall I bring him in here, sir?</said></p>
          <p><said>Yes, if you please,</said> said <persName>Major Courtland</persName>; <said>but
	      <lb/>no,</said> he added quickly, <said>I will go to him myself; and
	      <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName>, my dear, will you order dinner somewhat
	      <lb/>earlier than usual, as <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> is anxious to
	      <lb/>return to camp, and we will detain him the shortest time
	      <lb/>possible.</said></p>
          <p><said>But you will not leave us, Colonel,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,
	    <lb/><said>without informing us of your adventures, and in what
	      <lb/>corner of the earth you have been hid this age past.</said></p>
          <p><said>The recital will occupy more time than I can
	      <lb/>possibly command to-day,</said> said <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>;
	    <lb/><said>but I have promised the Major to pass tomorrow with
	      <lb/>him, and will then recount all that has befallen me,
	      <lb/>since the evening on which we parted in the glen at
	      <lb/><placeName>Saratoga</placeName>. I reached the camp only yesterday, and
	      <lb/>was, this morning, riding hither, when the noise of the
	      <lb/>skirmish reached my ear, and on arriving at the scene
	      <lb/>of action, I immediately perceived, from the state of
	      <lb/>the engagement, that my interference was necessary.</said></p>
          <p><said>It was ill-timed enough, however,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,
	    <lb/><said>and the consequences incline me to wish you had
	      <lb/>kept peaceably on your way, instead of turning aside,
	      <lb/>to snatch away poor <persName>Talbot's</persName> victory.</said></p>
          <p><said>I wish, at least, it had been done with less personal
	      <lb/>injury to him,</said> said <persName>Grahame</persName>; <said>but here is the sur­
	      <lb/>geon, who, I hope, will be able to give us assurance of
	      <lb/>his speedy restoration.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Major Courtland</persName>, at this moment, entered, followed
	    <lb/>by the surgeon, and <persName>Catherine</persName> withdrew.</p>
          <p>The surgeon pronounced favorably of <persName>Captain Tal­
	      <lb/>bot's</persName> wounds, and after remaining with <persName>Colonel Gra­
	      <lb/>hame</persName> to dinner, they returned together to the American
	    <lb/>camp. Towards evening the wounded officer fulfilled
	    <lb/>the surgeon's prediction, by reviving to perfect con­
	    <lb/>sciousness, and though weak, from loss of blood, he
	    <pb n="229"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="20(1)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">229</mw>
	    <lb/>appeared easy and free from pain. He was delighted
	    <lb/>to find himself under the hospitable roof of <persName>Major
	    <lb/>Courtland</persName>, though a slight degree of agitation crossed
	    <lb/>his features, when the soft voice of <persName>Catherine</persName> first
	    <lb/>greeted his ear, in kind inquiries after his welfare.
	    <lb/>But it quickly subsided into a tranquil and happy ex­
	    <lb/>pression, and his eye brightened, whenever her light
	    <lb/>step sounded in the apartment, or her hand offered any
	    <lb/>thing to his lips.</p>
          <p><persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> watched beside him, during the
	    <lb/>night, and the morning found him so much better,
	    <lb/>that the general attention and interest, which an appre­
	    <lb/>hension of his danger had drawn towards him, became
	    <lb/>fixed upon his brave captor.</p>
          <p>The reappearance of <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> had caused
	    <lb/>both the Major and <persName>O'Carroll</persName> extreme surprise and
	    <lb/>joy; while <persName>Catherine</persName>, though less astonished, experi­
	    <lb/>enced a variety of sensations, which she sought not to
	    <lb/>define.</p>
          <p>On the following morning, the Colonel arrived
	    <lb/>early with the surgeon; and when the visit to <persName>Captain
	    <lb/>Talbot</persName> was paid, and the doctor had taken his depart­
	    <lb/>ure, after confirming his favourable opinion of his
	    <lb/>patient, the wounded man was left for a time to the
	    <lb/>care of <persName>Martha</persName>, while the rest of the party assembled
	    <lb/>in the parlor, to hear the promised recital of <persName>Colonel
	    <lb/>Grahame</persName>.</p>
          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> and <persName>Amelia</persName> seated themselves at a small
	    <lb/>work table, the Major occupied a corner of the sofa,
	    <lb/>while <persName>O'Carroll</persName> took possession of <persName>Miss Courtland's</persName>
	    <lb/>music stool, and with his back supported against the
	    <lb/>instrument, remained stationary, during the recital;
	    <lb/>except, when particularly excited, he swung his seat
	    <lb/>half round, or rose and walking hastily through the
	    <lb/>apartment, as hastily returned, and resumed his former
	    <lb/>station. <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> drew his chair towards
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName>, and while recounting his adventures, his
	    <lb/>eyes strayed, not unfrequently, to her face, which elo­
	    <lb/>quently expressed her feelings, and yielded him a flat­

	    <lb/>tering testimony of the interest which she took in his

          <p>But to spare our readers the frequent interruptions,
	    <lb/>caused by the remarks and exclamations of the party,

          <p>We will now request permission of our readers to
	    <lb/>recur to the evening of <persName>Colonel Grahame's</persName> singular dis­
	    <lb/>appearance, after the conversation, which passed be­
	    <lb/>tween him and <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, in the glen at <placeName>Sara­
	      <lb/>toga</placeName>. It may be recollected that he left his companion
	    <lb/>to recover a pistol, which he had forgotten, and was
	    <lb/>subsequently seen no more, till the period which has
	    <lb/>again introduced him to our notice.</p>
          <p>The Colonel walked hastily to the low, flat rock, on
	    <lb/>which he thought he had left the weapon; but, after
	    <lb/>groping over its surface for some minutes, without find­
	    <lb/>ing it, he proceeded farther up the glen, to a similar
	    <lb/>rock, on which he imagined it possible he might have
	    <lb/>laid it. But here also he was unsuccessful, and feeling
	    <lb/>it vain to attempt any farther search, involved as every
	    <lb/>object now was in the obscurity of night, he resolved
	    <lb/>to defer it till morning, and was on the point of turning
	    <lb/>back to rejoin <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, when he heard a low, deep
	    <lb/>groan, as of some one in distress, and apparently at no
	    <lb/>great distance; and impelled by humane feelings, he
	    <lb/>advanced a few paces, and stopped to listen.</p>
          <pb n="231"/>

          <mw type="pageNum">231</mw>
          <p>The sounds were shortly repeated, with even more
	    <lb/>distinctness, and they seemed like the moanings of a
	    <lb/>sick child. <persName>Grahame's</persName> compassionate feelings were
	    <lb/>deeply excited; he imagined that some hapless inno­
	    <lb/>cent had strayed from its parents, and was perishing
	    <lb/>with famine in this wilderness. The thought was agony
	    <lb/>to him; and forgetful of the situation in which he had
	    <lb/>left <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, unmindful even of personal danger, he
	    <lb/>continued to follow the sounds, which were repeated
	    <lb/>at regular intervals, intent only on the hope of rescuing
	    <lb/>the object of his compassion from the miserable fate
	    <lb/>which awaited it. He was somewhat perplexed, how­
	    <lb/>ever, to find that the moans seemed to recede, as rapid­
	    <lb/>ly, as he advanced; and though he had left the glen,
	    <lb/>and penetrated into the wilderness, they seemed still at
	    <lb/>the same distance, as when he first heard them. He
	    <lb/>could only suppose, that the unfortunate child, bewild­
	    <lb/>ered by the darkness, continued to stray, wherever
	    <lb/>chance might lead, and he walked more quickly for­
	    <lb/>ward; and fearful of alarming it, gently and in a sooth­
	    <lb/>ing tone, called on it to stop.</p>
          <p>The sounds instantly ceased, and quite unsuspicious
	    <lb/>of stratagem, he walked eagerly towards the spot, from
	    <lb/>whence they had last proceeded, and where he fancied
	    <lb/>he could perceive a figure move beneath the clear light
	    <lb/>of the stars, which now thickly studded the heavens,
	    <lb/>and partially disclosed the gloomy recesses of the forest.
	    <lb/>But it was only a bush waving in the night breeze; and
	    <lb/>at a loss how to proceed, he stopped to listen for some
	    <lb/>sound, which might direct him, when suddenly he felt
	    <lb/>himself seized from behind by a rude and strong grasp,
	    <lb/>which confined both his arms with a rigor, from which
	    <lb/>he in vain endeavoured to free himself.</p>
          <p>By a few low words, which passed between the two
	    <lb/>persons who held him, he perceived that he was in
	    <lb/>the hands of <name>Indians</name>, and he instantly conceived that
	    <lb/>they had imitated the voice of a child, to decoy him
	    <lb/>into their power; for he knew it was the custom of
	    <lb/>these savages to mimic the cries of different animals,
	    <lb/>when they wished to ensnare their prey.</p>
          <pb n="232"/>
          <milestone unit="sig" n="20(2)v"/>
          <mw type="pageNum">232</mw>
          <p>The moment this suspicion flashed upon the Colonel's
	    <lb/>mind, he renewed his struggles for freedom with a vio­
	    <lb/>lence, which at length enabled him to seize his remain­
	    <lb/>ing pistol; for his sword had been snatched from his side
	    <lb/>in the first moment of attack, by a third assailant, who
	    <lb/>now joined his efforts to those of his companions, in an
	    <lb/>attempt to bind their prisoner.</p>
          <p>In the contest which ensued, the pistol went off in
	    <lb/>the hand of <persName>Grahame</persName>, and its contents passed through
	    <lb/>his shoulder. Immediately convinced that all further
	    <lb/>efforts would now be ineffectual to obtain his freedom,
	    <lb/>he called loudly upon <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, unconscious of the
	    <lb/>distance which separated them, and vainly hoping his
	    <lb/>voice might reach the ear of his friend, and intimate
	    <lb/>to him his need of assistance. The wary savages,
	    <lb/>however, had taken the precaution to lure him beyond
	    <lb/>the reach of help, before they commenced their attack;
	    <lb/>and, though assured that they had him now completely
	    <lb/>in their power, yet, with a fierce cruelty, which they
	    <lb/>delight to exercise, they tore the military sash from him,
	    <lb/>and bound it so rigidly over his mouth, that he was
	    <lb/>inable to utter an audible sound. They then raised
	    <lb/>him forcibly from the ground, and bore him rapidly on­
	    <lb/>ward. For some time, the resistance which he con­
	    <lb/>tinued to make, caused them much trouble, and greatly
	    <lb/>retarded their progress; but the effusion of blood from
	    <lb/>his wound, soon rendered him incapable of exertion,
	    <lb/>and obliged him to remain passive in their hands.</p>
          <p>When they reached the low, wet ground in the forest
	    <lb/>where <persName>Captain Budworth</persName> and his party had discovered
	    <lb/>the human tracks, they placed him upon his feet, still,
	    <lb/>however, retaining strict hold of him; and stopped a
	    <lb/>moment to consult on the expediency of crossing the
	    <lb/>spot, or of going round it, in order to reach their place
	    <lb/>of destination.</p>
          <p>Savages, when apprehensive of pursuit, will seldom
	    <lb/>venture on ground which easily receives the impression
	    <lb/>of the foot; choosing rather to travel miles out of
	    <lb/>the direct course, over a rocky or hard surface, where
	    <lb/>no trace can be left behind them. In this instance,
	    <pb n="233"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="20(3)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">233</mw>
	    <lb/>however, they agreed to depart from their usual cus­
	    <lb/>tom, urged by the situation of their prisoner, whose
	    <lb/>profuse bleeding had reduced him nearly to a state of
	    <lb/>insensibility, and by the fear of the immediate pursuit,
	    <lb/>which the disappearance of so valuable an officer as
	    <lb/><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, might occasion. Wrapping a large
	    <lb/>bear skin about him, to prevent the blood from staining
	    <lb/>the ground, which would, at once, betray their course,
	    <lb/>they again raised the Colonel, and proceeded with
	    <lb/>expedition across the marshy soil, and ascending the
	    <lb/>precipitous bank, on the opposite side again descended
	    <lb/>into the ravine, and entered the wigwam, which <persName>O'Car­
	    <lb/>roll</persName> had explored with <persName>Captain Budworth</persName>.</p>
          <p>A large fire was blazing in the cntre of the hut,
	    <lb/>before which sat, or rather squatted, in the Indian man­
	    <lb/>ner, a young squaw, who rose quickly, as the party
	    <lb/>entered, and, at the command of him who seemed to
	    <lb/>be the Chief, spread a large mat upon the floor, on
	    <lb/>which they placed the Colonel. Two of the savages
	    <lb/>sat down, one on each side of him, to prevent any
	    <lb/>chance of escape, should he attempt it; and, perceiving
	    <lb/>that he looked exceedingly pale, and seemed near faint­
	    <lb/>ing from the loss of so much blood, they offered him
	    <lb/>rum to drink from the shell of a gourd. But he re­
	    <lb/>jected it with disgust; and, making a signal that he
	    <lb/>preferred water, the Chief ordered the woman to pro­
	    <lb/>cure it. <persName>Grahame</persName> understood the Mohawk language,
	    <lb/>and knew, from their speech, that his captors were of
	    <lb/>that nation; but he was careful not to betray to them
	    <lb/>his knowledge, lest it should prevent their speaking
	    <lb/>with freedom, in his presence, and thus deprive him of
	    <lb/>an opportunity to learn their designs. He was attentive,
	    <lb/>though not obviously so, to all their gestures, and to
	    <lb/>every word which they uttered; and he heard the
	    <lb/>woman say, as she rose to bring the water, which the
	    <lb/>Chief had desired her to procure,</p>
          <p>
            <said>He has slaked his thirst with your blood, yet now
	      <lb/>you pity his sufferings.</said>
          </p>
          <p>The answer of the Chief was made in so low a tone,
	    <lb/>that he could not understand it, and when the squaw
	    <mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(+3)">20*</mw>

	    <milestone unit="sig" n="20(3)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">234</mw>
	    <lb/>approached him with the water, he felt so great a re­
	    <lb/>pugnance to her, that he did not raise his eyes to her
	    <lb/>face, till she said in a whisper, and in very good <name>English</name>,
	    <lb/>as she bent over him,</p>
          <p>
            <said>Fear nothing; <persName>Ohmeina</persName> is here, and you shall both
	      <lb/>be saved.</said>
          </p>
          <p><persName>Grahame</persName> started, and looked up with extreme sur­
	    <lb/>prise; but she motioned him to remain silent, and the
	    <lb/>presence of the <name>Indians</name> compelled him to obey her.
	    <lb/>But where was <persName>Ohmeina</persName>? and why should this woman
	    <lb/>give him a promise, which her situation seemed to for­
	    <lb/>bid her performing, and which, besides, was so at vari­
	    <lb/>ance with the language which she had addressed to the
	    <lb/>Chief? A promise, too, that implied a knowledge of
	    <lb/>him, and a degree of interest in his welfare, which
	    <lb/>seemed to him exceedingly myserious.</p>
          <p>As these thoughts passed through his mind, he con­
	    <lb/>tinued to observe, through his half closed eyelids, the
	    <lb/>motions of the female; and he could not but admire the
	    <lb/>singular beauty of her countenance and figure, as they
	    <lb/>were now clearly revealed to his view by the light of
	    <lb/>the fire, before which she stood singing, in a sweet, but
	    <lb/>subdued tone, one of the wild melodies of her nation.</p>
          <p>As she caught the fixed glance of <persName>Grahame's</persName> eye,
	    <lb/>she raised her finger to her lips, and, without ceasing
	    <lb/>her song, changed it into <name>English</name>.</p>
          <p>
            <said>The deer lies close when the hunter is near; the
	    <lb/>snare may be around him, but he seeks not to set him­
	    <lb/>self free!</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>Woman, thy song is in the language of the foe,</said><lb/>said one of the <name>Indians</name>, with a frown of suspicion. It
	    <lb/>seemed, however, not in the least to intimidate the
	    <lb/>female, who with a slow motion of her head continued
	    <lb/>her song, mingling the <name>English</name> and <name>Mohawk</name> confusedly
	    <lb/>together.</p>
          <p><said>Frown not upon her, brother,</said> said the Chief.
	    <lb/><said>The Great Spirit loves <persName>Minoya</persName>, and has told her
	      <lb/>many things, of which ye are ignorant. Her songs are
	      <lb/>to fright the captive, and she rejoices that we have
	      <lb/>taken the slayer of our people.</said></p>

          <mw type="pageNum">235</mw>
          <p>While they continued talking, <persName>Minoya</persName>, seeing <persName>Gra­
	      <lb/>hame</persName> still observing her, moved towards a corner of the
	    <lb/>wigwam, where, sitting upright upon a mat, the Colonel
	    <lb/>perceived his faithful <persName>Ohmeina</persName>, regarding him with a
	    <lb/>mournful and tender expression, and who, the moment
	    <lb/>he caught the eye of his benefactor, bowed his head,
	    <lb/>and laid his fettered hands upon his breast, with a ges­
	    <lb/>ture of affection and respect.</p>
          <p><persName>Minoya</persName> bent down, and seemed to speak, but in so
	    <lb/>low a tone, that <persName>Grahame</persName> could not even hear the sound
	    <lb/>of her voice, nor could he attend any longer to her
	    <lb/>motions; for the pain of his wound, which had received
	    <lb/>no attention, was excruciating; and, united to the in­
	    <lb/>tense heat of the fire, against which he lay, reduced
	    <lb/>him nearly to fainting.</p>
          <p><persName>Kamaset</persName>, the Chief, perceiving his sufferings, spoke
	    <lb/>to <persName>Minoya</persName>, who immediately approached the Colonel,
	    <lb/>and intimated her wish to examine his wound. Aware
	    <lb/>of the skill frequently possessed by these people, he
	    <lb/>submitted his shoulder without reluctance to her in­
	    <lb/>spection, and shortly experienced the beneficial effect of
	    <lb/>her attention. The contents of the pistol had passed
	    <lb/>through the fleshy part of the shoulder, and though the
	    <lb/>wound was, for the present, painful, there was reason
	    <lb/>to believe, that, with judicious management, it might
	    <lb/>shortly be quite healed.</p>
          <p><persName>Minoya</persName> dressed it with a balsam distilled from herbs,
	    <lb/>of which she had often experienced the virtue, and it
	    <lb/>so soothed and quieted the pain, that <persName>Grahame</persName> soon
	    <lb/>felt almost entirely at ease. She performed her office
	    <lb/>in silence, broken, at intervals, by a few notes of the
	    <lb/>songs, which she seemed to have ever on her lips; but
	    <lb/>she made no attempt to renew her former communi­
	    <lb/>cations with the Colonel, probably restrained by the
	    <lb/>presence of one of the <name>Indians</name>, who stood by to observe
	    <lb/>the mode of her operation, while she dressed the wound.
	    <lb/>When she had finished, he turned away, and, unobserved,
	    <lb/>she placed a pillow of deer skins beneath her patient's head,
	    <lb/>chanting, while she did it, words to the following effect:</p>
          <said>

          <p>This epithet convinced him that he was in the hands
	    <lb/>of those savages, on whom he had avenged the destruc­
	    <lb/>tion of <persName>Ohmeina's</persName> settlement; for he knew that in
	    <lb/>consequence of his having appeared in the midst of a
	    <lb/>violent thunder storm, and fallen upon them by the
	    <lb/>glare of the vivid lightning which illuminated the hor­
	    <lb/>rible scene, they had bestowed on him the significant
	    <lb/>appellation by which <persName>Minoya</persName> had just now addressed
	    <lb/>him.</p>
          <p>This conviction, by no means a consoling one, for
	    <lb/>some time prevented his enjoying the repose which he
	    <lb/>required. The uncertainty of his fate filled his mind
	    <lb/>with gloomy reflections, which were not at all enlivened
	    <lb/>by the appearance of the fierce looking group who were
	    <lb/>gathered around the decaying fire. Among them,
	    <lb/><persName>Minoya</persName> mingled; her finely formed figure, and delicate
	    <lb/>features, full of animation and intelligence, contrasting
	    <lb/>strongly with the muscular and half naked persons, and
	    <lb/>hideously painted faces of the <name>Indians</name>. They conversed
	    <lb/>earnestly, but in a low tone; often looking towards <persName>Gra­
	      <lb/>hame</persName>, who affected to sleep, and using many gestures
	    <lb/>and signs, which he could not interpret. <persName>Minoya</persName> bore
	    <lb/>no inconsiderable part in the conference; her words
	    <lb/>flowed rapidly, and her motions were graceful and
	    <lb/>animated, but equally unintelligible to the Colonel, as
	    <lb/>were those of her companions.</p>
          <p>The novelty of this scene, and the interest with which
	    <lb/>he, for some time, continued to observe it, could not long,
	    <lb/>however, overcome the influence of a powerful anodyne,
	    <lb/>which <persName>Minoya</persName> had administered to him; extreme weari­
	    <lb/>ness increased its effect, and gradually the dusky group
	    <lb/>faded from his view, and he sunk into a profound sleep.
	    <lb/>He yielded to it the more readily, as he remarked that
	    <lb/>his faithful <persName>Ohmeina</persName> was on the watch, though artfully
	    <lb/>pretending sleep whenever he thought himself observed.</p>
          <p><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> was rudely awakened long before
	    <lb/>day break, by two of the <name>Indians</name>, who were attempting
	    <lb/>to lift him from the mat. Bewildered by being so sud­
	    <lb/>denly aroused from sleep, he looked around him, unable,
	    <lb/>for the moment, to account for his present situation, and
	    <pb n="237"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="20(5)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">237</mw>
	    <lb/>suffered himself, without resistance, to be placed upon a
	    <lb/>litter of woven branches, which, after the precaution of
	    <lb/>securing him with thongs of deer skin, two of the <name>Indians</name>
	    <lb/>raised, and proceeded with him out of the wigwam.
	    <lb/>The other two led the fettered <persName>Ohmeina</persName> between them,
	    <lb/>and <persName>Minoya</persName> walked by the side of <persName>Grahame</persName>, without
	    <lb/>speaking, but uninterruptedly humming her sweet, but
	    <lb/>monotonous song.</p>
          <p>The freshness of the morning air revived the recol­
	    <lb/>lection of the Colonel, and by signs he endeavoured to
	    <lb/>inquire whither they were carrying him, and what was
	    <lb/>to be his fate. But he received no answer, except a
	    <lb/>fiend-like laugh, which, heroic as <persName>Grahame</persName> was, curdled
	    <lb/>his blood with horror, and suppressed all farther at­
	    <lb/>tempt at inquiry.</p>
          <p>They continued to march forward in perfect silence,
	    <lb/>for more than an hour, and with such extreme rapidity,
	    <lb/>that <persName>Grahame</persName> thought they must have travelled many
	    <lb/>miles, when they stopped in the admidst of a wet and
	    <lb/>tangled thicket, and, setting down the litter, gathered in
	    <lb/>a group, and spoke to each other in low whispers.
	    <lb/><persName>Grahame</persName> imagined they had nearly reached the ter­
	    <lb/>mination of their march, and he was not mistaken.
	    <lb/>They advanced a few paces, and, forcing aside the
	    <lb/>brushwood and matted boughs, disclosed the narrow
	    <lb/>mouth of a cave, into which the whole party made their
	    <lb/>way, by creeping on their hands and knees. A light
	    <lb/>was instantly struck, and a fire kindled, which revealed
	    <lb/>to view the interior of the rude cavern. The red and
	    <lb/>glaring flame glanced wildly on the craggy walls, drip­
	    <lb/>ping with moisture, and clothed with a short green moss,
	    <lb/>which, in this humid atmosphere, flourished in perpetual
	    <lb/>verdure; while the smoke, after circling in fantastic
	    <lb/>eddies round the roof, found its way out at the numerous
	    <lb/>crevices which nature had made.</p>
          <p>The place was high enough for a man to stand up­
	    <lb/>right, and ten or twelve feet in circumference. It ap­
	    <lb/>peared to have been frequently occupied before, for it
	    <lb/>was furnished with skins and mats; and many rude
	    <lb/>utensils, such as are used by the Indian tribes, were
	    <pb n="238"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="20(5)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">238</mw>
	    <lb/>scattered about it. <persName>Grahame</persName> was furnished with a mat,
	    <lb/>on which, wearied and ill as he found himself, he was
	    <lb/>glad to seek repose; they offered him also some of the
	    <lb/>food which he had prepared for themselves, but he
	    <lb/>felt no inclination to eat, though he gladly accepted a
	    <lb/>draught of cold water from <persName>Minoya</persName>; and, throwing him­
	    <lb/>self upon his mat, fell into a confused and unrefreshing
	    <lb/>slumber.</p>
          <p>When he awoke, the sun was darting through the
	    <lb/>narrow crevices of the cavern, and he looked around
	    <lb/>upon its rough walls, and upon the figures which occu­
	    <lb/>pied it, to assure himself that he was not under the in­
	    <lb/>fluence of a bewildering dream. But, as he identified
	    <lb/>the person of <persName>Ohmeina</persName>, and the female <name>Indian</name>, the
	    <lb/>reality of his unfortunate situation pressed forcibly on
	    <lb/>his mind.</p>
          <p>They were the only ones who remained in the cave;
	    <lb/>and, for a minute, he lay silently observing them. The
	    <lb/>hands and feet of <persName>Ohmeina</persName> were bound, and he sat
	    <lb/>leaning against the side of the rock; before him stood
	    <lb/><persName>Minoya</persName>, speaking in a low and earnest tone, and with
	    <lb/>a rapid utterance, as if fearful of sudden interruption.
	    <lb/><persName>Ohmeina</persName>, at length, caught the Colonel's eye, and un­
	    <lb/>able to control his affectionate feelings, he uttered an
	    <lb/>exclamation of delight at being able to address him,
	    <lb/>without restraint; and was making an effort to spring
	    <lb/>towards him, when <persName>Minoya</persName>, with a look of alarm, placed
	    <lb/>her hand upon his shoulder, and said a few words so
	    <lb/>hastily, that <persName>Grahame</persName> could not understand them.
	    <lb/><persName>Ohmeina</persName> instantly sunk back, and drooping his head
	    <lb/>upon his breast, remained silent and motionless. The
	    <lb/>woman then hasted to the mouth of the cave, and, after
	    <lb/>listening and looking cautiously around, for several
	    <lb/>minutes, she returned and approached the mat, on
	    <lb/>which <persName>Grahame</persName> was lying.</p>
          <p>Without any ceremony, she addressed him in the
	    <lb/>same hurried manner, in which she had conversed
	    <lb/>with <persName>Ohmeina</persName>, informing him, that the Chief would
	    <lb/>soon return and she must improve this opportunity to
	    <pb n="239"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="20(6)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">239</mw>
	    <lb/>communicate, what it was of the utmost importance for
	    <lb/>him to know.</p>
          <p>She proceeded to say, that he was a prisoner in the
	    <lb/>hands of <persName>Kamaset</persName>, the Chief, who had burned the
	    <lb/>flourishing settlement of <persName>Ohmeina</persName>, and who enraged
	    <lb/>at the vengeance which <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> had taken
	    <lb/>for the deed, swore, with tremendous oaths, to make
	    <lb/>both him and <persName>Ohmeina</persName> feel the bitterness of his wrath.
	    <lb/><persName>Minoya's</persName> husband and infant child were among the
	    <lb/>victims of that dreadful night, and terrified by the
	    <lb/>frightful scene of bloodshed and destruction, she, with
	    <lb/>several other females, fled to the woods for safety.
	    <lb/>But they were overtaken in the subsequent flight of the
	    <lb/><name>Indians</name>, and all excepting herself sacrificed to their
	    <lb/>fury. Pleased with her beauty, the Chief permitted
	    <lb/>her to live, and forced her to become his wife. De­
	    <lb/>testing him in her heart, yet informed of his hostile in­
	    <lb/>tentions with regard to <persName>Ohmeina</persName> and the gallant <persName>Gra­
	      <lb/>hame</persName>, whose lives she hoped to be the instrument of
	    <lb/>preserving, she studiously concealed her real feelings,
	    <lb/>and even pretended an affection for <persName>Kamaset</persName>, and an
	    <lb/>aversion for the objects of his hatred. In short she
	    <lb/>completely deceived him, and acquired over him the
	    <lb/>most entire ascendancy. She also, by assuming a cer­
	    <lb/>tain air of mystery, inspired him with a belief in her
	    <lb/>superior wisdom, and rendered herself an object of awe
	    <lb/>and reverence to his superstitious followers. Never
	    <lb/>doubting the sincerity of her words, he believed that
	    <lb/>she was as hostile as himself, to the Colonel and his
	    <lb/>Indian follower; and persuaded that she held com­
	    <lb/>munion with a superior being, he entrusted her with
	    <lb/>all his projects to ensnare them, and consulted her in
	    <lb/>every case of importance. In continuing to live with,
	    <lb/>and affecting to love this monster, whom from her
	    <lb/>very soul she hated and despised, <persName>Minoya</persName> did constant
	    <lb/>violence to her feelings. She sometimes resolved to
	    <lb/>kill him, and then make her escape; but she was not
	    <lb/>savage enough to execute the deed of horror. En­
	    <lb/>dowed, in an eminent degree, with that constancy and
	    <lb/>firm endurance, which are peculiar attributes of the
	    <pb n="240"/>

	    <mw type="pageNum">240</mw>
	    <lb/>Indian character, she suffered every species of mental
	    <lb/>anguish, and resolved to sacrifice even her life, if that
	    <lb/>were necessary, to ensure the safety of the Chief <persName>Ohmei­
	      <lb/>na</persName>, and the gallant <persName>Grahame</persName>, who had so bravely
	    <lb/>avenged the cruel slaughter of those who were most
	    <lb/>dear to her heart.</p>
          <p>In the mean time, <persName>Kamaset</persName>, intent only on accom­
	    <lb/>plishing his revenge, deserted from the English army,
	    <lb/>with whom his tribe were in alliance, and retired to
	    <lb/>the deep ravine in the forest, near <placeName>Saratoga</placeName>, where he
	    <lb/>constructed a wigwam, and continued to dwell, till the
	    <lb/>period which threw the Colonel into his power. <persName>Mi­
	      <lb/>noya</persName> had made several attempts to discover the Colo­
	    <lb/>nel, or <persName>Ohmeina</persName>, and inform them of the mischief,
	    <lb/>which was threatened against them; but the jealousy
	    <lb/>with which she was watched by <persName>Samokin</persName>, an <name>Indian</name>
	    <lb/>who was in league with the Chief, had defeated her
	    <lb/>intentions; though she was revolving a plan, which she
	    <lb/>hoped might prove successful, at the very moment
	    <lb/>when the art of her savage lord had unhappily entrap­
	    <lb/>ped his unsuspicious victim.</p>
          <p>On that evening, <persName>Samokin</persName>, by the order of his chief,
	    <lb/>was lurking round the outskirts of the forest, where
	    <lb/><persName>Grahame</persName>, with other officers, was often known to walk,
	    <lb/>when he discovered him, with his follower <persName>Ohmeina</persName>,
	    <lb/>slowly pacing up the narrow glen together. <persName>Samokin</persName>
	    <lb/>was alone, and perceiving that both his victims were
	    <lb/>armed, he feared to attack them, without calling in the
	    <lb/>aid of <persName>Kamaset</persName>. He accordingly, returned hastily to
	    <lb/>the wigwam; the chief joined him with two others, and
	    <lb/>they were on their way back to the glen when they
	    <lb/>encountered <persName>Ohmeina</persName>, who had just separated from
	    <lb/><persName>Grahame</persName>, and was proceeding on his destined journey.</p>
          <p>He was immediately seized, bound, and, under the
	    <lb/>escort of the two <name>Indians</name>, sent back to the wigwam.
	    <lb/>One of them remained to guard him, and the other
	    <lb/>rejoined the Chief and his companion. When they
	    <lb/>reached the glen they were disappointed to observe an
	    <lb/>officer in the British uniform, walking with <persName>Grahame</persName>.
	    <lb/>The <name>English</name> had been their allies, their very good
	    <pb n="241"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="21(1)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">241</mw>
	    <lb/>friends; they feared to offend them, and were appre­
	    <lb/>hensive of being recognised. They waited a long
	    <lb/>time, in perfect silence, hoping that <persName>Grahame</persName> might
	    <lb/>again be left alone; but when they saw the two officers
	    <lb/>departing together, they began to think their scheme
	    <lb/>frustrated, for the present. The Colonel however,
	    <lb/>while talking with <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, had laid one of his pistols
	    <lb/>upon a rock, with the intention of taking it up when he
	    <lb/>had examined the lock of the other; but in the interest
	    <lb/>of the conversation had forgotten it. <persName>Kamaset</persName> fixed
	    <lb/>his eye upon the weapon, of which he possessed him­
	    <lb/>self, the moment he was assured that <persName>Grahame</persName> and his
	    <lb/>friend had quitted the glen. But he had scarcely
	    <lb/>snatched it from the rock, when he heard steps again
	    <lb/>approaching. He flew to his covert, and though the
	    <lb/>fast increasing darkness had involved every object in
	    <lb/>obscurity, their outlines were still visible, and it was
	    <lb/>easy to distinguish the tall figure of <persName>Grahame</persName>, from the
	    <lb/>more diminutive one of <persName>O'Carroll</persName>. The Colonel was
	    <lb/>alone, and <persName>Kamaset</persName> rightly imagined him to have come
	    <lb/>in search of his weapon. He heard him grope about
	    <lb/>the rock, and then saw him walk farther on, and stop at
	    <lb/>a similar one. So golden an opportunity was not to be
	    <lb/>neglected, and the Chief, gliding swiftly to the upper
	    <lb/>end of the glen, whispered his companions to precede
	    <lb/>him, at a cautious distance, while he endeavoured to
	    <lb/>lure his prey beyond the reach of his assistance.</p>
          <p>Artfully imitating the cries of a child, which, with
	    <lb/>instinctive sagacity, he judged would readily excite the
	    <lb/>interest and compassion of <persName>Grahame</persName>, he led him on,
	    <lb/>till convinced his loudest calls for succour would be
	    <lb/>made in vain, and then, joining his savage companions,
	    <lb/>they seized the unfortunate Colonel, and led him cap­
	    <lb/>tive to their wigwam.</p>
          <p>Having related these particulars, which she had
	    <lb/>learned from theChief, <persName>Minoya</persName> proceeded to inform
	    <lb/>the Colonel, that both he and <persName>Ohmeina</persName> were destined
	    <lb/>to death; but were first to be carried to an Indian vil­
	    <lb/>lage on the <placeName>Mohawk</placeName>, where they were to be publicly
	    <lb/>sacrificed. Her interposition alone had prevented their
	    <mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(+3)">21</mw>
	    <pb n="242"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="21(1)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">242</mw>
	    <lb/>being sent directly thither; but alarmed for the conse­
	    <lb/>quences of such a proceeding, she had represented to
	    <lb/>the Chief the disgrace which would be reflected upon
	    <lb/>his valor, should he sacrifice a prisoner, who was suf­
	    <lb/>fering by a wound from his own weapon; that more­
	    <lb/>over, should he persevere in his design, his revenge
	    <lb/>would, in all probability, be disappointed, as it was
	    <lb/>scarcely possible that the pirsoner, in his present situa­
	    <lb/>tion, should live till the end of the march.</p>
          <p>Fearful of losing his revenge, <persName>Kamaset</persName> yielded to
	    <lb/>the persuasions of <persName>Minoya</persName>, and consigned the Colonel
	    <lb/>to her charge, with an injunction to heal his wound,
	    <lb/>within a week. Uncertain, however, whether she
	    <lb/>should be able to effect his release during that time,
	    <lb/>she informed the Chief, that the wound was deep, and
	    <lb/>that it might perhaps be two weeks, before the pri­
	    <lb/>soner would be able to commence the journey. <persName>Kama­
	      <lb/>set</persName> heard her with a frown, and said, that if in ten days
	    <lb/>he could not walk, the fire of sacrifice should be light­
	    <lb/>ed in the cave, or they would convey him on a litter
	    <lb/>to the Mohawk village. Two of the <name>Indians</name> had that
	    <lb/>morning set out for the Mohawk village to prepare for
	    <lb/>the sacrifice of the prisoners; and at the appointed
	    <lb/>time they were to return, and assist to conveying them
	    <lb/>thither.</p>
          <p>The Chief and his companion resolved, in the mean
	    <lb/>time to confine themselves chiefly to the cave; and
	    <lb/>they had now gone to the wigwam, in order to convey
	    <lb/>from thence what things they valued, and afterwards
	    <lb/>todestroy the hut, lest it should lead to their discovery.</p>
          <p><persName>Minoya</persName> charged the Colonel to affect extreme ill­
	    <lb/>ness, and appear to notice nothing that was passing.
	    <lb/>She assured him, she would contrive means for their
	    <lb/>escape, and become herself the companion of their
	    <lb/>flight; that in order to effect this object, she must pre­
	    <lb/>tend to treat them with harshness, and feign to espouse
	    <lb/>warmly the feelings and sentiments of the Chief;
	    <lb/>though she had hitherto, and would still, prevent any
	    <lb/>exercise of cruelty.</p>
          <pb n="243"/>

          <p><persName>Grahame</persName> inquired, if it was impossible for her to
	    <lb/>convey any intelligence of his situation to his friends.
	    <lb/>She replied that it was utterly so, as <persName>Samokin</persName> was al­
	    <lb/>ready so jealous of her, that he had prevailed on <persName>Kama­
	      <lb/>set</persName> to forbid her quitting the cave, and should she at­
	    <lb/>tempt it, she must inevitably be detected, in which case,
	    <lb/>not only her death, but that of the prisoners would be
	    <lb/>the immediate consequence.</p>
          <p><persName>Grahame</persName> would not, even to save his own life, en­
	    <lb/>danger that of the generous <persName>Minoya</persName>, and while he
	    <lb/>thanked her for all she had done, and still wished to
	    <lb/>do for him, he entreated her to avoid every thing,
	    <lb/>which might excite suspicion, and expose her to the
	    <lb/>malice of the bloodthirsty savages. Relying on her
	    <lb/>sincerity, and trusting much to her address and inge­
	    <lb/>nuity, he resolved to give himself no uneasiness; but if
	    <lb/>he still remained a prisoner, when his arm had recov­
	    <lb/>ered strength, to attempt, by force, what could not be
	    <lb/>effected by stratagem.</p>
          <p><persName>Minoya</persName> had scarcely finished her communications,
	    <lb/>when a rustling noise, at the mouth of the cavern, an­
	    <lb/>nounced the return of the <name>Indians</name>. It was <persName>Kamaset</persName>,
	    <lb/>however, who entered alone, and <persName>Minoya</persName> no sooner
	    <lb/>heard him, than she resumed her habitual song, and
	    <lb/>pretended to busy herself about the shoulder of her pa­
	    <lb/>tient. <persName>Kamaset</persName> approached the corner where <persName>Ohmei­
	      <lb/>na</persName> sat, and addressed him with angry gestures and
	    <lb/>words of insulting scorn. But the noble <name>Indian</name> dis­
	    <lb/>dained to cast down his eyes before a foe, and he fixed
	    <lb/>them proudly upon the dark countenance of <persName>Kamaset</persName>,
	    <lb/>and endured, in perfect silence, the taunts of his cruel
	    <lb/>enemy. Irritated by the calcmness of <persName>Ohmeina</persName>, the
	    <lb/>Chief approached the mat, on which <persName>Grahame</persName> reclin­
	    <lb/>ed, and said, with a laugh of horrid triumph,</p>
          <p>
            <said>The white men seek thee, son of the lightning!
	      <lb/>Arise and join thy brothers, and help them to smite the
	      <lb/>red men, as thou didst, when <persName>Kamaset</persName>, the mighty
	      <lb/>warrior, fled from the strength of thy arm!</said>
          </p>
          <p>By an effort of self-command, which few in his
	    <lb/>situation could have made, <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> subdued

	    <lb/>his feelings, so that not a single feature of his counte­
	    <lb/>nance betrayed the slightest emotion. According to
	    <lb/>the directions of <persName>Minoya</persName>, he had forced them to ap­
	    <lb/>pear inanimate, and had assumed an appearance of
	    <lb/>languor and weakness, which gave an idea of serious
	    <lb/>indisposition.</p>
          <p>The squaw suspended her song, and turning with a
	    <lb/>severe air to the savage, said, in a haughty tone, which
	    <lb/>evinced the extent of her power over him,</p>
          <p>
            <said>Foolish Chief, he hears not thy words; he knows
	      <lb/>not the language of our tribes; speak, and tell me what
	      <lb/>thou hast seen; and if the paths of the forest are filled
	      <lb/>with the long knives of the foe.</said>
          </p>
          <p><persName>Kamaset</persName> immediately related, that when he had
	    <lb/>gained the summit of the bank which bounded the ra­
	    <lb/>vine, he beheld the wigwam surrounded by soldiers,
	    <lb/>who pursued, and would have caught him, had he not
	    <lb/>taken refuge in the hollow trunk of a large tree, near
	    <lb/>which they had several times passed, so close, that he
	    <lb/>could with ease have grasped them. When they were
	    <lb/>weary of searching after him they returned to the ra­
	    <lb/>vine; when he quitted his place of concealment, and
	    <lb/>hastened to the cave. <persName>Samokin</persName>, who had accompanied
	    <lb/>the Chief, also concealed himself, on the first alarm of
	    <lb/>the soldiers, and before he was perceived by them.
	    <lb/>After their departure, he ventured from his hiding
	    <lb/>place, and entered the cave while <persName>Kamaset</persName> was speak­
	    <lb/>ing.</p>
          <p>He informed them that the soldiers had quitted the
	    <lb/>ravine, and crossed the marshy ground; and proposed
	    <lb/>to the Chief to follow, at a distance, and endeavour to
	    <lb/>wound some of them with their arrows. <persName>Kamaset</persName>
	    <lb/>readily assented, and selecting several of his sharpest
	    <lb/>arrows, the two <name>Indians</name> left the cave, and by a circui­
	    <lb/>tous rout approached the spot, where <persName>Captain Bud­
	    <lb/>worth</persName> and his party were stopping to refresh them­
	    <lb/>selves. The arrow, which alarmed them, and which
	    <lb/><persName>Captain Budworth</persName> plucked from the tree beside him,
	    <lb/>was from the bow of <persName>Kamaset</persName>, who with his compan­
	    <pb n="245"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="21(3)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">245</mw>
	    <lb/>ion, took suddenly to flight, after the volley of musket­
	    <lb/>try, which <persName>Budworth</persName> caused to be discharged at them.</p>
          <p>The wigwam was destroyed that night; and in con­
	    <lb/>sequence of the parties, which daily scoured the forest
	    <lb/>in search of <persName>Grahame</persName>, the <name>Indians</name> confined themselves
	    <lb/>closely to the cave, to the great trouble and annoyance
	    <lb/>of the prisoners. <persName>Minoya</persName> was not less displeased by
	    <lb/>it; for her plans were of course delayed, and she fear­
	    <lb/>ed, should they persevere in this system of seclusion,
	    <lb/>they might be entirely frustrated. But though con­
	    <lb/>stantly revolving new projects, in the hope of finding
	    <lb/>one, which, under prersent circumstances, might be
	    <lb/>rendered practicable, she was compelled, in order to
	    <lb/>lull the suspicions of the jealous <persName>Samokin</persName>, to appear to
	    <lb/>treat the unfortunate captives with harshness, and join
	    <lb/>in the contemptuous language, which was uniformly
	    <lb/>addressed to them. So well did she act her part, that
	    <lb/><persName>Grahame</persName> began almost to fear it was not feigned.</p>
          <p>His wound, in the mean time, instead of healing,
	    <lb/>grew worse; while the anxiety of the mind, the close
	    <lb/>confinement which he endured, and the coarse diet
	    <lb/>on which he subsisted, contributed to reduce him
	    <lb/>actually to the state of weakness, which <persName>Minoya</persName> had
	    <lb/>desired him to affect. In brief, he became exceedingly
	    <lb/>ill, and when at the appointed time the other <name>Indians</name>
	    <lb/>returned, to assist in guarding him on the march, his
	    <lb/>condition rendered it impossible for him to walk, and
	    <lb/>the labor of carrying him was so great, that the Chief
	    <lb/>consented to wait another week, when <persName>Minoya</persName> promis­
	    <lb/>ed he should be healed.</p>
          <p>The general search after <persName>Grahame</persName> seemed now
	    <lb/>quite at an end; but a few individuals were almost dai­
	    <lb/>ly seen by the <name>Indians</name>, lurking about the ravine, and
	    <lb/>exploring the recesses of the forest. They were in
	    <lb/>fact, <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, and the two servants; and the
	    <lb/>circumstance of their being always well armed, alone
	    <lb/>deterred the Chief and <persName>Samokin</persName> from attacking them,
	    <lb/>as they had but one musket between them, and that
	    <lb/>was but an awkward weapon in their hands, compared
	    <lb/>to the bows and arrows, which they were in the habit

	    <mw type="pageNum">246</mw>
	    <lb/>of using. Irritated however by the continued intrusion
	    <lb/>of the explorers, and fearful of their discovering the
	    <lb/>cave, the Chief resolved, when reinforced by the two
	    <lb/>absent <name>Indians</name>, to lie in wait, and cut them off by sur­
	    <lb/>prise.</p>
          <p><persName>Minoya</persName> was informed of this design, and she deter­
	    <lb/>mined to prevent its execution. Fond of mystery, and
	    <lb/>jealous of the honor of freeing her Chief and his friend
	    <lb/>from captivity, she wished at the same time to put an
	    <lb/>end to the interference of their friends, and save their
	    <lb/>lives by warning them of the danger which menaced
	    <lb/>them. This she desired to do without discovering her­
	    <lb/>self, in order to render her communications the more
	    <lb/>impressive, and to avoid an explanation, which must
	    <lb/>ensue, should she make herself known. Without re­
	    <lb/>vealing her project to <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, she obtained
	    <lb/>permission of <persName>Kamaset</persName> to quit the cave for an hour, in
	    <lb/>search of some roots, which she wished to prepare for
	    <lb/>the wounded captive. <persName>Samokin</persName> ventured to oppose her
	    <lb/>request; but the Chief silenced him with a stern look,
	    <lb/>and, bidding <persName>Minoya</persName> hasten back, ordered <persName>Samokin</persName> to
	    <lb/>watch the prisoners during her absence.</p>
          <p>The squaw left the cave immediately, and hastened
	    <lb/>to the ravine. It was about the time when <persName>O'Carroll</persName>
	    <lb/>usually made his appearance; and she stood for a few
	    <lb/>minutes on the top of the bank, in expectation of seeing
	    <lb/>him approach. At last she discerned him and his two
	    <lb/>followers crossing the wet soil, and, preciptately de­
	    <lb/>scending the bank, she concealed herself in a small
	    <lb/>sunken cavity between two rocks, which rose behind
	    <lb/>the site of <persName>Kamaset's</persName> wigwam. It was scarcely large
	    <lb/>enough to admit even her slender form; but she reso­
	    <lb/>lutely pressed into it, and carefully covered herself with
	    <lb/>a profusion of moss and dried leaves, over which she
	    <lb/>drew some pine branches, which the tempests had
	    <lb/>severed from the trees, and which so effectually con­
	    <lb/>cealed the fissure that only a very minute observer
	    <lb/>would have been likely to discern it. A thick group
	    <lb/>of dwarf cedars screened the front of the opening,
	    <lb/>through which <persName>Minoya</persName> watched the motions of the
	    <pb n="247"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="21(4)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">247</mw>
	    <lb/>party; and, like the Delphic oracle, from behind its
	    <lb/>cloudy tabernacle, sent forth her solemn and mysterious
	    <lb/>warnings. When, however, in spite of her injunction,
	    <lb/>the imputuous <persName>O'Carroll</persName> descended into the ravine, she
	    <lb/>remained motionless and silent; and, though he passed
	    <lb/>close to the cedars, and even stopped before them, they
	    <lb/>appeared to grow so immediately out of the rock, that
	    <lb/>the most distant idea of any person's being concealed
	    <lb/>behind them never even occurred to him. Had he
	    <lb/>stopped to examine he could not have failed to see the
	    <lb/>piercing black eyes of the <name>Indian</name> peeping from the nar­
	    <lb/>row fissure in which she lay.</p>
          <p>The moment the Captain had left the ravine, she
	    <lb/>stole from her hiding-place, and gathering the few roots
	    <lb/>she pretended to want, hastened to the cave within the
	    <lb/>time prescribed by <persName>Kamaset</persName>.</p>
          <p>The return of <persName>O'Carroll</persName> on the following morning,
	    <lb/>was not discovered by any of the <name>Indians</name>; and, after
	    <lb/>watching for several days, and finding he did not again
	    <lb/>appear, the two <name>Indians</name>, who had recently rejoined the
	    <lb/>Chief, set off on a hunting excursion, from which they
	    <lb/>were to return at the end of three or four days.</p>
          <p>Delighted with the success of her adventure, <persName>Minoya</persName>
	    <lb/>took the first opportunity to relate it to the Colonel; he
	    <lb/>was amused by her ingenious stratagem; but vexed,
	    <lb/>that she did not inform <persName>O'Carroll</persName> of his situation, and
	    <lb/>direct him to come with a sufficient force to his rescue.
	    <lb/>She replied, that it would not have been in her power
	    <lb/>to direct them to the cave, without incurring the danger
	    <lb/>of detection, in which case they must all have lost their
	    <lb/>lives; that his friend would not probably have placed
	    <lb/>any confidence in what she said to him; but would
	    <lb/>have feared some wicked stratagem; that, besides, she
	    <lb/>dared not speak openly with him, because she knew
	    <lb/>some of the <name>Indians</name> were lurking in the forest, and
	    <lb/>might, perhaps, observe her. She further added, that
	    <lb/>the two savages who had lately arrived, were just gone
	    <lb/>off again; and that before they returned she would con­
	    <lb/>trive means for their escape.</p>

          <mw type="pageNum">248</mw>
          <p><persName>Grahame</persName> did not express his dissatisfaction, though
	    <lb/>he felt exceedingly chagrined, that she should neglect
	    <lb/>so good an opportunity of informing <persName>O'Carroll</persName> (for,
	    <lb/>from the description, he had no doubt that it was he,)
	    <lb/>of his situation. But he saw her spirit of intrigue, and
	    <lb/>that she coveted the pleasure of being herself the sole
	    <lb/>instrument of his release; and he became the sooner
	    <lb/>reconciled to her manœuvre, since two of the <name>Indians</name>
	    <lb/>had again left them, and his strength was returning so
	    <lb/>fast, that he imagined he should find it no difficult mat­
	    <lb/>ter to subdue those who remained.</p>
          <p>On the evening succeeding the departure of the <name>In­
	    <lb/>dians</name>, the Chief informed <persName>Minoya</persName>, that he and <persName>Samokin</persName>
	    <lb/>should go out to hunt the next morning, and she must
	    <lb/>keep a strict watch over the prisoners. She could
	    <lb/>scarcely conceal the joy, which she felt, on hearing of
	    <lb/>this design, and she whispered to the Colonel, that, be­
	    <lb/>fore the next night, he should sit at the board of his
	    <lb/>white brothers. Great was their disappointment, how­
	    <lb/>ever, when, on the following morning, <persName>Kamaset</persName> declared
	    <lb/>he should not hunt that day; and, seating himself upon
	    <lb/>a mat, began to shape some arrows, from the tough
	    <lb/>wood of the ash. <persName>Samokin</persName> also employed himself in
	    <lb/>repairing his moccasins; and <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> could
	    <lb/>not subdue his vexation, when he found that their escape
	    <lb/>was likely to be prevented, for this day at least. He
	    <lb/>looked wishfully at the place where his sword was de­
	    <lb/>posited, with the tomahawks of the <name>Indians</name>, and would
	    <lb/>have sprung from the mat to seize it, and fight his way
	    <lb/>from the dismal cavern, where so many days of his
	    <lb/>existence had lingered miserably away, had not his
	    <lb/>fetters convinced him of the hopelessness of the design,
	    <lb/>and compelled him to exert that fortitude which had so
	    <lb/>long sustained him.</p>
          <p>During the severity of his illness, <persName>Kamaset</persName>, at the
	    <lb/>instance of <persName>Minoya</persName>, had permitted him to remain with­
	    <lb/>out fetters; but the moment he began to recover, the
	    <lb/>jealous <persName>Samokin</persName> insisted upon the danger of leaving him
	    <lb/>unbound, and persuaded the Chief to fasten him by the
	    <lb/>ancle to a strong stake, which was driven into the ground.
	    <pb n="249"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="21(5)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">249</mw>
	    <lb/><persName>Ohmeina</persName> was even more securely fettered; but, as he
	    <lb/>marked the direction of the Colonel's eye, he forgot the
	    <lb/>restraints which confined him, and made an effort to
	    <lb/>spring from the mat, and seize the weapon, which, had
	    <lb/>they been unfettered, would have procured them instant
	    <lb/>freedom.</p>
          <p><persName>Minoya</persName> only marked their impatient gestures, and,
	    <lb/>with warning looks and signs, she endeavoured to impress
	    <lb/>upon them both the importance of perfect quiet and
	    <lb/>submission. Minutes seemed like hours to <persName>Grahame</persName>,
	    <lb/>and the fear that the other <name>Indians</name> might return before
	    <lb/>they could effect their escape, tortured him with doubt
	    <lb/>and anxiety. At length, however, to his inexpressible
	    <lb/>delight, <persName>Kamaset</persName> finished his arrows; and, taking down
	    <lb/>his bow, told <persName>Minoya</persName> he would go hunt awhile in the
	    <lb/>forest. She followed him to the mouth of the cave,
	    <lb/>and looked after him to observe in what direction he
	    <lb/>went; then returning, she glanced significantly at <persName>Gra­
	    <lb/>hame</persName>, and pointed towards <persName>Samokin</persName>, who was still
	    <lb/>busied in repairing the breaches of his moccasins.</p>
          <p>The Colonel endeavoured to make her understand that
	    <lb/>he cared nothing for the presence of the savage, who
	    <lb/>would not dare to make any resistance, if they were
	    <lb/>armed; and signed to her, to reach him his sword.
	    <lb/><persName>Samokin</persName> sat with his back to them, and was so intently
	    <lb/>occupied, that he took no observance of what was pass­
	    <lb/>ing in the cave. <persName>Minoya</persName> hastily snatched the sword, and,
	    <lb/>after cutting <persName>Grahame's</persName> fetters, and those of <persName>Ohmeina</persName>,
	    <lb/>which were formed of the sinews of the deer, twisted
	    <lb/>firmly in the resemblance of rope, she placed the long
	    <lb/>absent weapon in the Colonel's hand, who grasped the
	    <lb/>trusty steel with as much delight as he would have done
	    <lb/>the hand of a dear and valued friend. She then armed
	    <lb/>herself with a tomahawk, and gave another to <persName>Ohmeina</persName>.
	    <lb/>All this was done so silently, and so speedily, that it was
	    <lb/>not till <persName>Ohmeina</persName> sprang, with a shout, upon his feet, that
	    <lb/>the startled savage was made aware of the liberation of
	    <lb/>his prisoners.</p>
          <p>It was too late to prevent their escape, and he saw it
	    <lb/>was so; but with all the fury of that deadly passion
	    <pb n="250"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="21(5)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">250</mw>
	    <lb/>which is ever most powerful in the breast of the savage,
	    <lb/>he rushed towards <persName>Minoya</persName>, and drawing a short knife
	    <lb/>from his girdle, would have plunged it into her heart, had
	    <lb/>not <persName>Grahame</persName> stepped hastily between them, and turned
	    <lb/>aside the point of his instrument. The wrath of the
	    <lb/><name>Indian</name> was then directed towards him; but the Colonel
	    <lb/>wrested the knife from his hand, and, with a degree of
	    <lb/>strength which he scarcely believed himself capable of
	    <lb/>exerting, threw him on the earth. <persName>Minoya</persName> hovered
	    <lb/>round with her uplifted tomahawk, ready to let it fall
	    <lb/>upon the head of a monster whom she abhorred. Her
	    <lb/>lips were compressed, and her eye flashed with un­
	    <lb/>governable passion. She seemed suddenly transformed
	    <lb/>from a soft and gentle woman, into a perfect fury; and
	    <lb/><persName>Grahame</persName>, as he looked at her, recoiled with a feeling of
	    <lb/>abhorrence from the features, upon which he had so
	    <lb/>often gazed in silent admiration. With a sternness, for
	    <lb/>which he reproached himself a moment after, he bade
	    <lb/>her retire; and, unwilling to shed the blood of any
	    <lb/>human being unless self-defence rendered it an absolute
	    <lb/>duty, he called <persName>Ohmeina</persName> to assist him in binding the
	    <lb/><name>Indian</name>. Finding resistance vain, he submitted in sullen
	    <lb/>silence; and, having securely bound him, they left him
	    <lb/>to be released by his companions, and hastily quitted
	    <lb/>the cave.</p>
          <p><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> wished to take the course which
	    <lb/>would lead them to <placeName>Saratoga</placeName>; but <persName>Minoya</persName> assured him
	    <lb/><persName>Kamaset</persName> had gone to hunt in that direction; and, though
	    <lb/>she would lead them to <placeName>Saratoga</placeName>, she must do it by a
	    <lb/>circuitous path, in order to avoid the danger of meeting
	    <lb/>the Chief. <persName>Grahame</persName> knew nothing of the forest, and
	    <lb/>he had been conveyed to the cave under such circum­
	    <lb/>stances, that he was unable to judge of its situation; he,
	    <lb/>therefore, consented to follow the steps of <persName>Minoya</persName>, and
	    <lb/>desired her to choose that course which would be safest,
	    <lb/>and conduct them soonest to the abodes of civilized men.</p>
          <p><persName>Minoya</persName> instantly set forward, guiding them with cau­
	    <lb/>tion through the intricacies of the forest, and observing
	    <lb/>a profound silence, which neither <persName>Grahame</persName> nor <persName>Ohmeina</persName>
	    <lb/>felt disposed to interrupt. For some time, they pro­
	    <pb n="251"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="21(6)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">251</mw>
	    <lb/>ceeded with extreme rapidity; but <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>,
	    <lb/>weakened by long confinement, and scarcely yet re­
	    <lb/>covered from severe illness, felt himself wholly unable
	    <lb/>to continue it; and the <name>Indians</name>, therefore, conformed to
	    <lb/>his more moderate pace. He looked around him, with
	    <lb/>the feelings of one who has long been immured from
	    <lb/>the light and brilliancy of nature, and drank in the air,
	    <lb/>which, though moist and loaded with vapor, seemed to
	    <lb/>inspire him with new life, and braced his languid frame
	    <lb/>with a vigor unfelt for weeks before.</p>
          <p>They had continued in this way for more than an
	    <lb/>hour, and made no inconsiderable progress, when sud­
	    <lb/>denly <persName>Minoya</persName> stopped, and placed her finger on her lip;
	    <lb/>at the same time making a signal that persons were near
	    <lb/>them, and they must remain still.</p>
          <p>They had scarcely time to withdraw a little from their
	    <lb/>path, when three <name>Indians</name> started directly in front of
	    <lb/>them, whom they immediately recognised as <persName>Kamaset</persName>,
	    <lb/>and the two, who, the preceding day, had left the cave,
	    <lb/>on a hunting expedition.</p>
          <p>With the most horrible yells, they rushed towards the
	    <lb/>party; <persName>Kamaset</persName>, with the aspect of a demon, aimed
	    <lb/>directly at <persName>Minoya</persName>, who, not in the least daunted, kept
	    <lb/>him at lay with the tomahawk which she had brought
	    <lb/>away with her, till <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> interfered, and
	    <lb/>laid him weltering in blood at her feet. One of the
	    <lb/>others in the mean time was approaching to strike the
	    <lb/>Colonel a deadly blow behind, when, <persName>Grahame</persName> turning
	    <lb/>suddenly round, he darted back, and took instantly to
	    <lb/>flight. The <name>Indian</name> who was struggling with <persName>Ohmeina</persName>,
	    <lb/>seeing his Chief fall, and his companion flee, quitted his
	    <lb/>adversary, and followed after him, no longer daring to
	    <lb/>sustain a conflict which had become so unequal.</p>
          <p>The moment they were left alone, <persName>Minoya</persName> bent over
	    <lb/>the body of <persName>Kamaset</persName>, and broke forth into a wild chant:</p>
          <p>
            <said>He has fallen! <persName>Kamaset</persName>, the mighty, has fallen! Who
	      <lb/>is there to weep for him? The hand red with the blood
	      <lb/>of our beloved ones, is left unburied! The wild beast
	      <lb/>shall devour it! No wife, no child, shall mourn for

          <p><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> was shocked by the cruel triumph
	    <lb/>which she expressed, indicative of a thirst for vengeance,
	    <lb/>so incompatible with the gentleness of a female charac­
	    <lb/>ter; with one, too, which had, in many points, been
	    <lb/>ameliorated by the mild precepts of <name>Christianity</name>. The
	    <lb/>reader is already aware that <persName>Minoya</persName> had been a member
	    <lb/>of <persName>Ohmeina's</persName> little community, and by the cruel outrage
	    <lb/>which destroyed the settlement, was deprived of the
	    <lb/>objects of her affection, and driven from a home, which
	    <lb/>a partial civilization had taught her to prize more highly
	    <lb/>than a perfect savage is wont. From that period she
	    <lb/>had cherished bitter thoughts of vengeance; and with a
	    <lb/>constancy which only a mind of uncommon power and
	    <lb/>strength could have possessed, she had sustained the
	    <lb/>artificial character which her situation induced her to
	    <lb/>adopt, till the moment, so ardently anticipated, arrived,
	    <lb/>for the destruction of her savage masters, and the release
	    <lb/>of their unhappy victims.</p>
          <p><persName>Grahame</persName> knew all these circumstances, yet he could
	    <lb/>not hear her song of exultation over the bleeding body of
	    <lb/>him, whom, cruel as he was, she had betrayed to death,
	    <lb/>without being greatly shocked. He gazed upon her, in
	    <lb/>stern silence; but, with native readiness, she interpreted
	    <lb/>the expression of his countenance, and said with tears,
	    <lb/>which cancelled her offence:</p>
          <p>
            <said>Brother! they were our husbands, and our chil­
	      <lb/>dren; and shall we not weep for them! But the blood
	      <lb/>which stained their graves is washed away, and flowers
	      <lb/>are springing on the yellow earth which covers them!</said>
          </p>
          <p>She wiped her eyes with her long black hair, and
	    <lb/>moved hastily away as she finished speaking; and <persName>Gra­
	      <lb/>hame</persName>, who understood by this figurative mode of ex­
	    <lb/>pression, so common among the <name>Indians</name>, that she had
	    <lb/>forgiven the crimes of <persName>Kamaset</persName>, now that his death had
	    <lb/>expiated them, followed her without reply.</p>
          <p>They continued their march till past the hour of
	    <lb/>noon, when <persName>Minoya</persName> produced some roasted ground­
	    <lb/>nuts and coarse Indian bread, which she had taken the
	  <pb n="253"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="22(1)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">253</mw>
	    <lb/>precaution to bring with her, and of which she and
	    <lb/><persName>Ohmeina</persName> made a savory repast; <persName>Grahame</persName>, excessively
	    <lb/>fatigued, declined sharing it with them; and, after
	    <lb/>quenching his thirst from a stream beside which they
	    <lb/>had stopped, he threw himself upon the ground, cold
	    <lb/>and damp as it was; and, notwithstanding the anxiety
	    <lb/>of his mind and the peril of their situation, he slept till
	    <lb/><persName>Ohmeina</persName> awakened him, and urged him to rise, that
	    <lb/>they might, if possible, clear the forest before nightfall.</p>
          <p><persName>Grahame</persName> sprang upon his feet, and, refreshed by the
	    <lb/>short slumber he had enjoyed, was able to resume his
	    <lb/>march with more rapidity than before. Without inter­
	    <lb/>ruption they continued it till the sun had set, and night
	    <lb/>was beginning to veil every object in obscurity, when,
	    <lb/>to their extreme pleasure, they reached the verge of the
	    <lb/>forest, and, directed by a bright ray of light, which
	    <lb/>streamed from the window of a log hut, they bent their
	    <lb/>course towards it, in the hope of obtaining a shelter for
	    <lb/>the night.</p>
          <p>The rain, which during the day had seemed ready to
	    <lb/>fall, was now fast descending, and the wet and wearied
	    <lb/>travellers longed to enjoy the comforts of the blazing
	    <lb/>fire which cheerfully illuminated the humble dwelling.
	    <lb/>Leaving his companions beneath a rude shed, where
	    <lb/>two cows and some sheep had already located them­
	    <lb/>selves for the night, <persName>Grahame</persName> walked forward, and
	    <lb/>knocked gently at the door. It was immediately opened
	    <lb/>by a sturdy, good-humored looking man, who, after
	    <lb/>glancing over the person of the stranger, and perceiving
	    <lb/>by his dress that he was an American officer, held forth
	    <lb/>his hand and bade him welcome, with an honest warmth
	    <lb/>which evinced his affection for the brave defenders of his
	    <lb/>country. His wife, a neat and buxom little woman, sat
	    <lb/>carding wool beside the fire, and at the same time gently
	    <lb/>rocking a cradle, in which a rosy cheeked infant was
	    <lb/>quietly sleeping. She rose as the Colonel entered, and
	    <lb/>offered a seat with smiling, though homely courtesy.
	    <lb/><persName>Grahame</persName> accepted it with the peculiar grace which
	    <lb/>accompanied all his actions; and, anxious to bring his
	    <lb/>companions into this comfortable shelter, he proceeded
	    <mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(+3)">22</mw>
	    <pb n="254"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="22(1)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">254</mw>
	    <lb/>to relate, as concisely as possible, the cause of his
	    <lb/>present singular situation, and the leading events which
	    <lb/>had preceded and followed his release.</p>
          <p>The kind farmer listened with interest to his narrative,
	    <lb/>and with that cordial hospitality and unaffected benevo­
	    <lb/>lence which distinguish the honest yeomanry of the
	    <lb/><name>United States</name>, hastened to offer the shelter of his hum­
	    <lb/>ble roof to the poor <name>Indians</name> who had so faithfully served
	    <lb/>the unfortunate officer. As he left the house <persName>Grahame</persName>
	    <lb/>observed that he used a crutch, and seemed to walk
	    <lb/>with difficulty; and, on inquiring the cause from his
	    <lb/>wife, he learned that her husband had been so grievously
	    <lb/>wounded in the battle of <placeName>Bennington</placeName>, that he had not
	    <lb/>been able to serve since, and was but just beginning to
	    <lb/>go out, after his long confinement. He soon returned,
	    <lb/>followed by the <name>Indians</name>, who, hardy and patient as they
	    <lb/>were, yet seemed to enjoy the comfort of the blazing
	    <lb/>fire and plentiful supper which the good dame prepared
	    <lb/>for them. <persName>Minoya</persName> was lodged in an out house, and
	    <lb/><persName>Ohmeina</persName> slept upon the kitchen floor; they wished
	    <lb/>for no better accommodations, since, unaccustomed to
	    <lb/>luxury, they could enjoy repose in any situation, when
	    <lb/>wearied nature required it.</p>
          <p>Not so <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>; his couch was as good as
	    <lb/>he desired, far better than that whereon he had slept for
	    <lb/><choice><sic>for </sic><corr/></choice>a fortnight past; but his long confinement and the
	    <lb/>harassed state of his spirits, together with the recent
	    <lb/>illness which had reduced his strength and depressed
	    <lb/>the vigor of his mind, forbade his enjoying repose in
	    <lb/>the first moment of recovered freedom. Exhausted as
	    <lb/> he was, by the fatigue and excitement of the day, he
	    <lb/>courted sleep in vain; it fled from his pillow; and,
	    <lb/>when the morning dawned, he felt himself too ill to rise.</p>
          <p>The farmer, with kind sympathy, expressed regret
	    <lb/>for the indisposition of his guest; and his wife, with
	    <lb/>the utmost solicitude administered every little specific
	    <lb/>which she had learned from the experienced dames of
	    <lb/>her acquaintance. There was no physician within many
	    <lb/>miles; and, as the Colonel's indisposition continued to
	    <lb/>increase, the skill of the <name>Indians</name> was put in requisition.
	    <pb n="255"/>

	    <lb/>Accustomed to heal themselves, they acquire a surpris­
	    <lb/>ing knowledge of diseases, and the manner of treating
	    <lb/>them; and their remedies, though extremely simple,
	    <lb/>are not unfrequently successful, even in the most severe
	    <lb/>cases.</p>
          <p>For a week <persName>Grahame</persName> remained very ill; but heaven
	    <lb/>blessed the means which the untutored <name>Indians</name> used for
	    <lb/>his recovery, and their unwearied attention, united to
	    <lb/>the kindness of his host and hostess, soon contributed
	    <lb/>to render his recovery complete.</p>
          <p>The moment he was able, he began to make arrange­
	    <lb/>ments for his departure, and to reflect how and in what
	    <lb/>manner he should dispose of <persName>Minoya</persName>. She was without
	    <lb/>home, friends, or tribe; she had risked her own life to
	    <lb/>preserve his, and with unsuspecting confidence thrown
	    <lb/>herself under his protection. <persName>Grahame</persName> was incapable
	    <lb/>of sacrificing her to any motive of personal convenience;
	    <lb/>and, after some deliberation, he resolved to send her
	    <lb/>to a friend in <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>, where her services might,
	    <lb/>perhaps, be useful, and whither <persName>Ohmeina</persName> was directly
	    <lb/>to proceed<choice><sic>,</sic><corr>.</corr></choice> Indeed, such was his destination when en­
	    <lb/>trapped by the <name>Indians</name>; and it was determined that he
	    <lb/>and <persName>Minoya</persName> should join a party of friendly <name>Oneida In­
	    <lb/>dians</name>, who, as the farmer informed them, were going to
	    <lb/>the American camp, to hold a <mcr>talk</mcr> with the commander
	    <lb/>in chief.</p>
          <p>Having seen his humble friends with six Oneida
	    <lb/>Chiefs depart on their journey, which, notwithstanding
	    <lb/>the coldness of the season, and the distance which they
	    <lb/>had to travel, they seemed to view as a slight under­
	    <lb/>taking, he began to think of his own departure.</p>
          <p>Neither the farmer nor his wife would listen to any
	    <lb/>mention of reward. But the Colonel, though he had it
	    <lb/>not in his power when he left them, for he had been
	    <lb/>robbed of his purse and every thing else that was valua­
	    <lb/>ble about his person, sent them, on his arrival at <placeName>Albany</placeName>,
	    <lb/>a valuable token of his gratitude for their benevolent
	    <lb/>hospitality to an unfortunate stranger.</p>
          <p>The farmer had procured for him a horse, on which
	    <lb/>he rode to <placeName>Albany</placeName>, where he found his faithful servant,
	  <pb n="256"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="22(2)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">256</mw>
	    <lb/>who, when he left <placeName>Saratoga</placeName>, had repaired to that city,
	    <lb/>where he still continued, in the hope of gaining some
	    <lb/>intelligence of a master for whom he had never ceased to
	    <lb/>mourn. After passing one day with a friend in <placeName>Albany</placeName>,
	    <lb/><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> pushed forward with all possible ex­
	    <lb/>pedition to join his regiment, then quartered with the
	    <lb/>main army at <placeName>Valley Forge</placeName>.</p>
          <p>The arrival of <persName>Ohmeina</persName> at the camp was quickly
	    <lb/>followed by his own, and the tidings of his welfare had
	    <lb/>scarcely reached his friends before he presented himself
	    <lb/>to receive the joyful congratulations of all who knew his
	    <lb/>worth, and had mourned his loss. And these were not
	    <lb/>a few; for the manly virtues of <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> en­
	    <lb/>deared him to all who were honored by his acquaint­
	    <lb/>ance, and procured him the respect and enthusiastic
	    <lb/>attachment of the soldiery.</p>
          <p>The day of his return was fully occupied; but, on
	    <lb/>the succeeding morning, having obstained a direction to
	    <lb/>the residence of <persName>Major Courtland</persName>, he rode thither to
	    <lb/>renew the intercourse which had been so unpropitiously
	    <lb/>interrupted at <placeName>Saratoga</placeName>. On his way, however, he
	    <lb/>called upon <persName>Minoya</persName>, and was pleased to find her quite
	    <lb/>happy, and zealously endeavouring to conform to the
	    <lb/>habits of civilized life.</p>
          <p>She told him that, on the preceding day, she saw
	    <lb/>his friend, who had come to the ravine at <placeName>Saratoga</placeName>, in
	    <lb/>search of him, and whom she had warned away with
	    <lb/>her song; and that she had followed him and informed
	    <lb/>him by another song, that <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> was in
	    <lb/>safety.</p>
          <p>She had, indeed, seen <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, walking with the
	    <lb/>ladies, and instantly recognised him. Her love of
	    <lb/>mystery and adventure prevailed, and instead of accost­
	    <lb/>ing him with tidings of the Colonel's return, she watch­
	    <lb/>ed him, at a distance, till she saw him enter the house.
	    <lb/>She then stole after him, and assuring herself by a
	    <lb/>glance through the window, that the object of her inter­
	    <lb/>est was within, concealed herself in the shrubbery, till
	    <lb/>the darkness became so intense, as to prevent all fear
	    <lb/>of discovery. She then raised her song, and while she
	  <pb n="257"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="22(3)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">257</mw>
	    <lb/>gratified her own spirit of own intrigue, so framed her
	    <lb/>words, as to give the information she wished to con­
	    <lb/>vey. When assured that she had attracted observation
	    <lb/>and excited surprise, she glided rapidly from her place
	    <lb/>of concealment, and under cover of the night, escaped
	    <lb/>without detection.</p>
          <p><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> could not forbear laughing at this
	    <lb/>characteristic incident, and at the perplexity, into which
	    <lb/>he imagined it must have thrown <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; but at the
	    <lb/>same time, he gently reproved the <name>Indian</name> for having
	    <lb/>done so, and warned her not to indulge a propensity,
	    <lb/>which might be the occasion of much mischief. He
	    <lb/>then remounted his horse, and was proceeding to pay
	    <lb/>his respects to his English friends, when the affair of
	    <lb/>the skirmish interrupted his progress, and introduced
	    <lb/>him to their notice, in a manner more abrupt than he
	    <lb/>had intended.</p>

          <p>The narrative of <persName>Colonel Grahame's</persName> adventures ex­
	    <lb/>cited the deepest interest, in his attentive auditors, and
	    <lb/>drew forth many congratulations, for his fortunate es­
	    <lb/>cape from the power of the savages, as fervent as they
	    <lb/>were sincere. <persName>Catherine</persName> alone remained silent, but it
	    <lb/>was a silence more flattering to the feelings of <persName>Gra­
	      <lb/>hame</persName>, than would have been the utmost eloquence of
	    <lb/>words.</p>
          <p>He had not failed to observe how entirely she had
	    <lb/>been absorbed during his recital; he had remarked,
	    <lb/>with emotion, the rapid mutations of her countenance,
	    <lb/>and read in them a sanction to the fondest wishes of

	    <lb/>his heart. <persName>O'Carroll</persName> also had bestowed on her a part
	    <lb/>of his attention; he saw her cheek alternately glowing
	    <lb/>and pale, and her eye brighten with hope or sadden with
	    <lb/>anxiety, as <persName>Grahame</persName> recounted his adventures, and he
	    <lb/>felt persuaded that he had read aright the secret of her
	    <lb/>heart.</p>
          <p>But when the Colonel began to explain the manner,
	    <lb/>in which <persName>Minoya</persName> had practised on them, the night pre­
	    <lb/>ceeding his appearance, <persName>O'Carroll's</persName> exclusive attention
	    <lb/>was devoted to the subject, and he had no sooner heard
	    <lb/>the mystery unravelled than he started from his seat
	    <lb/>and half laughing, half vexed, exclaimed,</p>
          <p>
            <said>And so this dusky heroine of your's Colonel, has
	      <lb/>been all this time leading our wits a wild goose chase
	      <lb/>for her own amusement, forsooth!</said>
          </p>
          <p><said><emph>Your</emph> wits Captain, if you please,</said> said <persName>Major
	    <lb/>Courtland</persName>, highly enjoying this denouement of the mys­
	    <lb/>tery. <said><emph>Ours</emph> were not in the least disturbed by the
	      <lb/>song of the syren, for, you may recollect, I told you
	      <lb/>at the time, it was only some gentle squaw, as suscep­
	      <lb/>tible, as fairer ladies, of whom doubtles you can reckon
	      <lb/>a score, that has followed you from <placeName>Saratoga</placeName>, to seduce
	      <lb/>you with her bewitching melodies.</said></p>
          <p><persName>O'Carroll</persName>, mortified that he had made so serious an
	    <lb/>affair of an occurrence, which in the end had proved
	    <lb/>so trifling, felt chagrined by the Major's ridicule, and
	    <lb/>desirous to elude it, pretended to be so much engaged
	    <lb/>in rescuing a ball of silk from a small terrier dog, that
	    <lb/>was lying at <persName>Catherine's</persName> feet, as not to notice his words.</p>

          <p><said>She is not vindictive,</said> said <persName>Grahame</persName>; <said>at least, I
	      <lb/>have not found her so, among friends; so you need not
	      <lb/>fear to accept <persName>Miss Courtland's</persName> purse, Captain.</said></p>
          <p><persName>O'Carroll</persName> fancied he could detect a lurking jealousy
	    <lb/>in the Colonel's words, and instantly forgetting his cha­
	    <lb/>grin, he said with a view to develope his secret senti­
	    <lb/>ments,</p>
          <p>
            <said>It will not be safe for me, whom as the Major as­
	      <lb/>serts she regards with feelings of such a peculiar nature,
	      <lb/>to tempt her wrath; but you, Colonel, may without ap­
	      <lb/>prehension wear the gift, which <persName>Miss Courtland</persName> de­
	      <lb/>signed for me; and I am convinced that you will value
	      <lb/>it above all it ever will contain.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>Far, far above all it ever <emph>can</emph> contain,</said> said <persName>Gra­
	      <lb/>hame</persName>, with an animation which covered <persName>Catherine's</persName>
	    <lb/>cheek with blushes; but she said, with an air of gaiety,
	    <lb/>as unconcerned as she could assume,</p>
          <p><said>I might have spared the reproof I bestowed on
	      <lb/><name>Juba</name>, for spoiling the silk, Captain, since you set so
	      <lb/>slight a value on the work for which it was designed,
	      <lb/>as voluntarily to transfer it to another.</said> She then
	    <lb/>added, with a quickness which evinced her anxiety to
	    <lb/>change the subject. <said>But when are we to see this

	      <lb/>in consideration of the good service she has done in

          <p><said>Forgive!</said> repeated <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, <said>I admire her the
	      <lb/>more for it, and owe her many thanks for supplying
	      <lb/>me with such abundance of food for conjeccture. Be­
	      <lb/>sides, it furnished me with a theme for some dozens of

          <p><said>And <persName>Ohmeina</persName> too,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>; <said>of whom I

          <p><said><persName>Ohmeina</persName>! and in the forest!</said> said <persName>Grahame</persName>, with
	    <lb/>a startled look; <said>and pray may I inquire, <persName>Miss Court­
		<lb/>land</persName>, in what part of the forest you saw the <name>Indian</name>?</said></p>
          <p><said>At no great distance from the path which borders
	    <lb/>it,</said> she replied, rather surprised by the earnestness,
	    <lb/>with which he asked so apparently trifling a question.
	    <lb/><said>I have not ventured far within its limits,</said> she con­
	    <lb/>tinued, <said>since our immediate neighbourhood has be­
	      <lb/>come the scene of contest; and the <name>Indian</name> would have
	      <lb/>passed me unobserved, had not a large dog, which
	      <lb/>followed him, sprung fiercely towards <persName>Amelia</persName>, and
	      <lb/>obliged me to descend from a rock, where I was
	      <lb/>gathering moss, to her rescue.</said></p>
          <p><said rend="pre()">But I was less alarmed by the assault of the dog,</said><lb/>said <persName>Amelia</persName>, <said>than at the eagerness, with which <persName>Cathe­
		<lb/>rine</persName> pursued this fierce looking <name>Indian</name>, whose person
	      <lb/>was unknown to me. I forcibly detained her till she
	      <lb/>explained to me her knowledge of him, and her desire
	      <lb/>to learn of him some tidings of your fate.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> blushed deeply, as her cousin innocently
	    <lb/>related a circumstance which, from a feeling of intui­
	    <lb/>tive delicacy she had omitted to mention. She dared
	    <lb/>not raise her eyes from her work, or she would have
	    <lb/>seen the look of doubt and perplexity, which had a
	    <lb/>moment before, embarrassed the fine features of <persName>Gra­
	      <lb/>hame</persName>, exchanged for one of unclouded delight; while
	    <lb/>with eyes beaming gratitude and pleasure, he gazed
	    <lb/>upon her glowing countenance.</p>
          <p><persName>Major Courtland</persName>, who had been for some minutes
	    <lb/>ruminating on the singular incidents which <persName>Grahame</persName><lb/>had related, observing a pause in the conversation, rose
	    <lb/>and approached the little group, who were gathered
	    <lb/>around his daughters work table. <persName>Catherine</persName>, glad of
	    <lb/>an opportunity to dispel the embarrassment which pre­
	    <lb/>vailed, looked up as he approached, and said,</p>
          <p>
            <said>We are requesting of <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, an intro­
	      <lb/>duction to the heroine of his tale, sir; but as yet he has
	      <lb/>not promised to grant our petition.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>He will not be so selfish, as to monopolize her,</said><lb/>said the Major; <said><persName>O'Carroll</persName>, at least may be permitted
	    <pb n="261"/><milestone unit="sig" n="22(5)r"/><mw type="pageNum">261</mw><lb/>to enjoy an interview with this tutelar divinity of his,
	      <lb/>whom I dare say, he invokes with as much solemnity,
	      <lb/>as he would any Saint in the calendar.</said></p>
          <p><said>Now since she has proved a mere mortal, Major,
	      <lb/>and a swarthy one besides,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>. <said>My
	      <lb/>interest, of course, is not so great, as when I fancied
	      <lb/>her, <quote>some gay creature of the element;</quote> a being,
	      <lb/>who might float upon a moon-beam, or a cloud; fathom
	      <lb/>the depths of the ocean, and penetrate to the hidden
	      <lb/>centre of the earth. But as she has saved a life valued
	      <lb/>by us all, and as the Colonel asserts her to be hand­
	      <lb/>some, I should like to see her; though I confess, I can­
	      <lb/>not imagine any beauty in a face where the splendor
	      <lb/>of the rose and lilly are usurped by the dusky and life­
	      <lb/>less hue of the olive.</said></p>
          <p><said>But it is the softest olive in the world, Captain,</said><lb/>said <persName>Grahame</persName>; <said>enlivened by teeth of the finest ivory,
	      <lb/>and a pair of jet black eyes, whose brilliancy makes
	      <lb/>ample compensation for the darkness of the counte­
	      <lb/>nance which they illumine. And then, her figure is
	      <lb/>perfect. It has all the native grace and symmetry,
	      <lb/>which distinguish these denizens of the forest, who
	      <lb/>from infancy are accustomed to athletic exercises,
	      <lb/>which require the play of every limb, and unused to
	      <lb/>any of those restraints, which fetter the motions of civi­
	      <lb/>lized children. Thus left free to the forming hand of
	      <lb/>nature, they expand into a perfection of beauty, which
	      <lb/>artificial efforts may in vain attempt to equal.</said></p>
          <p><said>And were you bred among these people, who are
	    <lb/>such lovers and promoters of grace?</said> asked <persName>O'Carroll</persName>
	    <lb/>archly glancing his eye over the symmetrical propor­
	    <lb/>tions of <persName>Grahame's</persName> fine figure.</p>
          <p><said>Do you inquire, because you find me so familiar
	    <lb/>with their customs,</said> said <persName>Grahame</persName>, quite unsuspicious
	    <lb/>of <persName>O'Carroll's</persName> meaning; <said>or because I am inclined
	      <lb/>to judge them more favourably then many, who with­
	      <lb/>out knowing a single individual, stigmatize the whole
	      <lb/>race as bloodthirsty and barbarous wretches, who
	      <lb/>should be exterminated without mercy from the earth?</said></p>

          <mw type="pageNum">262</mw>
          <p><said>And are they not bloodthirsty and barbarous?</said><lb/>inquired <persName>Amelia</persName>, with surprise.</p>
          <p><said>I cannot deny that they are, <persName>Miss Dunbar</persName>,</said> re­
	    <lb/>plied the Colonel. <said>But how can it be otherwise,
	      <lb/>when they are early taught to glory in revenge, and to
	      <lb/>delight in the fierce and hardy exploits, which charac­
	      <lb/>terize uncivilized nations? The sweet sympathies of
	      <lb/>social life are unknown to them; the mild light of
	      <lb/>christianity has not shed on them its softening influ­
	      <lb/>ence, nor exalted their females to that station, where
	      <lb/>they may be permitted to soften with their gentleness,
	      <lb/>the sterner virtues of their savage lords. But they
	      <lb/>have redeeming qualities, which inform us what they
	      <lb/>might become, if brought within the pale of civilized
	      <lb/>life, and which ought to fill us with the deepest regret,
	      <lb/>that the remnant of a people, whom we have hunted
	      <lb/>from their forests, and well nigh exterminated from the
	      <lb/>soil, should at last perish in the dark ignorance of un­
	      <lb/>enlightened nature.</said></p>
          <p><said>Those few who have been civilized, may have
	      <lb/>imbibed virtues, perhaps,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>but I much
	      <lb/>doubt if they have any inherent in their barbarous
	      <lb/>state.</said></p>
          <p><said>You misjudge them, <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>,</said> returned
	    <lb/><persName>Grahame</persName>. <said>Even in their savage state, they possess
	      <lb/>many virtues, and those the noblest that can dignify
	      <lb/>humanity.</said></p>
          <p><said>Did you discover them, Colonel, during the agreea­
	      <lb/>ble days you passed with them in the cavern,</said> asked
	    <lb/><persName>O'Carroll</persName>. <said>At least you do not reckon their tying
	      <lb/>you by the leg with those twisted sinews, among their
	      <lb/>good deeds.</said></p>
          <p><said>It was certainly a proof of their ingenuity,</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>Grahame</persName>. <said>But I am sure you will no longer dispute
	      <lb/>the justice of the praise, which I have bestowed on
	      <lb/>them, when I name a few of the virtues which, like
	      <lb/>spots of verdure that occasionally refresh the eye in a
	      <lb/>land of sterility, appear amidst the harsh and stern fea­
	      <lb/>tures of their character, with a brightness that more
	      <lb/>than half redeems their failings. A firm reliance on the
	      <pb n="263"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="22(6)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">263</mw>
	      <lb/>care and protection of a superior being, never in any
	      <lb/>emergency forsakes them. Reverence and respect for
	      <lb/>age, fidelity in friendship, and fortitude in suffering,
	      <lb/>besides many minor virtues, are peculiarly their own.
	      <lb/>And now will you not confess <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, that
	      <lb/>there are few comparatively speaking, even among
	      <lb/>those who boast of the highest refinement, that can
	      <lb/>with justice lay claim to all the rare and noble qualities,
	      <lb/>which I have named, and which, almost without ex­
	      <lb/>ception, distinguish the tawny savages of our forests?</said></p>
          <p><said>You have forgotten to mention humanity to cap­
	      <lb/>tives,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, gravely, <said>of which you can
	      <lb/>doubtless speak from experience.</said></p>
          <p><said>I might have said,</said> returned <persName>Grahame</persName>, <said>that to­
	      <lb/>wards captives who are not personally obnoxious to
	      <lb/>them, they usually exercise much kindness and hu­
	      <lb/>manity, either adopting them as their own children, or
	      <lb/>presenting them to their friends. But if they are re­
	      <lb/>jected by those to whom they are offered, death is not
	      <lb/>unfrequently their fate.</said></p>
          <p><said>I have heard,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, <said>that the brave
	      <lb/><persName>General Stark</persName>, who, like <persName>Cincinnatus</persName>, quitted his
	      <lb/>plough, at the call of his country, was once a captive,
	      <lb/>among some of the Indian tribes.</said></p>
          <p><said>You are correct, <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>,</said> said the Colo­
	    <lb/>nel. <said>He was taken when a young man, and passed
	      <lb/>a number of months with them; and the discipline
	      <lb/>which he there endured, doubtless contributed to form
	      <lb/>that character of intrepidity, decision, and indepen­
	      <lb/>dence, which renders him one of our bravest as well as
	      <lb/>ablest Generals.</said></p>
          <p><said>Yes, he peppered <persName>Baum's</persName> fellows unmercifully at
	      <lb/><name>Bennington</name>,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>.<choice><sic>”</sic><corr/></choice> 
	    <said>It was the precursor
	      <lb/>of that fatal convention which dished up our valor so
	      <lb/>finely; for, by <persName>St. George</persName>, I believe he roused up the
	      <lb/>whole country to fight us at <name>Saratoga</name>.</said></p>
          <p><said>I thought you would not finish the day, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,
	      <lb/>without ringing a chime upon the worn out subject of
	      <lb/>the convention,</said> said the Major, petulantly. <said>Indeed,

	      <lb/>reaching this grand climax of all your eloquence. But,
	      <lb/>Colonel, in this discussion upon the merits of the savage
	      <lb/>tribes, we have strayed far from the original topic, and
	      <lb/>quite forgotten the wished for interview with your friend
	      <lb/><persName>Minoya</persName>. When shall we see her, and where is she?
	      <lb/>Most of the families in this vicinity are known to me,
	      <lb/>and I may not be ignorant of that in which she resides.</said></p>
          <p><said>They are known to very few, sir,</said> returned <persName>Gra­
	      <lb/>hame</persName>, after a brief pause, and with an air of embarrass­
	    <lb/>ment; <said>but if you are really desirous to see this squaw,
	      <lb/>I will send her here with <persName>Ohmeina</persName>.</said></p>
          <p><said>By all means, we wish exceedingly to see her,</said><lb/>said the Major, earnestly regarding <persName>Grahame</persName>, whose
	    <lb/>confusion greatly surprised him, as well as his declining
	    <lb/>to mention the name of the family with whom <persName>Minoya</persName><lb/>resided. <said>But there is no haste,</said> he added; <said>consult
	      <lb/>your own convenience, Colonel; we are ready at all
	      <lb/>times to receive her.</said></p>
          <p><said>There is no occasion for delay,</said> said <persName>Grahame</persName>,
	    <lb/><said>I will instruct <persName>Ohmeina</persName> to conduct her highter tomor­
	      <lb/>row or the day following.</said></p>
          <p>
            <said>When you please, Colonel; we all feel interested
	      <lb/>in one who has so much agency in preserving your
	      <lb/>life; and, should the fate of war call you from us, I
	      <lb/>make it my request, that you will resign this amiable
	      <lb/>savage to our protection.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>I sincerely thank you, sir;</said> returned the Colonel;
	    <lb/><said>and, should circumstances compel me to remove her
	      <lb/>from her present situation, I shall accept with gratitude
	      <lb/>your kind proposal.</said></p>
          <p><said>Do so, Colonel,</said> said the Major; <said>and now, with
	      <lb/>your leave, I will just step and see how <persName>Talbot</persName> is. I
	      <lb/>fear the poor fellow has passed a tedious morning
	      <lb/>alone.</said></p>
          <p><said>I hope, sir, I have not been the means of detaining
	      <lb/>you from him,</said> said the Colonel. <said>I beg my presence
	      <lb/>may be no restraint upon you; if you consider it so, I
	      <lb/>shall be compelled to make my visits less frequent than
	      <lb/>I am inclined.</said></p>

          <p><said>That shall not be,</said> said the Major; <said>and, to prove
	      <lb/>that I mind you no more than I should <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, I will
	      <lb/>not even ask you to excuse me, and perhaps may not
	      <lb/>again make my appearance till dinner time.</said></p>
          <p>He quitted the room as he finished speaking; and
	    <lb/>the Captain laughing, said,</p>
          <p>
            <said>You have, indeed, caused us to forget our wounded
	      <lb/>hero, <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>; I doubt if even <persName>Miss Court­
		<lb/>land</persName> has once thought of him since the surgeon left us.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>Yes, I have, several times,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>; <said>and
	      <lb/>was on the point of rising to visit him, when my father
	      <lb/>anticipated me. But I believe <persName>Captain Talbot</persName> has not
	      <lb/>been entirely neglected; for I observed <persName>Amelia</persName> steal
	      <lb/>away once since <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> finished his recital;
	      <lb/>and, from her long absence, I fancy she had been on an
	      <lb/>errand of consolation to our disabled knight.</said></p>
          <p><said>I wished to speak with <persName>Martha</persName>,</said> said <persName>Amelia</persName>,
	    <lb/>blushing. <said>But <persName>Captain Talbot</persName> had so many ques­
	      <lb/>tions to ask concerning your visit to <placeName>Saratoga</placeName>, <persName>Catherine</persName>,
	      <lb/>that I was detained much longer than I wished.</said></p>
          <p><said>Than you <emph>wished</emph>, cousin!</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, in a
	    <lb/>low tone.</p>
          <p><persName>Amelia's</persName> blushes deepened, but she made no reply,
	    <lb/>and kept her eyes fixed steadfastly upon her work.
	    <lb/><persName>Grahame</persName> was earnestly regarding them; and the nature
	    <lb/>of his meditations was not rendered more pleasant by
	    <lb/><persName>O'Carroll's</persName> observing:</p>
          <p>
            <said><persName>Talbot</persName> is a noble fellow, and a brave one too; we
	      <lb/>served together in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, and there was not an officer
	      <lb/>in the regiment more generally beloved.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>And he is highly connected, I believe,</said> said <persName>Cathe­
	      <lb/>rine</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>Yes,</said> returned <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>he is the son of an
	      <lb/>English baronet, and the nephew of an Irish peer,
	      <lb/>whose title he will probably inherit; for the present
	      <lb/>heir is as sickly a scion as ever sprouted from a noble
	      <lb/>tree.</said></p>
          <p><said>He will probably rise fast in his profession,</said> ob­
	    <lb/>served <persName>Catherine</persName>, <said>since he has powerful friends to
	      <lb/>interest themselves in his promotion</said></p>

          <p><said>That he has done already,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>; <said>but
	      <lb/>it has been by merit only. He disdains to rise by any
	      <lb/>other means, and refuses all the offers of his friends to
	      <lb/>assist his promotion.</said></p>
          <p><said>It is such conduct as I should have expected from
	      <lb/>him,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>. <said>Before we went to <placeName>Albany</placeName> he
	      <lb/>was often here, and he became a great favorite with us.
	      <lb/>He was so candid, so free from the spirit of party; and,
	      <lb/>though zealous in the cause of his country, he expressed
	      <lb/>his opinions with perfect modesty, and spoke of his
	      <lb/>opponents with a manly generosity that won our esteem.
	      <lb/><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, I think you will find much to admire
	      <lb/>in this gallant adversary.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Grahame</persName> started when <persName>Catherine</persName> addressed him; for
	    <lb/>both he and <persName>Amelia</persName> had remained silent during this
	    <lb/>short conversation, alike attentive to all that was said,
	    <lb/>but agitated by far different feelings. Putting down the
	    <lb/>dog, that uninvited, and almost unnoticed, was fawning
	    <lb/>upon him, he replied.</p>
          <p>
            <said>It can be no subject of surprise to me, <persName>Miss Court­
	      <lb/>land</persName>, to find talents and virtue united to gallantry and
	      <lb/>courage. I only regret for him and those friends to
	      <lb/>whom he is deservedly dear, the consequences of that
	      <lb/>fearless intrepidity which has caused his present suf­
	      <lb/>ferings.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>And you really regret,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, <said>that you
	      <lb/>have captured <persName>Talbot</persName>, since you find him a brave fel­
	      <lb/>low, and a huge favorite here.</said></p>
          <p><said>You misunderstand me, Captain,</said> returned the
	    <lb/>Colonel. <said>I pride myself still more upon my conquest,
	      <lb/>since I find it one so highly worth the making. I only
	      <lb/>regret the effusion of so much blood, and the personal
	      <lb/>injury which <persName>Captain Talbot</persName> has received.</said></p>
          <p><said>We all regret that,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>; <said>but hope
	      <lb/>our united skill will soon effect a complete cure. In
	      <lb/>the mean time, national feelings out of the question, we
	      <lb/>can none of us, in sincerity say, we are sorry for this
	      <lb/>pleasant addition to our family circle, though we will
	      <lb/>not be so disloyal as to thank you for it, Colonel. I
	      <lb/>fear, however, the Captain himself will not rejoice at it.

	      <lb/>tween my father and <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName>, which pleasant­
	      <lb/>ly disturbs the waveless calm of our retirement.</said></p>
          <p><said>Or an occasional argument,</said> said the Captain,
	    <lb/><said>between the Major and yourself, <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>, on
	      <lb/>the merits of the republican cause, which you display
	      <lb/>so much ingenuity and address in defending.</said></p>
          <p><said>It requires no great effort of ingenuity to defend
	      <lb/>the right,</said> replied <persName>Catherine</persName>, smiling, and slightly blush­
	    <lb/>ing. <said>And you know I have induced you both to
	      <lb/>concede many points which formerly it was treason to
	      <lb/>mention in your presence.</said></p>
          <p><said>You need not look so delighted, Colonel,</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>O'Carroll</persName>, as <persName>Grahame</persName> raised his fine eyes, full of
	    <lb/>pleasure, to the face of <persName>Catherine</persName>. <said>She will not
	      <lb/>make traitors of us,</said> he continued; <said>though these
	      <lb/><persName>Circes</persName> of womankind can effect almost any meta­
	      <lb/>morphosis, yet I believe our loyalty will resist all the
	      <lb/>magic of the sex.</said></p>
          <p><said>It is not your loyalty, Captain, that I seek to
	      <lb/>weaken,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>; <said>but some few prejudices
	      <lb/>only, which, I am happy to say, have almost disappeared
	      <lb/>since the convention of <placeName>Saratoga</placeName>.</said></p>
          <p><said>How now, <persName>Kate</persName>,</said> exclaimed the Major, suddenly
	    <lb/>entering the apartment; <said>you have not taken up the
	      <lb/>burden of <persName>O'Carroll's</persName> song, I hope.</said>
	    <said>I did not know you were within hearing, father, or
	      <lb/>I should not have ventured to speak of the convention,</said>
	    <lb/>said <persName>Catherine</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>Tush, girl; why name it again?</said> exclaimed the
	    <lb/>Major. <said>Excuse me, <persName>Colonel Grahame</persName>, but I cannot
	      <lb/>for my life hear this shameful surrender mentioned
	      <lb/>without chagrin and mortification. It is my humor, and
	      <lb/>you must pardon it.</said></p>
          <p><said>Willingly, sir,</said> replied <persName>Grahame</persName>; <said>but you must
	      <lb/>allow me to repeat what the American officers are
	    <pb n="268"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="23(2)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">268</mw>
	      <lb/>unanimous in declaring, that no self accusation ought
	      <lb/>to imbitter the reflections of the men, who fought with
	      <lb/>such intrepid gallantry.</said></p>
          <p><said>Thank you, Colonel</said> replied the Major; <said>humili­
	      <lb/>ated as we are, we are still compelled to feel, and to
	      <lb/>acknowledge the generosity which has sought to alle­
	      <lb/>viate the misfortunes of a vanquished foe, and soften the
	      <lb/>regrets and mortifications of his forlorn situation.</said></p>
          <p><said>If such has been the conduct of the <name>Americans</name>, sir,</said><lb/>returned the Colonel, <said>it will perhaps convince you,
	      <lb/>that there is less of party feeling than of the pure <foreign xml:lang="la">amor
		<lb/>patriæ</foreign> in the motives which have driven them to arms;
	      <lb/>that they cannot forget the ties which once united them
	      <lb/>to the land of their fathers, nor cease to regard as
	      <lb/>brothers, those with whom they would gladly be recon­
	      <lb/>ciled, whenever circumstances shall render it practicable
	      <lb/>and expedient<choice><sic/><corr>.</corr></choice></said></p>
          <p><said>I know, Colonel, you believe your cause righteous,
	      <lb/>and so do we ours,</said> said the Major. <said>I doubt not
	      <lb/>there is party spirit on both sides; and on both sides, I
	      <lb/>am sure, there are men of pure, upright, and candid
	      <lb/>minds. But, at all hazards, it is an unhappy contest;
	      <lb/>and since I am no longer permitted either to aid my own
	      <lb/>party or to injure yours, I am sometimes half resolved
	      <lb/>to quit this scene of strife, and return with my daughter
	      <lb/>to the peaceful shores of my own long forsaken, but still
	      <lb/>fondly remembered country.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Grahame</persName> looked disturbed, while <persName>Catherine</persName>, suddenly
	    <lb/>changing color, said quickly:</p>
          <p>
            <said>To <placeName>England</placeName>, father! Who will welcome us there?
	      <lb/>You are forgotten, and I was never known. It will, in­
	      <lb/>deed, be like seeking a strange land, where there is no
	      <lb/>friend to embrace us, and no eye to beam with pleasure
	      <lb/>at our approach.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>And what, child, have we to bind us to this soil?</said><lb/>asked her father. <said>It is drenched with the blood of
	      <lb/>our countrymen, and trodden by a people who view us
	      <lb/>with hatred and suspicion.</said></p>
          <p><said>You wrong them, father,</said> replied <persName>Catherine</persName>; <said>we
	      <lb/>have received only kindness at their hands; kindness
	    <pb n="269"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="23(3)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">269</mw>
	      <lb/>which has bound me to them by a thousand tender ties.
	      <lb/>And there are some sweet and sacred links, dear father,
	      <lb/>which unite you to this lovely land.</said></p>
          <p><said>Yes, there is one, there is your mother's grave,</said><lb/>returned the Major. <said>But there are dearer memorials
	      <lb/>of her in the green vallies of <placeName>Devonshire</placeName>, where I first
	      <lb/>called her my own, and where you, my love, were born.</said></p>
          <p>He walked towards a window as he spoke, subdued
	    <lb/>by the recollection of earlier days, and of the wife who
	    <lb/>had rendered them so happy. <persName>Catherine</persName>, hurt that she
	    <lb/>had awakened painful emotions in her father's breast,
	    <lb/>remained silent and downcast; but he quickly recovered
	    <lb/>himself and returned to the circle with his usual air of
	    <lb/>cheerfulness.</p>
          <p><said>You have not informed us how you found <persName>Captain
	      <lb/>Talbot</persName>, Major,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, anxious to change the
	    <lb/>subject of discussion, and dispel the slight shade which
	    <lb/>still hovered upon <persName>Cath<choice><sic>a</sic><corr>e</corr></choice>rine's</persName> open brow.</p>
          <p><said>Looking as wo-begone as the knight of the rueful
	      <lb/>countenance,</said> returned the Major. <said>I stopped with
	      <lb/>him sometime, but found him so incorrigibly stupid,
	      <lb/>that I was glad to return to more agreeable company.
	      <lb/>I left him, however, with a promise, which I had well
	      <lb/>nigh forgotten, of sending you, <persName>Kate</persName>, to chase away the
	      <lb/>blue vapors which seemed to be settling around him.</said></p>
          <p><said>It is no enviable task, sir, I acknowledge,</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName>; <said>though as hostess and superintendant of
	      <lb/>the hospital, I feel it my duty to attempt it. But really
	      <lb/>I think <persName>Captain O'Carroll</persName> would have been a fitter am­
	      <lb/>bassador to send on this mission; for you know from
	      <lb/>experience, father, that neither gloom nor sadness can
	      <lb/>long resist the glance of his mirthful eye.</said></p>
          <p><said>You are wrong, <persName>Kate</persName>,</said> said the Major; <said>he would
	      <lb/>have regaled the poor fellow with a dissertation on the
	      <lb/>treaty of <placeName>Saratoga</placeName>; and he feels his own surrender
	      <lb/>heavily enough, without being obliged to hear of other
	      <lb/>people's mishaps.</said></p>
          <p><said>You have become quite fond of the treaty, Major,</said><lb/>said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, <said>and garnish your speech with it almost
	      <lb/>as often as I am wont to do.</said></p>

          <p><said>I will begin and end every sentence with it for a
	      <lb/>month to come,</said> said the Major, <said>if that will cause
	      <lb/>you to be weary of it, <persName>O'Carroll</persName>. But away, <persName>Kate</persName>; if
	      <lb/>you linger here any longer, the Captain will think I
	      <lb/>deceived him just to get off myself.</said></p>
          <p><said>I am gone, sir,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, <said>though without
	      <lb/>a hope of success. Come, <name>Juba</name>, and help me to enter­
	      <lb/>tain your master.</said></p>
          <p><said>Poor fellow, he is a dog of taste, and chooses to
	      <lb/>remain with more cheerful people,</said> said <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, as
	    <lb/>he laid his hand upon the dog, who stood wagging his
	    <lb/>tail, and looking, first at <persName>Catherine</persName>, and then at the
	    <lb/>Captain, as if uncertain which invitation to accept.</p>
          <p><said>But I cannot execute my mission without a coad­
	      <lb/>jutor,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>; <said>so if you will not part with
	      <lb/>the dog, Captain, you must go in my stead.</said></p>
          <p><said>Oh, as for a coadjutor,</said> returned <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, <said>if
	      <lb/>you do not insist upon his being a quadruped, <persName>Colonel
	      <lb/>Grahame</persName>, I doubt not, will gladly accept the office; if I
	      <lb/>may judge from his looks, he was on the very point of
	      <lb/>offering his services.</said></p>
          <p><said>I would not bestow on him a task so unwelcome as
	      <lb/>that of soothing the wounded pride of a vanquished sol­
	      <lb/>dier,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, deeply blushing. Without giving
	    <lb/>the Colonel time to reply, she opened the door, on the
	    <lb/>lock of which her hand had rested, for several minutes,
	    <lb/>and went hastily out, followed by <name>Juba</name>, who sprung
	    <lb/>from <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, and, bounding on before her, led the
	    <lb/>way to his master's apartment.</p>
          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> knocked gently at the door, which was
	    <lb/>opened by <persName>Martha</persName>, who, although <persName>Talbot's</persName> servant had
	    <lb/>that morning arrived from <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, maintained her
	    <lb/>station beside the sick man's bed, assured that her skill
	    <lb/>and experience were necessary to perfect his restoration.</p>
          <p><name>Juba</name> sprung upon the bed, the moment he had
	    <lb/>forced his way into the room, and by a thousand mute
	    <lb/>demonstrations, expressed his joy at again beholding
	    <lb/>his master. But they did not meet with that attention,
	    <lb/>which another, and a more interesting object complete­
	    <lb/>ly engrossed. <persName>Talbot</persName> heard the soft voice of <persName>Cathe­

	      <milestone unit="sig" n="23(4)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">271</mw>
	      <lb/>rine</persName>, inquiring of <persName>Martha</persName>, if he was asleep, and through
	      <lb/>the folds of his bed curtains, he caught a glimpse of
	      <lb/>her lovely figure, approaching on tip-toe towards him.
	      <lb/>The next moment she stood beside him, and the plea­
	      <lb/>sure which he felt in seeing her, was eloquently ex­
	      <lb/>pressed by the sudden brightening of his eye, and the
	      <lb/>vivid glow, which overspread his before pale cheek.</p>
          <p><said>This is very kind, <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>,</said> he said; <said>to
	      <lb/>quit the gay circle of your friends, for the unsocial
	      <lb/>gloom of an invalid's apartment.</said></p>
          <p><said>Even pleasure sometimes wearies,</said> replied <persName>Cathe­
	      <lb/>rine</persName>; <said>and though I cannot, in this instance, allege
	      <lb/>that as the cause of my present visit to you, yet I as­
	      <lb/>sure you, I left my guests, without the least reluctance,
	      <lb/>and came, at my father's desire, to beguile if possible
	      <lb/>your solitude.</said></p>
          <p><said>Then I am indebted to the Major for this visit,</said><lb/>said <persName>Talbot</persName>, with a look of disappointment.</p>
          <p><said>Not entirely,</said> returned <persName>Catherine</persName>. <said>I have been
	      <lb/>twice on the point of coming hither, but was once
	      <lb/>anticipated by <persName>Amelia</persName>, and once by my father, both of
	      <lb/>whom I thought abler comforters than myself. But I
	      <lb/>hope you continue as well, as when the surgeon left us
	      <lb/>this morning? your color varies so frequently, that I
	      <lb/>fear you are more indisposed.</said></p>
          <p><said>Indeed I have not felt so well before, to-day, <persName>Miss
	      <lb/>Courtland</persName>, as I do at this moment,</said> said <persName>Talbot</persName>, while
	    <lb/>a still deeper glow suffused his feature, and increased
	    <lb/>the apprehensions of <persName>Catherine</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>He has certainly much fever,</said> she whispered aside
	    <lb/>to <persName>Martha</persName>, who shook her head with a grave look, say­
	    <lb/>ing,</p>
          <p>
            <said>And I fear, <persName>Miss Catherine</persName>, we can never cure it.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>Do you then think him so very ill?</said> asked <persName>Cathe­
	      <lb/>rine</persName> in the same low tone, and with a countenance of
	    <lb/>extreme concern.</p>
          <p><persName>Martha</persName> smiled at the simplicity of her young lady,
	    <lb/>in not detecting the cause of <persName>Captain Talbot's</persName> frequent
	    <lb/>change of complexion, which her discernment had long
	  <pb n="272"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="23(4)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">272</mw>
	    <lb/>since enabled her to discover, and she replied in a
	    <lb/>whisper,</p>
          <p>
            <said>Do not alarm yourself, <persName>Miss Catherine</persName>; the Cap­
	      <lb/>tain has no more fever than most other young men of
	      <lb/>like courage, and I dare say his sickness will end well
	      <lb/>enough.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>Ah, if that is all, we have indeed no cause for ap­
	      <lb/>prehension,</said> replied <persName>Catherine</persName>; and she returned to
	    <lb/>the side of <persName>Talbot's</persName> bed, who had begun to grow im­
	    <lb/>patient of her conference with <persName>Martha</persName>.</p>
          <p>Finding the Captain inclined to converse, <persName>Catherine</persName>
	    <lb/>remained with him some time. He seemed to forget
	    <lb/>his indisposition, and to derive new life and animation
	    <lb/>from the presence of <persName>Catherine</persName>. A variety of topics
	    <lb/>occupied them in succession, and the Captain fearing
	    <lb/>lest a pause in the conversation, should give her an
	    <lb/>opportunity to quit him, did not suffer it to occur, but
	    <lb/>continued to engage her without interruption on sub­
	    <lb/>jects, which he thought would interest her.</p>
          <p><persName>Catherine</persName> knew that <persName>Talbot</persName> and <persName>O'Carroll</persName>, had long
	    <lb/>been intimate, and she wished to ask of him some par­
	    <lb/>ticulars respecting an unfortunate attachment, to which
	    <lb/>she had once heard <persName>O'Carroll</persName> allude.</p>
          <p><said>He was, indeed, deeply wounded,</said> said <persName>Talbot</persName>, in
	    <lb/>reply to her inquiry. <said>But the native haughtiness of
	      <lb/>his spirit forbade his sinking into despondency. It
	      <lb/>was somewhat of a singular affair, though I could never
	      <lb/>prevail on myself to believe the lady meant him ill.</said></p>
          <p><said>It was ill,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, <said>to deceive him, with
	      <lb/>a promise of affection, which she did not feel.</said></p>
          <p><said>True, if the deception was intentional,</said> returned
	    <lb/><persName>Talbot</persName>; <said>but I am inclined to think there was a good
	      <lb/>deal of treachery practised on her, as well as upon
	      <lb/><persName>O'Carroll</persName>.</said></p>
          <p><said>And what reason have you to think so?</said> asked
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>Perhaps, I judged hastily,</said> said <persName>Talbot</persName>; <said>but ap­
	      <lb/>pearances certainly justified my suspicions. <persName>O'Carroll</persName>
	      <lb/>and myself, at that time, served in the same regiment,
	      <lb/>and were quartered near ―― in the county of <placeName>Ul­

		<lb/>ster</placeName>, where his acquaintance with the lady of his affec­
	      <lb/>tions commenced. Her father, <persName>Mr. Spencer</persName>, was one
	      <lb/>of those reduced gentlemen so common in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>, and
	      <lb/>she resided with him, on a small patrimonial estate,
	      <lb/>which was all that remained to them of a considerable
	      <lb/>inheritance. We obtained an introduction, and made
	      <lb/>them long and frequent visits: for our society was
	      <lb/>rather limited, and we found <persName>Mr. Spencer</persName> gentleman­
	      <lb/>ly and intelligent, and his daughter lovely and ac­
	      <lb/>complished. <persName>O'Carroll</persName> shortly became her declared
	      <lb/>lover, and was accepted both by herself and her father,
	      <lb/>with undisguised pleasure. Indeed she gave so many
	      <lb/>unequivocal proofs of her affection for my friend, that
	      <lb/>it was impossible to doubt her sincerity. From after
	      <lb/>events I might have suspected her of deliberately act­
	      <lb/>ing a part to deceive, had not her character seemed to
	      <lb/>me so perfectly artless, tender, and confiding, as to
	      <lb/>render such a suspicion absurd.</said></p>
          <p><said>How then,</said> inquired <persName>Catherine</persName>, <said>do you account
	      <lb/>for her change of conduct.</said></p>
          <p><said>A <persName>Mr. Dalkeith</persName> came to reside at his seat in the
	      <lb/>neighbourhood,</said> returned <persName>Talbot</persName>, <said rend="post()">who, I suspect, had
	      <lb/>a powerful agency in the affair. He was rich, and
	      <lb/>rather handsome, and he became a frequent guest at
	      <lb/>the house of <persName>Mr. Spencer</persName>, by whom he was evidently
	      <lb/>courted and admired. He often praised <persName>Miss Spen­
		<lb/>cer's</persName> charms, and though, in presence of her lover, he
	      <lb/>forbore to make her the principal object of his atten­
	      <lb/>tion, it was evident to all that she only occupied his
	      <lb/>thoughts. <persName>O'Carroll's</persName> jealousy was excited, he became
	      <lb/>petulant and reserved; and I am positive, that the
	      <lb/>change in <persName>Miss Spencer's</persName> manners may be partly at­
	      <lb/>tributable to this cause. He would often absent him­
	      <lb/>self, for several days together, from her society, and
	      <lb/>when again he saw her, the interview only furnished
	      <lb/>him fresh cause for suspicion, and he would leave her,
	      <lb/>far more wretched than before. Her father certainly
	      <lb/>treated him with less cordiality and her dejection,
	      <lb/>which to me wore the air of deep-rooted sorrow,
	      <lb/>seemed to the tortured lover, the effect of unconquera­
	    <pb n="274"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="23(5)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">274</mw>
	      <lb/>ble aversion. Her silence, her tears, her reserve, con­
	      <lb/>vinced him of her attachment to <persName>Dalkeith</persName>, and he
	      <lb/>estranged himself more and more from her society.</said></p>
          <p>
            <said rend="pre()">At last he received a few lines one morning, from
	    <lb/><persName>Mr. Spencer</persName> informing him, that he was on the point
	    <lb/>of setting off for <placeName>Dublin</placeName> with his daughter, and should
	    <lb/>not return for several weeks. <persName>O'Carroll</persName> knew that
	    <lb/>the journey had been long in contemplation, but angry
	    <lb/>that <persName>Miss Spencer</persName> should not even write a line to say
	    <lb/>farewell, he suffered her to depart, without even an at­
	    <lb/>tempt to see her. Before the period fixed for their
	    <lb/>return however, <persName>O'Carroll</persName> had forgotten his chagrin,
	    <lb/>and found a thousand excuses for <persName>Miss Spencer's</persName> con­
	    <lb/>duct. With the impatience of devoted love he count­
	    <lb/>ed the days and hours of her absence, and as the term
	    <lb/>fixed for their return drew towards a close, he rode
	    <lb/>every day to the house, in the hope of finding them
	    <lb/>there. But four, five, and even six week wore away,
	    <lb/>and still they did not return. Distracted with anxiety,
	    <lb/>he wrote repeatedly to both father and daughter; but
	    <lb/>without receiving any answer. Unable any longer, to
	    <lb/>endure the agony of suspense, he at last obtained leave
	    <lb/>of absence from his regiment, and was on the point of
	    <lb/>setting out for <placeName>Dublin</placeName>, when a letter was handed him
	    <lb/>from <persName>Mr. Spencer</persName>. Its contents at once terminated
	    <lb/>his doubts and hopes. They informed him that cir­
	    <lb/>cumstances had occurred, which would render it im­
	    <lb/>possible for any connexion to take place between him
	    <lb/>and <persName>Miss Spencer</persName>; that she herself desired him to re­
	    <lb/>nounce the hope; and in order to avoid any future in­
	    <lb/>tercourse, they should not return to ―― so long as
	    <lb/>his regiment remained in its vicinity. The letter end­
	    <lb/>ed with advice to him to forget them, and with many
	    <lb/>wishes for his happiness. A few lines from <persName>Miss
	    <lb/>Spencer</persName>, written with a trembling hand, at the bottom
	    <lb/>of the page, confirmed all that her father had said, and
	    <lb/>concluded with a repetition of the same wishes, though
	    <lb/>less copiously expressed. The Captain was frenzied
	    <lb/>with rage and disappointment, which were not at all
	    <lb/>softened, when, on riding to the house of <persName>Mr. Dalkeith</persName>,

	    <lb/>he learned that he had left the place, several weeks
	    <lb/>before. Without delay, he pursued his way to <placeName>Dub­
	      <lb/>lin</placeName>; but neither <persName>Mr. Spencer</persName> nor <persName>Dalkeith</persName> were to be
	    <lb/>found: every search after them was vain, they were
	    <lb/>no where to be traced. Still he continued his inqui­
	    <lb/>ries, and before he was resolved to give them up, he
	    <lb/>was transferred to another regiment, and that to which I
	    <lb/>was still attached, was ordered to embark for <placeName>America</placeName>.
	    <lb/>I saw him before we sailed, but so altered, that I
	    <lb/>should scarcely have known him; pale, dejected, the
	    <lb/>very shadow, in fact, of what he was. A year after, he
	    <lb/>followed me to <placeName>America</placeName>, and now the fortunes of war
	    <lb/>have thrown us unexpectedly, indeed, beneath the same
	    <lb/>hospitable roof.</said>
          </p>
          <p><said>And has he never seen <persName>Miss Spencer</persName>, since that
	      <lb/>time, nor even heard of her?</said> asked <persName>Catherine</persName>, deep­
	    <lb/>ly interested by the circumstances, which <persName>Talbot</persName> had
	    <lb/>related.</p>
          <p><said>He has neither seen nor heard of her,</said> returned the
	    <lb/>Captain. <said>We were informed that <persName>Mr. Spencer</persName> did
	      <lb/>not again return to his estate, and that <persName>Dalkeith</persName> proved
	      <lb/>an impostor, and fled the country; but whither they
	      <lb/>went, and what has been their fate, we have been un­
	      <lb/>able to discover. I believe, however, that <persName>O'Carroll</persName>
	      <lb/>was too deeply wounded by the conduct of <persName>Miss Spen­
		<lb/>cer</persName>, ever to love again.</said></p>
          <p><said>And does he still cherish the hope of finding her,</said><lb/>asked <persName>Catherine</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>He continues tenderly to love her, and often re­
	      <lb/>proaches himself for his harshness towards her,</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>Talbot</persName>; <said>but he dares not indulge the hope of finding
	      <lb/>her free; and he could not endure the shock of seeing
	      <lb/>her the wife of <persName>Dalkeith</persName>, and living perhaps in wretch­
	      <lb/>edness and obscurity. He therefore seldom mentions
	      <lb/>her, and has long since given up all efforts to discover
	      <lb/>her. I am persuaded however, if she has married <persName>Dal­
		<lb/>keith</persName>, it was only by the express command of her
	      <lb/>father.</said></p>
          <p><said>Oh yes, I am sure she loved <persName>O'Carroll</persName>,</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName>; <said>and amidst all his gaiety I can often see

	      <lb/>that the remembrance of the past comes like a cloud
	      <lb/>over his spirits. But you are weary, <persName>Captain Talbot</persName>,
	      <lb/>I have done wrong in suffering you to talk so much,
	      <lb/>and upon a subject not at all calculated to enliven
	      <lb/>you.</said></p>
          <p><said>I feel perfectly well,</said> said <persName>Talbot</persName>, <said>and were it
	      <lb/>not for these troublesome bandages, I should have a
	      <lb/>mind to make my debut at dinner; instead of remain­
	      <lb/>ing here to eat my soup alone.</said></p>
          <p><said>Not to day<choice><sic>.</sic><corr>,</corr></choice></said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>; <said>but within a week,
	      <lb/>perhaps, we may allow you a seat at the table, pro­
	      <lb/>vided you will endure silence and solitude, and consent
	      <lb/>to fast till then.</said></p>
          <p><said>I will endure abstinence willingly, if you prescribe
	      <lb/>it,</said> said <persName>Talbot</persName>; <said>but I did not expect you to enjoin
	      <lb/>solitude and silence, after witnessing the beneficial in­
	      <lb/>fluence of the last delightful hour.</said></p>
          <p><said>Well, then, I will permit occasional society,</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>Catherine</persName>; <said>I would not have you weary of your cap­
	      <lb/>tivity, when it has but just commenced, and I already
	      <lb/>fear, you will sigh for the gaiety of the city, before you
	      <lb/>have passed a week in our quiet and retired abode.
	      <lb/>Our circle is seldom larger than it is to-day, and we
	      <lb/>are of course obliged to depend upon ourselves and
	      <lb/>each other for amusement.</said></p>
          <p><said><quote rend="pre()post()">I have ever loved the life removed</quote>,</said> said <persName>Talbot</persName>,
	    <lb/>in the words of <persName>O'Carroll's</persName> favorite bard; <said>and the
	      <lb/>calm pleasures of domestic life, the rational enjoyments
	      <lb/>of friendly intercourse and society, will be peculiarly
	      <lb/>delightful to me after the noisy tumult of scenes, in

	      <lb/>who are stigmatized with every opprobrious epithet

          <p><said>And those the bravest, and most impartial, I doubt
	      <lb/>not,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>.</p>
          <p><said>The most impartial certainly,</said> replied <persName>Talbot</persName>;
	    <lb/><said>but brave men, <persName>Miss Courtland</persName>, will have prejudices,
	      <lb/>and sometimes express them too, in most intemperate
	      <lb/>language.</said></p>
          <p>A summons to dinner interrupted the conversation.</p>
          <p><said>It is quite time for me to leave you, <persName>Captain Tal­
		<lb/>bot</persName>,</said> said <persName>Catherine</persName>, as she rose to go; <said>and if you
	      <lb/>are not as well tomorrow, I shall be compelled to re­
	      <lb/>proach myself for it.</said></p>
          <p><said>Your presence brings only healing with it,</said> said
	    <lb/><persName>Talbot</persName>, in a tone so marked, and with a look so ex­
	    <lb/>pressive of tenderness and admiration, that <persName>Catherine</persName>
	    <lb/>blushed and quitted him, without reply; though as she
	    <lb/>crossed the hall, she chid herself for having betrayed
	    <lb/>any emotion at a mere effusion of gallantry, and which
	    <lb/>even if seriously intended, she was far from designing
	    <lb/>to receive in earnest.</p>
          <p>When she entered the parlor, <persName>O'Carroll</persName> rallied her
	    <lb/>on the length of her visit to the invalid, and though she
	    <lb/>parried his attack, with the most perfect non chalance,
	    <lb/>he was induced to continue it, because he observed
	    <lb/><persName>Colonel Grahame</persName> to be disturbed by it. The conver­
	    <lb/>sation, however, gradually became general, and the
	    <lb/>dinner hour passed pleasantly away. Even <persName>Amelia</persName>,
	    <lb/>though naturally taciturn and reserved, was drawn by
	    <lb/>the address of <persName>Grahame</persName>, to take part in the various
	    <lb/>subjects, which in succession employed the wit, the
	    <lb/>eloquence, or the grave morality of the party.</p>
          <p>When they rose from table, the Colonel went to
	    <lb/>take leave of <persName>Captain Talbot</persName>, and after promising the
	    <lb/>Major to pass the next evening with them, he remount­
	    <lb/>ed his horse, and returned to the American camp, rumi­
	    <lb/>nating as he rode along, upon the occurrences of the
	    <lb/>day, and the different characters, with whom he had
	    <lb/>associated.</p>
