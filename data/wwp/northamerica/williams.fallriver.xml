        <p>I shall always recollect with pleasure one little incident, in
<lb/>one of the weaving rooms of the manufactory, where the noise
<lb/>was very distracting arising from a vast number of looms go­
<lb/>ing at once.  The machinery suddenly stopped, and a strain of
<lb/>music arose simultaneously from every part of the room, in such
<lb/>perfect concord that I at first thought it a chime of bells.  My
<lb/>conductor smiled when I asked him if it was not, and pointed to
<lb/>the girls, who each kept their station until they had sung the
<lb/>tune through.</p>

        <p><lb/>Her countenance was exceedingly distorted, and there was

<lb/>chill.  That look never was seen on the countenance of a person

        <p>The first part of the comb was found some rods from the place
<lb/>while she lay near the stack, after they had taken her down, and
<lb/>the man who found it brought it and laid it on her cloak.  They
<lb/>did not then know but she wore a broken piece in her hair, until
<lb/>after its fellow was found.  Some way further off, on the lonely
	  <lb/>path leading round the corner of the wall towards <placeName>Fall River</placeName>, she
<lb/>was buried with the first piece in her hair, and when disinterred
<lb/>it was taken out and compared with the remaining piece found,
<lb/>and they fitted, and both parts were then identified.  It was sin­
<lb/>gular that the pocket handkerchief of the deceased, found near her
<lb/>wound up in a hard bunch and wet through and through, should

<lb/>saliva, but they did not think of this test at the time, though it
<lb/>was afterwards believed to have been used to stop her mouth by some
	  <lb/>person who murdered her.  <persName>Doctor Wilbour</persName> remarked that the
<lb/>cloak showed marks of tears, which combined with the discharge
<lb/>from the nose appeared to have been very plentifully shed and ran
<lb/>down on each side of the cloak.  He has even expressed his hope
<lb/><said>that they might have been tears of penitance as well as anguish,

        <p>It is with feelings of embarrassment never felt on any former oc­
<lb/>casion, that the writer of this little volume lays it before the public.
<lb/>The tale which forms the principal part of its contents has been
<lb/>hitherto treated in such an indecent manner, that this, of itself,
<lb/>was nearly sufficient to terrify any one at the undertaking;  and it
<lb/>was not until after long and reiterated persuasion, that the author
<lb/>was induced to attempt it.  Who first proposed it, is of no conse­
<lb/>quence:  it is sufficient that a very great part of the subscribers
<lb/>and patrons of former works have seconded the request;  and if the
<lb/>volume answers no other purpose except proving the wish to oblige,
<lb/>it will certainly answer an important one.  But we confidently
<lb/>hope it may answer other and more useful ones.
</p>
        <p>The History of <placeName>Fall River</placeName>, a place which is becoming of so much
<lb/>importance in the manufacturing world, cannot but be acceptable
<lb/>to the public.  The anecdotes connected with its revolutionary
<lb/>history are worthy to be preserved.  And a fair and candid state­
<lb/>ment of facts, connected with the late unhappy affair in that quarter,
<lb/>is desirable.  As to the trial, it does not treat of things in their pro­
<lb/>per order, nor cannot:  and in the next place, none but what is call­
<lb/>ed legal evidence is admissible;  and lastly—and its greatest objec­
<lb/>tion—it is not fit for any body to read.  A narrative, therefore,
<lb/>that would embrace the facts, without any of the odious details in
<lb/>the trial, is highly necessary, if public curiosity on the subject is
<lb/>lawful:  and who shall say that it is not?
</p>
        <p>There is another way too, in which it is hoped and presumed
<lb/>this work may prove useful:—as a salutary and timely warning
<lb/>to young women in the same situation in life, in which the ill fa­
<lb/>ted girl was placed, who is the subject of this narrative.  On
<lb/>many accounts it may benefit.  That baneful disposition to rove,
<lb/>to keep moving from place to place, which has been the ruin of so
<lb/>many, will here receive a check.  And what is more important
<lb/>still—though an extremely difficult subject to treat upon so as to
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">A2</mw>
<pb n="4"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="A2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">4</mw>
<lb/>be understood—they will be warned, by the fate of one, against
<lb/>that idolatrous regard for ministers, for preachers of the gospel,
<lb/>which at the present day is a scandal to the cause of christianity;
<lb/>which neither honors God or benefits his church;  and certainly
<lb/>is calculated to bring reproach and ridicule on the christian char­
<lb/>acter.  To venerate the ambassador of the Most High, and listen
<lb/>to him with respect, while in the sacred discharge of his ministe­
<lb/>rial duties, is right and proper;  to contribute to his relief in sick­
<lb/>ness and support in health, of our abundance, or our personal ex­
<lb/>ertion, if necessary, is likewise our duty;  but here let us stop,
<lb/>and not make ourselves, and the cause we profess to be engaged in,
<lb/>ridiculous, by such attentions as mortal man <emph rend="slant(italic)">ought never</emph> to re­
<lb/>ceive.
</p>
        <p>The absurd custom of crowding round some handsome preacher
<lb/>on every occasion, in order to share his smiles, and be distin­
<lb/>guished by his <emph rend="slant(italic)">gracious</emph> gallantries, has justly excited the ridi­
<lb/>cule of a large part of the community, and armed every scoffer
<lb/>with weapons against that holy cause, which ought not to suffer
<lb/>from the faults of its ignorant professors, but which they neverthe­
<lb/>less confound together.  Besides, ministers are mortal men;  and,
<lb/>with good intentions, sometimes persons of weak minds:  and it re­
<lb/>quires a very strong mind to resist continual flattery.  Some of
<lb/>them too are ignorant persons;  people, who, if they had their
<lb/>proper places in society, would be hewers of wood and drawers
<lb/>of water, rather than teachers.  This description of false teachers
<lb/>is very plainly set forth in the Scriptures, as being <said>ever learning,
<lb/>and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth;</said> as <said>creep­
<lb/>ing into houses, and leading captive silly women,</said> &amp;c. &amp;c.  This
<lb/>last description of preachers take care to insinuate themselves into
<lb/>every place where they can possibly find entrance.  No matter
<lb/>what the religious privileges of the people may be, they go among;
<lb/>unless they themselves have built up a sect among them, they con­
<lb/>sider them as destitute of truth and the means of grace.  If a
<lb/>neighborhood is furnished with ever so many good, respectable,
<lb/>competent teachers, supported by those who are able to do it, there
<lb/>must be one more added, if there is no other way to support him
<lb/>but out of the hard earnings of the poor.  Now the fact is, that a
<pb n="5"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="A3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">5</mw>
<lb/>preacher, who cannot be supported without drawing upon the
<lb/>charity of poor factory girls, ought to go in and go to work him­
<lb/>self.
</p>
        <p>It will be seen too after perusing the history of this unfortunate
<lb/>girl, whether a course of spiritual dissipation is favorable to the
<lb/>growth of religion in the soul;  whether a continual round of go­
<lb/>ing to meetings night and day, is in reality recommending the
<lb/>cause, or likely to recommend the character, or preserve the cha­
<lb/>racters of young women, in an especial manner.  It is much to be
<lb/>feared it is otherwise.  In the first place, this appearance of supe­
<lb/>rior devotedness, this over zeal, fails in no instance to draw all
<lb/>eyes upon her.  There is rivalship in churches it is known, as
<lb/>well as in other communities, and such members are watched with
<lb/>jealous regard;  if they go and return protected as they ought to
<lb/>be by one of the other sex, barbarous insinuations will sometimes
<lb/>be made;  if on the contrary they wander about from meeting to
<lb/>meeting alone, they are immediately censured.  And added to
<lb/>this it is expected that the general deportment of such females
<lb/>should differ from that of others;  that it should present an appear­
<lb/>ance of stiffness and restraint incompatible with youth, with cheer­
<lb/>fulness, and a social temper;  hence the slightest deviation from
<lb/>the prescribed forms is censured in such persons as a crime;  what
<lb/>would pass in others without remark, is the subject of unqualified
<lb/>abuse in these, and induces a species of persecution, that too often
<lb/>results in loss of character to the victim.
</p>
        <p>And is this counterbalanced by any inward advantage?  Does re­
<lb/>ligion thrive most in noise and tumult?  Does the heart become
<lb/>better, the imagination purer, the temper more placid?  can that
<lb/>God, who is worshipped only in spirit and in truth, be only hon­
<lb/>ored in a crowd?  Let every heart decide the question.
</p>
        <p>With respect to embellishment in this book, no person acquaint­
<lb/>ed with the facts, who has seen it, pretends to say there is any,
<lb/>except in the first interview between the physician and the unfor­
<lb/>tunate heroine of the tale;  where it is said the phraseology is im­
<lb/>proved without altering the facts.  If the error is on the side of
<lb/>delicacy we hope to be pardoned.</p>

        <p>Situated on a rather abrupt elevation of land
	  <lb/>rising from the northeast side of <placeName>Mount Hope bay</placeName>,
	  <lb/>distant about eighteen miles from <placeName>Newport</placeName>, and
	  <lb/>nine from <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, <placeName>R. I.</placeName> stands the beautiful and
	  <lb/>flourishing village of <placeName>Fall River</placeName>, so called from the
<lb/>river, which, taking its rise about four miles east,
<lb/>runs through the place, and after many a fantastic
<lb/>turn, is hurried to the bay over beds of rocks, where,
<lb/>before the scene was marred by the hand of cultiva­
<lb/>tion and improvement, it formed several beautiful
<lb/>cascades and had a fine and imposing effect.  The
<lb/>village is now only picturesque from the variety of
<lb/>delightful landscape by which it is surrounded,
<lb/>the back ground presenting a variety in rural scene­
<lb/>ry—where neat farms and fertile fields shew them­
<lb/>selves here and there, between hill and dale and rock
<lb/>and wood.  The soil, though for the most part
<lb/>fertile, is in some places exceedingly rocky, and
<lb/>often in the midst of such places some little verdant
	  <lb/>spot shews itself, looking, as <persName>Cunningham</persName> says, <said>as
<lb/>though it were wrested from the hand of nature.</said>
</p>
        <p>But <placeName>Fall River</placeName> is chiefly inviting as a place of
<lb/>residence from the salubrity of its air, and the vicin­
	  <lb/>ity of <placeName>Mount Hope bay</placeName>, which spreads before it like
<lb/>a mirror, and extends easterly until it meets the

<milestone unit="sig" n="A4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">8</mw>
	  <lb/>waters of <placeName>Taunton</placeName> river, forming on each side nu­
<lb/>merous little creeks and coves, which add to the
<lb/>charms of the landscape materially;  while on the
<lb/>southwest it takes a bold sweep, and passing round
	  <lb/>through <placeName>Howland's ferry</placeName>, where it is compressed
<lb/>through the narrow channel of a drawbridge, having
	  <lb/>the island of <placeName>Rhode-Island</placeName> on one hand and the
	  <lb/>town of <placeName>Tiverton</placeName> on the other, again expands and
	  <lb/>flows on to meet the ocean.  <placeName>Howland's ferry</placeName> is not
	  <lb/>visible from the village of <placeName>Fall River</placeName>, though it is
<lb/>from the bay when at the distance of three or four
<lb/>miles.  Vessels do sometimes pass and repass through
	  <lb/>the drawbridge at <placeName>Howland's ferry</placeName> to and from <placeName>Fall
	    <lb/>River</placeName> and <placeName>Taunton;</placeName>  but the most usual way of ac­
	  <lb/>cess to the former is through <placeName>Bristol ferry</placeName>, two
	  <lb/>miles south of <placeName>Bristol</placeName> port.  It requires no great ef­
<lb/>fort of imagination to go back a few years, and im­
	  <lb/>agine the <name>Indian</name> with his light canoe sailing about
<lb/>in these waters, or dodging about among the rocks
	  <lb/>and trees.  The neighborhood of <placeName>Fall River</placeName> has
<lb/>been the scene of frequent skirmishes among the
	  <lb/><name>Picknets</name>, the tribe of <persName>King Philip</persName>, and the <name>Pequods</name>
	  <lb/>and <name>Narragansetts</name>.  <persName>Uncas</persName> too, with the last of the

        <p><placeName>Fall River</placeName>, which in <date when="1812">1812</date> contained less than
<lb/>one hundred inhabitants, owes its growth and im­
<lb/>portance principally, indeed almost wholly, to its
<lb/>manufacturing establishments;  which, though not
<lb/>splendid in appearance, are very numerous and em­
<lb/>ploy several thousand persons collected from differ­
<lb/>ent parts of the country, as well as many foreigners:
<lb/>the immense fall of water here being now nearly
<lb/>covered by establishments of various kinds.

<lb/>eration, and it is only twenty-one years since the
<lb/>erection of the first cotton manufactory.  Previous
<lb/>to this the land in this vicinity belonged principally
	  <lb/>to the families of <name>Borden</name>, <name>Bowen</name>, and <name>Durfee</name>;  three
<lb/>families from whom the principal part of the station­
<lb/>ary inhabitants sprung.  The land now divided
<lb/>among the different manufacturing establishments
<lb/>is principally held in shares, that is in the neighbor­
<lb/>hood of the establishments.  So flourishing has
<lb/>business been there, that there is scarce a mechanic,
<lb/>trader, or even labourer, who has been there for any
<lb/>length of time, who has not acquired an estate of
	  <lb/>his own.  In <date when="1812">1812</date> the first cotton manufactory was
<lb/>erected by a company incorporated by the name of
	  <lb/>the <name>Fall River Company</name>.  In the same year, anoth­
	  <lb/>er company was incorporated called the <name>Troy Man­
<lb/>ufacturing Company</name>, and another factory built.
	  <lb/>There are now, in <date when="1833">1833</date>, thirteen manufactories, viz.
	  <lb/>two cotton manufactories of the <name>Troy Company</name>—
	  <lb/><placeName>Pocasset</placeName>, one woollen <choice><abbr>do.</abbr><expan>ditto</expan></choice>—<placeName>New
	    Pocasset</placeName>—<placeName>Mas­
	    <lb/>sasoit</placeName>—<placeName>Olney's mill</placeName>—<name>Calico works</name>—<name>Fall River
	    <lb/>Company's</name> mills, three in number—<name>Annawan</name>—<name>Iron
	    <lb/>Works and Nail Manufactory</name>.  The <name>Calico Works</name>
<lb/>alone, which cover a large area of ground, employ
<lb/>nearly three hundred hands;  its state of improve­
<lb/>ment is not, we believe, exceeded by any establis<choice><sic/><corr>h</corr></choice>­
<lb/>ment of the kind in the country—besides a number
<lb/>of machine shops, &amp;c. which, stuck about on the
<lb/>jutting rocks, many of them in the very bed of the
<lb/>stream, have a most singular appearance.  The fall
<lb/>originally was through a deep black gulf, with high
<lb/>rocky sides.  Across this gulf most of the manu­
<lb/>factories are built.  There is an appearance of ac­
<lb/>tive industry and a spirit of enterprise, as well as of
<lb/>cheerfulness and contentment, that at once strikes
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">A5</mw>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">10</mw>
<lb/>a stranger.  It is evident too from the number of
<lb/>houses of worship, schools, &amp;c. that the moral and
<lb/>religious education of the rising generation is not
<lb/>neglected.  There are seven houses of worship.
	  <lb/>Two for <name>Congregationalists</name>, two for <name>Baptists</name>, one
	  <lb/><name>Free-Will Baptist</name>, one <name>Unitarian</name>, one <name>Methodist</name> &amp;c.
<lb/>There are a number of free-schools here, towards
<lb/>which the inhabitants themselves voluntarily con­
<lb/>tribute twenty-five hundred dollars per annum.
<lb/>The number of inhabitants at the present date,
	  <lb/><date when="1833">1833</date>, is said to exceed five thousand.  It is to be
<lb/>supposed that among the heterogeneous materials
<lb/>which form the community in this place, there is a
<lb/>great variety of character, as well as of creeds;  oc­
<lb/>casionally some differences of opinion as well as
<lb/>clashing of interests.  Yet for the most part crime
<lb/>has been unknown there.  There have indeed been
<lb/>a few suicides, but they were <said>few and far be­
<lb/>tween</said>; and it has often been a boast among the in­
<lb/>habitants, that living as they do, on the borders of two
	  <lb/>states (part, and by far the greater part, is in <placeName>Troy</placeName>,
	  <lb/><placeName>Mass</placeName>. the other in <placeName>Tiverton</placeName>,
<placeName>R.I.</placeName>) the laws of ei­
<lb/>ther were seldom called in to punish any thing ex­
	  <lb/>cept venial transgressions.  <placeName>Fall River</placeName> too can boast
<lb/>of its prowess in battle, of its revolutionary characters
<lb/>in <said>the times that tried men's souls.</said>  For although
<lb/>their humble attempts to resist invasion have not
<lb/>yet found a place on the pages of history, yet certain
<lb/>it is, the tide of war has once rolled its threatening
	  <lb/>waves as far up as to reach the shores of <placeName>Mount
<lb/>Hope bay</placeName>.  The character for bravery, generosity,
<lb/>and independence of mind manifested at that peri­
<lb/>od seems to have become a part of their inheritance.
<lb/>Among all the changes which the increase of popu­
<lb/>lation causes, the primitive virtues of simplicity and
<pb n="11"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="A6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">11</mw>
<lb/>hospitality are still eminently conspicuous.  Who­
<lb/>ever goes to reside there seems to adopt readily the
<lb/>manners of the inhabitants.  Even the labouring
<lb/>part of the community in the manufactories, as well
<lb/>as in other departments, are positively distinguished
<lb/>by a degree of refinement and courtesy of manners,
<lb/>superior in a great degree to what we usually meet
<lb/>with in manufacturing villages.<anchor xml:id="a001" corresp="#n001" rend="pre(*)"/> It is a fact that
<lb/>speaks loudly and deserves to be recorded in letters
	  <lb/>of gold, that <placeName>Fall River</placeName> is the only place known to
<lb/>the writer of these sheets where she ever past a week
<lb/>without hearing one individual speak ill of another:
<lb/>and few persons ever had a greater opportunity, hav­
<lb/>ing spoken with more than three hundred people
<lb/>during that time.
</p>
        <p>We have stated that previous to the commencement
<lb/>of its settlement as a manufacturing village, and even
<lb/>as far back as the revolutionary war, the families of
	  <lb/><name>Borden</name>, <name>Bowen</name> and <name>Durfee</name>, were the principal pro­
<lb/>prietors of the soil—and brave fellows they were too,
<lb/>some of them.  Even the soil around this secluded spot
	  <lb/>was stained with the contest.  At the time <placeName>Newport</placeName>
	  <lb/>was in possession of the <name>British</name>, there was an attempt
<lb/>made to destroy their mills at this place, consisting of
<lb/>saw mills, grist mills and a fulling mill.  An expedition
<lb/>was fitted out in boats, and came upon them in the
<lb/>night with the intention of firing the village, consisting
<pb n="12"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="A6v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">12</mw>
<lb/>of a l<choice><sic>t</sic><corr>i</corr></choice>ttle cluster of houses, about ten in number,
<lb/>and those remote from each other.  They were
<lb/>aided by some of the tory refugees, and succeeded
<lb/>in landing on the shore, a little below the long
<lb/>wharf, that now is, where they fired the house of
	  <lb/><persName>Thomas Borden</persName>.  Several little bridges lay between
<lb/>them and the mills, and these were immediately de­
<lb/>stroyed by the brave little handful of men collected
<lb/>on the spot, except the last, behind which they en­
<lb/>trenched themselves, and commenced firing a few
	  <lb/>yankee shot, and from behind the house of <persName>Rich­
<lb/>ard Borden</persName>, at the corner of which one of the ene­
<lb/>my was shot.  (The old fabric is still standing.)  The
<lb/>enemy continuing to advance, and becoming more
<lb/>formidable, they succeeded in levelling two of them;
	  <lb/>one was shot dead, supposed by <persName>Doct. John Turner</persName>,
<lb/>and the other mortally wounded.  This rather in­
<lb/>timidated the assailants, who made a motion to re­
<lb/>treat, but after halting at a little distance, returned
<lb/>again, and the scuffle was renewed—the yankees
<lb/>fighting bravely, with their last powder and ball;
<lb/>finding their ammunition all expended, they con­
<lb/>trived to make up the defect by management.  One
	  <lb/>of them, <persName>Sherman</persName>, by name, was mounted on the
<lb/>wall, and instructed to give orders, which he did
<lb/>with a great flourish, telling them to fight on brave­
<lb/>ly—the day was their own, and they had ammuni­
<lb/>tion enough to last a month.  The poor fellows had
<lb/>then the very last in their guns—but they gave a
<lb/>great shout, and discharged that in the face of the
<lb/>foe, who swallowed the bait, and retreated to their
<lb/>boats, carrying with them, however, one prisoner,
	  <lb/>old <persName>Mr. Richard Borden</persName>, who had ventured too
<lb/>near in the zeal of the moment.  Boys fifteen and

<lb/>sixteen years old, fought in that contest, and women
<lb/>brandished their broomsticks—and tradition says
<lb/>only one small boy was frightened, and he ran off
<lb/>and hid in the woods until it was over.  One of the
	  <lb/>tories who had been an inhabitant of <placeName>Fall River</placeName>,
<lb/>and guided the enemy to this little nook was named
	  <lb/><placeName>Holland</placeName>.  The business not prospering as he ex­
	  <lb/>pected, he was glad to retreat with the <name>British</name>, and
	  <lb/>at the evacuation of <placeName>Newport</placeName> went to reside at <placeName>Hal­
<lb/>ifax</placeName>.  Many years subsequent to this, and after he
	  <lb/>had become quite an old man, he returned to <placeName>Amer­
	    <lb/>ica</placeName>, and being anxious to see <placeName>Fall River</placeName>, the scene
<lb/>of his treacherous attempts, he visited it under an
	  <lb/>assumed name.  <persName>Thomas Borden</persName> was then an old
<lb/>man, and the stranger made some pretence for call­
<lb/>ing at his house, but in spite of his disguise and the
<lb/>lapse of years, his eagle eye detected the resem­
<lb/>blance, and hastily advancing he demanded to know
	  <lb/><said>if he was not the traitor <persName>Holland</persName>.</said> The stranger
<lb/>stoutly denied himself to be that character.  <said xml:id="q001">If I
<lb/>knew you was,</said> said the old man, clenching his fist,
<lb/><said xml:id="q002">I would lay you on that forestick, (pointing to
	    <lb/>the fire) and roast you to a cinder.</said>  <persName>Holland</persName>, ter­
<lb/>rified, fled again from the place and has never been
<lb/>there since.
</p>
        <p>This <persName>Richard Borden</persName> was a singular character
<lb/>for oddity.  He was taken prisoner, I before ob­
<lb/>served, at the memorable contest of the mills, and
<lb/>as they were carrying him off laid down in the boat
	  <lb/>while they were passing <placeName>Bristol Ferry</placeName>, lest some
<lb/>shot from his enraged countrymen should reach
<lb/>them.  The enemy commanded him to stand up,
<lb/>which he refusing, two men took hold of him and
<lb/>attempted to force him upon his feet, when a chain
<lb/>shot from the shore, mowed them both down at
<pb n="14"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="A7v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">14</mw>
<lb/>once, and they fell on the body of the prisoner, dead
<lb/>men.
</p>
        <p>The wounded prisoner, meanwhile at <placeName>Fall River</placeName>,
<lb/>died the next day, and the two comrades were
<lb/>buried on the spot where they fell, side by side.
	  <lb/>One <persName>Peter Thatcher</persName>, who had distinguished himself
<lb/>on that memorable night, advanced to the grave
<lb/>while this operation was performing, and protesting
<lb/>if their heads were laid together there would be
<lb/>some mischief hatching, commanded them to be
<lb/>laid heads and points.  This was accordingly done,
	  <lb/>and in <date when="1828">1828</date>, when the ground was excavating for
	  <lb/>the erection of the <name>Massasoit Factory</name>, the bones of
<lb/>the unfortunate victims of kingly power, of the poor
<lb/>wretches dragged from their families three thousand
<lb/>miles across the water to engage in a broil of which
<lb/>they probably knew nothing—were discovered laying
<lb/>heads and points.

        <p>The growth of <placeName>Fall River</placeName> from the period of the
	  <lb/>revolution to the year <date when="1812">1812</date>, must have been slow—
	  <lb/>and even since that, until <date when="1822">1822</date>,<anchor xml:id="a002" corresp="#n002" rend="pre(*)"/> when there was
<lb/>but four stores in the place, of any description, and
<lb/>not to exceed four hundred inhabitants.  There is
<lb/>now about 100 shops and stores of various descrip­
	  <lb/>tions—but excepting two or three on the <placeName>Tiverton</placeName>
<lb/>side of the village, scarce any where spirituous
<lb/>liquors are retailed, and not a single distillery in the
<lb/>place.</p>

        <p>The roads north and south of the village, lead
<lb/>through a delightful country.  The view of the
	  <lb/>island of <placeName>Rhode-Island</placeName> on the south one is beautiful,
	  <lb/>almost enchanting—while that leading to <placeName>Taunton</placeName>
<lb/>is scarcely less picturesque.  On this road lies the
	  <lb/>little village of <placeName>Assonet</placeName>, where there is considerable
<lb/>commerce carried on.  It is a singular sight to see
<lb/>large vessels coming up to the very doors of the cot­
<lb/>tages, sheltered and shut in by the little woody point
<lb/>that encloses the tiny harbor—and music to hear
<lb/>the voices and loud laugh of numerous little urchins
<lb/>who are frequently seen playing on the hull of some
<lb/>old vessel on the grassy strand.  These fairy land­
<lb/>scapes on the one hand, are strangely contrasted by
<lb/>the wildness and sterility of that on the east, which
<lb/>resembles a newly settled country.  The land lying
	  <lb/>between <placeName>Fall River</placeName> and <placeName>New-Bedford</placeName>, a distance of
<lb/>from sixteen to eighteen miles, is a perfect desert
<lb/>for the most part, being only diversified by bogs,
<lb/>rocky pastures and forests of scrub oak and wild
	  <lb/>poplar.  The village of <placeName>Fall River</placeName> perhaps owes
<lb/>much of its picturesque appearance to the rocks
<lb/>which are seen rising on all sides, some of the most
<lb/>finished buildings being nearly surrounded by rocks.
</p>
        <p>It almost seems in the law of destiny that every
<lb/>place shall have something in its history to recom­
<lb/>mend it to the attention of mankind.
</p>
        <p>In the countries of <placeName>Europe</placeName>, in every part of the
<lb/>old world, scarce a village or hamlet is past, where
<lb/>the attention of the traveller is not called to some cir­
<lb/>cumstance of notoriety connected with the history
<lb/>of the place, either it has been the birthplace of
<lb/>some hero, or statesman, or poet, renowned in the
<lb/>annals of the world, or the spot where some bloody
<pb n="16"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="A8v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">16</mw>
<lb/>battle has been fought that perhaps decided the fate
<lb/>of nations.  Here was once the resort of banditti,
<lb/>and here once stood the monastery of some religious
<lb/>fanatics.  Here was the cell of an anchorite, and
<lb/>here the home of unbounded luxury and unbridled
<lb/>licentiousness.  Those ruins cover the springs once
<lb/>so celebrated in history where the beauty and fash­
<lb/>ion of centuries long gone by resorted for health and
<lb/>pleasures, and drank from the fountains now hidden
<lb/>fathoms under ground.  This place witnessed ages
<lb/>since, the vows of those celebrated lovers, and this
<lb/>was the scene of a black and midnight murder.
<lb/>Here, dwelt the witches of yore, and here the sorce­
<lb/>rers.  Here was lighted the fires of the martyrs, and
<lb/>there, their persecutors breathed their last.  Here
<lb/>wept an injured, banished queen, and here a king
<lb/>abdicated his throne.  In short, there is no end to
<lb/>the catalogue of events by which each place is con­
<lb/>secrated in the memory of man.
</p>
        <p>In our happy country, new to crime and unknown
<lb/>to greatness comparatively speaking, there is little
<lb/>of this kind of distinction known.  It is sufficient
<lb/>that the thriving city exhibits the appearance of in­
<lb/>dustry and application and enterprise, that the rural
<lb/>landscape teems with sights and sounds of human
<lb/>happiness, that it is clothed with the flowers of
<lb/>spring, the verdure of summer, and the fullness of
<lb/>autumn.  The unenvied distinctions conferred by
<lb/>the monuments of former greatness and vengeful
<lb/>crimes, we desire to leave to our older neighbors.
<lb/>Yet even in this our new and favored country, crime
<lb/>is sometimes known.  The primeval curse which
<lb/>extends over the whole earth, has not left our plains
<lb/>and vallies without some demonstrations of its uni­

<lb/>versality.  <said rend="pre(“)post()">The blood of man, slain by his brother

        <p>About half a mile from the centre of the Village
	  <lb/>of <placeName>Fall-River</placeName>, in a southwardly direction, on the di­
	  <lb/>rect road to <placeName>Howland's ferry</placeName> and rather remote from
<lb/>any other dwelling, there is a large old fashioned farm
	  <lb/>house belonging to a family by the name of <placeName>Durfee</placeName>.
<lb/>The land descends from here towards the bay with a
<lb/>gentle slope, and is probably about 150 or 200 rods to
	  <lb/>the water.  The house stands in the State of <placeName>Rhode-
<lb/>Island</placeName>, and is quite near the line that marks the
<lb/>boundaries of the two states.  Proceeding from here
	  <lb/>towards the village you enter the suburbs of <placeName>Fall-
	    <lb/>River</placeName>. In the State of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> in about a
<lb/>quarter of a mile distance, within a short distance
<lb/>from this line on the Mass. side is the residence of a
<lb/>physician esteemed in his profession as well as in
<lb/>his private life, of unaffected manners, and unas­
<lb/>suming deportment.  His appearance is the very epit­
	  <lb/>ome of plain old fashioned <name>Republican</name> simplicity:
<lb/>there is a degree of frankness and benevolence ex­
<lb/>pressed in his countenance that at once secures the
<lb/>confidence, even of strangers.

        <p>It was on the evening of the <date when="1832-10-08">8th of <name>October</name> 1832</date>,
<lb/>that the Doctor was summoned to the parlor to see a
<lb/>lady who desired to speak with him.  This circum­
<lb/>stance to a physician was nothing extraordinary, and
<lb/>therefore it was without any feelings of curiosity or
<lb/>awakened attention that the doctor obeyed the sum­
<lb/>mons:  he perceived a young woman very plainly hab­
<lb/>ited and of most dejected appearance:  her age he
<lb/>judged might be about twenty eight, and her coun­
<lb/>tenance bespoke the possession of beauty in happier

<lb/>days—but it was now clouded with care and sha­
<lb/>ded with grief, and as she arose to adress the doctor
<lb/>upon his enterance, the air of extreme dejection that
<lb/>she wore, caught his eye, and in a moment interested
<lb/>him in behalf of the unknown sufferer.  He begged
<lb/>her to be seated:  while drawing a chair opposite, he
<lb/>endeavoured to penetrate so deep a grief and ascer­
<lb/>tain the cause of this visit.  <said>She had come she said
<lb/>to consult him on the subject of her health.  She
<lb/>had not been well for some time, and wished to as­
<lb/>certain with certainty the nature of her disease.</said>
</p>
        <p>The doctor desired her to mention her symptoms.
<lb/>She did so.  Not having the slightest recollection of
<lb/>seeing her before, he inquired, was she a stranger
<lb/>here?  <said>Not exactly;  she had been employed to
<lb/>weave in one of the cotton manufactories for some
<lb/>time past.</said>  <said>Her work probably disagreed with
<lb/>her:  had she been used to such employment?</said>  <said rend="pre()post()">yes,
<lb/>for several years.</said>  <said rend="pre(“)post()">Would she be so good as to state
<lb/>her symptoms once more?</said>  she did so, with a fault­
<lb/>tering voice, and changing cheek.  The doctor
<lb/>rose, took a turn or two across the room, and again
<lb/>seating himself opposite, asked the question, <said>Are
<lb/>you married, madam?</said>
</p>
        <p><said>No sir,</said> said the young woman faintly.—A long
<lb/>pause ensued.
</p>
        <p><said>If you were a married woman I should be apt
<lb/>to tell you what I thought, but as it is I scarcely
<lb/>know what to say, except it is my opinion you will
<lb/>not be able to work in the factory much longer.</said><lb/>The miserable young woman clasped her hands to­
<lb/>gether and wept profusely.
</p>
        <p><said>Can you speak with certainty, sir, as respects my

</p>
        <p>
          <said>Can you not tell me his name?</said>
        </p>
        <p><said>I cannot, I dare not,</said> said she at last, bursting
<lb/>into a fresh flood of tears.</p>
        <p><said rend="pre(“)post()">Have you no connections in this place young
<lb/>woman?</said> demanded the doctor.
</p>
        <p>
          <said>None sir except religious connections.</said>
        </p>
        <p>
          <said>Then you are a member of some religious soci­
<lb/>ety—of which?</said>
        </p>
        <p>
          <said>Of the <name>methodist</name>, sir.</said>
        </p>
        <p><said rend="pre(“)post()">Well your case is certainly a very peculiar and
<lb/>a very distressing one, but I can see no reason why
<lb/>you cannot tell who this person is—this man who
<lb/>has led you into this trouble—there seems to be
<lb/>some great mystery about it, which I am desirous of
<lb/>unravelling.  Perhaps I can advise you to some safe
<lb/>course, and if I am to be your physician I insist up­
<lb/>on knowing before I give you any further advice,
<lb/>and if it is in my power to befriend you in any way
<lb/>I should certainly do so.</said>  It was not until many
<lb/>apparent struggles with herself, much persuasion,
<lb/>solemn injunctions to secresy, and finally a promise
<lb/>on the part of the doctor not to expose the name,
<lb/>that she at length reluctantly disclosed it;  and great

<lb/>was the doctor's astonishment indeed when she na­
<lb/>med a preacher of the gospel as her betrayer—a
<lb/>Methodist minister!</p>
        <p><said xml:id="q005" rend="pre(“)post()">Monstrous!</said> said the appalled physician,
<said xml:id="q006" rend="pre()">and
	    <lb/>does he preach now?</said>  <said>Yes sir, in <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, next
<lb/>town to this.</said>
</p>
        <p>
          <said>But how, where, which way, could a minister of
<lb/>the gospel contrive to insult one of his flock?  Where
<lb/>young woman, I must ask, has your interviews ta­
<lb/>ken place?</said>
        </p>
        <p>
          <said>Our <emph rend="slant(italic)">interview</emph>, sir, was
	    at the late <name>Camp Meet­
	      <lb/>ing</name> in <placeName>Thompson</placeName>, <placeName>Con</placeName>.  It was unsought by me for
<lb/>any such purpose, but I trusted myself with him in
<lb/>a lonely place, and he acted a treacherous part.</said>
        </p>
        <p><said xml:id="q007">Amazing,</said> exclaimed the doctor, <said xml:id="q008">under the
<lb/>mask of religion too!  Well young woman it is use­
<lb/>less to mourn over what is past and cannot now be
<lb/>mended.  Your business must now be to take care
<lb/>of yourself—and there is as I conceive one straight
<lb/>forward course for you to pursue.  Such a man de­
<lb/>serves to be exposed.  It is a duty you owe not only
<lb/>to yourself but to the public to expose the man.  It
<lb/>is outrageous that such a man should continue to
<lb/>deceive the  public.  I would therefore if I were you
<lb/>boldly go forward and expose him to the world, and
<lb/>compel him by law to do me justice.  You would
<lb/>certainly be doing society a service to unmask such
<lb/>a person.</said>
</p>
        <p><said xml:id="q009">Oh I cannot, I cannot sir, indeed,</said> said the
<lb/>young woman, with a shudder.  <said xml:id="q010">I cannot consent
<lb/>to bring such disgrace and trouble upon the church,
<lb/>and upon his innocent family to<choice><sic/><corr>o</corr></choice>.  He has a worthy
<lb/>woman for a wife, and she and all his innocent chil­
<lb/>dren must be disgraced if he is exposed.</said>
</p>
        <p><said rend="pre(“)post()">Well, I know not what to advise you, young

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">23</mw>
<lb/>woman, if you are averse to this course.  There is
<lb/>but one other way to obtain redress—and that is by
<lb/>threatening him. You must at all events be provi­
<lb/>ded for before long, and the best way is in case you
<lb/>do not expose him, to threaten to do so unless he
<lb/>settles handsomely with you, and enables you to
<lb/>leave the factory until after the termination of this
<lb/>unhappy affair.</said>  To this the young woman assented,
<lb/>and saying she would call again, after writing to
<lb/>him, withdrew.
</p>
        <p>The image of this afflicted and unhappy person
<lb/>could not momently be erased from the mind of the
<lb/>doctor.  The circumstance of itself was calculated
<lb/>to interest, and the sufferer, though not very hand­
<lb/>some, was certainly a very interesting person.  It
<lb/>was not long though before she called again, and
<lb/>the subject of her second communication was cer­
<lb/>tainly not less interesting than the first.  She came
<lb/>now she said to ask advice as a friend.  She had
	  <lb/>recently received a letter from <persName>Mr. Avery</persName> requesting
	  <lb/>her to come to <placeName>Bristol</placeName> and see him there—that he
<lb/>appointed a time and place, and seemed anxious for
<lb/>the interview.  She stated also she had received
	  <lb/>another letter from <placeName>Providence</placeName>, during the four days
<lb/>meeting.
</p>
        <p>The doctor again advised her to compel <placeName>Avery</placeName> to
<lb/>a settlement, and she asked what she had better say
<lb/>to him.  He observed that she ought at least to de­
<lb/>mand three hundred dollars, and he had no doubt
	  <lb/><persName>Avery</persName> would think himself well off to come off so.
</p>
        <p><said xml:id="q011">Why,</said> said she, <said xml:id="q012">he is not able to give such a
<lb/>sum.  The Methodist ministers are poor—all poor.
<lb/>They are very illy paid for their services, and I doubt
<lb/>his power to make up such a sum, besides I should
<lb/>not dare name so much for fear he would think I

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">24</mw>
<lb/>had told some one.</said>  And she seemed to be in con­
<lb/>siderable terror at the idea that he should suspect
<lb/>he had been exposed to any one.  She then inform­
<lb/>ed the doctor that she had a short interview with
	  <lb/>him at <placeName>Fall River</placeName>, where she met him on the meet­
<lb/>ing-house steps, and walked away with him, and
<lb/>that he wished her to take a medicine which he
<lb/>recommended, in order to prevent future trouble and
<lb/>expense, and at once obliterate the effects of their
<lb/>connexion.  The doctor inquired what it was, and
<lb/>was shocked and surprized to learn it was one of
<lb/>such deadly effect that she would probably have ex­
<lb/>pired on the spot had she taken it.  The drug re­
<lb/>ferred to was the oil of tansy, one of the most violent
<lb/>things ever used, and never given except in very
<lb/>small quantities, and under the direction of a physi­
<lb/>cian.  Comprehending as he now thought a little of
<lb/>the plot, he advised her against a private interview
	  <lb/>with <persName>Avery</persName>, and begged her by no means to go to
	  <lb/><placeName>Bristol</placeName> and give him the private interview he re­
<lb/>quested, nor to take any medicine of his prescrip­
<lb/>tion, telling her the one recommended would proba­
<lb/>bly have killed her on the spot, if not, it would have
<lb/>utterly destroyed her health for ever.<anchor xml:id="a003" corresp="#n003" rend="pre(*)"/> The girl
<lb/>seemed shocked, but could not seem to believe her
<lb/>betrayer had designs on her life.  The doctor ob­
<lb/>served if she meant to do any thing of that sort she
<lb/>must apply to another physician.  She however
<lb/>avowed her determination to take nothing, but bear
<lb/>as she said, the whole shame and disgrace of it her­
<lb/>self, <said>and take care of her child as well as she was
<lb/>able.</said>  The doctor commended her in this resolu­
<lb/>tion, and told her it was his duty to come to her,
<pb n="25"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">25</mw>
<lb/>not hers to go to him, and to have him by all means
	  <lb/>come to <placeName>Fall River</placeName>, and meet him in some suitable
<lb/>place, where they could talk it over and make some
<lb/>settlement with him, that was, in case she had still
<lb/>resolved not to expose him publicly.  This she seem­
<lb/>ed resolved not to do, and spake again of the dis­
<lb/>tress such a disclosure would bring upon his family,
<lb/>and mentioned the agitation the first disclosure of
<lb/>her situation had caused him.  He protested to her
<lb/>afterwards that he passed the <said rend="slant(italic)">most wretched night
<lb/>that night he had ever done, having scarcely closed
<lb/>his eyes.</said>  Much more conversation occurred of
<lb/>the same description, accompanied by many tears,
<lb/>which the doctor observed she always shed when
<lb/>conversing on that subject; and thanking him for
<lb/>his kindness, she withdrew, leaving an impression
<lb/>of pity and admiration upon the mind of the good
<lb/>physician, that one so feelingly alive to sentiments
<lb/>of virtue and propriety should have fallen into such
<lb/>a snare.  She had, between these interviews men­
<lb/>tioned, called for medicine to take, such as her
<lb/>health required, and the doctor observed he never
<lb/>saw her without her shedding tears and betraying
<lb/>most painful feelings with respect to her situation,
<lb/>although she was calm, and seemed to have resign­
<lb/>ed herself to the event.
</p>
        <p>A few weeks only elapsed since the last visit of
	  <lb/><persName>Miss Cornell</persName>, during which the doctor often thought
<lb/>of her, and wondered how she was likely to settle
<lb/>the difficulty with her seducer as he termed him, for
<lb/>so perfectly modest and proper was her deportment
<lb/>that he could on no account harbor an opinion, but
<lb/>that she had been artfully led from the paths of vir­
<lb/>tue, by one in whom it was perfectly natural she
<lb/>should place the utmost confidence.  He looked
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">B4</mw>

<milestone unit="sig" n="B4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">26</mw>
<lb/>upon her as one of the most unfortunate of women,
<lb/>but could not despise her as he might have done in
<lb/>other circumstances.
</p>
        <p>It was on a cold frosty morning, the <date when="1832-12-21">21st <name>Decem­
<lb/>ber</name></date>, that the doctor observed some people running
<lb/>up the street, apparently in great haste;  he stood
<lb/>at the window watching when they should return,
<lb/>to know what the matter was;  but no body came
<lb/>back, while another and another party followed
<lb/>close upon the heels of the former.  The women
<lb/>appeared to be horror struck as they collected in
<lb/>groups at their doors or in the streets, and many
<lb/>leaving their families just as they were, (it was about
<lb/>breakfast time) and hastily throwing something over
	  <lb/>them pushed on in the direction of <persName>Durfee's</persName> farm.
<lb/>Presently some one came running into the doctor's,
<lb/>saying a young woman had just hung herself up at
	  <lb/><persName>Durfee's</persName>.  The doctor stopped to ask no more, but
<lb/>catching his hat, ran up to the farm, without how­
<lb/>ever having the least suspicion who it was.  Upon
<lb/>gaining a stack yard some fifty rods south of the
<lb/>house, he perceived a female lying on the ground,
<lb/>for they had taken her down.  She lay with her
<lb/>cloak, gloves and calash on, and her arms drawn
<lb/>under her cloak.
</p>
        <p><said>Does any one know her?</said>  asked one.  <said xml:id="q013">She
<lb/>is well dressed,</said> said another, <said xml:id="q014">I think she must be
<lb/>somebody respectable.</said>  <said xml:id="q015">Yes I know her,</said> said
<lb/>the Methodist minister who had arrived on the
<lb/>ground a little previous to the doctor—<said xml:id="q016">she is a re­
<lb/>spectable young woman, and a member of my
<lb/>church.</said>
</p>
        <p>Just then the physician reached the yard, and
<lb/>hastily lifting the profusion of dark locks that had
<lb/>fallen entirely over her face, he discovered with
<pb n="27"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B5r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">27</mw>
<lb/>grief and astonishment the countenance of his late
<lb/>interesting patient.  Horror struck, he endeavored to
<lb/>loosen the cord from her ne<choice><sic>e</sic><corr>c</corr></choice>k;  it was nearly half an
<lb/>inch imbedded in the flesh.  But alas!  there was
<lb/>nothing in the usual remedies to produce resusita­
<lb/>tion that would have availed any thing here, for the
<lb/>young woman appeared to have been there all night
<lb/>and was frozen stiff.  <said rend="pre()post()">And is this the end of thy sor­
<lb/>rows, poor unfortunate!</said>  thought the kind physician,
<lb/>as bending over the hapless victim of unhallowed
<lb/>passion.  He gazed upon that altered countenance
<lb/>—altered it was indeed—it was livid pale,—her
<lb/>tongue protruded through her teeth—pushed out
<lb/>her under lip, that was very much swollen as though
<lb/>it had received some hard blow, or been severely
<lb/>bit in anguish, gave a dreadful expression of ag­
<lb/>ony, while a deep indentation on the cheek looked
<lb/>as though that too must have been pressed by some
<lb/>hard substance;  but whatever he thought at that
<lb/>time respecting the means by which she came to her
<lb/>death, he wisely forbore to utter it, and the jury of
<lb/>inquest was summoned in immediately.<anchor xml:id="a004" corresp="#n004" rend="pre(*)"/> In the
<lb/>mean time the respectable farmer in whose prem­
<lb/>ises the deceased was found, after having her care­
<lb/>fully conveyed to the house, inquired of the Metho­
<lb/>dist minister if she had any friends in the place, and
<lb/>if not whether the society of which he said she was
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">B5</mw>

<milestone unit="sig" n="B5v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">28</mw>
<lb/>a respectable member would not see to the expense
<lb/>of her funeral.  That person replied that he did not
<lb/>exactly know their rules in such cases, but he would
<lb/>go and consult them and return soon and inform
<lb/>them.  Meanwhile the truth struggled hard in the
<lb/>breast of the doctor.  He had felt himself bound to
<lb/>secrecy in case the girl had lived, respecting the
<lb/>name of her betrayer, but her death and the awful
<lb/>manner of it impelled him to reveal what he believ­
<lb/>ed to be the cause.  He felt that death had taken
<lb/>off the injunction of secrecy;  and stepping after the
<lb/>clergyman, he related the confession of the unhap­
<lb/>py girl to him, and what she had said respecting
	  <lb/>his brother <persName>Avery</persName>.  In what language he expressed
<lb/>himself, or whether he gave way to the feelings of
<lb/>indignation which the knowledge of such a trans­
<lb/>action was calculated to awaken, is not known, but
<lb/>the reverend listener was at once roused to defend
<lb/>him, and express his full belief that his brother was
<lb/>perfectly innocent, and finally asserted <said>that the
<lb/>deceased was a very bad character, and that Avery
<lb/>had told him so, and warned him against her, and
<lb/>that she was not in full communion with the meet­
<lb/>ing but only received upon probation.</said>  Very short­
	  <lb/>ly he returned to the house of <persName>Mr. Durfee</persName>, and said
<lb/>that <said>the deceased was a bad character and the
<lb/>meeting would have nothing to do with burying
<lb/>her.</said>
</p>
        <p>Of course <persName>Mr. Durfee's</persName> astonishment was very
<lb/>great, having just before heard the Rev. gentleman
<lb/>say <said>she was a respectable woman and a member of
<lb/>their society.</said>  But nothing influenced the honest
<lb/>and benevolent farmer to omit his own duty, and de­
<lb/>ny the right of burial to the poor unhappy girl
<lb/>whose remains Providence seemed in a peculiar
<lb/>manner to have confided to his care.</p>
        <pb n="29"/>
        <milestone unit="sig" n="B6r"/>
        <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">29</mw>
        <p><said xml:id="q017">She shall have a burial place in my grounds,</said><lb/>said he, <said xml:id="q018">near my family, and as respectable a fune­
<lb/>ral as any body, and as respectable a clergyman as
<lb/>any other to make the prayer, and every thing that
<lb/>is necessary and decent shall be attended to.</said>  And
<lb/>without any fear of contamination, from the neigh­
<lb/>borhood of one whom the clergyman chose to de­
<lb/>nominate a vile character, he gave orders to have a
<lb/>grave prepared for her near his own family.
</p>
        <p>In the mean time a hasty and irregular jury had
<lb/>been selected and sitting upon the question, and af­
<lb/>ter a very superficial observation, and no examina­
<lb/>tion whatever of her person, brought in a verdict of
<lb/><said>suicide.</said>  The corpse was then delivered into the
<lb/>hands of five or six of some of the most respectable
<lb/>matrons of the village who had volunteered to per­
<lb/>form this office of benevolence towards the hapless
<lb/>stranger.
</p>
        <p>They commenced this work with mournful re­
<lb/>flections upon the subject of self-murder, and some
<lb/>expressions of pity towards her whose hard fortune
<lb/>some way or other must have driven her to so rash
<lb/>and daring an act, for that she died otherwise than
<lb/>by her own hand never entered the heads of either
<lb/>of the good women.  But what was their astonish­
<lb/>ment when stripping the body for the purpose of ar­
<lb/>raying it for the grave they discovered marks of vio­
<lb/>lence about her person.  <said xml:id="q019">Oh,</said> said one of the oldest
<lb/>of the ladies who they called aunt Hannah, <said xml:id="q020">what has
<lb/>been done?</said>  <choice><sic>t</sic><corr>T</corr></choice>he person adressed answered <said>rash
<lb/>violence.</said>  Just above each hip were marks of hands,
<lb/>the bruises of which were very bad, so that the spots
<lb/>of the thumb inwards, and the fingers outside were
<lb/>distinctly visible, they were those of a large hand,
<lb/>for one or two of the women applyed theirs and they
<pb n="30"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B6v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">30</mw>
<lb/>were not large enough to cover the marks:  one only,
	  <lb/>the person they called aunt <persName>Hannah</persName>, found her hand
<lb/>to fit:  there were bad bruises on the back, and the
<lb/>knees scratched and stained with grass as though
<lb/>they had been on the ground during some struggle:
<lb/>spots below the knee where the skin was rubbed off
<lb/>and bad bruises on the back;  the right arm was bent
<lb/>up and the hand turned back, and it was with much
<lb/>difficulty the females could bring it down, after fo­
<lb/>menting it for some time with warm water, and
<lb/>when they succeeded in bending it down it snapt so
<lb/>that they thought it must have been broken:  appear­
<lb/>ance of a blow on the under lip, which was much
<lb/>swollen, and the tongue projected out a little.  Still
<lb/>those women said but little, except a few whispers
<lb/>among themselves:  in fact the time was too short for
<lb/>much talking.  The body was not laid out until past
<lb/>noon on the day she was found, and she was buried
<lb/>at one o'clock on the next day.  One most startling
<lb/>circumstance however occured to arouse the atten­
<lb/>tion and petrify the blood of the spectators.
</p>
        <p><persName>Mr. Durfee</persName>, the farmer who found the deceaced,
<lb/>took his wagon (shortly after the verdict of the jury
<lb/>of inquest) and proceeded to the house where she
<lb/>had boarded, after her things, the object of this was
<lb/>to find something suitable for grave cloths, and if
<lb/>possible to ascertain by some letters or something
<lb/>of that kind where the friends of this poor girl, if she
<lb/>had any, were to be found.  He found a trunk, lock­
<lb/>ed, and a bandbox of clothes, &amp;c. which he took,
<lb/>and returned about noon.  The key of the trunk
<lb/>was found in the pocket of the deceased, in pres­
<lb/>ence of a number of persons.  The trunk was ex­
<lb/>amined, and four letters found in the bottom of it.
	  <lb/>One was addressed to the <persName>Rev. Mr. Bidwell</persName> of <placeName>Fall

<lb/>River</placeName>, her minister, written by herself.  The other
<lb/>three were anonymous, but directed on the outside
	  <lb/>to <persName>Sarah M. Connell</persName>, <placeName>Fall River</placeName>.  Near the middle
<lb/>of the bandbox lay a small piece of soiled paper and
	  <lb/>a lead pencil.  <persName>Mr. Durfee</persName> did not open the little
<lb/>piece of paper or think of its being of any conse­
<lb/>quence whatever.  Two of the women, on rumma­
<lb/>ging the bandbox late in the afternoon, in hope by
<lb/>some means to discover where to direct a letter to
<lb/>her friends, chanced to observe this very piece of
<lb/>paper, which, though very small, soiled, and looking
<lb/>like waste paper, they unfolded and read.  It con­
<lb/>tained these words—<quote rend="pre(“)post()"><floatingText xml:id="TR00220-01"><body><p>If I am missing enquire of

</p>
        <p>There were a great many persons in the house,
<lb/>and constantly going and coming, and although the
<lb/>women talked much about it and shew it to others
<lb/>in the house, one of whom was the wife of the congre­
<lb/>gational clergyman, invited to make the prayer, yet
<lb/>it was not seen by the master of the house until next
<lb/>morning.  His thoughts upon reading it may easily
<lb/>be discerned.  The hour of the funeral however
<lb/>drew near and active duties prevented much time
<lb/>from being spent in debate.  The resolution howev­
	  <lb/>er of <persName>Mr. Durfee</persName> and some others to have the mat­
<lb/>ter investigated, seemed to have been taken.  A
<lb/>crow<choice><sic>n</sic><corr>d</corr></choice> gathered early to the house, and solemn and
<lb/>appropriate prayer was made by the congregational
	  <lb/>minister, the <persName>Rev. Mr. Fowler</persName>, and, followed by a
<lb/>numerous procession, the remains of the unfortu­
<lb/>nate and mysterious stranger were conveyed to the
<lb/>grave.  Providence however had determined that
<lb/>though consigned to the grave it should not be to
<lb/>present repose.  A storm was gathering which was
<lb/>destined not only to call forth the dead from her

<lb/>grave, but to shake the society to which she belong­
<lb/>ed to its centre—a storm whose effects have contin­
<lb/>ued to be felt ever since—a contention which has
<lb/>embittered many former friends against each other,
<lb/>created many heart-burnings, assailed the peace of
<lb/>families, hindered the christian missionary in the
<lb/>exercise of his pious duties, caused the name of
<lb/>Christ to be blasphemed, and in some places almost
<lb/>depopulated churches.</p>

        <p>Although consigned to her grave, the image of

	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Durfee</persName>, and he arose on the following day de­
<lb/>termined to investigate the dark mystery which
<lb/>hung over her fate.  A circumstance occurred on
<lb/>this morning to materially increase the evidence of
<lb/>the murder of the young woman.  A man in the
	  <lb/>neighborhood, (<persName>Thomas Hart</persName>,) while walking near
<lb/>the scene of the sad catastrophe, found about thirty
<lb/>rods from the place, in the direction towards Fall
<lb/>River, a piece of a comb, which upon being shewn
<lb/>to the woman where the deceased boarded, was
<lb/>identified as hers.  It was also known by the jew­
<lb/>eller who had mended it for her a short time before,
<lb/>by the rivetting, which was peculiar.  This piece of
<lb/>comb, evidently broken in a struggle, was carried
	  <lb/>by <persName>Mr. Hart</persName> to <persName>Mr. Durfee</persName>.  That gentleman took

<lb/>day, and called a new jury.  Three of the principal
<lb/>physicians and surgeons of the place examined the
<lb/>person of the deceased, that is the external bruises,
<lb/>and ascertained she had told no falsehood with re­
<lb/>spect to her situation.  From the state of the lungs
<lb/>it appeared she died of suffocation, and from the
<lb/>mark of the rope around her neck, that she could
<lb/>not have died by hanging, but by the drawing of the
<lb/>cord, which had been drawn so tight as to strangle,
<lb/>and must have been so before suspension from the
<lb/>stake, as the knot they all deposed was not a slip
<lb/>knot, but what is called a clove hitch, and could
<lb/>not have been drawn but by pulling the two ends
<lb/>separately.  Various other circumstances now for
<lb/>the first time detailed, were related, such as the de­
<lb/>ceased being found with her cloak hooked down be­
<lb/>fore and her hands under it, her knees within four
<lb/>inches of the ground, and her clothes smooth under
<lb/>them, and moreover as it was known that when the
<lb/>neck is not broken by hanging, and hers was not,
<lb/>there is a great struggle in death, and there was not
<lb/>on the ground beneath the least signs of any.  On
<lb/>the contrary, her feet were quite close together, her
<lb/>clothes standing off from her behind as far as they
<lb/>would reach, and smooth under her.  And lastly,
<lb/>and most extraordinary of all, her gloves on her
<pb n="35"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B9r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">35</mw>
<lb/>hands, without any marks of a rope or any thing of
<lb/>the kind upon them, although the rope must have
<lb/>been drawn with great strength by two hands be­
<lb/>fore it was tied to the stake.
</p>
        <p>With all these proofs before them it was not sur­
<lb/>prising their verdict should be <said>murder.</said>  It was
	  <lb/>true suspicion pointed at <persName>Avery</persName> before, but the sup­
<lb/>posed sanctity of his character shut the mouths of
<lb/>many who but for that and his profession would
<lb/>have been ready to exclaim <said>thou art the man.</said>
</p>
        <p>Although <persName>Mr. Durfee</persName> and others were thus alone
<lb/>in acting, it must not be supposed that circumstances
<lb/>of the nature just described could be concealed.
	  <lb/>They were not: and the inhabitants of <placeName>Fall River</placeName>
	  <lb/>on the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> side (where they do busines
	  <lb/>off hand, and not quite so clumsily as in <placeName>Rhode-Is­
<lb/>land</placeName>) having heard from the first the circumstances
<lb/>of suspicion that had been developed, became very
<lb/>much amazed at the slowness of enquiry respecting
<lb/>such a horrible transaction;  and feeling themselves
<lb/>rather scandalized, as a place, although the matter
<lb/>did not come under their immediate cognizance, at
<lb/>length began to take active measures in relation to
	  <lb/>it.  All day <name>Sunday</name> there was a sort of half stifled
<lb/>hum heard through the village.  The bells as usual
<lb/>called people to public worship, but not as usual was
<lb/>the solemnity of it regarded by the great mass of the
<lb/>people.  Many, to be sure, went to meeting;  but
<lb/>many did not appear to hear after they got there.
<lb/>Some thought ministers were such wicked creatures,
<lb/>they did not want to hear them;  and some too just
<lb/>to condemn all, for the sins of one, endeavoured to
<lb/>listen with reverence, while their thoughts, in spite
<lb/>of themselves, would wander after him, who in their
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">B9</mw>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">36</mw>
<lb/>mind was guilty of this foul deed, and at this very
<lb/>time calling <emph rend="slant(italic)">sinners</emph> to repentance.
</p>
        <p>Oh you!  upon whom the authorities of the church,
<lb/>and the partiality of man, have conferred the envied
<lb/>distinction of speaking in your Master's cause, of
<lb/>being ambassadors for the greatest and highest of
<lb/>potentates, how great is your responsibility!  a stain
<lb/>upon that spotless garment who shall wash away?  If
<lb/>you are defiled by abominations, the destruction of
<lb/>your own souls is the least evil of which you are the
<lb/>cause.
</p>
        <p>All day, little knots of citizens were seen gather­
<lb/>ing at the corners of the streets, and even at the
<lb/>meeting-house doors, discussing the subject of the
<lb/>murder, though in an under tone of voice.  Upon
<lb/>separating, they were invariably observed to shake
<lb/>their heads and walk away sorrowful.  No active
<lb/>measures were, however, taken until <choice><sic>morni<g ref="#invertedn"/>g</sic><corr>morning</corr></choice>;  when
<lb/>a few citizens met in the street, and agreed upon
	  <lb/>having a meeting at the <placeName>Lyceum Hall</placeName>.  A boy was
<lb/>sent about the streets with a bell, to notify the peo­
<lb/>ple to assemble, and very soon after the hall was fill­
<lb/>ed to overflowing.  Upon motion, a committee, con­
<lb/>sisting of five gentlemen, some of the most respecta­
<lb/>ble persons in the place, was appointed;  who were
<lb/>directed to <said>meet the Coroner and jury of inquest,
<lb/>who, it was understood, were that morning to be in
<lb/>session, and disinter the body for further examina­
<lb/>tion;  and if, upon examination, they should believe
<lb/>a murder had been committed, and upon having the
<lb/>evidence that some person was implicated in the
<lb/>murder, they should proceed to aid and assist the
	    <lb/>authorities of <placeName>Rhode-Island</placeName> in having the subject
<lb/>properly investigated, and in prosecuting it to a final
<lb/>issue.</said>
<pb n="37"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B10r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">37</mw>
</p>
        <p>At this meeting too, another and larger committee
<lb/>was appointed to collect and report to the first
<lb/>named committee, <said>any evidence or circumstance
<lb/>that might come to their knowledge, having a bear­
<lb/>ing upon the case.</said>  It was resolved that the truth
<lb/>should, if possible, be elicited in this search;  and
<lb/>that they should report every thing of a favourable
<lb/>nature respecting the accused, as well as that which
<lb/>should appear unfavourable.  Another meeting was
<lb/>subsequently held to make provisions for defraying
<lb/>the expenses of this committee.
</p>
        <p>It is said by the friends of <persName>Avery</persName> often, that he
<lb/>gave a manifest proof of his innocence in remaining
<lb/>in Bristol till the warrant came, and not fleeing or
<lb/>shewing any difference in his manners.  The fact
<lb/>was, that he did not know anything was suspected
<lb/>of him, except his being the seducer of the girl.
	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Bidwell</persName>, to whom <persName>Doct. Wilbour</persName> had, as before
<lb/>mentioned, related the conversations of the deceased,
	  <lb/>had proceeded immediately to <placeName>Bristol</placeName> and commu­
	  <lb/>nicated with <persName>Avery</persName>, and had stated to him he was
<lb/>suspected of being the betrayer of the hapless girl.
	  <lb/>Avery and his friends got <persName>Mr. Bartlett</persName>, the stage
	  <lb/>driver, and a <name>Methodist</name> by profession, to go to <placeName>Fall
<lb/>River</placeName> and see how matters stood.  In the mean
	  <lb/>time, <persName>Avery</persName> kept his house, walking it, as was said,
<lb/>in a state of very great agitation.  He did no preach­
	  <lb/>ing that day.  <persName>Bartlett</persName> proceeded to <placeName>Fall River</placeName>, and
	  <lb/>went in search of <persName>Doct. Wilbour</persName>, who was from
<lb/>home, visiting a patient.  He followed him, and
<lb/>met him returning not far from his house, which
<lb/>they entered together.  Upon going into the house,
	  <lb/>the Doctor perceived <persName>J. Durfee</persName> and another man
	  <lb/>from <placeName>Tiverton</placeName> waiting for him.  Aiding <persName>Bartlett</persName> in­
<lb/>to the parlour, he went out to see them.  They in­
<pb n="38"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B10v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">38</mw>
<lb/>formed the Doctor that the warrant they had got
<lb/>was informal, and that it had been decided to ap­
	  <lb/>prehend <persName>Avery</persName>;  and they requested him to go over
<lb/>the line and complain of him.  This the Doctor re­
<lb/>fused to do, because he thought it was not his busi­
<lb/>ness;  <said xml:id="q021">but,</said> observed he, <said xml:id="q022">if he is not apprehend­
	    <lb/>ed soon, he will be off.  Here is <persName>Bartlett</persName> in the
<lb/>other room now, come to see how the business stands;
<lb/>and he will not get out of the place without finding
<lb/>out he is suspected of the murder.</said>  One of the gen­
<lb/>tlemen then proposed they should proceed immedi­
	  <lb/>ately to <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, and have him put under arrest un­
<lb/>til the succeeding day, when a proper warrant could
	  <lb/>be procured;  and begging the Doctor to keep <persName>Bart­
<lb/>lett</persName> as long as possible, they departed, and in a few
	  <lb/>moments were on the way to <placeName>Bristol</placeName>.  In the mean
<lb/>time, the Doctor apologized for delaying conversa­
<lb/>tion until he had dined, after which he recounted
<lb/>the particulars of his conversation with the deceased
<lb/>to his interrogator, and concluded with the question,
<lb/><said>and do you know that he is suspected of the mur­
<lb/>der too?</said>  Amazed, the messenger answerd, <said>no:</said>
<lb/>upon which the Doctor assured him of the fact.  Of
<lb/>course, he did not wait long after this, but hastened
<lb/>to convey the alarming intelligence to his employer.
	  <lb/>However, long before his arrival at <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, his friend
<lb/>and brother was under arrest.
</p>
        <p>It seems scarcely possible <persName>Avery</persName> could have re­
<lb/>frained from preaching on that day merely from del­
<lb/>icacy, because he had heard it was suspected he
<lb/>was the betrayer of the deceased girl, when he thus
	  <lb/>perseveres in it at the present day.  However, <persName>Bart­
<lb/>lett</persName> stated he was then very much disturbed and
<lb/>distressed in mind indeed, and that <said>he did not
<lb/>know when he had been kept from the house of
<lb/>God before.</said></p>

        <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">39</mw>
        <p>Nothing was done hastily;  the jury of inquest
<lb/>were very slow in their operations;  and it was not
	  <lb/>until several days after the murder that <persName>Avery</persName> was
<lb/>arrested;  and he probably might have escaped even
<lb/>that, had not new circumstances continually come
<lb/>up calculated to strengthen former suspicions.  For
<lb/>instance, the other piece of the broken comb was
	  <lb/>found on the same back route to <placeName>Fall River</placeName>;  fitted
<lb/>the first piece with which she was buried, and both
<lb/>were sworn to and identified as hers by the person
<lb/>who mended it and the people where she boarded,
<lb/>who, with the persons who worked next to her in the
<lb/>factory, deposed that she went out about six in the
<lb/>evening with it whole;  changed her dress for one
<lb/>better;  went in good spirits;  and was exceedingly
<lb/>anxious to get leave to go out at the hour of six:  had
<lb/>spoken of an appointment several days before to the
<lb/>daughter of the lady where she boarded;  said she
<lb/><said>did not care how many days it rained, if it was on­
	    <lb/>ly fair on that day,</said> <date when="1832-12-20">20th of <placeName>December</placeName></date>;  shewed the
<lb/>pink and yellow letter which were afterwards found
<lb/>in her trunk to this young lady, who identified them;
<lb/>the white one also, with which she returned from
	  <lb/>the Post Office, on the <date when="1832-12-08">8th of <name>December</name></date>.  The lady
<lb/>did not read the inside, but looked at the post marks
<lb/>and hand writing and was able to testify to them.
</p>
        <p>Those letters corroborated the statement made
	  <lb/>by <persName>Doct. Wilbour</persName>.  The first of these letters, writ­
	  <lb/>ten on yellow paper, was dated, <date when="1832-11-13"><name>Nov</name>. 13th 1832</date>, and
<lb/>was as follows.

        <p>They observed that he says, <said>I have just received
<lb/>yours;</said> and upon examining at the Post Office,
	  <lb/><placeName>Fall River</placeName>, it was found there was one letter mailed
	  <lb/>for <placeName>Bristol</placeName> on the day preceding that addressed to
	  <lb/><persName>S. M. Cornell</persName>, viz. on the <date when="1832-11-12">12th</date>.  But who it was
<lb/>for had escaped their recollection, if they observed
<lb/>at the time.  Again, there was a letter on pink pa­
	  <lb/>per, addressed to the deceased, which a <persName>Mr. Orswell</persName>,
	  <lb/>the engineer of the <name>King Philip</name>, (a steamboat ply­
	  <lb/>ing between <placeName>Fall River</placeName> and <placeName>Providence</placeName>) deposed was
	  <lb/>given him by <persName>Avery</persName>, in person, to deliver to <persName>Sarah
	    <lb/>Maria Cornell</persName>, near the last of <name>November</name>, while the
	  <lb/>four days meeting was holding among the <name>Metho­
	    <lb/>dists</name> at <placeName>Providence</placeName>.  This letter too appeared to be
<lb/>in answer to one written not long before;  and on
	  <lb/>the <date when="1832-11-19">19th of <name>November</name></date> the Post Master recollected
<lb/>that on that day, while making up the mail, he
<lb/>heard something drop into the letter box after he had
<lb/>cleared it;  and upon looking, saw two letters, one
	  <lb/>for <placeName>Bristol</placeName> and one directed to <persName>Mr. Rawson</persName>, brother
	  <lb/>in law of the deceased, <placeName>South Woodstock</placeName>.  This let­
	  <lb/>ter was afterwards produced by <persName>Mr. Rawson</persName>.  His
	  <lb/>impression was, the other was directed to <persName>Avery</persName>;
	  <lb/>remembered distinctly it was for <placeName>Bristol</placeName>:  and as it
<lb/>was ascertained he was correct about the first name,
<lb/>the committee could have no doubt about the other.

        <p>But so extremely cautious were they to go upon
	  <lb/>facts, that they delayed their proceedings until <persName>Ors­

        <p>With respect to this last, final, and fatal letter,
	  <lb/>upon examination, it was ascertained that <persName>Avery</persName>
	  <lb/>had been at <placeName>Fall River</placeName> on that very day;  had been
<lb/>heard asking for paper in a store kept by a member
<lb/>of the Methodist meeting;  and that that man went
<lb/><choice><sic>i<g ref="#invertedn"/>to</sic><corr>into</corr></choice> the next store to get a wafer for him:  could not
<lb/>recollect whether he wrote in the store, but remem­
<lb/>bered hearing him talk about writing to the editor
<lb/>of a paper in the village, (whom, upon enquiry, he
<lb/>did not write to.)  From thence he went in the di­
<lb/>rection of the Post Office, and the deputy post mas­
<lb/>ter recollected, a few moments before the stage start­
	  <lb/>ed for <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, in which he went, hearing a letter
	  <lb/>drop:  and looking at the moment saw <persName>Avery</persName> just
<lb/>withdrawing his hand from the box.  He then look­
<lb/>ed, and took out the one cent letter addressed to
	  <lb/><persName>S. M. Cornell</persName>, when the wafer was wet.  That wa­
<lb/>fer was recollected as the one supplied by the lady
<lb/>next door to the store where the paper was supposed
<lb/>to be procured—remembered from its peculiar col­
<lb/>our.
</p>
        <p><lb/>The first letter, the yellow one, was post marked
<pb/><milestone unit="sig" n="B13r"/><mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">43</mw><lb/>at <placeName>Warren</placeName>;  and on that day it was ascertained the
<lb/>accused had been there.
</p>
        <p>The other letter was written by <persName>Sarah Maria</persName>
	  <lb/>herself, and directed to her minister, <persName>Mr. Bidwell</persName>.
<lb/>It expressed much compunction for her sins, con­
<lb/>fessed herself unworthy of a place in the meeting,
<lb/>and requested to be set aside as unworthy, &amp;c.
</p>
        <p>With all these concurring circumstances before
<lb/>them, it is most evident the committee could
<lb/>not, in conscience, take any other course than
<lb/>the one they did take.  Now previous to the
<lb/>arrest, when the suspicions of the murder were
	  <lb/>first excited at <placeName>Fall River</placeName>, his friends (<persName>Avery's</persName>)
	  <lb/>consoled themselves with the assurance that <persName>Avery</persName>
<lb/>would be able to prove where he was at the time of
<lb/>the murder;  and it being a very cold blustering day
<lb/>until towards night, they had little doubt it would
<lb/>be found he was at his own house.  What then was
<lb/>their consternation to find, upon enquiry, that he
	  <lb/>had actually crossed the ferry, at <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, on the af­
<lb/>ternoon of that very day, and after being absent on
<lb/>the island until a very late hour in the evening had
<lb/>gone back to the ferry-house requesting to be set
	  <lb/>over, which <persName>Mr. Gifford</persName>, the ferryman, declined do­
<lb/>ing on account of the lateness of the hour and tedi­
<lb/>ousness of the weather.  There had been a rough
<lb/>wind for most part of the day, and generally in that
<lb/>place there is a considerable swell for some time af­
<lb/>ter.
</p>
        <p>Still the friends of <persName>Mr. Avery</persName> kept up a good
<lb/>courage, for they felt morally certain that being in
<lb/>a methodist neighbourhood near so many friends and
<lb/>acquaintance he could easily be recognized, and
<lb/>would undoubtedly bring proof of where he was.
	  <lb/>But when after the examination at <placeName>Brist<choice><sic>a</sic><corr>o</corr></choice>l</placeName>, it was
<pb n="44"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">44</mw>
<lb/>found that he could not bring a single individual
<lb/>who even thought they saw him on the rout he de­
<lb/>scribed himself to have taken, many who had trust
<lb/>in him before fell off.  He observed he had been on
<lb/>a walk of pleasure and observation, walking about
	  <lb/>the Island towards the coal mines, near the <placeName>Union
<lb/>Meeting-house</placeName>, &amp;c. &amp;c. past brother such a one and
<lb/>sister 'tother one, crossed a brook, went through a
<lb/>white gate, saw a <said>man with a gun, and a boy with
<lb/>some sheep,</said> and finally wandered back to the fer­
	  <lb/>ry somewhere about ten o'clock, of a cold <name>Decem­
<lb/>ber</name> night, without any supper or appearing to think
<lb/>of any?  (though travelling ministers are not apt to
<lb/>forget such accommodations.)  No man with a gun, or
<lb/>boy with sheep, could be heard of in that part of the
<lb/>country from any body but himself, and no one saw
<lb/>him, through all that route:  nevertheless the justices
	  <lb/>appointed to examine him at <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, after what they
<lb/>declared to be a <said>patient, laborious, and impartial
<lb/>examination of the subject,</said> discharged him.  The
	  <lb/>county of <placeName>Newport</placeName> claimed him as their prisoner in
<lb/>the first place, and it was not a legal examination,
<lb/>because the offence alleged against him was perpe­
<lb/>trated in that county.  But his friends were deter­
<lb/>mined to have his examination there, and they had
<lb/>it.  By this illegal and ill judged proceeding the State
<lb/>was put to the expense of another examination, be­
<lb/>sides some much more heavy ones.  The inhabitants
	  <lb/>of <placeName>Fall River</placeName> called another meeting and entered
	  <lb/>complaint to a magistrate in the county of <placeName>Newport</placeName>.
<lb/>A warrant was issued and a sheriff sent once more
<lb/>to take him.</p>

        <p>Upon arriving at <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, the sheriff found the
<lb/>prisoner had fled.  Thirteen days had been spent
<lb/>in his examination, during which time he appeared
<lb/>so firm and unmoved for the most part that it was
<lb/>thought there was no danger of his decamping.  He
<lb/>had fled however, and left his character to take care
<lb/>of itself.  Those who believed him innocent, had
<lb/>thought he would court a trial in order to free him­
<lb/>self from the odium attached to him, which unless
<lb/>wiped off they knew must forever destroy his useful­
<lb/>ness as a min<choice><sic>e</sic><corr>i</corr></choice>ster of the gospel; but when they
<lb/>found he had decamped and left his friends and par­
<lb/>tizans to fight it out in the best manner they were
<lb/>able, they were confounded, but for the most part
<lb/>wise enough to keep still;  and had he never been
<lb/>found, as most people believed he never would, it is
<lb/>probable the point would have been conceded.  But
	  <lb/>he was gone:  and <persName>Col. Harnden</persName>, the person who
<lb/>went in persuit of him, was almost at a loss to know
<lb/>what to do.  There seemed no trace of him to be
<lb/>discovered.  But although the person of the accused
<lb/>appeared to be beyond their reach, his character
<lb/>was not;  and this flight, disgraceful and unmanly
<lb/>as it was, put the finishing seal to it.
</p>
        <p>Matters seemed so well arranged with respect to
<lb/>the reverend fugitive, that it would have puzzled
<lb/>wise heads to have known which way to look for him.
<lb/>But the indefatigable Col. Harnden was not to be
<lb/>daunted or disheartened in the cause he had under­
<lb/>taken.  He had been one of the committee appoint­
<pb n="46"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B14v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">46</mw>
<lb/>ed to examine into this affair by the inhabitants of
	  <lb/><placeName>Fall River</placeName>, and had satisfied himself that the accu­
<lb/>sed ought at whatever cost to be brought to trial.
<lb/>He therefore commenced a most laborious and ar­
<lb/>duous search, and after traversing hundreds of miles
<lb/>backwards and forwards, in three States, having as
<lb/>he believed got on a track of him, he finally suc­
<lb/>ceeded in his search, finding him in a remote neigh­
	  <lb/>bourhood in <placeName>New-Hampshire</placeName>, at the house of a <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Mayo</persName>.  He was indebted at last to the sagacity of
	  <lb/>a baker's boy, who related a story of <persName>Mrs. Mayo</persName>
<lb/>being accused of some misdemeanor in the meeting,
	  <lb/>and <persName>Avery</persName> being sent for to plead her off, which he
<lb/>succeeded in doing, and saved her from the cen­
<lb/>sures of the meeting—an evil of no ordinary char­
<lb/>acter, if we may judge from the manner of handling
<lb/>the character of the deceased—and the lad think­
<lb/>ing according to the old saying that one good turn
<lb/>deserved another, thought it must be he was con­
<lb/>cealed at that house.  Upon arriving at the house,
	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Mayo</persName> denied his being there, but observing his
	  <lb/>wife glide out of the room, <persName>Mr. Harnden</persName> followed
	  <lb/>her, and found <persName>Avery</persName> hid, pale and trembling be­
<lb/>hind the door of a chamber, evidently fitted up for
<lb/>his concealment, having the windows completely
<lb/>darkened, with lights and fire wood laid in, and all
<lb/>the comforts of life in abundance bore witness to
<lb/>the gratitude of her who held him in such gen­
<lb/>tle durance:  pity that such comfortable quarters
<lb/>should have been disturbed by the intrusion of such
	  <lb/>unwelcome guests.  <persName>Mr. Harnden</persName> returned with
	  <lb/>him through <placeName>Boston</placeName>, where, as in several other
<lb/>places, he, like other great characters, received the
	  <lb/>calls of his friends, the <name>Methodists</name>:  Divines and all
<lb/>flocking to pay their respects—giving him the right
<pb n="47"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">47</mw>
<lb/>hand of fellowship, &amp;c. and having several <said>com­
<lb/>fortable seasons of prayer,</said><anchor xml:id="a006" corresp="#n006" rend="pre(*)"/> &amp;c. with a man then
<lb/>laboring under the strongest presumption of being
<lb/>both an adulterer and murderer—of a man caught
<lb/>in the very act of hiding himself from the ministers
<lb/>of justice.  <said>O tempora!  O mores!</said>
</p>
        <p>The authorities of the county of <placeName>Newport</placeName>, after
<lb/>examination, bound him for trial and he was indicted
	  <lb/>for murder by the grand jury, and the first <name>Monday</name>
	  <lb/>in <name>May</name> assigned for his trial.  The interval between
	  <lb/>the <name>March</name> term of the Supreme Judicial Court for
	  <lb/>the county of <placeName>Newport</placeName>, and the first <name>Monday</name> in <name>May</name>,
<lb/>was a busy one;  scouts were out in all directions,
<lb/>and oh the racing and chasing there was to look up
<lb/>witnesses.  Turnpike corporations and tavern keep­
<lb/>ers reaped a golden harvest during those two months.
<lb/>There was scarcely a factory village within a hun­
<lb/>dred and fifty miles but what underwent a thorough
<lb/>examination.  The deceased it appeared, had been
<lb/>a moving planet, which she accounted for in one of
<lb/>her letters to her friends, by saying, <said>she belonged
<lb/>to a people who did not believe in staying long in
<lb/>a place.</said>  She seemed to have adopted for her mot­
<lb/>to, the text, that <said>here we have no continuing city;</said>
<lb/>and she adhered to it in the spirit and the letter.
<lb/>Poor unfortunate being! she did not realize the
<lb/>danger of changing neighborhoods so often, nor
<lb/>know that it was safest for people to stay where they
<lb/>are best<choice><sic/><corr>␣</corr></choice>known, and where slanderers make out to
<lb/>live upon one old story for a thousand years, but tran­
<lb/>sport it into a new neighborhood and ten thousand
<lb/>will immediately be added to it.  She probably had
<pb n="48"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B15v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">48</mw>
<lb/>never read that admirable fable of the Fox, who was
<lb/>advised to remove on account of the swarm of flies
<lb/>who beset him, and who wisely chose to remain
<lb/>where they might after a time get gorged with his
<lb/>blood, rather than to encounter a fresh and hungry
<lb/>set, when he should be robbed of every remaining
<lb/>drop of it.
</p>
        <p>In the mean time public indignation could not
<lb/>wait with patience for the issue of the trial, and
<lb/>from time to time it would speak out through the
<lb/>medium of the papers.  This the methodists termed
<lb/><said>persecution,</said> whatever it was it is certain that
<lb/>much of it was provoked by their own imprudence
<lb/>in continually and loudly asserting his innocence,
<lb/>and the violence with which they endeavored to
<lb/>bear down public opinion, as well as their ridiculous
<lb/>fidgetting about the safety of his person, and his
<lb/>personal accommodation, through all the stages of
	  <lb/>his travels.  Had <persName>Avery</persName> constituted solely in his per­
<lb/>son the palladium of their rights, they could not
<lb/>have guarded him with more jealous care.  They
<lb/>pretended to discover in the natural curiosity of
<lb/>the populace to see one who had become the lion of
<lb/>the day, a conspiracy to mob him;  and at once took
<lb/>the responsibility of his flight upon their own shoul­
<lb/>ders, averring it to have originated in their fears for
<lb/>his person, and expressing terrible apprehension lest
	  <lb/>the <placeName>Fall River</placeName> folks should take justice into their
<lb/>own hands instead of waiting for the slow remedy
<lb/>of the law.  The disgrace of flying from the per­
<lb/>suit of justice, they affirmed belonged to them, hav­
<lb/>ing as they said persuaded him off and conveyed
<lb/>him to a secret place, against his own judgment.
<lb/>This last assertion may well be believed, viz. that
<lb/><said>it was against his own judgment;</said>  as that, if he
<pb n="49"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B16r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">49</mw>
<lb/>had any, must have told him that his flight, under
<lb/>such circumstances, amounted to a strong presump­
<lb/>tion, if not to a confession of guilt.  That he had
<lb/>fears cannot be doubted:  he might have been in
	  <lb/>the situation of <persName>Trumbull's</persName> hero,
<quote rend="indent(3)"><lg type="poem" subtype="indeterminate"><lg type="indeterminate"><l>Who found his fear of tar and ropes,</l><l>by many a drachm outweigh his hopes.</l></lg></lg></quote>
</p>
        <p>Their fears however of the vengeance of the
	  <lb/><said><placeName>Fall River</placeName> folks</said> were entirely without foundation,
<lb/>since nothing was intended but to bring the accused
<lb/>to a fair trial, and if his friends knew of such re­
<lb/>sources as they boasted of, they ought to have been
	  <lb/>the last to be afraid of that.  But the important <date when="1833-05-06">sixth
<lb/>of May</date> arrived, and headed by an army of preach­
<lb/>ers, stout muscular men as ev<choice><sic>o</sic><corr>e</corr></choice>r took the field, fol­
<lb/>lowed by a company of women as a <said>corps de
<lb/>reserve</said>—and flanked by a hundred and sixty wit­
<lb/>nesses—the force of the prisoner made its appear­
	  <lb/>ance.  <placeName>Newport</placeName> swarmed with people of every de­
<lb/>nomination—curiosity was on tiptoe.  There was a
<lb/>deep anxiety that truth should be brought to light
<lb/>by the friends of justice and humanity—and a rest­
<lb/>less and watchful one with others, to prevent if pos­
<lb/>sible its developement.
</p>
        <p>The trial came on, and the prisoner was produced.
<lb/>He was a middle aged man, tall, and of very stout
<lb/>frame, and a face that might have passed for good
<lb/>looking, had not a certain iron look, a pair of very
<lb/>thick lips, and a most unpleasant stare of the eyes,
<lb/>have taken much from the agreeable;  however it
<lb/>was agreed on all hands that notwithstanding these
<lb/>blemishes, he would almost any where pass for a
<lb/>tolerable good looking man, and moreover <said>looked
<lb/>like no fool;</said>  or to use the language of the specta­
<pb n="50"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B16v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">50</mw>
<lb/>tors, <said>looked as though he knew more than he told
<lb/>for.</said>  He was charged with three counts in the in­
<lb/>dictment.  First—<said>for choaking and strangling the
<lb/>deceased.</said>  Secondly, <said>for tying her to a stake,</said>
<lb/>and thirdly, inflicting various wounds and bruises
<lb/>on the deceased, calculated to cause death;  or at
<lb/>least that must have been their meaning, though it
<lb/>was worded in the indictment, <said>of which she in­
<lb/>stantly died,</said> but as no person could die twice, we
<lb/>presume this must have been the meaning.  The
<lb/>prisoner of course plead <said>not guilty.</said>  The difficul­
<lb/>ties experienced in the formation of a jury were
<lb/>greater, it is believed, than were ever known before
	  <lb/>in any court in the <placeName>United States</placeName>, so strong was the
<lb/>presumption of the prisoner's guilt that it seemed al­
<lb/>most impossible to find a man who had not made up
<lb/>his mind, and this mind was pretty rudely and une­
<lb/>quivocally expressed by all on the spot:  some few de­
<lb/>clared their feelings to be perfectly neutral, but one
<lb/>only solitary instance could be found of a man who
<lb/>said he had formed an opinion rather favourable to
<lb/>the prisoner;  and it was not until after one hundred
<lb/>and eight were challenged that a jury could be found:
<lb/>the difficulty was materially increased by the prison­
<lb/>er's counsel, who in this as well as in every part of
<lb/>the trial seemed determined to carry every point by
<lb/>what is called management, and who fought the
<lb/>ground inch by inch—with so little apparent rev­
<lb/>erence to the authorities of the law that many a na­
	  <lb/>tive of <placeName>Rhode-Island</placeName> blushed to hear the highest
<lb/>court in his state dictated to thus by a Boston law­
<lb/>yer.

        <p>As there are many, probably, who read this, who
<lb/>have never read the trial and never will, and some
<lb/>who will not even permit that document to come into

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">51</mw>
<lb/>their houses, we shall endeavour to give a summary
<lb/>of the evidence, though in a very brief and perhaps
<lb/>superficial manner;  without going into the whole re­
<lb/>volting particulars.
</p>
        <p>First then, the case was stated in a clear light, by
	  <lb/><persName>D. J. Pierce</persName>, Esq. of <placeName>Newport</placeName>, the witnesses were
	  <lb/>then sworn.  The fact of the death of <persName>S. M. Cornell</persName>
<lb/>was then proved, and of her appearance when found,
<lb/>as presumptive evidence she could not have hung her­
<lb/>self, that she was taken down with the utmost care,
<lb/>rolled in a blanket and laid on straw in a horse wa­
<lb/>gon, and carried over a smooth road to the dwelling
	  <lb/>of <persName>Mr. Durfee</persName>, so that none of the bruises could have
<lb/>been inflicted after death.  Here followed the testi­
<lb/>mony of the women who laid her out, and of the phy­
<lb/>sician who examined her, the first and second time,
	  <lb/>for she was disinterred the second time on the <date when="1833-01-25">25th
<lb/>of January</date>, when a more complete examination was
<lb/>had:  this to be sure was nearly or quite a month af­
<lb/>ter her interment, but it was in the coldest part
<lb/>of the year:  she had been laid in a dry and marly
<lb/>soil, was frozen when she was buried, and the earth
<lb/>frozen that was thrown upon her, and the physician
<lb/>deposed that there was little alteration in her from
<lb/>the first examination.  Every succeeding one brought
<lb/>to light new barbarities, and imagination sickens
<lb/>at the idea of the cruel butchery which this most un­
<lb/>fortunate girl must have undergone, previous to her
<lb/>being strangled.  No person could hear them un­
<lb/>moved:  the very judges, though used to the deline­
<lb/>ation of crime, and pictures of violence, wept upon
<lb/>the bench;  yea wept like children, at the description
<lb/>of her mangled person.  We question whether the
<lb/>mere bodily sufferings of any one woman ever crea­
<lb/>ted such excitement, since the death of her whom
<pb n="52"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">52</mw>
	  <lb/>the <name>Levite</name> cut in pieces and sent to all the coasts of
	  <lb/><placeName>Isr<choice><sic>ea</sic><corr>ae</corr></choice>l</placeName>, which caused the death of more than forty
<lb/>thousand persons, and the extermination of a tribe.<anchor xml:id="a007" corresp="#n007" rend="pre(*)"/></p>
        <p><lb/>The circumstances of the letters were sworn to,
<lb/>and half a sheet of paper found in the store where
	  <lb/>the letter of the <date when="1832-12-08">8th of December</date> was supposed to be
<lb/>written, which exactly matched the one of the letter,
<lb/>both the water mark and even the very fibres of the
<lb/>paper.
</p>
        <p>It was proved that the prisoner left his home on
	  <lb/>the <date when="1832-12-20">20th of December</date>, without any good reason,
<lb/>without informing his family where he was going or
<lb/>assigning any excuse for absenting himself, that he
<lb/>had refused an invitation for that day to visit a Me­
<lb/>thodist lady, without giving any reason;  that no
<lb/>person had been seen on the route he pretended to
<lb/>have taken on that afternoon;  but that a man an­
<lb/>swering his description exactly was traced step by
	  <lb/>step all the way to <placeName>Fall River</placeName>, even to the very
	  <lb/>stack yard.  One man, <persName>Mr. Cranston</persName>, at <placeName>Howland's
	    <lb/>ferry</placeName> bridge, swore to his identity.  <persName>Mr. Lawton</persName>,
	  <lb/>the man on the <placeName>Tiverton</placeName> side, remembered a person
<lb/>of his exact description passing at the same hour,
	  <lb/>three o'clock.  <persName>Mr. Durfee</persName> had been blowing rocks
<lb/>quite near the stack yard, and saw a man standing,
	  <lb/>and looking about with his back towards him.  <persName>Ab­
<lb/>ner Davis</persName>, at work there, saw the same man sitting
<lb/>on the wall, and upon his proceeding in the direc­
<lb/>tion of the rock where they had just laid a train of
	  <lb/>powder (the direction of <placeName>Fall River</placeName>) called out to
<lb/>him, when he stopped.  Both of their descriptions
	  <lb/>of clothes, person, &amp;c. agreed with that of <persName>Avery</persName>,
<pb n="53"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B18r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">53</mw>
<lb/>and upon seeing him they felt convinced he was the
<lb/>person, but as they did not see his face, could not
	  <lb/>swear to his identity.  <persName>William Hamilton</persName> passing
<lb/>this spot about a quarter before nine in the evening,
<lb/>heard sounds as of stifled groans of some female in
<lb/>distress.  The sounds appeared to proceed from the
<lb/>spot where the first piece of comb was found.  He
<lb/>rose the hill and stopped, when, hearing nothing
	  <lb/>more, went on.  One <persName>Ellinor Owen</persName>, who lived with­
<lb/>in sight of the place, about a quarter of a mile distant,
<lb/>testified to hearing screechings from that direction
<lb/>at half past seven in the evening.  The cord was
<lb/>identified as belonging to some bags that lay in a cart
	  <lb/>of <persName>Mr. Durfee's</persName> within a few rods.  A man answer­
<lb/>ing his description went into the back room of Law­
<lb/>ton's hotel, early in the evening on that day, and had
<lb/>a glass of brandy carried in.  They did not know
	  <lb/><persName>Avery</persName>, but upon seeing him, believed him to be the
<lb/>same person.  Some person passed round the toll
	  <lb/>gate, at <placeName>Howland's ferry</placeName>, in returning, after it was
<lb/>closed, (after nine o'clock) by the beach.  Their
<lb/>tracks were seen on the sand, where the water effa­
<lb/>ces any print once in twelve hours.  The gate-keeper
<lb/>looked in the morning and ascertained some one had
<lb/>passed.  He returned to <placeName>Gifford's</placeName>, at the ferry, <choice><sic>lat<g ref="#invertede"/></sic><corr>late</corr></choice>
<lb/>at night, about a quarter before ten, and said he had
<lb/>been on the island, on business;  and to the ques­
<lb/>tion of the ferryman's daughter, if he <said>had a mee­
<lb/>ting that evening?</said> he returned for answer, he had
	  <lb/>not, but had <said>been on business to brother <persName>Cook's</persName>.</said>
</p>
        <p>Nothing perhaps through the whole proceedings
<lb/>of the trial, examination, &amp;c. gave more offence to
<lb/>the feelings of the public than the reckless disre­
<lb/>gard to character shewn by the prisoner and his
<lb/>friends in impeaching witnesses.  This last men­

<pb n="54"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B18v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">54</mw>
	  <lb/>tioned witness, <persName>Miss Jane Gifford</persName>, was a young lady
<lb/>about eighteen years of age, of fair character it is
<lb/>believed as any other in the country:  she had been
<lb/>a member of the Methodist class, and previous to
<lb/>this no one heard any thing to her discredit, but
<lb/>on this occasion they brought witnesses to swear
<lb/><said>her character was not good for truth and vera­
<lb/>city,</said> though upon cross examination they were
<lb/>obliged to acknowledge <said>they had never heard any
	    <lb/>thing to her disadvantage previous to the <placeName>Bristol</placeName>
<lb/>examination.</said>  Several very respectable persons
<lb/>in the neighbourhood testified to her good char­
	  <lb/>acter, among the rest <persName>Judge Childs</persName>, who had
<lb/><said>known the girl from infancy.</said>  They first spoke
	  <lb/>against her at the examination at <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, where
<lb/>she deposed to the fact.  Another instance of this
	  <lb/>barbarity occurred at <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, whence it seemed an
	  <lb/>object to prove that <persName>S. M. Cornell</persName> was a wander­
	  <lb/>er and interloper at the camp meeting in <placeName>Thomp­
<lb/>son</placeName>:  it was there mentioned she was seen with a
	  <lb/><persName>Miss Rebecca Burk</persName> of <placeName>Providence</placeName>, and by her
	  <lb/>introduced to one or two methodists.  <persName>Rev. Mr.
<lb/>Merrill</persName> was asked if she was not a leading mem­
<lb/>ber of their meeting?  <said xml:id="q0023">No,</said> he answered, <said xml:id="q0024">she
<lb/>was not a leading member there, that she had
<lb/>been set aside for <emph rend="slant(italic)">impudence</emph>, and imprudence of
<lb/>conduct,</said> or something like that, when the fact
<lb/>was that this same woman had been considered
<lb/>as a leading member in that society for more
<lb/>than twenty years, that she had been of great ser­
	  <lb/>vice in the cause of methodism in <placeName>Providence</placeName>
<lb/>particularly, and it is believed by many has done
<lb/>more towards building up the Methodist society in
<lb/>that town than any three persons who could be
<lb/>named, that she has given liberally of her sub­
<pb n="55"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="C1r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">55</mw>
<lb/>stance towards the support of their meetings, though
<lb/>obliged to labor with her hands for her own support.
<lb/>The only thing they could have said, and that if
<lb/>fairly explained would have done her no harm, was
<lb/>some little disagreement between some of the mem­
<lb/>bers, of whom she was one, some time previous,
<lb/>wherein they were all what they call <said>put back,</said>
<lb/>for six months, and at the end of that time restored,
<lb/>and every thing went on as before;<anchor xml:id="a008" corresp="#n008" rend="pre(*)"/> but there was
<lb/>nothing to affect her character.  The words <said>im­
<lb/>pudence</said> and <said>imprudence</said> are generally under­
<lb/>stood to mean a great deal.  But we are digressing.

        <p><persName>Mr. Orswell</persName>, the engineer of the <name>King Philip</name>,
<lb/>gave a very clear and comprehensive evidence with
	  <lb/>respect to the delivery of the pink letter, by <persName>Avery</persName>,
	  <lb/>in <placeName>Providence</placeName>—<said>that he received it from the hands
	    <lb/>of <persName>Avery</persName> himself in person, who gave it to him be­
<lb/>tween the hours of 8 and 9, or a little past 9, in
<lb/>the morning—that he received it with an express in­
<lb/>junction to have it delivered as soon as the boat ar­
<lb/>rived, and gave him nine pence for carrying it—that
	    <lb/>he did not know <persName>Avery</persName> then, but went up to <placeName>Bris­
<lb/>tol</placeName> to see him, and recognised him at once, at his
	    <lb/>(<persName>Avery's</persName>) house, and to his anxious inquiries of
<lb/><said>what he meant to swear?</said> he replied <said>that to the
<lb/>best of his knowledge and belief he was the per­
	      <lb/>son.</said>  <persName>Avery</persName> then put on his spectacles and asked
<lb/>him if he looked like him, and then turning to his
<lb/>friends asked them <said>if he ever went out without
<lb/>spectacles?</said></said>  No notice appeared to be taken of
<lb/>this in court which was singular, as all the witnesses
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">C</mw>
<pb n="56"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="C1v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">56</mw>
	  <lb/>who saw him when he crossed the ferry (<persName>Mr. Pearce</persName>,
	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Gifford</persName>, &amp;c.) attest to his being without spec­
<lb/>tacles.  It certainly amounted to proof positive of
<lb/>his artifice and dissimulation.  He did in general,
<lb/>and for all that is known to the contrary, invaria­
<lb/>bly wear his spectacles on going out, except this
	  <lb/>once, and on the fatal <date when="1832-12-20">20th of <name>Dec</name></date>.  What could
<lb/>possibly be his motive for going on those two occa­
<lb/>sions without them, unless it was to disguise him­
	  <lb/>self?  <persName>Mr. Orswell</persName> did not positively swear to the
<lb/>day the letter was delivered him, but thought it was
	  <lb/>on <name>Thursday</name>.  The letter was identified as the one
<lb/>he received, by the marks of his fingers which were
<lb/>smutty and oily at the time, and he recollected the
<lb/>manner.
</p>
        <p>With respect to the <name>Camp Meeting</name>, the source
<lb/>and origin, as she asserted, of her misfortunes, it
	  <lb/>was stated by a <persName>Mr. Paine</persName>, the young gentleman
<lb/>who carried her there at the request of her brother­
<lb/>in-law, <said>that he had seen her at various times dur­
<lb/>ing the summer, at the shop where she worked, while
<lb/>there, and that her conduct always appeared be­
<lb/>coming and proper, and that he neither knew or
<lb/>suspected or heard of any impropriety in her.</said>
</p>
        <p>The sister of the deceased stated that she (<persName>S. M.
<lb/>Cornell</persName>) returned from the <name>Camp Meeting</name> to her
<lb/>house, with a young man, an apprentice of theirs,
	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Saunders</persName>;  and that in <name>September</name> she confess­
<lb/>ed her fears of her situation to her, acknowledging
	  <lb/>her connexion with <persName>Avery</persName> at the <name>Camp Meeting</name>.
	  <lb/>The sister also swore to the fact that <persName>Sarah M. Cor­
<lb/>nell</persName> was free from any such embarrassment previous
	  <lb/>to that meeting.  This was also sworn to by a <persName>Miss
<lb/>Lawton</persName>, a very respectable young woman in the
<lb/>family at the time, and who was her bed-fellow.</p>
        <pb n="57"/>
        <milestone unit="sig" n="C2r"/>
        <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">57</mw>
        <p>The brother-in-law of the deceased also testified
<lb/>to this confidence placed in himself and wife, and
<lb/>being troubled about it, he consulted his minister,
	  <lb/><persName>Rev. Mr. Cornell</persName>, and a lawyer, and that they both
	  <lb/>advised her removal to <placeName>Rhode-Island</placeName>.  And further,
<lb/>both stated they never had the least reason to sup­
<lb/>pose she meditated self-destruction.  That she had
<lb/>never, notwithstanding what had past, spoken re­
	  <lb/>proachfully of <persName>Avery</persName>, but always mildly;  and that
<lb rend="post(”)"/>her conduct at their house was perfectly proper.
</p>
        <p><persName>Mr. Saunders</persName>, the young man mentioned, gave
	  <lb/>his testimony to the bringing of her from <name>Camp
<lb/>Meeting</name>—her behaviour perfectly proper, &amp;c. in
<lb/>answer to the questions asked, and to his having
<lb/>put letters in the postoffice for her several times.
<lb/><said>Were any of them directed to Bristol?</said>  it was
<lb/>asked.  <said>Yes.</said>  <said>Were the letters sent to Bristol
<lb/>before or after the <name>Camp Meeting</name>?</said>  <said>Before.</said>
<lb/><emph rend="slant(italic)">Before</emph> was the answer, and by what strange over­
<lb/>sight this witness was not even interrogated we can­
<lb/>not tell;  why after an answer that promised to them
<lb/>so much light on the subject, it was pressed no fur­
<lb/>ther is beyond conjecture.  Many people previous to
	  <lb/>this had formed the conclusion that <said><persName>Marmion</persName> and
<lb/>she were friends of old.</said> And that the betrayer had
<lb/>connived at her expulsion from the meeting, in or­
<lb/>der to conceal his own villany the better, and they
<lb/>thought they saw in this testimony of the correspon­
	  <lb/>dence with <placeName>Bristol</placeName> previous to the <name>Camp Meeting</name> a
<lb/>confirmation of their suspicions, that the interview
	  <lb/>with <persName>Avery</persName> at that meeting was concerted by letter:
<lb/>they therefore eagerly looked to see the witness fur­
<lb/>ther interrogated, but no such interrogation took
<lb/>place. <emph rend="slant(italic)">What he would have said, if interrogated</emph>,
<pb n="58"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="C2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">58</mw>
<lb/>belongs to another part of this story—and we hast­
<lb/>en along with the trial.
</p>
        <p>The testimony of her sister and sister's husband
<lb/>was the only one which related directly to the inter­
	  <lb/>view of the deceased with the prisoner at the <name>Camp
<lb/>Meeting</name>.  She had told them of an acknowledg­
<lb/>ment which she had given the meeting, about being
<lb/>unworthy, &amp;c. &amp;c.;  that although she was then in
<lb/>good standing with them, it had not been returned;
	  <lb/>that <persName>Avery</persName> still had the paper in his hands and ought
<lb/>to restore it to her;  that she had asked him on the
<lb/>Camp ground for that letter, and he requested an
<lb/>interview with her;  that she met him in a retired
<lb/>part of the wood, where he asked her to be seated,
<lb/>which she complied with, and then asked him <said rend="pre()">if he
<lb/>had got the letter with him?</said>  that he said <said>no</said>,
<lb/>and then proceeded to take unwarrantable liberties,
<lb/>and that she made ineffectual resistance.
</p>
        <p>It seemed the friends of the prisoner had made
<lb/>great objections to the time it must have taken to
	  <lb/>walk the distance back from <placeName>Fall River</placeName> to <placeName>Bristol</placeName>
	  <lb/>ferry, on the night of the <date when="1832-12-20">20th</date>;  and two men now
<lb/>appeared and swore to the fact of travelling it re­
<lb/>cently in fifteen minutes less than it took the pris­
<lb/>oner, according to all their statements:  and further,
<lb/>it seemed the person whose route was traced all the
<lb/>way on that afternoon, was no slouch of a walker;
<lb/>for when he went over, a lady who saw him just on
	  <lb/>the <placeName>Fall River</placeName> side of <placeName>Howland's ferry</placeName>, remarked
<lb/><said>that if that man kept on as he was going, he would
	    <lb/>get to <placeName>Ohio</placeName> before night.</said>  The evidence mention­
<lb/>ed constituted the most important part, and pretty
<lb/>much all (though condensed into a much smaller
<lb/>compass) that was given.  After the Government
<lb/>evidence was closed, the host of testimony on the
<lb/>part of the prisoner was brought forward.</p>
        <pb n="59"/>
        <milestone unit="sig" n="C3r"/>
        <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">59</mw>
        <p>And first, there were six physicians, most of them
<lb/>of very considerable eminence in their profession;
<lb/>one or two holding professorships in the medical de­
<lb/>partment of some of our Universities.  By them they
<lb/>endeavoured to prove, first, that the deceased might
<lb/>have hung herself;  that there was a possibility of
<lb/>her hanging herself up after she had strangled her­
<lb/>self to death with the cord:  next, that the internal
<lb/>injuries discovered in her person on the second ex­
<lb/>amination, viz. a little more than a month after the
<lb/>first interment, might have been occasioned by de­
<lb/>composition.  Those observed at the first disinter­
<lb/>ment they did not attempt much to account for.
<lb/>Next, that <emph rend="slant(italic)">hanging</emph> was a very common death by
<lb/>suicide, and an uncommon way of murder.  (This
<lb/>was certainly a great discovery, and no doubt edifi­
<lb/>ed the court and jury.)  Thirdly, a long and most
<lb/>indecent examination and discussion was entered
<lb/>into, to prove that the prisoner could not have been
<lb/>the father of the child which the deceased was about
<lb/>to give birth to, and that her situation must have
<lb/>commenced previous to the <name>Camp Meeting</name>.  This
<lb/>they ground on the circumstance of the child itself,
<lb/>who perished with the mother, being larger than
<lb/>common for that period of time.  This seemed to
<lb/>be the hinge on which they meant the case should
<lb/>turn;  and for this six physicians, some from a very
<lb/>considerable distance, were brought together at a
<lb/>great expense, and a most lengthy and elaborate
<lb/>investigation was entered into, which for indelicate
<lb/>exposure was probably never exceeded in any Court
<lb/>of Justice.  It was a saying afterwards that <said>the
<lb/>next age would have no need of physicians, as every
<lb/>boy capable of reading would be perfectly instructed
	    <lb/>in all the secrets of the <term>Materia Medica</term>—in the sci­
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">C*</mw>
<pb n="60"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="C3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">60</mw>
<lb/>ences of Anatomy and Surgery, at least.</said>  Howev­
<lb/>er learned and elaborate it was, it is certain that
<lb/><emph rend="slant(italic)">one single question</emph> put to those physicians, if proper­
<lb/>ly answered, as no doubt it would have been, would
<lb/>have put the whole to rest at once, by overthrowing
<lb/>the whole theory they had been endeavouring to es­
<lb/>tablish.  But the counsel for the Government hap­
<lb/>pening to understand more of the laws of the land
<lb/>than the laws of nature, probably never thought of
<lb/>this test.<anchor xml:id="a009" corresp="#n009" rend="pre(*)"/>
</p>
        <p>Immediately after the testimony of the physicians,
<lb/>commenced the examination of a long string of wit­
<lb/>nesses respecting the character of the deceased, and
<lb/>here it has been shrewdly said the law was violated
<lb/>which provides that <said>persons shall not be compell­
<lb/>ed to give evidence against themselves.</said>  The
<lb/>whole sum and substance of the charges seemed to
<lb/>be taken from her own mouth, and women appear­
<lb/>ed on the stand and testified to things told them by
<lb/>the deceased of herself, <said>not fit for mortal ear to
<lb/>hear, or mortal tongue to utter.</said>  Such a repetition
<lb/>of village gossip—such a hunting up of old factory
<lb/>stories, and of legends long since, as one would have
<lb/>supposed, forgotten, (that is if they ever existed,)
<lb/>never was heard of before.  Such a display of the
<lb/>amazing powers of memory too.  That these witnesses
<lb/>were from different States, and therefore voluntary
<lb/>witnesses, relaters of scandals, of village gossip
<lb/>which never yet spared any one, and of which the
<lb/>good and the bad have sometimes to be equal par­
<pb n="61"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="C4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">61</mw>
<lb/>takers;  betrayers of confidence reposed in them
<lb/>(by their own account) which if true proved at least
<lb/>that the deceased, however bad herself, considered
<lb/>them of the same stamp, for whoever heard of a
<lb/>loose woman pouring into the ears of a modest one
<lb/>the history of her intrigues?  Whoever heard of
<lb/>such degrading herself by being in the confidence
<lb/>of a wanton?  It appeared the obvious intent of such
<lb/>testimony to prove the deceased a perfect fiend, ca­
<lb/>pable of plotting any atrocity and of carrying it
<lb/>through.  But to what purpose it may be asked was
<lb/>all this directed?  What possible bearing upon the
<lb/>case could such evidence have?  It was not to prove
<lb/>the deceased good, but the prisoner bad, that the
<lb/>process was instituted.  It was not supposed that
<lb/>an immaculate, incorruptible being would have fall­
<lb/>en a victim to the clumsy courtship and bungling
<lb/>attempts of a fellow who by the testimony of his
<lb/>own letters does not appear to have understood even
<lb/>the language he preached in, and a married man too.
<lb/>Why then this innumerable company of witnesses
<lb/>to blacken her character?
</p>
        <p>Why, as people generally understood it, it was
<lb/>for a threefold purpose.  In the first place, the mere
<lb/>introduction of such a crowd of witnesses, the mere
<lb/>repetition of such a mass of evidence, was of itself
<lb/>sufficient to divert the attention, and confuse the in­
<lb/>tellects of any court and jury that ever sat.  It had
<lb/>a certain tendency to throw dust in people's eyes, a
<lb/>phrase too well understood to need explanation here.
<lb/>And above all, its effect would be to turn indigna­
<lb/>tion into another channel.  This the wily counsel
<lb/>were fully aware of, and the doors once open to ad­
<lb/>mit such evidence, they took care should not be
<lb/>speedily closed, but that every possible frailty or im­
<lb/>prudence from the cradle to the grave should be
<pb n="62"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="C4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">62</mw>
<lb/>hunted up and expatiated upon.  It had the certain
<lb/>tendency to turn the public indignation from the
<lb/>murderer, whoever he might be, to the person mur­
<lb/>dered.  And some were almost ready to exclaim,
<lb/><said>No matter who killed her—such a person were
<lb/>better out of the world than in it—they have cer­
<lb/>tainly done society a good service—whatever were
<lb/>the motives of the slayer, he has certainly conferred
<lb/>a public benefit.</said>  One person went so far as to say
<lb/>that <said>he did not think such a drab worth having a
<lb/>trial about!</said>
</p>
        <p>Persons of sense and discernment however there
<lb/>were who thought they discovered in this host of
<lb/>evidence great contradiction with itself.  One of
<lb/>these evidences, a physician, related that she had
<lb/>come to him for advice, and told him she was a bad
<lb/>girl.  Several witnesses too corroborate his testimo­
<lb/>ny, and say that she told them of her calling on
<lb/>this doctor, and that he insulted her, and upon
<lb/>her repulsing him, threatened, unless she complied
<lb/>with his solicitations, that he would ruin her char­
<lb/>acter with the meeting, and knowing therefore that
<lb/>it is esteemed a point of honour with physicians to
<lb/>keep all such things secret, and that he did imme­
<lb/>diately after the threat, as she said, and after the
<lb/>visit at any rate, say those things against her, they
<lb/>believed it done for revenge.<anchor xml:id="a010" corresp="#n010" rend="pre(*)"/> It was further proved
<lb/>that this physician made a demand of ten dollars
<lb/>which she refused to pay, saying she did not owe
<lb/>him more than half a dollar.  Moreover one of these
<lb/>persons testified that the deceased told her she was
<lb/>doctored for a humour which originated in getting
<lb/>cold at a camp meeting—a thing by no means in­
<lb/>credible to those who know the danger of sleeping
<lb/>in the night air, and on the damp earth.</p>
        <pb n="63"/>
        <milestone unit="sig" n="C5r"/>
        <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">63</mw>
        <p>The story of this insult she persisted in through
<lb/>all the subsequent trouble she met with, and they in­
<lb/>quired if one part of her testimony was to be credit­
<lb/>ed, why not all.
</p>
        <p>One witness testified to her going out of a factory
<lb/>with a string in her hand and she followed her, and
<lb/>really believed she was going to hang herself if she
<lb/>had not interrupted her.
</p>
        <p>Another witne<choice><sic>e</sic><corr/></choice>ss of the <name>Methodist Society</name> testi­
<lb/>fied that the deceased once told her that she attempt­
<lb/>ed her life, and had not courage to go through with
<lb/>it.
</p>
        <p>Two persons, a tavern keeper and his wife, by the
	  <lb/>name of <persName>Parker</persName>, gave a most singular testimony.
<lb/>They averred that eight years before, a girl <emph rend="slant(italic)">calling
	    <lb/>herself</emph> <persName>Maria Cornell</persName>, came to their house in the
<lb/>evening, being evidently in a situation no young
<lb/>woman would want to travel alone in, and <said>appear­
<lb/>ed much engaged in <emph rend="slant(italic)">the work of God.</emph></said>  That was
<lb/>the expression.  When two young men entered, and
<lb/>she immediately charged one with being her be­
<lb/>trayer, and frightened him out of a sum of money
<lb/>to settle with her, and gave him a receipt;  and that
<lb/>they all staid all night;  and she came down stairs
<lb/>next morning looking entirely different;  and the
<lb/>young man thus swindled took no notice of her al­
<lb/>tered looks;  and they all went away, it would seem
<lb/>perfectly satisfied.  This evidence was judged of
<lb/>great importance it appeared by the prisoner's coun­
<lb/>sel, by the manner in which it was handled by
<lb/>them.  By others it was received as exhibiting in­
<lb/>consistenc<choice><sic/><corr>i</corr></choice>es not to be reconciled.  1.  That any
<lb/>young man would put up with such an imposition.
<lb/>2.  That any one engaged in such a fraud would so
<lb/>soon throw off the mask.  3.  That persons so very
<pb n="64"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="C5v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">64</mw>
<lb/>religious as they evidently wanted to be thought,
<lb/>would tolerate such transactions in their houses, and
<lb/>lodge the whole company after it, the woman, who­
<lb/>ever she was, and her paramour.
</p>
        <p>Four women and two men (<name>Methodists</name>) were then
<lb/>examined;  the women gave a history of such dis­
<lb/>gusting intrigues, as could scarce be parelleled,
<lb/>which they said the deceased acknowledged to them
<lb/>in the way of confession.  That she appeared very
<lb/>penitent for them, and one said <said>wept upon her
<lb/>neck until she was quite disgusted with her.</said>  Two
	  <lb/>testified she had threatened vengeance upon <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Avery</persName> for signing her expulsion from the meeting,
<lb/>and that she said <said>she would be revenged on him
<lb/>if it cost her her life,</said> although it did not appear
<lb/>she had any known cause of hostility against him.
<lb/>No one could attach any blame to him, who being
<lb/>her minister was obliged to act as the rules of the
<lb/>meeting required.  One of these fair swearers was
<lb/>one of those who went off with him at the time of
	  <lb/>his flight from <placeName>Bristol</placeName>.
</p>
        <p>Another instance of that recklessness displayed
<lb/>by the prisoner's friends of the character and peace
<lb/>of individuals, and perhaps the most barbarous, was
<lb/>the trying to disgrace the character of her sister's
<lb/>husband, a young man of most unexceptionable
<lb/>character, always known for his modesty, sobriety
<lb/>and piety, and who had not seen the deceased for
<lb/>several years previous to the fatal summer—the last
<lb/>of her earthly pilgrimage, when she came to visit
<lb/>them and her aged mother, who resided in the fam­
	  <lb/>ily.  They brought witnesses to say, that <persName>S. M. Cor­
<lb/>nell</persName> had told that her sister's husband had loved her
<lb/>better than his wife, and that they had been as
<lb/>free as man and wife; and one of the witnesses, a
<pb n="65"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="C6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">65</mw>
<lb/>young girl, recited a long piece of poetry which she
<lb/>recollected she said from reading it once or twice,
	  <lb/>and which <persName>Maria</persName> had said her brother addressed to
<lb/>her.<anchor xml:id="a011" corresp="#n011" rend="pre(*)"/>
</p>
        <p>The next company of witnesses were called to
<lb/>cover the time of the prisoner's being at the camp
<lb/>meeting, which if we recollect was three days, in
<lb/>such a manner as to occupy every moment of it, and
<lb/>make it an impossibility of his having any assigna­
<lb/>tion with the deceased.  In fact, if all this testimo­
<lb/>ny could be relied on, the prisoner had not only no
<lb/>time for an interview with any woman out of their
<lb/>sight, but no time neither for the ordinary occasions
<lb/>of life, no hour for private devotion or any thing of
<lb/>that sort;  wherever he went, it appeared from the
<lb/>testimony, there was some one at his elbow; if he
<lb/>walked or rode, or sat or slept, or eat or drank, or
<lb/>preached, somebody appeared to testify to the hour,
<lb/>whose memory was fresh with every particular.  As
<lb/>one dropped him another took him up;  if one left
<lb/>him another joined him at the same moment, until
<lb/>they fairly guarded him out of the premises, and
	  <lb/>out of the country.  Had <persName>E. K. Avery</persName> been a State
<lb/>prisoner, suspected of treason, under one of the most
<pb n="66"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="C6v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">66</mw>
<lb/>arbitrary governments in the world, he could not
<lb/>have been more strictly guarded, and closely watch­
	  <lb/>ed than he must have been, even if the whole <name>Col­
<lb/>lege of Jesuits</name> had been on the alert—besides hav­
<lb/>ing such fine memories that they could all remem­
<lb/>ber so exact about every moment of time, and even
<lb/>the slightest circumstance respecting this man.
<lb/>Many argued, who heard this testimony, that this
<lb/>was suspicious;  that it was a thing contrary to gene­
<lb/>ral experience—that among such a multitude, one
<lb/>person of no very extraordinary character for any
<lb/>thing, should be singled out as an object of remark,
<lb/>a point of observation, a centre of attraction to
<lb/>which all eyes were turned, and argued from this
<lb/>very testimony, as well as the similar one of the
	  <lb/>four days meeting in <placeName>Providence</placeName>, that it was over­
<lb/>done, and would undoubtedly have a tendency to
<lb/>convince the court of the delinquency of the prison­
<lb/>er—the result however disappointed their calcula­
<lb/>tions.
</p>
        <p>In the same manner they endeavored to cover the
	  <lb/>time of day <persName>Orswell</persName> supposed was the one that the
<lb/>letter was handed him.  The Attorney General sta­
<lb/>ted in his remarks, that so earnest had they been to
<lb/>cover the time, when the letter could have been de­
<lb/>livered, that <said>they made out fifteen minutes more
<lb/>than there really was of it.</said> It appeared from the
<lb/>testimony of the witnesses, that he was constantly
<lb/>with some of them except when he went from break­
<lb/>fast to the clergyman's, when the walk was accom­
<lb/>plished in as short a space of time, as ever man
<lb/>walked it, and immediately appeared in another
<lb/>place, when the Rev. somebody else took him to
<lb/>brother somebody's, and instantly he appeared
<lb/>again in the methodist meeting-house, at the begin­
<pb n="67"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="D1r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">67</mw>
<lb/>ning of the meeting, precisely at nine o'clock;  this
<lb/>they remarked by one particular circumstance, it
<lb/>is, that he did not open the meeting which he had
<lb/>previously agreed to do;  for this omission no reason
<lb/>appeared from him or his friends, so that people
<lb/>were left to conclude, either that there was a mis­
	  <lb/>take in the day, which <persName>Orswell</persName> did not swear to,
<lb/>or that he had slipped away a few moments before
<lb/>the meeting (eluding the vigilance of his sentinels,)
<lb/>and was too much fatigued to open the meeting after
<lb/>such a race;  or that he excused himself from making
<lb/>the first prayer, in order to slip away while the peo­
<lb/>ple were on their knees and would not observe him;
<lb/>and as to other profane spectators, they would not
<lb/>have observed the circumstance of a man gliding in
<lb/>and out, where there is such constant ingress and
<lb/>egress.<anchor xml:id="a012" corresp="#n012" rend="pre(*)"/>
</p>
        <p>While the evidence was taking, witnesses arrived

<lb/>just measured the distance from the methodist meet­
<lb/>ing-house to the steamboat wharf, and found the
<lb/>distance so great that it was impossible he could
<lb/>have travelled it that morning before meeting.  So
	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Orswell</persName> was completely sworn down.  Never­
<lb/>theless a little time after that trial was decided, a
<lb/>respectable farmer came forward and testified to
	  <lb/>seeing <persName>Avery</persName> when he delivered the very letter to
	  <lb/><persName>Orswell</persName>.  He did not know Avery at the time, but
<lb/>when the trial came to be published, accompanied

<lb/>with a striking likeness of the Rev. accused, this
	  <lb/>man, <persName>Mr. Angell</persName>, immediately recognized the per­
<lb/>son.<anchor xml:id="a013" corresp="#n013" rend="pre(*)"/>
</p>
        <p>Witnesses from the Camp ground were produced
	  <lb/>against <persName>S. M. Cornell</persName>, the deceased:  one of whom
<lb/>testified she saw her slap a young man on the shoul­
<lb/>der;  another thought something might have been
<lb/>the matter with her, as she thought she walked dif­
<lb/>ferent from other folks;  another imagined some­
<lb/>thing against her character because her frock did
<lb/>not quite meet together behind;  another testified
<lb/>that it was said there were persons of bad character
<lb/>there, who were directed to be ordered off the ground.
<lb/>But although it was known the deceased was there,
<lb/>it appeared she was not molested.  As to the char­
	  <lb/>acter of <persName>Avery</persName>, a number of their witnesses were
<lb/>examined, all of whom testified to the faultlessness of
<lb/>his character;  never heard but what his disposition
<lb/>was good;  his character for every thing, good.  Two
<lb/>of these witnesses, Methodist ministers by the name
	  <lb/>of <persName>Merrill</persName>, upon being cross examined, confessed
	  <lb/>he had been prosecuted for defamation in <placeName>Massachu­
<lb/>setts</placeName>, but stated it resulted in <emph rend="slant(italic)">nothing to impeach
	    <lb/>his character,</emph> and that <emph rend="slant(italic)">the Ecclesiastical Council
<lb/>acquitted him of all blame.</emph>
</p>
        <p>And what, asks the reader who has never read
<lb/>the trial and is unacquainted with the events of
<pb n="69"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="D2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">69</mw>
<lb/>this story (unless Ecclesiastical Councils should take
<lb/>the place of Courts of Justice, and become the law
<lb/>of the land, and such books be condemned to be
<lb/>burnt by the common hangman and their authors
<lb/>to some modern <name rend="pre(“)post(”)">Inquisition,</name>) what did they, the
	  <lb/>witnesses, say respecting the absence of <persName>Avery</persName> from
	  <lb/><placeName>Bristol</placeName> on the day of the murder?  and how did they
<lb/>manage to clear up the circumstance of the letters?
<lb/>of his being so unfortunate as to be in the very pla­
<lb/>ces, on the very day when the letters were dated,
<lb/>and of having letters charged him at the Post Office
<lb/>on the very day when the letters of the deceased
<lb/>must have reached him?  Surely here must have
<lb/>been their strongest stand;  and these things satis­
<lb/>factorily accounted for would not only have saved
<lb/>his life, but what is of more value, or ought to be to
<lb/>a christian minister, his character.  Doubtless this
<lb/>must have been the ransacking for witnesses at the
<lb/>time the turnpike gates saw such hard service.
<lb/>This must have been the dodging in and out of eve­
<lb/>ry tavern, factory village and factory boarding house
<lb/>in the country.
</p>
        <p>No such thing, no such witnesses were brought
<lb/>forward, nothing of the kind attempted.  Relying
<lb/>upon the protection of the law, that the accuser
<lb/>shall prove where the accused is, not he prove where
<lb/>he is not, the prisoner took possesion of the strong
<lb/>hold, and saved the ship from sinking by throwing
<lb/>character overboard.
</p>
        <p>But surely, says the reader, they must have made
<lb/>a lame piece of work of it, if that were the case.
<lb/>For what purpose this array of witnesses to prove
<lb/>the deceased bad?  that was what the Government
<lb/>wanted to prove:  for good she could not be and be
<lb/>his mistress—her minister!  a married man too!

<lb/>Why it argues a great degree of depravity, or infat­
<lb/>uation, or destitution of reason.  How did all these
<lb/>inconsistenc<choice><sic/><corr>i</corr></choice>es of character in the deceased help
<lb/>him?  It only made the probability of the case
<lb/>more apparent.  Granted—but nevertheless this tes­
<lb/>timony, strange and inconsistent and contradictory
<lb/>as it was, was their fort, and upon this they ground­
<lb/>ed their defence of the prisoner.  The counsel for
<lb/>the prisoner had sketched out a romance, not to be
<lb/>equalled by any thing we know or read of Spanish
<lb/>or Italian vengeance, and dressing it up in a most
<lb/>ingenious manner, presented it to the attention of
<lb/>the Jury.  His argument was, that this girl, the de­
<lb/>ceased, was utterly bad, capable of any sort of wick­
<lb/>edness;  that she owed the prisoner a grudge for his
<lb/>share in turning her out of meeting, and that she
<lb/>had wreaked her vengeance upon him in this man­
<lb/>ner:  first, by writing the letters or procuring them
<lb/>to be written and sent to her, and then by pretend­
<lb/>ing he was her betrayer;  and finally hanging herself
<lb/>after writing a billet, <said>if she was missing to inquire
	    <lb/>of the <persName>Rev. E. K. Avery</persName>.</said>—that she had said,
<lb/><said>she would be revenged upon him if it cost her her
<lb/>life,</said> and accordingly had contrived this method
<lb/>and carried it into execution, and that all the rest
<lb/>was the effect of the heightened imagination of the
	  <lb/><placeName>Fall River</placeName> folks;  and the excitement he politely
	  <lb/>styled the <said><placeName>Fall River</placeName> fever</said>:  and whenever in
<lb/>the course of his brief review of the evidence, he
<lb/>chanced to come across something remarkably tough,
<lb/>why, with a flourish known only to the people called
<lb/>lawyers, he would give it a toss, and get rid of it at
<lb/>once without any trouble, as easily as one would
<lb/>toss a biscuit into the sea.  Never was the old prov­
<lb/>erb verified better than in this case, viz.  <said>one bold
<pb n="71"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="D3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">71</mw>
<lb/>assertion is better than a host of argument,</said> and
<lb/><said>two negatives is as good as one affirmative;</said> and
<lb/>we had like to have added the third, <said>a lie <emph rend="slant(italic)">well
<lb/>stuck to</emph> is as good as the truth,</said> but we leave that
<lb/>out.  He attempted to establish it as a fact that the
<lb/>deceased was insane too, and yet that all this meth­
<lb/>od was adopted in her madness:  that she was capa­
<lb/>ble of a plot of revenge deeper and of a more dia­
<lb/>bolical character than any ever related before of
<lb/>woman—a plot which, in conception and execution,
<lb/>surpassed all human credibility.
</p>
        <p>He was replied to by the Attorney General, <persName>Al­
<lb/>bert C. Greene</persName>, Esq. whose health at the time was
<lb/>not good, and whose arduous labours had during the
<lb/>trial much exhausted him;  a gentleman of good law
<lb/>knowledge, of amiable manners, and feeling heart,
<lb/>but whose plain good sense was no match for the
<lb/>subtlety of his antagonist.  His speech contained
<lb/>much sound reasoning;  nevertheless, after a short
<lb/>charge from the chief justice, the jury retired, and
<lb/>on the next morning, at 9 o'clock, brought in a ver­
<lb/>dict of <emph rend="slant(italic)">not guilty,</emph> having consumed four weeks in
<lb/>the trial.
</p>
        <p>Various opinions respecting the verdict of the ju­
<lb/>ry prevailed, yet all felt it their duty to acquiesce in
<lb/>the decision of a legal tribunal, and no one had the
	  <lb/>least idea of molesting <persName>Mr. Avery</persName> after his discharge
	  <lb/>by the court.  The <placeName>Fall River</placeName> people, who had be­
<lb/>haved throughout most magnanimously, notwith­
	  <lb/>standing the hue and cry of the friends of <persName>Avery</persName>,
<lb/>that they were thirsting for his blood, and a deal
<lb/>more of that sort, were as content to let him live as
<lb/>any others.  They however looked forward with
<lb/>certain confidence to his being deposed as a preach­
<lb/>er.  They could conceive of very great efforts to
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">D*</mw>
<pb n="72"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="D3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">72</mw>
<lb/>save him from the gallows, from the mistaken notion
<lb/>that the penalty was the disgrace of crime, and that
<lb/>his death would be thought to bring an uneffaceable
<lb/>stain upon the methodist order.  When therefore
<lb/>his own people sat upon his case, as it was known
<lb/>they did not measure their decision by the fiat of the
<lb/>law, and that he did not, nor could not, satisfactori­
<lb/>ly account for himself, or clear up the affair of the
<lb/>letters, &amp;c. it was believed he would be expelled
<lb/>from their order, or at least forever debarred from
<lb/>preaching—that if it were for their own character
<lb/>alone, they would not suffer such an outrage upon
<lb/>the feelings and common sense of the community.
<lb/>But to their amazement and that of others the <said>Ec­
<lb/>clesiastical Council,</said> as they style themselves, the
<lb/>highest tribunal among them at any rate, pronoun­
<lb/>ced him perfectly innocent, and freed from all sus­
<lb/>picion, and continued him in the service of his of­
<lb/>fice.  This outrage upon the feelings of society it is
<lb/>believed will eventually injure them more in the es­
<lb/>timation of mankind, than it would have done to
<lb/>have had twenty preachers hung.
</p>
        <p>To leave digression and pursue the thread of the
	  <lb/>narrative—<persName>E. K. Avery</persName> was almost instantaneously
	  <lb/>hurried out of <placeName>Newport</placeName>, after the rendering of the
<lb/>verdict, and conveyed to his family in Bristol, and
<lb/>continued in his office, and weekly to hold forth to
<lb/>the people, followed by crowds whom curiosity at­
<lb/>tracted to hear him, so much more will that impel
<lb/>people than devotion.
</p>
        <p>The murdered, mangled remains of <persName>Sarah Maria
	    <lb/>Cornell</persName> still repose at <placeName>Fall River</placeName>, at rest we hope,
<lb/>from all further molestation.  The generous and
<lb/>feeling inhabitants of the village wished to have
<lb/>placed a handsome marble monument over her re­
<pb n="73"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="D4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">73</mw>
<lb/>mains, detailing the sad tragedy of her death, but
<lb/>this her relations objected to, from the fear that it
<lb/>would not be permitted to remain, and that the same
<lb/>interest which had been exerted to blacken her char­
<lb/>acter, might be to destroy all records of the transac­
	  <lb/>tion.  Her brother and sister <persName>Rawson</persName> therefore
<lb/>placed a small but neat stone at the head and foot
<lb/>of the grave, simply inscribed with her name and
<lb/>age.  That lowly grave has been the pilgrimage of
<lb/>thousands from all the different sections of the coun­
	  <lb/>try.  It is in vain that the friends of <persName>Avery</persName> endeav­
<lb/>our to place that unfortunate being beneath even
<lb/>the pity of the virtuous.  Her own sex feel she was
<lb/>a woman, and as such entitled to their sympathies,
<lb/>the other, more generally inclined to compassionate
<lb/>female frailty, pity her with undissembled sorrow.
<lb/>Few have visited that spot without tears.  There
<lb/>seems to be a spell breathing around that none can
<lb/>withstand:  the effect is absolutely irresistable.  It
<lb/>is a humble grave, in a solitary spot.  It is the grave
<lb/>of a poor factory girl, but from that grave a voice
<lb/>seems to issue, noisless as that still small one, that
<lb/>speaks to the conscience of the sinner, but whose
<lb/>tones nevertheless sink deep into the heart.  The
<lb/>author of these pages visited that spot, as well as the
<lb/>one where she met her fate, at a most interesting
	  <lb/>moment.  It was on the evening of the <date when="--07-01">first of Ju­
<lb/>ly</date>.  The moon was then at its full, yet a kind of
<lb/>shadowy darkness hung over the spot, blending the
<lb/>outlines of the surrounding landscape so as to render
<lb/>them nearly indistinct.  For some time I stood won­
<lb/>dering, without dreaming of the cause, but upon
<lb/>looking up, discovered the moon was in an eclipse.
<lb/>There was a singular coincidence in it certainly,
<lb/>and it forcibly reminded me of the dark and myste­
<pb n="74"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="D4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">74</mw>
<lb/>rious fate of her who reposed beneath.  I watched
<lb/>it as the shadow slid from the moon's disk, and I
<lb/>felt that confidence which I have ever felt since,
<lb/>that the mystery of darkness which envelopes the
<lb/>story and hides the sad fate of that unfortunate vic­
<lb/>tim will one day be dispersed.  The following lines
<lb/>were penned at the time and afterwards published
	  <lb/>in the <title>Fall River Monitor</title>.  They are inserted here

        <p>With the greatest care and impartiality the au­

<lb/>all the facts susceptible of proof relating to the life
	  <lb/>of <persName>Sarah Maria Cornell</persName>.  Some of these were gain­
<lb/>ed from her own family—others from st<choice><sic/><corr>r</corr></choice>angers.
</p>
        <p><persName rend="case(allcaps)">S. M. Cornell</persName> was born in <date when="1802-05">May 1802</date>, in
	  <lb/><placeName>Rupert</placeName>, <placeName>Vermont</placeName>.  Her mother, the daughter of
	  <lb/><persName>Christopher Leffingwell</persName>, Esq. of <placeName>Norwich</placeName>,<anchor xml:id="a015" corresp="#n015" rend="pre(*)"/> was a
<lb/>well educated and good principled woman, a daugh­
<lb/>ter to one of the first families in the State.  She
<lb/>had been carefully brought up and accustomed only
<pb n="77"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="D6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">77</mw>
<lb/>to the best society.  Unhappily, she contracted
	  <lb/>early in life an unfortunate attachment.  <persName>Mr. Cor­
<lb/>nell</persName> was a person employed in one of the manu­
<lb/>factories belonging to her father.  Good looking
<lb/>and of pleasing address, he succeeded in captiva­
<lb/>ting the affections of a daughter of his employer.
	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Leffingwell</persName> was at first very wroth, and made
<lb/>considerable opposition to the match, but upon be­
<lb/>ing assured by his daughter that she was firmly and
<lb/>immoveably attached to Cornell and could never be
<lb/>happy with any other man, the old gentleman gave
<lb/>up the contest, and suffered the union to take place
<lb/>without further opposition.  His daughter removed
	  <lb/>after marriage to <placeName>Vermont</placeName>, where her children were
<lb/>born;  and here she was destined to taste the bit­
<lb/>terness of an ill assorted union.  Her husband it
<lb/>seemed had formed the design, and it very soon de­
<lb/>veloped, to be supported from his father-in-law's
<lb/>funds, which were supposed inexhaustible, and him­
<lb/>self to be a gentleman at large.  In pursuit of this
<lb/>determination he worked upon the feelings of his
	  <lb/>wife to get her to draw money from her father.  <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Cornell</persName>, who was one of those gentle, unresisting
<lb/>characters that knew not how to contend, suffered
<lb/>herself for some time, though sorely against her
<lb/>feelings, to be influenced to this, and repeatedly
<lb/>drew large sums of money from her indulgent fa­
<lb/>ther, to supply her husband's demands, until at
<lb/>length the old gentleman resolutely refused to ad­
	  <lb/>vance any more;  upon which <persName>Cornell</persName> carried his
<lb/>wife and children to her father's house, and leaving
<lb/>them, quit the country, and relieved himself forever
<lb/>from the task of supporting a woman whom he had
<lb/>probably married without the least sentiment of af­
<lb/>fection whatever, and abandoning the children in

<pb n="78"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="D6v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">78</mw>
<lb/>their helpless infancy, whom the laws of God, and
<lb/>the laws of the land both required him to support.
	  <lb/>What was the situation of <persName>Mr. Leffingwell's</persName> estate
<lb/>at his decease, we do not know, or whether he sup­
<lb/>posed he had bestowed enough upon this daughter;
<lb/>but certain it is that although the rest of the family
<lb/>were in easy circumstances, if not affluent, she and
<lb/>her family were poor, and she and her children
<lb/>found a home with some of their relatives, and ap­
<lb/>pear to have looked chiefly to their own exertions
<lb/>for support.  They were separated, being all brought
<lb/>up at different places, and not even knowing one
<lb/>another for several year. The unfortunate girl who
<lb/>is the subject of this memoir was in the same house
<lb/>with her mother until about eleven years of age.
	  <lb/>She then went to live with a <persName>Mrs. Lathrop</persName> of <placeName>Nor­
<lb/>wich</placeName>, her mother's sister.  With her she continued
<lb/>until fifteen years of age, and then went to learn
<lb/>the tailor's trade, where she staid two years, and
<lb/>then for a time resided with her mother in Bozrah,
	  <lb/>a short distance from <placeName>Norwich</placeName>, working at her
<lb/>trade.
</p>
        <p>During her residence at the house where she
<lb/>learned her trade, her mind appeared for the first
<lb/>time called up to attend to religion.  There was at
<lb/>the time a great reformation, as it is termed, in the
<lb/>neighbourhood—that is, there was a great stir about
<lb/>religion, and much going to meeting, and many
<lb/>professing, of which number doubtless many con­
<lb/>tinued steadfast;  but in a time of such general ex­
<lb/>citement it is known there is a great deal of self­
<lb/>deception.  The quick feelings and sanguine tem­
	  <lb/>perament of <persName>S. M. Cornell</persName> were calculated to mis­
<lb/>lead her, and it was not long before she rushed with
<lb/>the multitude to the altar of baptism, joining herself
<pb n="79"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="E1r"/>

<lb/>in christian communion to the congregation of the

<lb/>No reproach can with justice attach itself to a cler­
<lb/>gyman in such cases, unless they are hurried into
<lb/>such a profession without any time for trial, which
<lb/>was not the case in this instance.  Man cannot
<lb/>look into futurity and tell who will prove stead­
<lb/>fast and who will not, and if a rational person makes
<lb/>a good profession of faith, and avows a resolution
<lb/>to lead a christian life, the minister is bound to re­
<lb/>ceive them, unless he knows something in their
<lb/>present character and conduct at variance with
<lb/>their professions.  For two years she continued
<lb/>steadfast, and it was said a bright example in out­
<lb/>ward conduct;  yet nevertheless the seed had fallen
<lb/>on stony ground, where the earth was not of suffi­
<lb/>cient depth to foster it.  A season of declension
<lb/>succeeded it.  Lightness and vanity again took pos­
<lb/>session of her imagination.  A passion for dress at
<lb/>this time seemed to be a predominant feeling, and
<lb/>that passion she was obliged to set bounds to, be<choice><sic/><corr>-</corr></choice>
<lb/>cause she had not the means of gratifying it.
</p>
        <p>It was at this unfortunate season, the only one it
<lb/>is believed in her existence when the same tempta­
<lb/>tion would have had the same weight, that her mo­
	  <lb/>ther brought her to <placeName>Providence</placeName>.  Her older sister
<lb/>lived there with a relation who had brought her up;
<lb/>and these two sisters, separated for many years, had
<lb/>long desired a reunion.  That wish, so natural, was
<lb/>at last indulged, and like most of our earnest desires
<lb/>for earthly gratification, indulged to their mutual
<lb/>sorrow.  Introduced for the first time since child­
<lb/>hood into the temptations and allurements of a com­
<lb/>mercial town, those feelings of childish vanity, and
<lb/>love of dress, and show, and ornament, which had

<lb/>been growing upon her for some time, seemed com­
<lb/>pletely to get the mastery—and being often in the
<lb/>shops where those articles for which she had so long
<lb/>sighed presented themselves before her—she at
<lb/>length possessed herself of some of them, trifling
<lb/>indeed in amount, but destined to prove her entire
<lb/>destruction in this world as respected character and
<lb/>every thing else.  Though the whole of these arti­
<lb/>cles purloined in a moment of lightness, of thought­
<lb/>lessness and temptation, did not exceed in amount
<lb/>but a very few dollars, it was immediately discover­
<lb/>ed, and the avenger was close upon her heels.  Un­
<lb/>used to crime, her manner at the time was so singu­
<lb/>lar and agitated as to excite suspicion in the store,
<lb/>and she was followed to the house of one of her
<lb/>relatives, where the articles were found—not exceed­
<lb/>ing five dollars in amount, and several very small
<lb/>trifles beside, which she immediately told of and
<lb/>where she got them, and her friends sent them to
<lb/>the gentlemen, and offered to pay all damages, &amp;c.
<lb/>to both;  they exacted nothing however but the
<lb/>amount of the goods.  The grief and agitation of
<lb/>the poor girl vented itself in repeated fits of hysteri­
<lb/>cal laughing and crying at the time, and in the bit­
<lb/>terest self-accusation afterwards, when she seemed
<lb/>fully to realize what she had done, and could those
<lb/>gentleman have known the effect that disgra<choice><sic>e</sic><corr>c</corr></choice>e was
<lb/>to have upon her future destiny, doubtless they
<lb/>would have preferred to have lost ten times the
<lb/>amount rather than have exposed her.  Be that as it
<lb/>may however, the fact that she did purloin these ar­
<lb/>ticles is certain, and I have it in express charge
<lb/>from her nearest kindred, her kind brother and sis­
<lb/>ter, not to attempt to conceal it, but in every thing
<lb/>as far as I can discover the truth to make it mani­

<lb/>fest.  They knew of this delinquency in their sister
<lb/>by her own confession;  she did not attempt to de­
<lb/>ceive them, and they knew of no other instance of
<lb/>the kind of her offending;  they know by the same
<lb/>means, viz. her own confessions, of her intercourse
<lb/>with Avery, and they know of no other person with
<lb/>whom they believe her to have been criminal.  But
<lb/>to go back to the story.<anchor xml:id="a016" corresp="#n016" rend="pre(*)"/>
</p>
        <p>The open, candid manner in which they had be­
<lb/>haved, themselves, and the keen distress of the of­
<lb/>fender herself, certainly induced them to hope she
<lb/>would not be publicly exposed, but by some means
<lb/>or other it was immediately communicated to town
<lb/>and country.  For this they were not prepared, far
<lb/>less did they anticipate that this circumstance would
<lb/>be brought up in a court of justice, eleven years after,
<lb/>to prove that she killed herself, to be avenged on a
<lb/>man who had exposed her misconduct, when she
<lb/>had not even shewn resentment towards them.
</p>
        <p>That this was the only sin of the kind—the only
<lb/>instance of dishonesty that could be brought up
	  <lb/>against <persName>S. M. Cornell</persName>, must be believed by every
	  <lb/>one who ever saw the famous trial of <persName>S. M. Cornell</persName>,
	  <lb/>denominated on the title page, <title>Trial of <persName>E. K. Ave­
<lb/>ry</persName>.</title>  For had there been another thing of the kind
<lb/>known against her—a wit observed as <said>heaven,
<lb/>earth and hell were ransacked for witnesses,</said> it
<lb/>must have made its appearance.  On the contrary,

<lb/>she was afterwards often remarked for the punc­
<lb/>tuality and exact regularity of her dealings.  The
<lb/>writer of these pages knew a milliner with whom
<lb/>she had very considerable dealings at Lowell, and
<lb/>to whom she was often indebted, and who remarked
<lb/><said>that she was the most punctual person in the pay­
<lb/>ment of her debts she had ever known, as she seem­
<lb/>ed to have a principle of honesty about discharging
<lb/>a debt the very day she had promised the money,
<lb/>and always bore in mind the exact sum she owed.</said>
</p>
        <p>It appears that the connexions of <persName>S. M. Cornell</persName>
<lb/>generally, with the exception of her mother, and her
<lb/>kind hearted sister, meant to make her feel the full
<lb/>extent of the offence she had committed.  It does
<lb/>not in the general way require much to set rich re­
<lb/>lations against poor ones—but here was ample room
<lb/>for feelings of superiority over <emph rend="slant(italic)">poor,</emph> fallen human
<lb/>nature.  Some of her connexions shut the door in
<lb/>her face when she called to see them afterwards—
<lb/>and for the most part they manifested a very <emph rend="slant(italic)">proper</emph>
<lb/><emph rend="slant(italic)">detestation</emph> of her offence, by displaying <emph rend="slant(italic)">proper re­
<lb/>sentment.</emph> She returned to the country and resumed
<lb/>her employment, but the story got there before her.
<lb/>She had relinquished her former employment of
<lb/>tailoring and gone to work in a factory.  Here she
<lb/>was now regarded with a degree of suspicion, painful
<lb/>in the extreme to a person of her natural pride, and
<lb/>she quit the place and went to another, but being
<lb/>dissatisfied with the employment, again resumed her
<lb/>sewing, and went to live with a merchant tailor in a
<lb/>neighboring town;  she continued in her employment
<lb/>some months, when the story reached the family that
<lb/>she <said><emph rend="slant(italic)">had been talked about</emph>,</said> which caused them to
<lb/>watch her with scrupulous regard.  There was a
<lb/>young gentleman then in the neighborhood who
<pb n="83"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="E3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">83</mw>
<lb/>used to go often into the shop, and frequently sit
<lb/>down by her and converse, sometimes in an under
<lb/>tone, and sometimes he would invite her to take a
<lb/>walk of a pleasant evening, and she would go with
<lb/>him.  This circumstance, as he was a young and
<lb/>unengaged man, and she very pretty, would proba­
<lb/>bly of itself have caused no suspicion, had not the
<lb/>saying that she had been talked about been so often
<lb/>repeated.  She did not board with the family who
<lb/>employed her, but in the family of a respectable
<lb/>physician on the other side of the way:  and being
<lb/>convinced by the circumstance just related, joined
<lb/>to the saying that she had been <said>talked about,</said>
<lb/>though they did not exactly know for what, that her
<lb/>character was not good, the wife of her employer
<lb/>took it upon her to dismiss her;  and sending for her
<lb/>to come in, begun by accusing her of <said>imposing
<lb/>herself upon their society when her character was
<lb/>not good;</said>  and having said all she judged necessa­
<lb/>ry on that head, she formally dismissed her from
<lb/>their employment.  During all this time the poor,
<lb/>persecuted girl only opposed tears to the reproaches
<lb/>heaped upon her.  She knew that she had, by one
<lb/>indiscretion, by one violation of that command,
<lb/><said>thou shalt not covet any thing that is thy neigh­
<lb/>bor's,</said> brought reproach upon her good name;  and
<lb/>she probably thought they knew of it, and said
<lb/>nothing because she could not bear to hear it named.
<lb/>She only asked permission to remain until next
<lb/>day, when the stage would pass, which was grant­
<lb/>ed.  <said>To this day,</said>  said the lady who had vented
<lb/>these reproaches, <said>to this day, my conscience re­
<lb/>proaches me for the harshness with which I spoke
<lb/>to her, when memory recalls the tears she shed, and
<lb/>her meek, forbearing manners, and I must say, that
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">E*</mw>
<pb n="84"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="E3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">84</mw>
<lb/>she had the meekest temper, and one of the mildest
<lb/>and sweetest dispositions I ever met with.</said>  She
<lb/>added, that that very night a relation of theirs who
<lb/>was then very ill in their house, was distressed for
<lb/>a watcher, they having sent half over the neighbor­
	  <lb/>hood for one without succes<choice><sic/><corr>s</corr></choice>; which <persName>S. M. Cornell</persName>
<lb/>hearing of, immediately offered to watch with her,
<lb/>and though they were ashamed to accept of her
<lb/>services, they were constrained to;  and that she was
<lb/>so kind and attentive to the sick, that the woman
<lb/>after her recovery often enquired after her, saying,
<lb/><said>she was the kindest and best person to the sick,
<lb/>she ever saw.</said>
</p>
        <p>From this place it appears she went to <placeName>Slaters­
	    <lb/>ville</placeName>, <placeName>Rhode-Island</placeName>, and commenced working again
	  <lb/>in the factory;  soon after which, a <persName>Mr. Taylor</persName>, a
	  <lb/><name>Methodist</name>, commenced preaching there, and here
	  <lb/>again there was a great stir about religion. <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Taylor</persName> was one of their popular preachers—there
	  <lb/>was a great reformation, and <persName>S. M. Cornell</persName>, who
<lb/>had for some time given up the idea that she had ev­
<lb/>er possessed religion, was once more awakened;
<lb/>and having, by some means or other, become per­
<lb/>suaded that immersion was the only Scripture way
<lb/>of baptism, felt desirous to be rebaptized.  After a
<lb/>profession of faith and going through all the prelim­
<lb/>inaries, she was accordingly immersed;  and the
<lb/>Methodist meeting, who profess to believe that wa­
<lb/>ter administered in any form, in the name of the
<lb/>Trinity, is baptism, and who baptize in both ways
<lb/>themselves, had no hesitation in rebaptizing her.
<lb/>However, that is of minor consequence to what fol­
<lb/>lowed.  She continued in fellowship with them, it
	  <lb/>appears by her letters, during her stay in <placeName>Slatersville</placeName>,
<lb/>which must have been over two years;  for she staid
<pb n="85"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="E4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">85</mw>
<lb/>there until the factory burnt down, and then of course
<lb/>had to depart <choice><sic>i<g ref="#invertedn"/></sic><corr>in</corr></choice> search of employment. With sev­
<lb/>eral others she removed to the Branch factory, a few
<lb/>miles off.  Here she staid until the water becoming
<lb/>very low, there was not steady employment, when
	  <lb/>she removed to <placeName>Millville</placeName>, to the satinett factory.
<lb/>From this place, only about a mile and a half from
	  <lb/><placeName>Slatersville</placeName>, it will be seen by her letters, she attend­
	  <lb/>ed her beloved Methodist meeting at <placeName>Slatersville</placeName>,
<lb/>and appears to have felt great joy at finding herself
<lb/>so near there again.  No person can read her let­
<lb/>ters and suppose she feigned what she wrote.  Just
	  <lb/>before her leaving <placeName>Smithfield</placeName>, i. e. <placeName>Slatersville</placeName>, <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Rawson</persName>, her brother-in-law, went and carried her
	  <lb/>brother, who had been absent several years at <placeName>New-
<lb/>Orleans</placeName>, to visit her, and inquired of the family
	  <lb/>where she boarded, <said>how <persName>Maria</persName> got along?</said>  <said xml:id="q025">Very
<lb/>well indeed,</said> was the reply, <said xml:id="q026">and much engaged
<lb/>in religion,</said> they added, <said xml:id="q027">and set a very good exam­
<lb/>ple.</said>
</p>
        <p>While at this place her zeal in the cause of meet­
<lb/>ings continued.  It appears she was in the habit
	  <lb/>of walking down to <placeName>Slatersville</placeName>, on all occasions, to
<lb/>meetings;  and that in the prayer meetings as well
<lb/>as those for exhortation, she usually took a part,
<lb/>and was called an active member.  We do not
<lb/>know whether she was censured at this time, but
<lb/>this fact we do know from letters in our possession,
<lb/>that she was in the habit of corresponding with
<lb/>methodist sisters at this time, and subsequent to it,
<lb/>who were highly spoken of for piety and consist­
<lb/>ence.  We have some directed to this last place,
<lb/>and they address her as <said>worthy sister,</said> and so­
<lb/>licit an interest in her prayers.
</p>
        <p>It had been the intention of <persName>Maria</persName> (by that
<pb n="86"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="E4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">86</mw>
	  <lb/>name she was generally called) to return to <placeName>Sla­
<lb/>tersville</placeName> as soon as the new manufactory should
<lb/>be completed, and never to leave the people with
<lb/>whom she was connected there until death, but
<lb/>unfortunately the works did not keep pace with
<lb/>her impatience;  she disliked the woollen factory
	  <lb/>where she worked at <placeName>Millville</placeName>, and one of the girls
<lb/>who had been a favorite companion and sister in
	  <lb/>the church persuaded her to go to <placeName>Lowell</placeName>, and de­
<lb/>claring her determination to go there first, which
	  <lb/>she did not however do immediately, as <persName>Maria</persName> came
<lb/>to Providence to visit her friends, or more particu­
<lb/>larly to visit her dear mother;  and after staying
	  <lb/>some little time in <placeName>Providence</placeName> and <placeName>Pawtucket</placeName>, re­
<lb/>ceived a line from her friend urging her again to
	  <lb/>go to <placeName>Lowell</placeName>, and naming a place on the road,
<lb/>where they would meet on a certain day provided
	  <lb/>she would comply.  The place was in <placeName>Dedham</placeName>,
<lb/>and here they concluded to remain, but there being
<lb/>no methodist meeting, she became discontented,
<lb/>and after four weeks residence there proceeded to
	  <lb/><placeName>Dorchester</placeName>.  What caused all this delay in going to
	  <lb/><placeName>Lowell</placeName> is not known, unless some guardian spirit in­
<lb/>terposed and delayed her progress to the place which
<lb/>was to consummate her destruction.  During the
<lb/>time of her sojourn in the towns already mentioned,
<lb/>at several different times she received attentions
<lb/>from some young man, who she thought and others
<lb/>thought wished to marry her.  Many young men
<lb/>make a practice it is well known of amusing them­
<lb/>selves at the expense of young women who are ap­
<lb/>parently without friends and natural protectors to
<lb/>call them to account for such baseness and compel
	  <lb/>them to act honorably.  <persName>S. M. Cornell</persName> had the curse
<lb/>of beauty, and she was not without admirers.  She
<pb n="87"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="E5r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">87</mw>
<lb/>was naturally of an affectionate and confiding dis­
<lb/>position.  Her manners too, all partook of that char­
<lb/>acter of fondness for which she has been so unjustly
<lb/>censured.  She loved her mother and sisters, and
<lb/>her letters bespeak any thing but a depraved heart.
<lb/>It is an indisputable fact that an abandoned woman
<lb/>is without natural affection, and we see that she was
<lb/>the very reverse of this.  Her letters she did not
<lb/>even know would be preserved.  Little could the
<lb/>poor, unfortunate girl have dreamed of the use here
<lb/>made of them:  they were only to meet the eye of
<lb/>her sister and her aged and bowed down mother.
<lb/>It seemed as though her affections sought constant­
<lb/>ly for some object upon which to repose themselves,
<lb/>for something to lavish that tenderness upon with
<lb/>which her heart was overflowing.  Disappointed in
<lb/>her first choice—(which has been basely insinuated
<lb/>was her sister's husband—a tissue of falsehoods
<lb/>from beginning to end)—disappointed in those
<lb/>schemes of earthly happiness upon which her heart
<lb/>had once been set, she strove to forget all but her
<lb/>duty, and to love God alone:  nevertheless, there
<lb/>were times when she could not help, situated as she
<lb/>was, desiring some respectable connexion and de­
<lb/>cent settlement in life;  and it is believed that she
<lb/>received the attentions of several young men who
<lb/>professed to her honorable attachment, with the
<lb/>laudable object in view of obtaining such settlement.
<lb/>How different her fate would have been could she
<lb/>have been settled in life and tied to the duties of a
<lb/>wife and mother, we cannot now say, but the prob­
<lb/>ability is she would have made a very respectable
<lb/>figure in society, and a much better wife than ordi­
<lb/>nary, owing to the natural docility of her disposition,
<lb/>her perfect habitual good nature, and forbearance
<pb n="88"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="E5v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">88</mw>
<lb/>and forgiveness.  But the waywardness of her des­
<lb/>tiny prevented, and perhaps the providence of God,
<lb/>which sometimes ordains partial evils to promote
<lb/>some universal good, ordered it otherwise.
</p>
        <p>The religion of this ill fated girl, it will be seen
<lb/>by her letters, was a religion of feelings and frames.
<lb/>Though there is no doubt it was sincere, yet it was
<lb/>of that unstable kind that is most apt to fail when
<lb/>most needed.  She had engaged in it in a time of
<lb/>high excitement, and its existence was preserved—
<lb/>while it was preserved—by constant application of
<lb/>the means which created it:  viz.  by frequent atten­
<lb/>dance on those exciting meetings where highly
<lb/>wrought feeling and sometimes hysterical affection
<lb/>is often mistaken for devotion.  While there, there
<lb/>is no doubt she thought herself in the enjoyment of
<lb/>religion;  and when out, the mind and spirits, by a
<lb/>natural reaction, would suffer a correspondent de­
<lb/>pression, and the same stimulus must be again re­
<lb/>sorted to.  It will be observed that the style of the
<lb/>letters, which follow this slight sketch, varied mate­
	  <lb/>rially after a years residence at <placeName>Lowell</placeName>, and were
<lb/>less frequent.  Previous to this date, during a res­
	  <lb/>idence of more than a year in <placeName>Dorchester</placeName>, and the one
	  <lb/>year that succe<choice><sic/><corr>e</corr></choice>ded in <placeName>Lowell</placeName>, religion seemed to be
<lb/>the chief subject of her correspondence;  soon after
<lb/>which, it is evident the subject, for some reason or
<lb/>other, flagged:  and her last letters, few and far be­
<lb/>tween, do not even make mention of the subject.
<lb/>That there was a cause for this, no one can doubt.
<lb/>She could write of it when in the confusion of a
<lb/>boarding house, as she says, with <said>sixty boarders,</said>
<lb/>and sometimes, nearly <said>all gabbling at once.</said>  But
<lb/>something has happened to damp her zeal now, or
<lb/>conscience whispers, <said>Thou that preachest to
<lb/>others, art thou a castaway?</said></p>
        <pb n="89"/>
        <milestone unit="sig" n="E6r"/>
        <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">89</mw>
        <p>That she felt the want of a friend, that she desir­
<lb/>ed one, is something so natural and proper that we
<lb/>cannot blame her for it.  And that the warm tide of
<lb/>her affections sought for rest on some object was no
<lb/>fault of hers, but that they should have centred at
<lb/>last on a married man, was shocking indeed.
<lb/>That that man was her minister, the person who
<lb/>broke the sacramental bread, and presented the sa­
<lb/>cramental cup, was an aggravation of her crime, a
<lb/>heinous aggravation.  Although it is to be presumed
<lb/>one of that sacred character might have more influ­
<lb/>ence over the opinions of a person than any other;
<lb/>yet any attempts at familiarity ought to be doubly
<lb/>offensive in such, since it proves at once that he
<lb/>is a hypocrite.
</p>
        <p>As to the opinion of attachment on the part of <persName>S. M.
<lb/>Cornell</persName> towards her minister, we ground it on these
<lb/>facts.  First, by her letters themselves;  not merely
<lb/>because they shew a decline in religious zeal at the
<lb/>time when we believe it commenced, but from this
<lb/>circumstance:—that the name of Avery is never
<lb/>mentioned by her in any of them.  She appears to
<lb/>speak with freedom of other persons, and other minis­
	  <lb/>ters;  of <persName>Mr. Taylor</persName>, <persName>Oathman</persName>, <persName>Maffit</persName> and others;  but
<lb/>his name she studiously avoids.  She was not only
	  <lb/>three years at <placeName>Lowell</placeName>, the greater part of which time
<lb/>she sat under his daily and nightly ministrations, but
	  <lb/>she heard him at <placeName>Great Falls</placeName> and in other places in
	  <lb/>the neighborhood of <placeName>Boston</placeName>.  Yet his name never es­
<lb/>capes her pen.  There must be some reason for this.
<lb/>As has been said, she seemed to contrive to be some­
<lb/>where within the range of his preaching from the
<lb/>first of her acquaintance with him.  Whether it was
<lb/>by her contrivance or his however, it is impossible
<lb/>for us to say, since she cannot tell, and he wont tell.
<pb n="90"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="E6v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">90</mw>
<lb/>How the intimacy commenced, and whether it was
	  <lb/>of a criminal nature previous to the <name>Camp-Meeting</name>
	  <lb/>at <placeName>Thompson</placeName>, we believe no one has taken upon
<lb/>themselves positively to say;  but from what is related
<lb/>of the circumstances of their intimacy, every one can
<lb/>judge.  The Parson, it is said, was a very polite man
<lb/>to females, frequently inviting some one of them to
<lb/>ride to a meeting or an evening lecture with him in
<lb/>his covered Carryall, and that he sometimes did the
<lb/>deceased the honor of riding with her.  It will be
	  <lb/>recollected that at the <placeName>Bristol</placeName> examination <persName>Avery</persName> or
	  <lb/>some of his friends stated the fact that <persName>S. M. Cor­
<lb/>nell</persName> had lived a short time in his family, but that
	  <lb/><persName>Mrs. Avery</persName> was not satisfied with her, and she had
<lb/>been dismissed.
</p>
        <p>At the time the sheriff passed through <placeName>Lowell</placeName> in
	  <lb/>pursuit of <persName>Avery</persName>, after his flight from justice, he
<lb/>learnt some very important particulars respecting
<lb/>this and others connected with it, and afterwards
<lb/>proposed laying it before the court upon his trial,
<lb/>but was told they were inadmissible, since it was
<lb/>not any particular act of impropriety in the priso­
<lb/>ner's life, previous to the commission of the crime
<lb/>for which he stood indicted, but his general charac­
<lb/>ter which they wished to know, and which could
<lb/>alone in this case be considered as evidence.  And
<lb/>as the sheriff was not prepared to prove that his
<lb/><emph rend="slant(italic)">general</emph> character, or that of any other preacher,
<lb/>was that of a rake, he of course kept it back:  some of
<lb/>this found its way afterwards into the public papers
<lb/>of the day, and upon examination, the facts appear
<lb/>to be these.
</p>
        <p>First, that <persName>S. M. Cornell</persName> was a resident in the
	  <lb/>family of <persName>E. K. Avery</persName> about a week, and that dur­
<lb/>ing that time he used to come out of her room after
<pb n="91"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F1r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">91</mw>
<lb/>ten o'clock at night;  and that the family, on being
<lb/>questioned upon the subject, gave as a reason <said>that
<lb/>she was ill, and sent for him to come in and pray
<lb/>with her.</said>
</p>
        <p>Secon<choice><sic/><corr>d</corr></choice>ly, that his wife, though habitually a mild,
<lb/>forbearing woman, on this occasion rose, and posi­
<lb/>tively declared <said>she would not have the girl in the
<lb/>house any longer,</said> when she went away.
</p>
        <p>Thirdly, that it was customary for him to be shut
<lb/>in his study with some young woman or other al­
<lb/>most every day;  sometimes several, in the course of
<lb/>the day.  Very seldom any of these were seen by
<lb/>his wife;  but that unfortunate woman was often seen
<lb/>with eyes red and swollen, as though she had re­
<lb/>cently been in tears;  and though used to speak
	  <lb/>mildly, she never mentioned the name of <persName>S. M. Cor­
<lb/>nell</persName> but with evident resentment and bitterness of
<lb/>feeling, even after she had gone from there.
</p>
        <p>Fourthly, that he was in the habit of keeping
<lb/>very late hours;  being out without his wife;  and
<lb/>giving no satisfactory account of himself, not even
<lb/>to the family in the house, whose rest he often dis­
<lb/>turbed, by obliging them to sit up for him, as they
<lb/>did not feel safe to retire and leave the front door
<lb/>unfastened:  that on one occasion, after returning
<lb/>from their own prayer meeting, at nine o'clock,
<lb/>(the time such meetings usually close,) and setting
	  <lb/>up<anchor xml:id="a017" corresp="#n017" rend="pre(*)"/> for <persName>Avery</persName> until after eleven, they retired, and
<lb/>he behaved with must unbecoming passion, beating
<lb/>and banging the door as though he would stave it
<lb/>in, and that the owner of the house hurried to let
<lb/>him in as quick as possible, and then retreated;
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">F</mw>
<pb n="92"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F1v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">92</mw>
	  <lb/>when <persName>Avery</persName> entered, flung the door to<choice><sic>o</sic><corr/></choice>, and snatch­
<lb/>ing the key from the lock, carried it to his cham­
<lb/>ber.  The master of the house followed him, and
<lb/>made him return the key.  These things, together
<lb/>with others of an aggravating nature determined the
<lb/>family not to reside any longer under the same roof,
<lb/>but having a chance to sell the house, they removed
<lb/>and left him in it.  That it was not wholly on ac­
<lb/>count of his late hours, so unbecoming in a clergy­
<lb/>man, but on account of other things which they dis­
<lb/>liked;  one of which was the frequent closetings with
<lb/>young women in the study, which stood at the head
<lb/>of the stairs and contained a bed;  and was rather
<lb/>remote from the sitting room and lodging room of his
<lb/>wife, having to pass through the front entry and
<lb/>front room, and a passage way, to get to the kitch­
	  <lb/>en where <persName>Mrs. Avery</persName> usually staid and lodged.
</p>
        <p>We do not place so much confidence in other
<lb/>things coming from a child, as they did, children
<lb/>being so prone to exaggerate and misrepresent;  yet
	  <lb/>it appears the little boy of <persName>Avery</persName>, after having ac­
<lb/>companied him on one of his rides, said on his re­
	  <lb/>turn, <said>Pa kissed <persName>Sarah Maria Cornell</persName> on the road</said>:
<lb/>and that the feelings of the gentleman in the house
<lb/>were considerably tried upon observing at one time
<lb/>a wonderful alteration in the horse usually rode by
<lb/>him.  His little boy accounted for it, by saying,
<lb/>that <said rend="pre(“)post()">the horse kicked his father, and he drove two
<lb/>spikes into the floor and tied his heels down, and
<lb/>kept him there two days without anything to eat or
<lb/>drink.</said><anchor xml:id="a018" corresp="#n018" rend="pre(*)"/> Of course, much was said respecting this
<lb/>man which was false:  there is no one so base but
<pb xml:id="docb02" corresp="#hypb02"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">93</mw>
<lb/>may, after all, be slandered.  For instance, the sto­
<lb/>ry of the mysterious and sudden death of his first
<lb/>wife must have been altogether false, for we cannot
<lb/>find that he ever had but one wife.  There is
<lb/>enough of what justly belongs to this unhappy man,
<lb/>without any effort of imagination to add to it.
</p>
        <p>We have but one remark to make respecting the
<lb/>intimacy at the house, which is, that if an intrigue
<lb/>commenced at his own house, at that time;  that if
<lb/>it was indeed true she used to send for him at that
<lb/>hour of the night to come to her room to pray with
<lb/>her, <emph rend="slant(italic)">she courted destruction</emph>, and might almost be
<lb/>said to deserve the fate it is supposed she met with
<lb/>at his hands.  If, on the contrary, he stole into her
<lb/>room, without an invitation, the case might be a lit­
<lb/>tle different.  That he was there, I suppose to be
<lb/>a fact.  That she cherished an uncommon regard
<lb/>for him, criminal as that affection was in her case,
	  <lb/>was evinced, as <persName>Doct. Wilbour</persName> observed, <said>by the
<lb/>absence of resentful feelings.</said> It was strange in­
<lb/>deed, if she had suffered the injury she complained
<lb/>of, at the <name>Camp Meeting</name>, without manifesting any
<lb/>resentment afterwards, she should, on the contrary,
<lb/>uniformily speak of him and his family with tender­
<lb/>ness, and above all things seem not to desire to ex­
<lb/>pose him.  It may be enquired, if this were the case,
<lb/>why did she leave that little bit of paper to direct, <said rend="pre()post()">if
<lb/>she was missing to enquire of him?</said> To that we
<lb/>answer, that our heavenly Father has implanted a
<lb/>something within us, that never fails to warn us of
<lb/>approaching danger:  some call it <said>a presentiment
<pb n="94"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">94</mw>
<lb/>of evil.</said>  But in her case there was something to
<lb/>fear exclusive of any resentment;  that was, if her
<lb/>tale was true—if she had once had poison recom­
<lb/>mended her, and been warned by him who told her
	  <lb/>not to take it, neither to go to <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, nor to put
<lb/>herself in his power, but to have him come to her
<lb/>fairly and honourably, and settle it—if she had re­
<lb/>ceived this warning, she could not but have some
<lb/>fear.  It was neither fair nor honourable in the first
<lb/>place, to ask a female to go to that cold, lonely place
<lb/>on a dark evening.  She knew, probably, it was a
<lb/>fearful thing under such circumstances, or indeed
<lb/>under any, to go there to an assignation.  The dark,
	  <lb/>deep waters of <placeName>Mount Hope</placeName> bay rolled below, and
<lb/>it would have been as easy to give one a plunge
<lb/>there, as to have poured down a dose of tansy oil.
</p>
        <p>That she had peculiar feelings of regard for this
<lb/>man may be inferred from the speech she made to
	  <lb/><persName>Benjamin H. Saunders</persName> also.  It does not appear
<lb/>there was any positive proof of any thing criminal
	  <lb/>in her conduct while at <placeName>Lowell</placeName>, by any testimony
<lb/>on the trial, if we except the testimony of the phy­
<lb/>sician before named.
</p>
        <p>It seems <persName>S. M. Cornell</persName> was expelled from meet­
	  <lb/>ing while absent at a <name>Camp Meeting</name> on <placeName>Cape Cod</placeName>;
	  <lb/>and <persName>Avery</persName> tells, that he <said>advised her to go away
<lb/>while the process was going on against her</said>:  but
<lb/>if the complaint was made against her previously, it
<lb/>was the height of impudence, to say no more of it,
<lb/>to suffer her to go to such a place, where the facili­
<lb/>ties for vice are so great.  There cannot be, per­
<lb/>haps, exhibited, a greater proof of superstition, than
<lb/>the offer of this girl to make an acknowledgment
<lb/>to the meeting of what she, at the same time, sol­
<lb/>emnly declares herself to be innocent of, merely for
<pb n="95"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">95</mw>
<lb/>the sake of being in church membership:  for it was
<lb/>upon those conditions she offered it.  As though to
<lb/>be out of the pale of the church was to be excluded
<lb/>from salvation.  Her own words were said to be
	  <lb/>these, in a letter to <persName>Avery</persName>, where she gives a cir­
<lb/>cumstantial and satisfactory account of her inter­
<lb/>views with the physician:—<said>yet I will confess all,
<lb/>if I can only be continued in the church.</said>  Some
<lb/>suppose that the desire to be near a certain minis­
<lb/>ter of that church was the great inducement, and
<lb/>that for his sake, or for the sake of being near him,
<lb/>she was willing to endure any disgrace, and would
<lb/>have signed any thing but her death warrant.  There
<lb/>is one anecdote, which has been related to the wri­
<lb/>ter of this, which proves she could not have been
<lb/>the abandoned creature represented previous to this.
	  <lb/><persName>S. M. Cornell</persName>, at one of the places where she lived,
<lb/>worked in the employ of two brothers, partners in
<lb/>an establishment.  Something had been said in
<lb/>their hearing about her not being prudent;  and the
<lb/>oldest formed the resolution to find out how far her
<lb/>imprudence extended.  He accordingly put himself
<lb/>repeatedly in her way, and at last insulted her with
<lb/>the declaration of his passion, which she resented
<lb/>firmly, and with some bitter reproaches.  (They
<lb/>were both married men.)  The older confided the
<lb/>affair to the younger, who felt piqued to try himself.
<lb/>He accordingly commenced a regular siege:  but in
<lb/>the moment when he thought himself sure of suc­
<lb/>cess, met with a still more severe repulse than his
<lb/>brother.  Upon comparing notes, they agreed it was
<lb/>only because they were married men;  but as they
<lb/>felt somewhat in her power, concluded that it was
<lb/>not prudent to have her there.  They accordingly
<lb/>gave her a hint her services were no longer wanted
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">F*</mw>
<pb n="96"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">96</mw>
<lb/>after which, being questioned with respect to her
<lb/>departure, said <said>she was rather too fond of young
<lb/>men</said>: though, as the gentleman said who related this
<lb/>and who, being in their employ, overheard the con­
<lb/>versation between them, when they agreed to get rid
<lb/>of her, <said>he did not know what proof they had of
<lb/>her being fond of <emph rend="slant(italic)">young men,</emph> except that she did
<lb/>not like <emph rend="slant(italic)">old ones</emph>.</said>
</p>
        <p>Various anecdotes too have been related to the
<lb/>author respecting the charity, kindness of heart and
	  <lb/>gentle disposition of <persName>S. M. Cornell</persName>:  but they would
<lb/>swell this volume beyond the bounds allotted to a
<lb/>work of this kind.  Suffice it to say, that from all
<lb/>accounts, it appears her hand was ever open to the
<lb/>suffering poor, according to her slender means;  that
<lb/>she was liberal to the society of which she was a
<lb/>member, and who did not disdain to receive of the
<lb/>pittance which her labour produced, towards promo­
	  <lb/>ting <name>Methodism</name>, whatever they may have thought of
<lb/>her character;  that she was kind to the sick and
<lb/>afflicted;  and retained a most affectionate regard
<lb/>towards her relatives, through the whole of her long
<lb/>absence from them.<anchor xml:id="a019" corresp="#n019" rend="pre(*)"/>
</p>
        <p>From <placeName>Lowell</placeName> she went to <placeName>Great Falls</placeName>, <placeName>N. H.</placeName> and
<pb n="97"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">97</mw>
<lb/>here the same contradiction occurs with respect to
<lb/>what was said of her.  A very decent and respecta­
<lb/>ble young man who boarded with her the whole
<lb/>time of her residence there, has testified to the au­
<lb/>thor, that he never knew of any thing being said or
<lb/>thought there, to her disadvantage;  that her con­
<lb/>duct, and he saw her daily, was as<choice><sic> as</sic><corr/></choice> becoming as
<lb/>that of any female he ever was acquainted with.
<lb/>Two respectable females too, who saw much of her
<lb/>during that time, testify to the same.  Likewise at
<lb/>Taunton, where she next went, and where she had
<lb/>a place of considerable trust, having to keep the
<lb/>books of the weaving room, her character and con­
<lb/>duct was respectable.  So persons, who boarded
<lb/>and worked in the same room, with her, testified
<lb/>that <said>she was much made of,</said> as he expressed it,
<lb/>and visited in very respectable company in the
<lb/>place.
</p>
        <p>While on a visit to her brother <persName>Rawson's</persName> in
	  <lb/><placeName>Woodstock</placeName>, it was remarked that her conduct was
<lb/>strickly proper by the young men working with her
<lb/>brother, as well as by other members of the family;
<lb/>by customers at the shop and visiters at the house;
	  <lb/>and especially by <persName>Mr. Cornell</persName>, the Congregational­
<lb/>ist clergyman, who, living quite near, was often in,
<lb/>and held frequent dialogues with her upon the sub­
<lb/>ject of Methodist principles and discipline, for which
<lb/>she, of course, was a great stickler, and they obser­
<lb/>ved, defended the cause with considerable skill.<anchor xml:id="a020" corresp="#n020" rend="pre(*)"/>
</p>
        <p>Previous to the fatal <name>Camp Meeting</name>, at <placeName>Thompson</placeName>,
<lb/>it seems her conduct there was without suspicion;
<pb n="98"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">98</mw>
<lb/>and could she have rested content without another in­
	  <lb/>terview with <persName>Avery</persName>, it is probable this last final work
<lb/>of destruction might have been avoided.  We have
<lb/>however the charity for her to believe, her intentions
<lb/>at this time to lead a new life were sincere, and that
<lb/>the interview, if planned by her, was only to obtain
<lb/>the letter of acknowledgment which it seems she
<lb/>had been influenced to write.   That letter, she
<lb/>found was having a fatal effect upon her character,
<lb/>and what was of more consequence in her own view,
<lb/>was depriving her of her communion with the church;
<lb/>to secure which privilege she seems to have written
<lb/>it, expecting that the command of scripture to for­
<lb/>give all who confess and ask forgiveness, would be
	  <lb/>literally obeyed.  By the testimony of <persName>Benjamin
<lb/>Saunders</persName>, who lived there and was in the habit of
<lb/>going to the post office for her, it appears she cor­
	  <lb/>responded with a minister in <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, previous to the
<lb/><name>Camp Meeting</name>;  who the minister was admits not
<lb/>of a doubt, especially as she requested him to keep
<lb/>it a secret, and by no means to let her sister know.
<lb/>He recollected the circumstance by a speech from
<lb/>her highly characteristic;  on occasion of carrying
<lb/>one of them to the office, said he, <said>I would not pay
<lb/>postage for a minister, should think he was able to
<lb/>pay it himself.</said>  She answered, <said>I want to help
<lb/>the minister all I can.</said>
</p>
        <p>Through all the vicissitudes of life woman will be
<lb/>woman still.  Of the tenderness of woman's heart
<lb/>man can seldom form an idea;  here was an instance.
<lb/>There can be no doubt that this girl had great
<lb/>cause of resentment towards the person she had
<lb/>been writing to, and very possibly she wrote in harsh
<lb/>terms, requiring him to come, and bring that letter
<lb/>of acknowledgment with him;  but come to the trial,
<pb n="99"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F5r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">99</mw>
<lb/>that resentment could not even enable her to lay
<lb/>upon him the burthen of paying the postage of a
<lb/>letter.  No wonder she made so many objections to
<lb/>naming a large sum as the settlement with her,
	  <lb/>which the benevolent physician of <placeName>Fall River</placeName> re­
<lb/>commended;  she could not endure the causing him
<lb/>inconvenience.  That fatal tenderness too, doubtless
<lb/>betrayed her at the camp ground;  perhaps, and let
<lb/>us in charity suppose it, she meant from hencefor­
<lb/>ward to leave the path of sin, and walk in that nar­
<lb/>row one that leads to life, and trusted to her reso­
<lb/>lutions to meet and part with him without any ac­
<lb/>tions that virtue could condemn;  the sight of him
<lb/>put all her good resolutions to flight, and that beguile­
<lb/>ing tenderness again plunged her into misery and
<lb/>irremediable distress.  Her only road to safety
<lb/>would have been in not seeing him at all.  Gone
<lb/>was the look of cheerfulness she was wont to wear;
<lb/>it was evident something pressed heavy on her heart.
<lb/>The sense of her crime and the dread of its conse­
<lb/>quences at length impelled her to yield to the solic­
<lb/>itations of her affectionate sister, and confide to her
<lb/>the humiliating cause of her grief and anxiety;  that
<lb/>sister who had but one heart and mind with her
<lb/>husband, immediately sought counsel of him.  What
<lb/>to do, or how to conduct themselves in such a strange
<lb/>case they scarce knew, and the brother finally re­
<lb/>solved to ask counsel of his pastor, and subsequently
<lb/>of another friend, an attorney in the neighborhood.
<lb/>They advised her immediate removal into the State
	  <lb/>of <placeName>Rhode-Island</placeName> where <persName>Avery</persName> resided;  and the
<lb/>brother feeling a delicacy about her remaining in
<lb/>the shop where his young men were, willingly acce­
	  <lb/>ded to the plan.  She herself proposed to go to <placeName>Fall
<lb/>River</placeName> and work there in a factory while able to work,
<pb n="100"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F5v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">100</mw>
<lb/>and until he should make some provision for her.
<lb/>Here she lived for about two months without re­
<lb/>proach or suspicion, being perfectly correct, as every
<lb/>one supposed who saw her, in her conduct.  In the
<lb/>respectable house where she boarded, and where
<lb/>there was a small family consisting of females, she
<lb/>was much beloved, having won their regard by the
<lb/>gentleness of her manners and the apparent amia­
<lb/>bility of her temper.  To the daughter of this fam­
<lb/>ily in particular, she was in the habit of speaking
<lb/>with some confidence, when she showed those cele­
<lb/>brated letters of different colors mentioned in the
<lb/>trial.  This young lady remarked the pink and yel­
<lb/>low ones appeared to be written by different hands,
<lb/>and that one looked like a lady's hand—and that
	  <lb/><persName>S. M. Cornell</persName> answered, <said>but they are both written
	    <lb/>by one hand, by a gentleman in <placeName>Bristol</placeName>.</said>  This an­
<lb/>swer the witness was about to repeat in court, when
<lb/>she was stopped by the prisoner's counsel.  She
	  <lb/>(<persName>S. M. C.</persName>) told them several times that she was only
<lb/>waiting for some money she was expecting to re­
	  <lb/>ceive, when she should leave <placeName>Fall River</placeName>.  The flut­
<lb/>ter of spirits, which made her on the last day of her
<lb/>life more cheerful than usual may be easily account­
<lb/>ed for.  She came out of the mill early and changed
<lb/>her clothes, and then probably wrote that little strip
	  <lb/>of paper, <said>If I am missing enquire of <persName>Rev. E. K.
<lb/>Avery</persName>.</said>  Her habitual politeness never deserted
<lb/>her;  even then while drinking tea, which was got
<lb/>early for her at her request, she said, <said>It is not
<lb/>very polite for me to be drinking tea here alone I
<lb/>know, before the rest, but I am in such a hurry,</said>
<lb/>and turning to the oldest sister, she said as she went
	  <lb/>out, <said>I think I shall be back as soon now, as <persName>Lucy</persName>
<lb/>returns from the factory.</said>  Alas!  she returned no
<lb/>more.</p>

        <p>Of the birth, parentage and early life of <persName>E. K.
<lb/>Avery</persName>, we know nothing, except that we are inform­
<lb/>ed he was the son of a revolutionary soldier;  if that
<lb/>be the case every one must rejoice he was spared
	  <lb/>the fate that threatened him in <date when="1833-05"><name>May</name>, 1833</date>.  It would
<lb/>indeed be a kind of blot upon the history of the
<lb/>brave defenders of our soil, that one of their children
<lb/>should come to such an ignominious punishment,
<lb/>since it is the disgrace that constitutes the evil with
<lb/>men, though with God it is the sin.  We are sorry
<lb/>to say we have so little account of the early years of
<lb/>a man who has made so much noise in the world;
<lb/>but from the time we can get any thing of his histo­
<lb/>ry, there seems to be something in almost every
<lb/>place that goes to prove him a bad tempered, daring
<lb/>and unprincipled man.  As to his person and ad­
<lb/>dress we know nothing of them, but we conclude
<lb/>they must be extremely imposing, at least to the
<lb/>people he is among, since he seems to have been
<lb/>approbated and upheld by them on all occasions, ex­
<lb/>cept one;  it seems he has been baffled once, and
<lb/>that was by a woman.  Report says he studied the
<lb/>science of medicine, previous to his becoming a
<lb/>preacher, but whether he ever commenced practice
	  <lb/>previous to the <date when="1832-12-20">20th of <name>December</name></date> is not known;  we
<lb/>have not heard of any of his performances since
<lb/>that date.</p>

        <p>The first we know of <persName>E. K. Avery</persName> he is preach­
	  <lb/>ing in <placeName>Duxbury</placeName>, <placeName>Mass</placeName>. and from thence he removed
	  <lb/>to <placeName>Scituate</placeName>, <placeName>Mass</placeName>. in <date when="1827">1827</date>, and took charge of the
<lb/>methodist society in that place.  Among the people
<lb/>who now sat under his ministry was a maiden lady
<lb/>of about five and forty, who sustained a very high
<lb/>reputation for piety as well as for what they style
<lb/><emph rend="slant(italic)">her gifts</emph>.  She was one of those active, useful wo­
<lb/>men whose exertions were always called in, and al­
<lb/>ways freely bestowed, wherever distress of mind or
<lb/>body required relief of any kind.  The young re­
<lb/>sorted to her for counsel, and the established chris­
<lb/>tian for encouragement.  She was as report said,
<lb/>not only a woman active in meetings and by the side
<lb/>of the sick and the dying, but what is extremely
<lb/>difficult, she supported on all occasions, a character
<lb/>for consistency that went far to make her labors suc­
<lb/>cessful.  Of course the new minister soon discover­
<lb/>ed the real character of this lady;  he not only heard
<lb/>her praises from every quarter, and witnessed her
<lb/>zeal, but he was also enabled to appreciate her ex­
<lb/>cellence by personal acquaintance.  She was evi­
<lb/>dently a woman of great spirit naturally, but so
<lb/>humble and subdued by the influence of real piety,
<lb/>that the very belief that this was the case could
<lb/>not fail in a sensible and candid person to increase
<lb/>respect for her.  She was not a woman in depen­
<lb/>dant circumstances by any means, so there was
<lb/>no way to torture her or try her disposition that way;
<lb/>she was past the bloom of youth if not the mer<choice><sic>e</sic><corr>i</corr></choice>dian
<lb/>of life, and thought not of conquests—of rivalship
<lb/>and admiration;  so there was no way to pique her
<lb/>in those—but humbled she must be, something must
<lb/>be done to try her temper until she proved herself
<pb n="103"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G1r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">103</mw>
<lb/>mortal and no better than other folks.  The new
<lb/>minister took a terrible dislike to her from the
<lb/>very first.  He thought <said>the people put too much
<lb/>confidence in her,</said> and averred <said>that he would see
<lb/>she was not made a goddess of.</said>  Whether her
<lb/>deportment was such as to shame some—a standing
<lb/>reproach to some others, who ought at least to be as
<lb/>consistent, or whether he thought others would rise
<lb/>higher if she fell, or whether she was one of those
<lb/>provoking women who have the faculty of reading
<lb/>characters at a glance, or from whatever cause we
	  <lb/>cannot say, but certain it is the <persName>Rev. E. K. Avery</persName>
	  <lb/>labored from the first of his going to <placeName>Scituate</placeName> to de­
<lb/>stroy this woman's good name, and thereby lessen
<lb/>her influence;  at first the dislike was only vented
<lb/>in a few sneering remarks to her disadvantage,
<lb/>which she immediately heard of;  those remarks be­
<lb/>ing wholly unprovoked could not fail to create a de­
<lb/>gree of resentment in the object of them.  During
<lb/>this frame it so chanced that the minister met her
<lb/>one evening at a prayer meeting, where he hap­
<lb/>pened to call just after visiting the house of a parish­
<lb/>ioner who had lately lost his wife.  In the course
<lb/>of the conversation he observed that <said>the husband
<lb/>(who was somewhat intemperate) will soon drown
<lb/>his sorrow.</said>  The lady upon returning to her lodg­
<lb/>ings, which was with a niece of this bereaved hus­
<lb/>band, repeated the remark;  it was again repeated
<lb/>and created some little unpleasant feeling towards
<lb/>Avery for what they judged rather unfeeling and
	  <lb/>ill timed.  His (<persName>Avery's</persName>) resentment against the
<lb/>woman was now at its height;  he had something
<lb/>to seize upon, and although she blamed herself
<lb/>exceedingly for her own imprudence in mentioning

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">104</mw>
<lb/>his random speech, and with much humility asked
<lb/>his forgiveness, &amp;c. yet it nothing mollified his ire.
<lb/>His hatred had now broke out into acts of hostility,
<lb/>and he commenced writing letters to various persons
	  <lb/>in <placeName>Duxbury</placeName> and elsewhere, to try to get her expelled
<lb/>from the church, but all to no purpose.  The woman,
<lb/>nothing daunted stood her ground manfully, and
<lb/>defied him to the proof of what he had asserted,
<lb/>viz. <said>that she had been guilty of lying and unchris­
<lb/>tian conduct, and exercising ungodly and unholy
<lb/>tempers,</said> &amp;c.  The matter was before the parent
	  <lb/>church at <placeName>Duxbury</placeName>, a long time, many letters passed
	  <lb/>between <persName>Avery</persName> and <persName>Mr. Mudge</persName>, as well as with oth­
<lb/>ers on the subject, but nothing could be proved
<lb/>against the woman, and it finally resulted in her
<lb/>coming off with honor, and with a certificate of her
<lb/>good standing.  How they managed to retain Avery
<lb/>in his standing after his failing to substantiate his
<lb/>charges we cannot tell, but that was their business.
<lb/>The certificate made no mention of the recent trial
<lb/>and its result, but merely stated what they could not
<lb/>avoid stating, that she was in good standing in the
<lb/>meeting.—It was as follows:</p>

                <p>Sir—I address you from the purest motives of my
<lb/>heart, and under circumstances peculiarly aggrava­
<lb/>ting.  Your conduct towards me urges me to use
<lb/>my pen, which otherwise would have remained si­
<lb/>lent—this I do in my own defence.  The charges
		  <lb/>against me, in writing from you to brother <persName>Mudge</persName>,
<lb/>he informs me are three.  The first relates to a cir­
<lb/>cumstance that happened three years ago this
		  <lb/>month,<anchor xml:id="a021" corresp="#n021" rend="pre(*)"/> respecting
<persName>Benjamin James</persName>.<anchor xml:id="a022" corresp="#n022" rend="pre(†)"/> Now look at
<lb/>it candidly and see if you have experienced the right
<lb/>spirit.  As respects the case, did I not confess at
<lb/>the time you brought up the accusation against me
		  <lb/>in the presence of my sister <persName>Susan</persName>—that I repeated
<lb/>your words inconsiderately, and was sorry, and said
<lb/><said>any compensation you requested I was willing to
<lb/>make, even at your feet,</said> and you would not<anchor xml:id="a023" corresp="#n023" rend="pre(‡)"/> be
<lb/>reconciled—does not this bespeak that you would
<pb/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">106</mw>
<lb/>not forgive.  Reflect—what does the gospel you
<lb/>profess to preach say:  <said>If we offend seventy times,
<lb/>and repent and ask forgiveness we should be forgiv­
<lb/>en.</said>  Are not these the words of our Savior, whose
<lb/>image we ought to bear.
</p>
                <p>The second charge I think brother <persName>Mudge</persName> tells
<lb/>me, was <said>indulging unholy and ungodly temper.</said>
<lb/>This I am confident was a false charge, as I know of
<lb/>no time whatever that I had any conversation with
		  <lb/>you, after that in my shop, in the presence of <persName>Susan</persName>,
<lb/>and I leave it to her if there was any thing of that
<lb/>manifested at that time—no, I was too much woun­
<lb/>ded in soul to indulge unholy temper.  Your con­
<lb/>versation towards me was like barbed arrows.  What
<lb/>past God was a witness to, and his justice will be
<lb/>satisfied;  for he judgeth impartially.  I can say in
<lb/>his presence and his spirit accompanying me, I do
<lb/>feel clear of this charge.  I know not what you
<lb/>have been informed by unholy people, that are plot­
<lb/>ters of mischief—they must see to it.
</p>
                <p>The rest I think was a charge of <said>talking to
<lb/>your disadvantage.</said>  This charge is as empty of
<lb/>truth as the other:  The most I have said is this.
<lb/>When tale-bearers have brought to me, what they
<lb/>say, you have said, I have replied, <said rend="pre(“)post()">how can I hear
<lb/>such a man preach?  that bears such a spirit?  No
<lb/>I cannot!  No nor will not—under existing circum­
<lb/>stances.</said>  And I say so now, unless I view the sub­
<lb/>ject differently.  Sir the many times you have been
<lb/>to this place, you have not so much as changed a
<lb/>word with me on the subject since the time first
<lb/>mentioned, but if I am rightly informed, said behind
<lb/>my back, what you had ought to have said to my
<lb/>face.  I am sure there has not been any time since
<pb n="107"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">107</mw>
<lb/>the first awful moment but what I should have been
<lb/>glad to have settled the affair and buried it in obliv­
<lb/>ion.
</p>
                <p>But sad to relate, you seem to lay the axe at the
<lb/>root of my moral and religious character by this last
<lb/>move.  This prompts me to take proper steps to
<lb/>vindicate my own cause, and clear up my charac­
<lb/>ter.
</p>
                <p>I am ready to settle it upon any consistent terms
<lb/>short of the law, that you are willing to.  But if I
<lb/>hear no more of you, I shall put it into the hands of
<lb/>one authorized to do justice to you and me.
</p>
                <p>Take away our good name from among men, and
<lb/>you strike a death blow to all we hold dear in this life.
<lb/>Take away our good name from among our broth­
<lb/>ers and sisters in the Church, and then this world
<lb/>will be a barren wilderness.  But one thing—no
<lb/>weapon formed against the child of God, can take
<lb/>away our name from the book of life.
</p>
                <p>I think defamation of character is an evil not to
<lb/>be overlooked or passed by unregarded—therefore
<lb/>I feel justified in putting myself in the way to have
<lb/>justice.<anchor xml:id="a024" corresp="#n024" rend="pre(*)"/></p>

<lb/>male, a defenceless woman, who probably was guilty
<lb/>of no real offence against him, or any one;  and if
<lb/>she had been, who is to set examples of forbearance
<lb/>and forgiveness of injuries, if preachers of the gos­
<lb/>pel are not?  If ministers were to commence a gen­
<lb/>eral dealing with all in their communions who exer­
<lb/>cise unholy tempers, it is presumed they would have
<lb/>their hands full, though in this case there would
<lb/>have been one innocent.  There was testimony suf­
<lb/>ficient that she endured the bitter things so often
<lb/>repeated to her without manifesting any thing but
<lb/>sorrow.  That she could not consent to hear him
<lb/>preach may be attributed to <emph rend="slant(italic)">principle</emph> rather than
<lb/>temper.
</p>
        <p>The character of <persName>Avery</persName> for revengeful, angry
<lb/>feelings, may be gathered from the circumstances of
<lb/>the prosecution, by a brother clergyman.  This was
	  <lb/>in the town of <placeName>Saugus</placeName>, <placeName>Mass</placeName>. and the circumstances
	  <lb/>are related thus.  The <name>Congregational Society</name> in
<lb/>that place were at that time destitute of a settled
	  <lb/>minister, and <persName>Avery</persName>, who was then stationed near
<lb/>over the Methodist one, offered to preach for them
<lb/>occasionally.  The offer was politely accepted, and
	  <lb/>some little time after, a <persName>Mr. Norris</persName>, who was es­
<lb/>teemed as a very amiable and pious man, and who
	  <lb/>was then preaching there to the <name>Reformed Metho­
<lb/>dists</name>, as they are called, (a sect of christians who
<lb/>have separated themselves from the others,) offered
<lb/>likewise.  He too was accepted, and preached there
<lb/>much to the acceptance of the congregation, who
<lb/>were delighted with the unassuming piety and evan­
	  <lb/>gelical sentiments of <persName>Mr. Norris</persName>, and asked him to
<lb/>continue his labors among them, whenever opportu­
	  <lb/>nity offered.  The next <name>Sunday</name> that <persName>Avery</persName> preach­
	  <lb/>ed there he took for his text the passage in <title>Job</title>—

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">109</mw>
<lb/><said>I also will declare mine opinion,</said> and commenc­
<lb/>ed an attack from the pulpit upon the character of
<lb/>his brother, whom he called a thief, and some other
<lb/>very bad things;  and getting in a passion as he
<lb/>proceeded, went on to charge him with individual
<lb/>sins, which he undertook to particularize.  A part
<lb/>of this discourse, as related, the writer has forgot­
<lb/>ten, but one was that he had been employed once in
<lb/>a glasshouse, and stole ware to furnish his own
<lb/>sideboard.  His hearers who relate the story, re­
<lb/>mark, that <said>all this time his face was violent red,
<lb/>and he appeared to be in a great passion.</said>  The
	  <lb/>whole story was immediately related to <persName>Mr. Norris</persName>,
<lb/>who proceeded to put his character in the care of
	  <lb/>the law, and prosecuted <persName>Avery</persName> for defamation of
	  <lb/>character.  It was tried, and <persName>Avery</persName> was found guilty,
<lb/>and sentenced to pay a fine, but he appealed, and
	  <lb/>it came to the second trial, when <persName>Avery</persName> appealed it,
<lb/>arresting judgment, and taking it out of court, by
<lb/>paying a sum of money, the amount of which we
<lb/>did not learn, but our informant says several hun­
<lb/>dred dollars.  The Ecclesiastical Council, as they
<lb/>style themselves, then took him under their protec­
<lb/>tion, and issued a manifesto declaring him entirely
<lb/>blameless, and clearing him of all censure.
</p>
        <p>After the examination at <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, some of the his­
	  <lb/>tory of this transaction got to <placeName>Fall River</placeName>, and a copy
<lb/>of the examination was forwarded by some one to
	  <lb/><persName>Rev. Mr. Norris</persName>, asking for the copy of the trial at
	  <lb/><placeName>East-Cambridge</placeName>.  The amazement and indignation
	  <lb/>of <persName>Mr. Norris</persName> and his friends, at finding the Mer­
<lb/>rills had sworn his character was unsullied, &amp;c.
<lb/>&amp;c. together with the belief that the public ought
<lb/>to have the facts, induced them to publish the fol­
	  <lb/>lowing manifesto, which was forwarded to <placeName>Fall Riv­

<lb/>No Governor of this State has received it, and by

<lb/>something that our public functionaries ought to

<lb/>completely nullifying its utmost poison;—rather
<lb/>ought he to humble himself before that church of
<lb/>which he is a member and minister, upon whose
<lb/>escutcheon he has brought a stain, which the good
<lb/>conduct of a long life can never wipe off.  I respect­

<lb/>is before the public, and much of it is clearly not

<lb/>illes</persName>. This is our opinion,—others may view it dif­
<lb/>ferently. But not careing to quarrel about mere
<lb/>matters of opinion, or rules of evidence, upon which
<lb/>even lawyers differ, let us notice a few facts.
</p>
        <p>On page 30 of this pamphlet the <persName>Rev. J. A. Mer­
	    <lb/>rill</persName> is made to swear that he had known <persName>Avery</persName> for
<lb/>about 11 years, and that as far as his moral, chris­
<lb/>tian, and ministerial character was concerned, it is
<lb/>unspotted and unblemished.  True it is on a cross
<lb/>examination, the Rev. gentleman is forced to confess
<lb/>(which he seems to have done reluctantly enough)
	  <lb/>that <persName>Avery</persName>, while at <placeName>Saugus</placeName>, got into a difficulty
<lb/>which resulted in a prosecution against him, a ver­
<lb/>dict against him, an arrest of judgement,— bu<choice><sic>is</sic><corr>si</corr></choice>ness
<lb/>settled, and an ecclesiastical council after the civil
	  <lb/>trial, acquitted <persName>Avery</persName>, and gave him a certificate.
	  <lb/>On page 45, <persName>Rev. A. D. Merrill</persName> is made to testify
	  <lb/>that he had heard the evidence of the <persName>Rev. J. A.
<lb/>Merrill</persName>, and concurred with him as to the unspotted
	  <lb/>and christian character of <persName>Avery</persName>, and that the pro­
	  <lb/>secution against him at <placeName>Saugus</placeName> resulted in nothing
<lb/>to impeach his conduct.
</p>
        <p>Now to us it is to the last degree surprising that
<lb/>these Rev. gentlemen should have testified in this
	  <lb/>wise about <persName>Avery's</persName> character and conduct.  The
	  <lb/>prosecution against <persName>Avery</persName> was a civil action, in
<lb/>which he was charged with publishing a most false,
<lb/>malicious and wicked slander against a peaceable,
<lb/>unoffending citizen and minister of religion.  This
	  <lb/>charge was made in a variety of forms.  <persName>Avery</persName> de­
<lb/>nied the truth of it, but notwithstanding this denial,
<lb/>a jury of his countrymen, after a long and labored
<lb/>defence, in which he was aided by the most emi­
<lb/>nent council, and a host of clerical and lay breth­
<lb/>ren, and the supposed sanctity of his own profession,
<pb n="113"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">113</mw>
<lb/>declared on oath that he was <emph rend="slant(italic)">guilty.</emph> This verdict
	  <lb/>was rendered upon the evidence of <persName>Avery's</persName> own re­
<lb/>ligious and personal friends;  and we have higher
	  <lb/>and better authority than the assertion of the <persName>Rev.
<lb/>Messrs. Merrills</persName> for saying it was a <said>most righte­
<lb/>ous verdict.</said>  It is true, that after this verdict was
	  <lb/>pronounced by the jury, the council for <persName>Mr. A.</persName>
<lb/>made a motion in arrest of judgment, on a point of
<lb/>special pleading, but even this ground was abandon­
<lb/>ed, and the matter settled before the time arrived
<lb/>for a hearing on the motion,—the object of it there­
<lb/>fore was clearly to gain time.
</p>
        <p>The slander charged upon <persName>Mr. Avery</persName> was proved
<lb/>to be <emph rend="slant(italic)">wanton, malicious, false,</emph> and wholly <emph rend="slant(italic)">unpro­
<lb/>voked.</emph>  No circumstances appeared at the trial to
<lb/>justify, excuse, or even palliate this dastardly and
<lb/>wicked attack upon the character of one who was
	  <lb/>an utter stranger to <persName>Mr. Avery</persName>, and whose only of­
<lb/>fence was that of seceding from the great body of
	  <lb/><name>Episcopal Methodists</name> and organizing an Indepen­
	  <lb/>dent Methodist church and society in <persName>Mr. Avery's</persName>

<lb/>clearly to have been to prostrate and ruin his oppo­
<lb/>nent, and thereby to destroy the christian society he
	  <lb/>had laboured to unite and build up.  The <persName>Rev.
<lb/>Messrs. Merrills</persName> were present at this <emph rend="slant(italic)">trial,</emph> heard

<lb/>it then come to this, that it is no stain upon a chris­
<lb/>tian minister's moral character to be convicted of
<lb/>uttering falsehood and groundless calumny, and of
<lb/>propagating malicious slander against his brother?
<lb/>Is it not robbery to take from an innocent man the
<lb/>dearest and best of his earthly possessions?  Is he,

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">114</mw>
<lb/>whose business it is to enforce the precepts of the
	  <lb/>peaceable religion of the Holy <persName>Jesus</persName>, and to preach
<lb/>charity and all long-suffering, to gratify his own
<lb/>malignant passions, in traducing a brother and
<lb/>neighbour?  Let these Reverend gentlemen look
<lb/>into that holy religion which they profess to teach,
	  <lb/>and see what <persName>St. Paul</persName> says of the slanderer, and
	  <lb/>what <persName>St. Peter</persName> says of the <said>man that bridleth not
<lb/>his tongue.</said>  Can that man's moral, christian and
<lb/>ministerial character be <emph rend="slant(italic)">truly</emph> said to be unspotted
<lb/>and unblemished, when the records of our highest
<lb/>Judicial Tribunal show that he has been <emph rend="slant(italic)">accused</emph>
<lb/>and <emph rend="slant(italic)">convicted</emph> of an offence against the peace and
<lb/>laws of the land;  against the rights of individuals,
<lb/>(an offence originating in malice,) and designed to
<lb/>blight the fair fame of an unoffending man?  Let
<lb/>these Rev. gentlemen settle this question for them­
<lb/>selves.  Their consciences are in their own keep­
<lb/>ing.  The slanderer, in the estimation of all good
<lb/>men, is no better than a robber or an assassin, and
<lb/>it will require something more than the ipsedixit of
<lb/>two <said>holy men in holy office</said> to overrule public
<lb/>opinion, the verdict of a jury or the laws of the land.
<lb/>And before the bar of public opinion, we leave the

        <p>Thus far the manifesto.  We will now go back
<lb/>to the history of Sarah Maria Cornell.</p>

        <p>There is a wonderful mystery in the fact, if it be
<lb/>so, that this unfortunate girl should be constantly
	  <lb/>betraying herself to the <name>Methodists</name>, by confessions
<lb/>of guilt and self-accusations of sins of a most out­
<lb/>rageous kind, while at the same time she was en­
<lb/>deavoring to keep in the society, and be in fellow­
<lb/>ship with the members, and respected by them, stri­
<lb/>ving as though her very salvation depended upon it.
<lb/>The trial has been published, and the evidence is
<lb/>before the public.  Those who wished to make her
<lb/>appear a monster of wickedness, have continually
<lb/>said all that is possible to say against any individ­
<lb/>ual, and said it as a certain preacher once said
<lb/>(when he was planning to abuse his neighbour from
<lb/>the pulpit)—from a place <said rend="slant(italic)">where she cannot answer
<lb/>them back again.</said>  It is however no more than fair
<lb/>that her letters should speak for her, and the author
<lb/>has been at the trouble to collect all of her corres­
<lb/>pondence that can be found, consisting of sixteen
<lb/>letters written to her mother and sister, all, except
	  <lb/>one, between the year <date when="1819">1819</date> and <date when="1832">1832</date>.  It will be
<lb/>seen by these that there is a period of more than a
<lb/>year when only one letter was written.  This was
<lb/>the period immediately succeeding her troubles at
<lb/>Lowell, and may be accounted for by the agitation
<lb/>of mind which such a punishment or persecution,
<lb/>(call it which we please,) must have occasioned.  It
<lb/>appears however that she was not entirely unmind­
<lb/>ful of her friends during this period, as by her last
	  <lb/>letter, dated <date when="1832-03-10"><name>March</name> 10th, 1832</date>, she speaks of a
	  <lb/>pamphlet sent to <persName>Mr. Rawson</persName>.  And by a letter from
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">H</mw>
<pb n="116"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="H1v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">116</mw>
<lb/>him to her it appears the family received one on the
	  <lb/>11th of <date when="1831-01"><name>Jan</name>. 1831</date>.  Other letters, written at differ­
<lb/>ent times may have been lost or mislaid, but not by
<lb/>design.  Her sister's family informed me that they
<lb/>were all of a like character, and, resembling her
	  <lb/>conversation, full of <name>Methodism</name>, and relating mostly
<lb/>to her religious feelings.  The papers were all given
<lb/>up without reserve.  Both hers and theirs were found
<lb/>among the few things at their house.  The letters
	  <lb/>of her brother-in-law, <persName>Mr. Rawson</persName>, to her, are in
<lb/>themselves a complete refutation of any scandal
<lb/>propagated against him.  They prove him to be
<lb/>what every one acquainted with him esteems him to
<lb/>be, a humble, plain dealing, and practical christian.
<lb/>They gave her excellent advice about her disposi­
<lb/>tion to rove from place to place, and cautioned her
<lb/>of the danger, and expressed great satisfaction at
<lb/>her continued assurance of loving God and religion,
<lb/>and endeavoured faithfully to point out to her the
<lb/>necessity of giving herself up wholly in a life of good
<lb/>works, and not to rest in a mere profession.  There
<lb/>is also among her papers letters from some of her
<lb/>Methodist sisters, expressing fellowship and christ­
<lb/>ian affection.
</p>
        <p>One of these letters, written in <date when="1827">1827</date>, from, as it
<lb/>appears, a pious and quite intelligent young lady,
<lb/>styling her worthy sister, &amp;c. struck me very forci­
<lb/>bly as being the year after what they term her <said>dis­
	    <lb/>graceful expulsion from the meeting at <placeName>Smithfield</placeName>.</said>
<lb/>It appears they had lived together, and been for
<lb/>some time in habits of intimacy, and expresses great
	  <lb/>desire to have <persName>Sarah Maria</persName> follow her to the place
<lb/>where she then was.  One from another sister, da­
	  <lb/>ted <date when="1829">1829</date>, also addresses her as a <said>worthy sister,</said>
<lb/>and feelingly asks an interest in her prayers, and
<pb n="117"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="H2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">117</mw>
<lb/>dwells upon the seasons of religious enjoyment they
	  <lb/>have had together.  One was directed to her at <placeName>Dor­
	  <lb/>chester</placeName> and another <placeName>Lowell</placeName>.  Her letters here follow,
<lb/>copied verbatim.  The originals are now in the
<lb/>hands of the author of this book, and can be seen by
<lb/>any one who has the curiosity to see them in her
	  <lb/>own hand writing.  The first is dated at <placeName>Norwich</placeName>.
<lb/>(One letter, No. 1, is omitted simply because it is a

<lb/>lon</placeName>, never expecting to see her beloved parents in
<lb/>this world;  but she is an example of christian pie­
<lb/>ty, she has left her native home to go to instruct the
<lb/>ignorant Heathen who sit in darkness worshiping

<lb/>it.  Let it be our daily prayer that God would send
<lb/>more missionaries to the heathen, to spread the gos­
<lb/>pel to those who know it not.

                <p>I am learning the Tailors trade, I have been here

<lb/>Mother is well and sends her love to you, likewise

<lb/>him these twelve months, May God Almighty help

<lb/>you must write me as soon as you receive this—
<lb/>either by public or private conveyance. We have
<lb/>been so long separated that we should not know

                <p>My dear sister—I received your letter about
<lb/>three weeks since but have not had time to answer
<lb/>it till now, being very much hurried in the shop.
<lb/>Mother has had two letters from our brother since I

		  <lb/>gone to <placeName>Fort Gibson</placeName>, and says he has very good

<lb/>ers a young lady who has had a consumption for
<lb/>about a year, dropt away suddenly yesterday.  When
<lb/>we see one and another of our friends dropping into
<lb/>eternity it ought to remind us, that this is not our
<lb/>home or abiding place. It naturally leads us to en­
<lb/>quire was they prepared to meet death and the judg­
<lb/>ment?  The young lady I mentioned that died yes­
<lb/>terday was resigned and took leave of all her friends,
<lb/>and said she hoped to meet them all in a better
<lb/>world, she said she could bid defiance to death, and
<lb/>meet Jesus with a smile. O that my feelings were
<lb/>like hers, but alas my heart is hard, and I am as
<lb/>prone to sin as the sparks that fly upward.  Oh my
<lb/>sister pray for me, that God in his infinite mercy
<lb/>pour the sweet refreshings of his grace on my soul.
</p>
                <p>I have almost finished my trade, my time will be
		  <lb/>out in <name>October</name>, and mother is making preparations
		  <lb/>for our coming to <placeName>Providence</placeName> this fall.  Oh shall
<lb/>I behold the face of my beloved sister which I have
<lb/>never seen—or have no recollection of.
</p>
                <p>Although we are strangers we ought not to be
<lb/>deprived of the privilege of writing to each other.
<lb/>Only think we are only forty-five miles apart and
<lb/>we dont hear from each other more than once or
		  <lb/>twice a year—and our cousin <persName>Harriet</persName> is three or
<lb/>four thousand miles from her parents and they have
<lb/>heard from her four or five times, she is well and has
<lb/>never regretted devoting her life to a missionary
<lb/>cause, she says if she is a means of helping bring the
<lb/>heathen out of idolatry she shall be doubly re­
<lb/>warded.

                <p><lb/>My dear sister—I with pleasure resume my pen
<lb/>to inform you of my pleasant and happy situation.
		  <lb/>I have been at <persName>Deacon Abels</persName> all winter and have
<lb/>just been able to pay my board, I am now situa­
<lb/>ted in a pleasant village near the factory, and
		  <lb/>between the town of <placeName>Bozrah</placeName> and <placeName>Goshen</placeName>, four miles
<lb/>from mother, and three from the meeting-house, we
		  <lb/>have meetings in the factory every <name>Sabbath</name>, and
<lb/>when it is unpleasant I attend.  I am the only Tai­
<lb/>loress for two miles each way, you may of course
<lb/>conclude I shall be somewhat hurried with work.  I
<lb/>wish you were here.  I desire to be thankful to God
<lb/>for placing me in so pleasant a situation.
</p>
                <p>The solemn bell has just summoned another fel­
<lb/>low-mortal into eternity but what is to be his fate in
<lb/>another world God only knows.  It is just four weeks
		  <lb/>since death entered <persName>Deacon Abel's</persName> family and de­
<lb/>prived them of a servant—a tall stout robust negro
<lb/>whom they had brought up from the age of two
<lb/>years, twenty years he lived with them, and never
<lb/>associated with any but respectable people, as there
		  <lb/>was but one other negro in the place.  <persName>Deacon
<lb/>Abel's</persName> family took his death very hard, he was in
<lb/>the vigor of health, often boasting of his strength—
<lb/>but when he came to be laid on a bed of sickness
<lb/>and the cold hand of death was upon him all his
<lb/>streng<choice><sic/><corr>t</corr></choice>h could not save him.
<choice><sic>h</sic><corr>H</corr></choice>e had just finished his
<lb/>years work, and engaged for another year, and want­
<lb/>ed one week for relaxation, and two weeks from the
<lb/>day that his year was up he was carried to his grave.

<lb/><choice><sic>t</sic><corr>T</corr></choice>he family did not consider him dangerous until just
<lb/>before he died, but he was imprest with the idea
<lb/>he should not recover and regretted that his life had
<lb/>not been better, and thought if it should please a
<lb/>just God to spare him he should live a different one.
<lb/>it is not for us to say whether he is happy or misera­
<lb/>ble in another world, but his death has very solemnly
<lb/>impressed my mind.  Sometimes I think <emph rend="slant(italic)">why am I
<lb/>spared</emph> perhaps it is to commit more sin, perhaps
<lb/>for some usefulness. <choice><sic>s</sic><corr>S</corr></choice>ometimes I think I am no

<lb/>says be ye also ready for ye know not what hour
<lb/>your Lord will come. How will ye escape if ye
<lb/>neglect so great salvation. Yesterday I heard a
<lb/>discourse from these words <said>Why halt ye between
<lb/>two opinions, choose you this day whom you will
<lb/>serve, if the Lord be God serve him, if Baal then
<lb/>serve him.</said> I have thought seriously about this
<lb/>text.
</p>
                <p>You will perceive by the date of this letter that it
<lb/>is my birth day.  Nineteen years has rolled round
<lb/>my head and what have I done for God?  If I were
<lb/>summoned before his judgment bar could I answer
<lb/>with a clear conscience to having performed my du­
<lb/>ty?  I fear I could not.
</p>
                <p>I have resolved this year, to leave the world and
<lb/>all its glittering toys, and devote the rest of my life
<lb/>to the service of God.  I have searched this world
<lb/>for happiness, but alas I have searched in vain;  it
<lb/>is all a mere show—a broken cistern that can hold
<lb/>no water.
</p>
                <p>In your last letter I recollect you harbored the
<lb/>idea that I was offended with you.  Far be it from

                <p>Dear Sister—I received a letter from you soon
<lb/>after I came to this place, in which you murmured
<lb/>at my coming to the factory to work;  but I do not
<lb/>consider myself bound to go into all sorts of compa­
<lb/>ny because I live near them.  I never kept any but
<lb/>good company yet, and if I get into bad it is owing
<lb/>to ignorance.
</p>
                <p>I have been away from home now about one year,
<lb/>and have found as many friends as among my own
<lb/>family connexions.  I have learned in whatsoever
<lb/>situation I am in to be content, though I have not
<lb/>been so contented here, being far from any friend
<lb/>or connexion.
</p>
                <p>You wrote me you thought I had better return to
		  <lb/><placeName>Norwich</placeName> as soon as possible, and that you should
<pb n="123"/>

		  <lb/>not come to <placeName>Killingly</placeName> as long as I staid at this fac­
<lb/>tory.  You must remember that your <emph rend="slant(italic)">pride must
<lb/>have a fall.</emph>  I am not too proud to get a living in
<lb/>any situation in which it pleases God to place me.
<lb/>Remember that you have expressed a humble hope
<lb/>in God, and bear the christian name;  learn then to
<lb/>imitate the example of Him whose name you bear,
<lb/>and never let it be said of you that you were too
<lb/>proud to follow your Saviour's steps—who was meek
<lb/>and lowly and went about doing good—suffering the
<lb/>scoffs and indignation of wicked men, and finally
<lb/>spilled his precious blood that you might be saved.
</p>
                <p>I do not expect to find the society here that I did
		  <lb/>in <placeName>Bozrahville</placeName>.  I have got some acquainted with
		  <lb/><persName>Mr. A—'s</persName> family and like them very well.  I miss
		  <lb/><persName>Mr. Dodge</persName> and his family, and some other friends
<lb/>I left there;  shall never enjoy myself so well in any
<lb/>other place as I did there.  No my dear sister, there
<lb/>is no revival of religion here, and I have no class in
<lb/>the Sunday school here, and it cannot be expected
<lb/>I can enjoy myself so well.
</p>
                <p>If you do not come to <placeName>Killingly</placeName> until I go to <placeName>Nor­

</p>
                <p>I had a letter from our dear brother a few weeks

                <p>My dear brother and sister—Almost two years
<lb/>has elapsed since I have written a letter or hardly a
<lb/>line to any one, and I scarce know what to say to my
<lb/>dear parent—but through the goodness of Divine
<lb/>Providence I am alive and in a comfortable state of
<lb/>health.  I enjoy all the necessaries of life and many
<lb/>of its enjoyments.  I can truly say my dear mother,
<lb/>that the year past has been the happiest of my life.
<lb/>I have lived in this village almost nineteen months,
<lb/>and have boarded in a very respectable family.  My
<lb/>employment has been weaving on water looms;  my
<lb/>wages have not been very great, yet they have been
<lb/>enough to procure a comfortable living, with econo­
<lb/>my and prudence.  I feel as though I had done with
<lb/>the trifling vanities of this world—I find there is no
<lb/>enjoyment in them and they have almost been my
<lb/>ruin.
</p>
                <p>While I am writing perhaps you have long since
		  <lb/>forgotten you have a daughter <persName>Maria</persName>—but stop dear
		  <lb/>mother, I am still your daughter and <persName>Lucretia's</persName> only
<lb/>sister.  God in mercy has shown me the depravity
<lb/>of my own wicked heart—and has I humbly trust,
<lb/>called me back from whence I had wandered.  Al­
<lb/>though I had professed religion, and have turned
<lb/>back to the beggarly elements of the world, and
<lb/>brought reproach upon the cause of God—and have
		  <lb/>caused <persName>Jesus</persName> to open his wounds afresh, and have
<lb/>put him to an open shame—and have followed him
		  <lb/>like <persName>Peter</persName> afar off—and even denied that I ever
<lb/>knew him.  When I look back upon my past life it
<lb/>looks dreary, and I feel like a mourner alone on the
<lb/>wide world without one friend to cheer me through
<lb/>this gloomy vale—but when I look forward it bears
<lb/>another aspect.  I have been made to rejoice in the
<pb n="125"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="H6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">125</mw>
<lb/>hope of the glory of God.  I feel that I have an ev­
<lb/>idence within my own soul that God has forgiven
<lb/>me, and I have an unshaken trust in God that I
<lb/>would not part with for ten thousand worlds.  I find
<lb/>there is nothing in this vain world capable of satis­
<lb/>fying the desires of the immortal mind.  But the re­
		  <lb/>ligion of <persName>Jesus</persName> is a fountain from whence joys of the
<lb/>most exalted kind will for ever flow.  I have enjoyed
<lb/>some precious seasons since I have been in this
<lb/>place.  Though destitute of any natural friends, yet
<lb/>God has raised up many christian friends of dif­
<lb/>ferent orders—all united heart and hand, bound to
<lb/>one home.
</p>
                <p>We have a house for worship and have preaching
		  <lb/>every <placeName>Sabbath</placeName>.
</p>
                <p>Sister <persName>Lucretia</persName>, by the best information I can ob­
<lb/>tain, since I saw you last you have become a wife
<lb/>and a mother.  I want to see the dear little babe;
<lb/>I hope the cares of a married life has not separated
<lb/>your heart from God.  I believe there is something
<lb/>in religion that is durable;  it is worth seeking and
<lb/>worth enjoying I feel as though I could enjoy my­
		  <lb/>self in this life while blest with the presence of <persName>Je­
<lb/>sus</persName>, I have found that a form of godliness will nev­
<lb/>er make me happy but I can praise God for the en­
<lb/>joyment of every day's Religion—it is that which
<lb/>will do to live by—and will prepare us for a dying
<lb/>hour.
</p>
                <p>May God bless you and your companion, and if
<lb/>I never meet you in this world, may we be prepared
<lb/>to spend a never ending eternity together in the
<lb/>bright mansions of glory.  I want to see Mother
<lb/>and if any of you desire to see me—write and let
<lb/>me know and I will try to come and spend a few
<lb/>days with you before long—but whether I ever see

        <p>The kind of self-accusation contained in the se­
<lb/>cond paragraph of this letter is very common among
<lb/>enthusiastic people when making their confessions
<lb/>of sin.  I have heard men of integrity—and young
<lb/>innocent girls, get up in meeting and roundly ac­
<lb/>cuse themselves of crimes—the least of which, if
<lb/>any other had accused them of, would have been a
<lb/>mortal offence.  Some very sensible and intelligent
<lb/>persons have done this in reference to the spiritual­
<lb/>ity of the law of God which makes, they say, <said>an

                <p>My dear Mother—I left the Branch Factory, and
<lb/>came to this place about three weeks since, and am
<lb/>weaving blue Sattinet.  The water was so low and
<lb/>filling so scarce, the weavers could not do much
<lb/>during the warm weather.  The factory that is re­
		    <lb/>building at <placeName>Slatersville</placeName> is going up slowly.  I anti­
<lb/>cipate much in returning to that delightful village
<lb/>and seeing it assume once more that lustre that
<lb/>shone so brilliantly.
</p>
                <p>I received a letter from you some weeks since, in
<lb/>which you thought you should not probably be at
		    <lb/>home until <name>September</name>.  I think some of going to
		    <lb/><name>Camp Meeting</name> at <placeName>Woodstock</placeName> where I went last year,
		    <lb/>and if I thought you and <persName>Lucretia</persName> would be at home
<lb/>I should come that way and spend one night with
		    <lb/>you.  <name>Camp Meeting</name> is appointed the <date when="1826-08-29">29th of this
<lb/>month</date> and holds four days, some of my Methodist
<lb/>friends from the village will probably go with me.
<lb/>I am boarding at a very still boarding house of about
<lb/>twenty boarders.  I enjoy myself very well most of
<lb/>the time.  I meet my brethren and friends at the
<lb/>village about once a week.

                <p>My dear Mother Brother and Sister—After wait­
<lb/>ing nearly six months for a letter in vain, I take up
<lb/>my pen to address those of my dear friends who are
<lb/>near and dear to me by the ties of nature.  After
		    <lb/>leaving you at <placeName>Providence</placeName> I came in the stage to
		    <lb/><placeName>Dedham</placeName> where I found the young lady as I expect­
		    <lb/>ed from <placeName>Slatersville</placeName>.  I went to weaving the next
		    <lb/>day at <placeName>Dedham</placeName>, where I staid about four weeks.  I
<lb/>immediately wrote, as I supposed before you left
		    <lb/><placeName>Providence</placeName>, but as I have received no answer I have
<lb/>reason to suppose you have never received it.  There
		    <lb/>was no meeting at <placeName>Dedham</placeName> that I wished to attend,
<lb/>and I had to board where there was sixty boarders,
<lb/>and after four weeks I removed to this place, which
<lb/>is about four or five miles from the city of Boston.
<lb/>It is a pleasant thick settled village.  There is one
		    <lb/><name>Unitarian</name>, two <name>Congregational</name> or <name>Calvinistic</name>, and
		    <lb/>one <name>Methodist</name> meeting in this place.  I have spent

		    <lb/>meeting there, at the <placeName>Bromfield Lane Chapel</placeName>.  The
		    <lb/><persName>Rev. Mr. Maffitt</persName> and <persName>Merrill</persName> are stationed preach­
		    <lb/>ers there.  <persName>Mr. Sias</persName> preaches here occasionally and

<lb/>py but natural connexions, I have been expecting
<lb/>all summer to visit you this month on my tour to

<lb/>sive—and I could stay so short a time—that I con­

		    <lb/><placeName>Boston</placeName> brethren.  We started for that place <date when="1827-08-28">August
<lb/>28th</date>, forty in number, in six private carriages.  It
<lb/>is a distance of fifty miles.  We had good weather
<lb/>all the time.  Between 20 and 30 ministers were
<lb/>present, and about five thousand people.  Nearly
<lb/>forty persons professed to have past from death unto
		    <lb/>life.  <name>Friday</name> which was the last day of the meeting
<lb/>between five and six hundred professors partook of
<lb/>the symbols of our Saviour's dying love.  It was a
<lb/>circle formed within the tents.  The scene was truly
<lb/>affecting—it will no doubt be remembered by hun­
<lb/>dreds through time and eternity.
</p>
                <p>I reside about half a mile from <persName>Mr. Oathman's</persName> fa­
		    <lb/>ther's that used to preach in <placeName>Providence</placeName>, he is fre­
<lb/>quently here and preaches.  The good people of
<lb/>Dorchester have ever treated me with the greatest
<lb/>respect.  But it is uncertain whether I spend the
		    <lb/>winter here or in <placeName>Boston</placeName>.  I have had several op­
<lb/>portunities to work at my trade there, in shops where
<lb/>the tailors hire fifteen or twenty girls to make coats
<lb/>and nothing else.  I should like to come and work
		    <lb/>a month with <persName>Mr. Rawson</persName> if I could—but I cannot
<lb/>this winter, it would cost all of eight dollars to go

<lb/>been very poor this summer, and I have not been
<lb/>able to work all the time, but through the goodness
<lb/>of God I am comfortable—though much has been
<lb/>said, and I have suffered very much from false re­
<lb/>ports in time past.
</p>
                <p>I enjoy myself as well as I could expect among
<lb/>strangers, as I have never seen but three faces since

<lb/>have been sustained and upheld by the mighty pow­
<lb/>er of God, and still retain a respectable standing in

                <p>My dear Mother—Once more I take up my pen
<lb/>to write a few lines to my parents, as nearly six
<lb/>months have again elapsed since I have heard from
<lb/>you.  I dont hardly feel reconciled to think so many
		    <lb/>connections and friends as I have in <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>
		    <lb/>and <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName>, that <choice><sic>1</sic><corr>I</corr></choice> cannot hear from any of
<lb/>them oftener than once in six or seven months.
<lb/>Sometimes I think they have lately forgotten me,
<lb/>but <choice><sic>1</sic><corr>I</corr></choice> have no reason to complain, I have cause to
<lb/>be thankfull that it is as well with me as it is.  I
<lb/>am tolerably well and in good spirits—though I have
<lb/>never been well enough to work one whole month
<lb/>since I have been here.  My work has been very
<lb/>hard the winter past, and I have got almost beat out,
<lb/>I have been weaving on four looms at the rate of
<lb/>120 or 30 yds. per day, at 1 half cent per yard, my
<lb/>board and other expences are considerable here, I
<lb/>feel a good deal attached to the people in this place,
<lb/>being surrounded by some very dear friends, I have
<lb/>a very pleasant boarding house, and every thing

<lb/>around me to make me contented and happy.  It is
<lb/>about one year since I have seen any of you, though
<lb/>to me I trust it has not been altogether an unprofit­
<lb/>able one;  my enjoyment has been great—and my
<lb/>privileges very many.  I long to see my brother and
<lb/>sister, and the dear little babe, and I have been se­
		    <lb/>riously thinking of visiting <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> the summer
		    <lb/>coming, if <persName>Mr. Rawson</persName> expects to stay in <placeName>Killingly</placeName>
<lb/>another year and it should be agreeable to you all, I
<lb/>think I shall come and spend a week with you some
<lb/>time in the course of the summer.  You will please
		    <lb/>to let me know before <date when="1828-04-01">the first of April</date>, as I want
<lb/>to know how to make my arrangements.
</p>
                <p>There has been several shocking cases of suicide
<lb/>within a few months here, one of which a man about
<lb/>30 cut his throat yesterday a few rods from me, he
<lb/>is to be buried this afternoon, he was intoxicated.
<lb/>I have not yet felt as though I could see him it brings
		    <lb/>so fresh to mind the murder at <placeName>Smithfield</placeName> I felt as
<lb/>though I had rather not see him.
</p>
                <p>About <date when="1828-02-01">the first of February</date> a young man shot him­
<lb/>self before my face and eyes, I was looking out of
<lb/>my window.  He tied himself to a tree and placed
<lb/>the gun to his breast, and before any one could get
<lb/>to him, made way with himself.  A girl belonging
<lb/>to this establishment threw herself into the river, af­
<lb/>ter remaining two days in the water she was found,
<lb/>the most awful sight I ever beheld.  How short and
<lb/>uncertain life is, it vanishes like the early cloud and
<lb/>the morning dew.  It is time to go to meeting and I
		    <lb/>must close.  Give my last love to <persName>Grindall</persName> and <persName>Lu­
		      <lb/>cretia</persName>, and tell dear little <persName>Edward</persName> aunt <persName>Maria</persName> wants

                <p>My dear Mother—It seems a long time since I
<lb/>have heard from you, and I almost begin to think
<pb n="136"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="I5v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">136</mw>
<lb/>you have forgotten me or you would have written
<lb/>before this.  I have written two letters and sent
<lb/>two papers since I have resided in this place, and
<lb/>not received a line from any of you.  I hope you
<lb/>will consider I am a stranger in a strange land, ex­
		    <lb/>posed to sickness and death.  Last <name>Saturday</name> night
<lb/>about twelve o'clock I was called a second time to
<lb/>witness a five story factory with all its machinery
<lb/>enveloped in flames.  It was a bitter cold night
<lb/>and with great difficulty they made out to save the
<lb/>others which stood on each side—there were five of
<lb/>the same bigness in the yard.  The middle one
<lb/>caught at the furnace and in less than three hours
<lb/>it was burned to the ground.  I expected to have
<lb/>seen the whole thirteen, with the whole Corporation
<lb/>swept by the flames.  But through the goodness of
<lb/>that God who rules the elements—although the air
<lb/>was keen and cold—it was still as in midsummer.
<lb/>The damage is great, but the distress is nothing to
		    <lb/>what it was in <placeName>Slatersville</placeName>—as each factory support­
<lb/>ed itself.  No one was personally injured.  It was
<lb/>my lot to remove on the other side the river, about
<lb/>half a mile distant.
</p>
                <p>I feel measurely happy and contented, but do
		    <lb/>long to return to <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> to see my friends—
<lb/>but when I shall is unknown at present—think I
<lb/>shall never set any time to come, but hope I shall
<lb/>next summer if health and strength permits.
</p>
                <p>I want you should write as soon as you receive
<lb/>this—if you never do again—and inform me how
		    <lb/>they all do at <placeName>Norwich</placeName>.  My best respects to my

                <p>Dear Sister and friends—I take up my pen once
<lb/>more to inform you, that through the mercy and
<lb/>goodness of God, I am spared to see one more anni­
<lb/>versary of my birth.  Twenty-seven years of my
<lb/>short life has rolled on to eternity, and I am still on
<lb/>the shores of time, a probationer of hope, and enjoy
<lb/>the day and the means of grace.  More than two
<lb/>years have past by since I have seen any of you, or
<lb/>indeed scarce seen one individual that I ever saw
<lb/>before, but still I am contented and happy.  I am
<lb/>surrounded by many dear friends who are near and
<lb/>dear by the ties of friendship and grace, and I feel
<lb/>much attached to the place and people here, and
<lb/>the religious p<choice><sic/><corr>r</corr></choice>ivileges I enjoy are much greater than
<lb/>they have ever been before.  But still I often look
		    <lb/>back and think of my natural connections in <placeName>Con­
		      <lb/>necticut</placeName> and <placeName>Rhode-Island</placeName>, and long to be with
<lb/>you.  I have been thinking of coming to see you
<lb/>for two summers—I feel a greater desire to see you
<lb/>now than I ever have done.  I begin to think
		    <lb/>if I do not come to <placeName>Killingly</placeName> this summer I never
<lb/>shall.  I received a letter from mother about four
<lb/>months since in which she mentioned she thought
<lb/>I was a moving planet, but I would tell my dear
<lb/>mother that I do not think I have moved much for
		    <lb/>two years past.  I staid in <placeName>Dorchester</placeName> more than a
		    <lb/>year, and it will be a year <date when="1829-05-17">the 17th of this month</date>
		    <lb/>since I came to <placeName>Lowell</placeName>—and more than all this tell
<lb/>mother she must remember that I am connected
<lb/>with a people that do not believe in tarrying in any
<lb/>one place longer than a year or two years at most
<lb/>at any one time—and I am with them in sentiment
<lb/>believing with the Apostle that we should be as
<pb n="138"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="I6v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">138</mw>
<lb/>strangers and pilgrims having here no continuing
<lb/>city or abiding place, but seek one to come.
</p>
                <p>With regard to my views and feelings respecting
<lb/>religion, they are the same as they have been for
<lb/>two years past.  I was a great sinner but I found a
<lb/>great Saviour.  Tis true I had made a formal pro­
<lb/>fession of religion, but when I was brought to see
<lb/>and feel the necessity of being deeply devoted to
<lb/>God, my views and feelings were vastly altered.  I
<lb/>am satisfied for one that a form of godliness will
<lb/>never prepare a soul for the enjoyment of heaven.
<lb/>For <said>great is the mystery of godliness.  God man­
<lb/>ifest in the flesh—justified in the spirit—believed on
<lb/>in the world, and received up into glory.</said>  Perhaps
<lb/>my friends may think strange that I chose a people
<lb/>different in their views and opinions from that which
<lb/>any of my friends have embraced.  But let me tell
		    <lb/>you my dear sister that the <name>Methodists</name> are my peo­
<lb/>ple—with them by the grace of God I was spiritu­
<lb/>ally born—with them I have tried to live, and if ev­
<lb/>er permitted to enjoy the happiness of the blest in
<lb/>heaven shall probably praise God to all eternity.  I
<lb/>see my beloved sister a fulness in the Saviour, and
<lb/>I believe it is the privilege of the child of God to
<lb/>enjoy all the depths of humble love.
</p>
                <p>It seems inconsistent to me for the profest follow­
		    <lb/>ers of the meek and lowly <persName>Jesus</persName>, who have said by
<lb/>their profession that they have bid farewell to the
<lb/>world to follow its customs and fashions.  It has
<lb/>appeared to me some time that it was good for the
<lb/>proud heart to be adorned with the modest livery of
<lb/>God's dear children, and to have a daily evidence
<lb/>that our witness is in heaven and our record on high.
<lb/>The bell rings for meeting and I must draw my let­
<lb/>ter to a close.  If nothing more than what I know

                <p>My dear Mother—After waiting for more than
<lb/>eight long months for an answer to a letter that I
<lb/>wrote you last spring, I once more take up my pen
<lb/>to address you.  You wrote me then you were go­
		    <lb/>ing to visit your friends at <placeName>Norwich</placeName>, and that you
<lb/>would write me immediately on your return, but as
<lb/>I have never received a line from that time, I have
<lb/>concluded that you were there or were sick or dead,
<lb/>for it appears to me if you were in the land of the
<lb/>living and possest a parent's feelings you would have

<lb/>if the Lord spared my life and health I should visit
		    <lb/><placeName>Connecticut</placeName> in <date when="1829-08"><name>August</name> last past</date>.  A long time I
		    <lb/>waited for your return from <placeName>Norwich</placeName>, thinking you
<lb/>would write and let me know, but at length conclu­
<lb/>ded it was neither your wish nor that of my brother
		    <lb/>and sister that I should visit <placeName>Killingly</placeName>—but enough
<lb/>of this—I will cease to trouble your minds with
<lb/>such painful feelings.  Not a day has rolled over my
<lb/>head since I left you but what I have thought of
<lb/>home, and the dear friends I have left many miles
<lb/>from this.  I can tell you that although deprived of
<lb/>every earthly connexion or even of a correspondence

<lb/>with them, and one hundred miles lies between me
<lb/>and the friends of my youth, still I am contented,
<lb/>still I am happy, the present witness of an indwell­
<lb/>ing God fills my soul, and I am walking hand in
		    <lb/>hand with a large circle of dear friends to <placeName>Mount
<lb/>Zion</placeName> the city of the living God.
</p>
                <p>My situation is as pleasant as I could expect.  I
<lb/>have daily blessings heaped upon me.  I am fed
<lb/>from day to day like the ravens, and I can say to
<lb/>you to day I am happy in the enjoyment of the love
<lb/>of God and I anticipate one day though separated
<lb/>from the society of my friends here below, meeting
<lb/>them in the kingdom of God.  Glory to God for re­
<lb/>ligion that makes the soul happy, a religion that
<lb/>brings peace and tranquility will prepare the soul
<lb/>in the language of the Psalmist to say—<said>Though I
<lb/>walk through the valley of the shadow of death I
<lb/>will fear no evil—for thou art with me, thy rod and
		      <lb/>thy staff comfort me.</said> I left <placeName>Lowell</placeName> <date when="1829-05">last May</date> on
		    <lb/>account of my health and staid until <date when="1829-10"><name>Oct</name>.</date> in
<placeName>Boston</placeName>
<lb/>and worked at my trade, except what time I was
		    <lb/>gone down on the water to <placeName>Cape Cod</placeName>.  I went to
		    <lb/><name>Camp Meeting</name> in <date when="1829-08"><name>August</name></date>, as usual was gone ten
<lb/>days, cast anchor three days—went ashore three
<lb/>miles from where we set sail, having in company
<lb/>upwards of two hundred, fourteen of which were
<lb/>Methodist Ministers.  Had about twelve sermons
<lb/>preached on board, and one on the shore—dug
<lb/>clams—had plenty of good codfish, crackers and
<lb/>coffee—and on the eleventh day reached Boston
<lb/>wharf in better health and better spirits than when
<lb/>I left—having had but about six good hours sleep in
<lb/>ten nights.  Just at this moment one of brother
		    <lb/><persName>Rawson's</persName> <name>Camp Meeting</name> stories has popt into my
		    <lb/>head and methinks I hear him say, <said>Well <persName>Maria</persName>
<pb n="141"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="K2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">141</mw>
<lb/>this is one of your <name>Camp Meeting</name> scrapes.</said>  Let me
<lb/>tell you my dear brother I love them now as well as
<lb/>I did five years ago.  Yea far better—for I have
<lb/>known real good produced by them.
</p>
                <p>Time reproves me and I must draw to a close by
<lb/>saying dear mother do write to me immediately—
<lb/>dear brother and sister do write and let me know
<lb/>whether you are in the land of the living, whether
		    <lb/>you live in <placeName>Killingly</placeName>—whether you prosper in spirit­
<lb/>ual and in temporal things.  As to myself I have
<lb/>enough of the good things of this life.  I brought
<lb/>nothing into this world, and I expect to carry noth­
<lb/>ing out, a stranger and a pilgrim here.
</p>
                <p>My best wishes and most fervent prayers will ever
<lb/>attend my dear parent.  Once more I say dear moth­
		    <lb/>er write to me, direct to <placeName>Lowell</placeName>, <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>.</p>

                <p>My dear Mother—I take this opportunity to ac­
<lb/>knowledge the reception of two letters, one of which
<lb/>I received last week.  You say you should like to
		    <lb/>have me come to <placeName>Killingly</placeName> this summer.  Last sum­
<lb/>mer I made my calculations to visit you, and should
<lb/>have done so if you had written—but I have not
<lb/>thought very seriously of visiting you this summer,
<lb/>until I received your last letter.  I then thought I
<lb/>should come immediately, but finding my engage­
<lb/>ments such that I could not be absent from here
<lb/>more than a week or ten days at most—I have con­
<lb/>cluded that the time I should stay would be so short
<lb/>—the expence would be more than it would gratify
<lb/>either of us.  I am now preparing to go down on
<lb/>the water to camp meeting where I went last year.

<lb/>My health is tolerably good for the season, I never
<lb/>enjoyed my health better than after I went on the
<lb/>salt water, although I was very sea-sick.  It is my
<lb/>intention now to spend two or three weeks with you
<lb/>in the spring, if life, health, and strength are spared
<lb/>me.
</p>
                <p>I have been in <placeName>Lowell</placeName> so long that I should feel
<lb/>lonesome any where else.  My love to my sister, tell
<lb/>her I long to see her and the children.  I shall write

		    <lb/>though I never received a line from him or <persName>Lucretia</persName>
<lb/>since they were married, but I expect my sisters
<lb/>time is pretty much taken up with her children.

                <p>You will please inform me in your next if you

        <p>The circumstances detailed in the life of <persName>Avery</persName>,
<lb/>need little comment;  every one must see in the
	  <lb/>persecution of <persName>Miss Winsor</persName>, and the slander of <persName>Rev.
	    <lb/>Mr. Norris</persName>, that <persName>Avery</persName> was a man of wicked, and
<lb/>revengeful, and persecuting temper;  and his fre­
<lb/>quent closetings in the famous study with females,
<lb/>and the sad and grieved appearance of his wife,
<lb/>speak volumes.  When apprehended for the slander
	  <lb/>against <persName>Mr. Norris</persName>, he was taken from the desk
	  <lb/>during a prayer meeting, by <persName>Mr. Kimball</persName>, a sheriff
	  <lb/>at <placeName>Lowell</placeName>, and was so much frightened as to faint,
<lb/>and several persons then made the remark, that he
<lb/>probably feared it was for some very different of­
<lb/>fence he was apprehended.  But when put under
	  <lb/>arrest at <placeName>Bristol</placeName> for the alleged murder of <persName>Miss Cor­
<lb/>nell</persName>, it was said he exhibited great firmness, and
<lb/>during his trial discovered no signs of fear and but
<lb/>little agitation.
</p>
        <p>To pass any comments upon that trial after the
	  <lb/>able Strictures published by <said><persName>Aristides</persName>,</said> would
<lb/>look like vanity indeed, yet a few facts which have
<lb/>come to the knowledge of the author it may not be
<lb/>amiss to mention, particularly as many who read
<lb/>this may not have seen the ingenious and masterly
<lb/>criticisms of the trial referred to.  Preliminary to
<lb/>the facts we are about to state, we will just make a
<lb/>short extract from that work.
</p>
        <p>
          <said>Never was a criminal trial instituted and car­
<pb n="145"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="K4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">145</mw>
<lb/>ried through in this country in which so much
<lb/>baseness was manifest, so much chicanery practis­
<lb/>ed, the public, the government, the court and the
<lb/>jury, so deeply insulted, nor an accused man ac­
<lb/>quitted with such a chain of circumstances against
<lb/>him.  The whole machinery of the methodist church
<lb/>has been brought into operation and its artillery
<lb/>made to bear on the battlements of the hall of jus­
<lb/>tice.  Perjury, base and foul has been committed
<lb/>on the stand, under the sanction of a religious garb
<lb/>to protect a wretch from punishment.</said>
        </p>
        <p>How much of perjury was practised on the stand
<lb/>we are unable to say, but certain it is there was
<lb/>great exertion made to prevent witnesses testifying
<lb/>against the prisoner, by his friends the methodists;
<lb/>most unwarrantable means used to prevent the truth
	  <lb/>coming out.  The circumstance related by <persName>Aristides</persName>
	  <lb/>respecting a sheriff of <placeName>Newport</placeName> having to run a race
<lb/>with a methodist minister, of nine miles, to see who
<lb/>would get there first, the sheriff to summon her or
<lb/>the preacher to prevent her, is strictly true, and that
<lb/>after all the vigilance of the sheriff the parson won
<lb/>the day and arrived there first, and when the sheriff
	  <lb/>came, the woman (a <persName>Mrs. Brownell</persName> if we recollect
<lb/>right) pretended to be too sick to go;  what her tes­
<lb/>timony would have been if let alone we do not
<lb/>know, but if we are to judge of its importance by
<lb/>the violent efforts made to stop her going, we must
<lb/>presume it to have had great bearing upon the case.
	  <lb/>A similar instance occurred in <placeName>Thompson</placeName>, (<placeName>Conn</placeName>.)
	  <lb/>A <persName>Mrs. Patty Bacon</persName>, a witness for the prisoner, sta­
<lb/>ted some circumstances which she said occurred at
	  <lb/>the <placeName>Thompson</placeName> <name>Camp Meeting</name>, of a very different
	  <lb/>complexion from the story told by her in Court.  <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Bacon's</persName> daughters, thinking it of some importance

<lb/>to the case communicated it immediately to the
<lb/>friends of the deceased, but before they or the coun­
<lb/>sel for the government could have a chance to con­
<lb/>verse with her, she had had a conversation with
<lb/>some of the methodist clergy, and when she was
<lb/>afterwards interrogated upon the subject, denied ev­
<lb/>ery word of it, and that she had ever said so, the
<lb/>testimony of her two daughters and son-in-law to
<lb/>the contrary notwithstanding, and was afterwards
<lb/>found on the stand testifying that <said>she had suspic­
	    <lb/>ions of the situation of <persName>S. M. Cornell</persName> at the <name>Camp
<lb/>Meeting</name>,</said> to the amazement of her own family,
<lb/>who had never heard any suspicions mentioned from
<lb/>her before.  The statement she made to her two
<lb/>daughters and son-in-law, was this:  <said>That a very
<lb/>tall man with a dark frock coat, and broad brimmed
<lb/>hat whom she took to be a methodist minister, (she
	    <lb/>did not then know <persName>Avery</persName>) came to the <placeName>Muddy Brook</placeName>
	    <lb/>tent three times, <name>Thursday</name>, enquiring for <persName>Sarah Ma­
<lb/>ria Cornell</persName>, and that she afterwards saw the same
<lb/>man conversing with her without the tent.</said>  All this
<lb/>she stoutly denied after the abovementioned confer­
<lb/>ence.  This woman was a member of the methodist
	  <lb/>church.  Again a <persName>Mr. Windsor</persName>, a respectable innkeep­
	  <lb/>er in <placeName>Dudley</placeName>, was standing on the west side of the
	  <lb/>camp ground on the memorable <name>Thursday</name> afternoon
	  <lb/>near the time of the blowing of the horn, with a <persName>Mr.
	    <lb/>Jason</persName> or <persName>Judson Phipps</persName>, and a gentleman and
	  <lb/>lady passed them, when <persName>Windsor</persName> enquired who they
	  <lb/>were, and was answered by <persName>Phipps</persName> that it was a <persName>Mr.
	    <lb/>Avery</persName> and <persName>Miss Cornell</persName>, and added <said>I am watch­
	    <lb/>ing them.</said>  <persName>Phipps</persName> afterwards in <persName>Windsor's</persName> bar
<lb/>room recalled the circumstance to mind, and in
<lb/>presence of several persons said, <said>that man was
	    <lb/><persName>Avery</persName> and the woman <persName>Miss Cornell</persName>, I know them
<pb n="147"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="K5r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">147</mw>
<lb/>both.</said>  It got out of course that he had said so, and
<lb/>when the gentlemen in search of evidence for the
<lb/>government called on him, the following dialogue
<lb/>took place.
</p>
        <p><hi rend="slant(italic)">Question.</hi>—<said rend="pre(“)post()">Did you tell
<persName>Mr. Windsor</persName> those per­
	    <lb/>sons walking together were <persName>Mr. Avery</persName> and <persName>Miss
<lb/>Cornell</persName>?</said>
</p>
        <p><hi rend="slant(italic)">Answer</hi>.—<said>I might and I might not.</said>
</p>
        <p><hi rend="slant(italic)">Question</hi>.—<said>Did you or did you not say in an­
	    <lb/>swer to the question of <persName>Windsor</persName>, <said rend="pre(‘)post(’)">who are those?</said>
	    <lb/>say it is a <persName>Mr. Avery</persName> and <persName>Sarah Maria Cornell</persName>, and
<lb/>I am watching them.</said>
</p>
        <p><hi rend="slant(italic)">Answer</hi>.—<said>I might and I might not.</said>
</p>
        <p>The same answer was invariably returned, and it
<lb/>was all they could get out of him, until the gentle­
<lb/>men were obliged to give it up in despair.  Nothing
<lb/>could be drawn from him.
</p>
        <p><persName>Mr. Asa Upham</persName>, a sober industrious man, said to
<lb/>be a man of property and respectability, said he saw
	  <lb/>and knew <persName>Avery</persName> and <persName>S. M. Cornell</persName>, and saw them
<lb/>walking arm and arm together, in the woods near
<lb/>the camp ground.  This person went to testify at
<lb/>the trial, and found the methodists had procured
<lb/>three persons to swear him down, and having no
<lb/>means there to testify to the character of these wit­
<lb/>nesses, he would not stay.  Being an inhabitant of
<lb/>another State they could not detain him.  What
<lb/>sort of persons the methodists had employed to tes­
<lb/>tify against the veracity of this man may be gather­
<lb/>ed from the fact, that two of them were so intoxica­
	  <lb/>ted before they got half way from <placeName>Providence</placeName> to
	  <lb/><placeName>Thompson</placeName>, as to be scarce able to continue their
<lb/>journey.  We can state this fact without quoting
	  <lb/><said><persName>Aristides</persName>.</said>
</p>
        <p>The attempts to brow beat witnesses in Court,
<pb n="148"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="K5v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">148</mw>
<lb/>to confuse and perplex them, so as if possible to
<lb/>cause them to falter or contradict themselves on the
<lb/>stand, was another most ungentlemanly, unmanly
<lb/>and unchristian proceeding, and was probably car­
<lb/>ried to a greater extent by the prisoner's counsel
<lb/>than has ever been attempted in any criminal case
<lb/>in this country, at least it is believed so by nineteen
<lb/>twentieths of the persons who attended the trial;
<lb/>and when the witnesses chanced to be persons of
<lb/>so much firmness that this was deemed impossible,
<lb/>either some one was brought up to impeach their
<lb/>character for truth, generally, or to swear that they
<lb/>had stated different to them at some other time.
</p>
        <p>Among the witnesses tampered with, there was
<lb/>none perhaps who underwent a more fiery trial than
	  <lb/><persName>Mrs. Sarah Jones</persName>.  As her name is mentioned sev­
<lb/>eral times in the trial, she will be readily recollect­
<lb/>ed, but as the whole story cannot be perfectly un­
<lb/>derstood from that that is told, and the whole is not
<lb/>related, we will give the narrative as she has given
<lb/>it to us, accompanied with her certificate to the
<lb/>truth of it.
</p>
        <p>The <persName>Rev. Mr. Drake</persName>, while enquiring in that
	  <lb/>neighborhood if any body had seen <persName>Avery</persName>, heard
<lb/>her say she saw a man in the morning;  he wanted
<lb/>to know why it was not as easy for her to say it was
	  <lb/>in the afternoon as morning.  By this means <persName>Avery</persName>
<lb/>and his counsel became possessed of the fact that
	  <lb/><persName>Mrs. Jones</persName> had seen a stranger pass their house in
<lb/>the neighborhood of the coal mines,<anchor xml:id="a030" corresp="#n030" rend="pre(*)"/> or rather on
<lb/>the route to it, in a very early state of the business,
<pb xml:id="docb03" corresp="#hypb03"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="K6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">149</mw>
<lb/>directly after he was put under arrest, and previous
	  <lb/>to the examination at <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, and they sent for her
<lb/>to come to his house.  When arrived there, she was
	  <lb/>very cordially greeted by <persName>Mr. Avery</persName>, who introdu­
<lb/>ced her to the presiding Elder as <said>one of his wit­
<lb/>nesses, who <emph rend="slant(italic)">saw him on the Island,</emph></said> and she was
<lb/>asked to relate the circumstances in presence of his
<lb/>attorney and the others.  This she did.  She had
<lb/>been looking out all the morning for the return of a
<lb/>brother who had been living at the eastward, and
<lb/>was expected back on that day.  Between 11 and
<lb/>12 o'clock she saw a man come through the white
<lb/>gate, and come within ten or fifteen rods of her.
<lb/>She described his course by answers to questions,
<lb/>gave an account of his route, and of the country,
<pb xml:id="docb04" corresp="#hypb04"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="K6v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">150</mw>
<lb/>which the counsel traced by chalk marks on the
<lb/>floor as fast as she described it.  Thus did the sim­
<lb/>plicity of this woman furnish a pretty correct map
<lb/>of the country.  But unfortunately, the man she
<lb/>persisted she saw in the <emph rend="slant(italic)">forenoon</emph>; and when she
	  <lb/>came out, <persName>Avery</persName>, who went with her to the door,
	  <lb/>said in passing the entry, laying his hand on <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Jones'</persName> shoulder, and looking imploringly in her face,
<lb/><said>My life is worth more to me than a thousand
<lb/>worlds, and my life depends upon my witnesses—
	    <lb/>can't you recollect <persName>Mrs. Jones</persName> that it was in the af­
<lb/>ternoon?</said>  but, <said>say nothing,</said> he added, to which
	  <lb/><persName>Mrs. Jones</persName> answered she would not, and as she says
<lb/>kept her word until circumstances made it imperi­
<lb/>ously necessary she should disclose this interview,
<lb/>and the conversation that took place.
</p>
        <p>On the day that <persName>Mrs. Jones'</persName> testimony was re­
	  <lb/>quired, at the examination of the prisoner in <placeName>Bristol</placeName>,
<lb/>she was brought over and was stopped at the house
	  <lb/>of a <persName>Mr. Tilley</persName> in <placeName>Bristol</placeName>;  where a Reverend
<lb/>gentleman met her, she says, at the door, ex­

	  <lb/>claiming, <said>now <persName>Mrs Jones</persName>, <emph rend="slant(italic)">you must remember it
	      <lb/>was in the afternoon</emph> when you saw the man, for <persName>Ol­
<lb/>iver Brownell</persName> has just sworn he saw the same man,
<lb/>and it was in the <emph rend="slant(italic)">afternoon.</emph></said>  For a moment she
<lb/>said she felt almost bewildered, but the firm convic­
<lb/>tion that she had stated nothing but the truth, and
<lb/>that if there were ever so many men of that descrip­
<lb/>tion seen in the afternoon, the one she saw was in
<lb/>the morning.  Directly some one came up to her
<lb/>and shook hands, saying, <said>we have been to tea,
	    <lb/>and <persName>Mrs. Jones</persName> here has not:  you will be so good
<lb/>as to get her some, will you not—as soon as possi­
<lb/>ble?</said>  and the good sisters hurried to get her tea,
<lb/>overwhelming her with civilities.  The tea was al­
<lb/>ready on the table, and the lady about to partake of
<lb/>their hospitality, when she was called for to the
<lb/>court.  Two of the daughters of mine host volun­
<lb/>teered to accompany her, thinking she would feel
<lb/>intimidated to go without any female, and on the
<lb/>way, short as it was, endeavoured to influence her
<lb/>to say it was in the afternoon.  One says, <said>well
	    <lb/>you saw brother <persName>Avery</persName>, it seems, on the island?</said>
<lb/><said>No, I don't suppose it could have been him,</said> said
	  <lb/><persName>Mrs. Jones</persName>, <said>the man I saw was in the morning.</said>
<lb/><said>Oh, it must have been him,</said> said one, <said>it could
<lb/>not have been any body else;  and you must try to
<lb/>remember it was in the afternoon.</said>  By this time
<lb/>the trio had arrived at the scene of action, where
	  <lb/>the matter was put upon oath;  and <persName>Mrs. Jones</persName> de­
<lb/>scribed the stranger, who really, from her descrip­
<lb/>tion, must have borne some faint resemblance in
<lb/>person to the prisoner.  But alas!  the stubborn wit­
<lb/>ness would not say it was in the afternoon:  after all
<lb/>the examining, cross examining, and twisting of ev­
<lb/>idence, nothing could be got out of her but the

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">152</mw>
<lb/>same old story, <said>it was in the forenoon.</said>  Was
<lb/>there ever such obstinacy heard of?  that so many
<lb/>civilities should have been thrown away!  But so it
<lb/>was:  and the woman was conducted back to the
	  <lb/>house of <persName>Mr. Tilley</persName>, where she had engaged to re­
<lb/>turn to tea, hurt and abashed by the altered looks of
<lb/>her now silent guides.  Nothing was said except as
<lb/>one looked mournfully upon her, and, as she thought,
<lb/>reproachfully, and said <said>we were in hopes you
<lb/>would have <emph rend="slant(italic)">remembered it was in the afternoon.</emph></said>
	  <lb/>Poor <persName>Mrs. Jones</persName> went in with a heavy heart, feeling
<lb/>that she had disappointed the hopes of the prison­
<lb/>er's friends, but (unable by any sophistry she could
<lb/>imagine, to make out that between eleven and twelve
<lb/>o'clock was in the afternoon) with an approving
<lb/>conscience.  She said the young ladies passed into
<lb/>the other room and were followed by one and anoth­
<lb/>er.  There was a whispering conversation going on
<lb/>there, and each, upon returning, would eye her
<lb/>with scornful and angry looks.  It seemed, she
<lb/>said, as though the tea never would be ready, but
<lb/>at length she was called.  <said>Never,</said> said the poor
<lb/>woman, <said>did I eat a meal before that I thought
<lb/>was begrudged to me.</said>  But at length, she said,
<lb/>she took courage, and feeling tired and faint, re­
<lb/>solved to <said>drink as much tea, and eat as much as
<lb/>she wanted to:</said>  directly after which she took leave
<lb/>of her now ungracious hosts and went to a tavern,
<lb/>and staid all night, and rose early on the following
<lb/>morning and returned home:—a distance of four
<lb/>miles including the ferry, which she had to give
<lb/>eight cents to cross.  From this time until after
<lb/>Avery's flight, and his being taken again, nothing
<lb/>could exceed the scornful and supercilious manners
<pb n="153"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">153</mw>
	  <lb/>of the <name>Methodists</name> to this woman, by her description,
<lb/>whenever she met any of them. Her own express­
<lb/>ion was, <said>they turned up their noses at her, and
	    <lb/>would not speak.</said>  But when <persName>Avery</persName>, after his flight,
<lb/>was pursued and taken again, to her amazement,
<lb/>all at once their manners changed.  Whether they
<lb/>had pouted it out till their resentment had worked
<lb/>itself off, or whatever was the cause, they now be­
<lb/>gan to relax the muscles of their faces, and not only
<lb/>to give her the time of day, but even to shake
<lb/>hands very cordially and enquire after her health.
	  <lb/>Behold a polite letter arrived from <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, dated <date when="--03-28">28th
	    <lb/><name>March</name></date>, enclosing three dollars;  the letter states that
<lb/>it encloses the fee for travel and attendance in the
	  <lb/>case of the State against <persName>E. K. Avery</persName>, but does not
<lb/>mention the sum—the sum enclosed was three dol­
<lb/>lars, she states, and it appears she opened it in the
<lb/>presence of another person.  When the trial came
	  <lb/>on at <placeName>Newport</placeName>, she was again summoned by the
<lb/>prisoner to testify.  She was in the State and was
	  <lb/>obliged to go.  The person, a <name>methodist</name>, who
<lb/>went to carry her, and she said to him, <said>what
	    <lb/>did you come for me for my evidence can do <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Avery</persName> no good, for the man I saw was in the mor<choice><sic/><corr>n</corr></choice>­
	    <lb/>ing.</said>  <said>Why we were in hopes <persName>Mrs. Jones</persName>, you
<lb/>would <emph rend="slant(italic)">remember it was in the afternoon</emph>,</said> was the
	  <lb/>answer.  Arrived at <placeName>Newport</placeName> she was conveyed to
	  <lb/>the house where the <placeName>Lowell</placeName> witnesses were quarter­
<lb/>ed, where she was again hampered to say it was in
<lb/>the afternoon when she saw the man on the island.
<lb/>She said the witnesses were shut up together in the
<lb/>front room of the house, and practising most of the
	  <lb/>evening to try to make the clove hitch, the <placeName>Whitney</placeName>
<lb/>girl and all, and that they asked her to show them.

<lb/><said>I cannot for I never saw one made in my life,</said>
<lb/>she answered.  <said>I did not state this circumstance
<lb/>to the court,</said> she said in her narration, <said>because
<lb/>I did not then think it of any importance, but when
<lb/>I found one of those very girls came forward in court
<lb/>and swore she had been used to seeing it in making
<lb/>harnesses, and showed how it might have been used
<lb/>by the deceased to hang herself, I then regretted
<lb/>extremely I had not told that this very girl had been
<lb/>drilling to practice that manœuvre all the evening,
<lb/>and that they did not, when I was with them, appear
<lb/>to understand how to make it, and asked me to
<lb/>shew them.</said>
</p>
        <p>Unable to twist the evidence of this woman to
<lb/>suit their purpose, the friends of the prisoner en­
<lb/>deavoured to make it appear, on the stand, that she
<lb/>had contradicted herself once or twice in conversa­
<lb/>tion:  but they did not make it out very clearly;  al­
<lb/>though it was a subject of amazement to many that
<lb/>she had not done it repeatedly, placed, as she had
<lb/>been, in circumstances of such embarrassment and
<lb/>temptation.  Since writing the narrative the author
	  <lb/>has been warned by some of <persName>Avery's</persName> friends not to
<lb/>place any reliance upon any thing this woman
<lb/>should tell, as there would not be a word of truth
<lb/>in any of it.  But when we wished to see the letter
	  <lb/>from <placeName>Bristol</placeName>, in confirmation of that part of her story,
<lb/>and she produced it;  and after ascertaining from
<lb/>the people of the house, that she was not only on
	  <lb/>that evening, at the house, with the <placeName>Lowell</placeName> witness­
<lb/>es and the girls named;  but that they were <said><emph rend="slant(italic)">shut up
<lb/>by themselves in the front room,</emph></said> the very words she
<lb/>used;  and that those girls were repeatedly seen prac­
<lb/>tising upon that knot while there;  we could not but
<pb n="155"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">155</mw>
<lb/>believe it:  particularly, as we have never in all our
<lb/>travels been able to find any one who used the clove
<lb/>hitch in harnesses, and have seen at least hundreds
<lb/>making.
</p>
        <p><persName>Mr. John N. Smith</persName>, who testified to the cord be­
<lb/>ing different from that used in factories, was urged
<lb/>to go as a witness for the prisoner, which he refused
<lb/>because he knew his evidence must be against him,
	  <lb/>of course.  One person, a <name>Methodist</name>, and if we re­
<lb/>collect right a deacon in the meeting, urged him to
	  <lb/>go to <placeName>Newport</placeName> to testify for the prisoner.  Said he,
<lb/><said>you will be at no expense—and here is a five dol­
	    <lb/>lar bill, if you will go.</said>  We asked leave of <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Smith</persName> to state this fact, saying such things ought to
<lb/>be exposed.  He objected, saying he was ashamed
<lb/>to have it known that any man should dare to offer
<lb/>him a bribe.
</p>
        <p>It must be evident to every candid observer, that
<lb/>the testimony for the prisoner in many instances
<lb/>was overdone.  For instance, had two or three re­
<lb/>spectable persons of good standing in society stated
	  <lb/>that the character of <persName>S. M. Cornell</persName> was not good,
<lb/>and that she was plotting, revengeful, &amp;c. it would
<lb/>have gone farther toward convincing the minds of
<lb/>the public than all this array of questionable evi­
<lb/>dence;  a great deal of it was entirely irrelevant
<lb/>to the case;  a vast deal appeared to have no object
<lb/>but to blacken the character of one as we observ­
<lb/>ed before, who was <said><emph rend="slant(italic)">where she could not answer them
<lb/>back again,</emph></said> and injured in a very material manner
<lb/>the credit of a society who could tolerate such a
<lb/>character (allowing that she was so,) so much as
<lb/>to retain her among them, to be on any terms at
<lb/>all with her.  To receive <emph rend="slant(italic)">again a woman upon pro­
<lb/>bation</emph>, who had once been expelled upon <emph rend="slant(italic)">such a
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">L*</mw>
<pb n="156"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">156</mw>
	    <lb/>charge</emph> as <persName>Doctor Graves</persName> made against her.  Gra­
<lb/>cious heaven!  the idea is monstrous—the thing in­
<lb/>credible, if they had not stated it themselves about
<lb/>themselves.  Who that reads and believes such a
<lb/>statement can be willing their young and innocent
<lb/>daughters should be followers of a meeting prover­
<lb/>bial for their familiar and social habits, where they
<lb/>would be liable to associate with such characters.
</p>
        <p>We do not know but a part of the charges against
<lb/>her may be true, because we have no means of
<lb/>positively knowing;  some of them we know cannot
<lb/>be;  for instance, we know she could not have been
<lb/>sinning and playing the hypocrite in four different
<lb/>places at once, as is found to have been stated in
<lb/>one part of the trial.  She could not have been at
	  <lb/><placeName>Dover</placeName>, <placeName>Great Falls</placeName>, <placeName>Lowell</placeName> and
<placeName>Waltham</placeName>, at one
<lb/>and the same time, without possessing one of the
<lb/>attributes of omnipotence—that of ubiquity.
</p>
        <p>We scarcely think she could have been the wri­
<lb/>ter of these letters, which we know she was, if as
<lb/>vile as represented.  <said rend="pre()post()">Oh</said> exclaims the scoffer who
<lb/>reads them, and believes the account given of
<lb/>her at the trial, <said rend="pre()post()">what a caricature they are upon
	    <lb/>talking, canting, whining <placeName>christians</placeName>.</said>  But to those
<lb/>who hope better things, what a different aspect will
<lb/>they wear.  To those who believe that <said>out of the
<lb/>abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh,</said> they
<lb/>will not appear like hypocrisy.  Ignorant and en­
<lb/>thusiastic we allow her to have been.  Ignorant as
<lb/>she was though, we observe her letters are much bet­
	  <lb/>ter spelt than those of <persName>Avery</persName> which we have seen.
</p>
        <p>We are sorry to say that what we have stated re­
<lb/>specting the treatment of the witnesses, together
<lb/>with much more, generally known, which our limits
<lb/>will not permit us to state, goes far towards contra­
<pb n="157"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">157</mw>
<lb/>dicting the assertion made in the report of the Con­
	  <lb/>ference, who sat upon <persName>Avery's</persName> last examination, viz.
<lb/>that while the trial was pending they remained per­
<lb/>fectly quiet, not even undertaking to clear their
<lb/>brother from any of the ridiculous and exaggerated
<lb/>reports daily circulated against him, or to contra­
<lb/>dicting their reports.  It is apparent it was no time to
<lb/>stand up in his defence in that way—but as to re­
<lb/>maining quiet, it will be seen by every body that
<lb/>they were as busy as <emph rend="slant(italic)">moles</emph>, all the time.  It is
	  <lb/>amazing that <persName>Avery</persName> should not have had the po­
<lb/>liteness to publish a card afterwards thanking his
<lb/>reverend brethren generally, for it would have been
<lb/>hard to have particularized names, where so many
<lb/>deserved the meed of thanks, for their great exertions
<lb/>and important services!!!  Have the proceedings
<lb/>of these reverend gentlemen resembled those of a re­
<lb/>ligious association?  Has it not rather looked like a
<lb/>combination of men for secular and political purpose
<lb/>—a league offensive and defensive? Has it appear­
<lb/>ed their object is to elicit truth, or suppress it?  How
<lb/>is a charge against one of them treated? Is there
<lb/>a candid examination of facts gone into, or is not
<lb/>every movement directed to break down the charac­
<lb/>ter of the accuser in the first place, or to invalidate
<lb/>his testimony some way or other?  Is this the way
<lb/>to come to truth?
</p>
        <p>We come now to the last remark except one
<lb/>we have to make on this painful subject, viz. the
	  <lb/>subject of those letters found in the possession of <persName>S.
<lb/>M. Cornell</persName>, designated as the yellow letter, the pink
<lb/>letter, and the white one.  (The original letters now
<lb/>in the custody of the court, have been kindly and po­
<lb/>litely submitted to our inspection.)  The view of the
<lb/>author in seeking to see them was simply to ascer­
<pb n="158"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">158</mw>
<lb/>tain for a certainty, whether the deceased had any
	  <lb/>hand in them, as insisted upon by the friends of <persName>E.
<lb/>K. Avery</persName>.  To some of them, honest, though prej­
<lb/>udiced people, we had pledged ourselves if possible to
<lb/>obtain a sight of them.  Having been employed for
<lb/>many days in transcribing her letters into this work,
<lb/>we felt perfectly confident, that if she had any hand
<lb/>in them we should at once detect it, however dis­
<lb/>guised.  Among the papers found in her possession
<lb/>we discovered nothing in her hand, however, except
	  <lb/>her letter to <persName>Mr. Bidwell</persName>, and the slip of paper con­
<lb/>taining those words—<said>If I am missing,</said> &amp;c.  The
<lb/>three other letters were written by one person, al­
<lb/>though the pink one was written very fine, and dis­
<lb/>guised to make it resemble a woman's.  But oh when
<lb/>they were compared with the acknowledged letters
	  <lb/>of <persName>Avery</persName> to <persName>Mr. Bidwell</persName>,
<persName>Mr. Drake</persName>,<anchor xml:id="a031" corresp="#n031" rend="pre(*)"/> and <persName>Mr. Storrs</persName>,
<lb/>the conviction which they brought to my mind was
<lb/>absolutely overwhelming.  We thought we had ful­
	  <lb/>ly believed in <persName>Avery's</persName> guilt before, but we feel we
<lb/>never had, until then, a gush of feeling which we
<lb/>could not prevent, choaking utterance for some mo­
	  <lb/>ments.  We do not wonder that his friend <persName>Mr. Bid­
<lb/>well</persName> could not help saying that one of them evident­
<lb/>ly was his hand writing.  That one of them was the
<lb/>plainest, but they all discovered one common hand,
<lb/>all the peculiar<choice><sic>a</sic><corr>i</corr></choice>ties, the turn of the letter, the dash
<pb n="159"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L5r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">159</mw>
<lb/>stops, the breaking of some and the leaning of others,
<lb/>the spelling—of folding and sealing, even to the
<lb/>most minute particulars, was exact in accordance,
<lb/>one thing too as <choice><sic>j</sic><corr>J</corr></choice>udge——, observed—was very con­
<lb/>vincing.  <said>If any one had forged these letters in­
<lb/>tending to have them attributed to him, would they
<lb/>not have put his name, or, at least the initials of it?</said>
<lb/>but instead of that they were signed <said>B. H.</said> for
	  <lb/><persName>Betsey Hill</persName>, probably, though it seemed the writer
<lb/>lost his recollection in one place, where he says,
	  <lb/><said>direct your letters to <persName>Betsey Hills</persName>, and not to me.</said>
</p>
        <p>The fact is it was confidently anticipated by the
<lb/>author of these letters, they would never come to
<lb/>light, she had been directed so positively to burn
<lb/>them.  One said, however, <said>you may keep the let­
<lb/>ter till I come and bring them and I will bring mine.</said>
<lb/>It was thought no doubt she had them with her in
<lb/>the pocketbook or wallet which she always carried
<lb/>in her pocket, and in which she had generally car­
<lb/>ried these letters.  It was stated to the author that
<lb/>when found the pocketbook was not about her, and
<lb/>that from that day to this it has never been discov­
<lb/>ered.  It is amazing this circumstance has never
<lb/>been commented on before, for if true undoubtedly
<lb/>the author of those letters, whoever he was, took it
<lb/>from her, expecting it contained the letters, which
<lb/>it seems she had taken out and put in her bandbox.
<lb/>In her pocket was found a silver pencil case, and
<lb/>some other trifles—we have forgotten what—but no
<lb/>pocketbook.  It would appear singular, if we did
<lb/>not recollect that the finding of the vial of tansy
<lb/>oil was not testified to in Court, or much said
<lb/>about it until within a few months past, although
<lb/>the women who laid her out and found it among her
<pb n="160"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L5v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">160</mw>
	  <lb/>things, talked about it at the time.  <persName>Mrs. Nancy
<lb/>Durfee</persName> testified to the author that she was the first
<lb/>person who saw it in the trunk, where it lay with a
<lb/>teaspoon beside it, and that from the quantity she
<lb/>could not believe it to be oil of tansy—but such it
<lb/>afterwards proved.  We believe there is one person
<lb/>who knows who sold this vial.  We have ascertain­
	  <lb/>ed she did not procure it herself at <placeName>Fall River</placeName>, nor
<lb/>carry it there with her.  There is a peculiarity about
<lb/>the vial, which we believe would cause any person
<lb/>who sold it to recognise it again.
</p>
        <p>It is almost equally strange so little should have
<lb/>been said respecting the wounded hand of the pris­
<lb/>oner.  At the time of the murder a woman in the
<lb/>vicinity of the place, dreamed that the murdered girl
<lb/>appeared to her and told her that the person who
<lb/>killed her, might be recognised by the marks of
<lb/>her teeth upon his hand, for that during the strug­
<lb/>gle he put his hand over her mouth to stifle her
<lb/>shrieks, and she bit it.  This woman determined
<lb/>to see the prisoner, and know whether there were
<lb/>any such marks on his hand or not.  Whether it
<lb/>was owing to her entreaties or not we cannot say,
	  <lb/>but at the <placeName>Bristol</placeName> examination the prisoner was
<lb/>ordered to unglove.  He had kept one glove on,
<lb/>previous to this.  He pulled off his glove and his
<lb/>hand was found to be wounded.  The counsel for
<lb/>the government wanted a physician called to exam­
<lb/>ine it, which the justices who sat on the examina­
	  <lb/>tion declined to do, when <persName>Avery</persName> offered to account
<lb/>for the wound by relating the manner in which it
<lb/>was done.  He was silenced by the government coun­
<lb/>sel, who did not wish to hear <mcr>his story.</mcr> And thus the
<lb/>affair of the wounded hand was dropped.
</p>
        <p>In conclusion, we would observe, that however
<pb n="161"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">161</mw>
	  <lb/>strong the presumption of the guilt of <persName>E. K. Avery</persName>
<lb/>may be on the public mind, we fervently hope he
<lb/>may remain unmolested, and we would wish unno­
<lb/>ticed.  If he is guilty, the avenger of blood is behind
<lb/>him.  That is sufficient.  If innocent, he ought
<lb/>not to preach.  Still, silent contempt and utter neg­
<lb/>lect would do more towards putting down such per­
<lb/>sons than clamour.  Mobbings never ought to be
<lb/>known in a civilized community;  besides that they
<lb/>are calculated to make even merited chastisement
<lb/>appear in the eyes of the world like persecution.
<lb/>They have another horrible tendency, which is to
<lb/>give men in power who are fond of the exercise of
<lb/>authority a pretext for the most shocking severities.
<lb/>Those who set out to inflict chastisement in this
<lb/>way  generally get the worst of it before it is over.
<lb/>Besides, who knows that in this case that is not the
<lb/>very point aimed at?  Who knows that the outrage­
<lb/>ous insult of thrusting this man into the pulpit in
<lb/>every place where he is most obnoxious is not in­
<lb/>tended to produce this very result?  Should a meet­
<lb/>ing-house be pulled down, or preacher torn from the
<lb/>pulpit, who knows what fearful war cry might be
<lb/>raised.  There is nothing whets the<choice><sic/><corr>␣</corr></choice>sword like false
	  <lb/>zeal.  The battles of the <name>Cavaliers</name> and <name>Round
<lb/>Heads</name>  might be fought over again in our country,
<lb/>experience has once demonstrated there is no quarter
<lb/>to be expected from men who would march to bat­
<lb/>tle singing psalms, and wield the battle axe with the
<lb/>covenant  in their bosoms.  From all such contests
<lb/>may the <emph rend="slant(italic)">God of peace</emph> deliver us.</p>

        <p>To return to <placeName>Fall River</placeName>, that place from which
<lb/>sin and sorrow and contention have kept us away
<lb/>so long in story.  Though its natural beauties, as
<lb/>we observed before, are obscured by improvements,
<lb/>it is, and ever will be, beautiful in situation.  The

        <p>Internal improvement is going on, and wealth
<lb/>flowing in.  But there is a change there—and oh,
<lb/>how great a one!  There are two classes of people
<lb/>who once lived in friendly intercourse, between
<lb/>whom, now, nothing but frozen civilities are ex­
<lb/>changed.  The great body of the inhabitants must
<lb/>feel, as every one of our republican states would
<lb/>have felt, if opposition had been enabled to palm
<lb/>upon us the curse of a people, within our own bor­
<lb/>ders, having a seperate and independent govern­
<lb/>ment within themselves.  Can nothing be done to
<lb/>heal the breach?  Children of the same heavenly
<lb/>Father, redeemed by the same power, can no com­
<lb/>promise be effected?  Alas!  we fear not.  Fanati­
<lb/>cism, aided by self-will and obstinacy, has drawn
<lb/>the sword and thrown away the scabbard.  The
<lb/>minority have nailed the flag to the mast, and are
<lb/>determined to surrender only with life.  Ah!  fool­
<lb/>ish and perverse generation;  something may yet
<lb/>happen, to convince you of your error:  but your
<lb/>conviction may come a day too late.  How mourn­
<lb/>ful it is to see people, who once exchanged a friend­
<lb/>ly greeting whenever they met, even in the streets,

<lb/>with a cordial <said>good morning,</said> or a friendly shake
<lb/>of the hand, now pass each other without any salu­
<lb/>tation, and perhaps even with looks of coldness and
<lb/>contempt, of estrangement and aversion.
</p>
        <p>Yet the hospitable and benevolent inhabitants of
	  <lb/><placeName>Fall River</placeName>, as a body, are not in fault in this case;
<lb/>they have only sought to do their duty towards a
<lb/>helpless stranger who perished by lawless violence
<lb/>within their precincts.  And for this, their reward
<lb/>shall be the eternal hatred of one particular class
<lb/>of people, and the esteem of every honest, candid
<lb/>and impartial person.
</p>
        <p>If <placeName>Fall River</placeName> was once an object of interest to the
<lb/>traveller, it is doubly so now, from the associations
<lb/>connected with it.  For months after the tragical
<lb/>affair detailed in the preceding pages, it formed the
<lb/>entire topic of conversation in every steam boat that
<lb/>plied the river;  though time has effected a change
<lb/>in this respect, yet ever as the boat nears the bay
	  <lb/>is the stranger heard to enquire the situation of <persName>Gif­
	    <lb/>ford's</persName> house, of the road to the ferry, of <persName>Howland's</persName>
	  <lb/>bridge, and of <persName>Durfee's</persName> farm.  It is in vain for the
<lb/>peace professing part of the community to say <said>it
<lb/>is time this subject was dropped—this excitement
<lb/>ceased.</said>  To get out of the way of it we must go as
<lb/>a certain writer says, <said>where a <emph rend="slant(italic)">hay stack</emph> was never

        <p>So much has been said of late of <name>Camp Meetings</name>,
<lb/>and such intense curiosity excited on the subject,
<lb/>that the author of these sheets feels called upon to
<lb/>give a history of one of which she was an eye and
<lb/>ear witness, i. e. for the time she passed there.  The
	  <lb/>meeting was held in <placeName>R. I.</placeName> and was I should say
<lb/>some ten or twelve years ago.  It is said that the
<lb/>regulations of those places have been much more
<lb/>strict of late years, and that the disorders in the im­
<lb/>mediate vicinity of a Camp have lessened since.
<lb/>That their moral tendency is better than it was be­
<lb/>fore is however doubtful.  Witness the affair of the
<lb/>unfortunate girl who perished at the stackyard.—
<lb/>That her latest misfortune was occasioned by her
<lb/>attendance there, cannot be doubted.  The testi­
<lb/>mony of her sister and one other respectable female
<lb/>fully proves that;  even by the testimony of her ene­
<lb/>mies it appears she had made resolutions of amend­
	  <lb/>ment, which the temptations and facilities of a <name>Camp
<lb/>Meeting</name> overcame.  In fact it is asserted by many
<lb/>that no certain proof exists that her first criminal
<lb/>offence was not perpetrated there:  that might have
<lb/>been the beginning—the end no one disputes was
<lb/>death.  Nothing can be more imposing than the
<lb/>first view of a camp, and a superficial observer, a
<lb/>person who entered and just walked through, or
<lb/>was so fortunate as to be seated in some safe place
<lb/>while listening to a sermon or a prayer, might see
<lb/>no harm in one.  But we think no person could pass
<pb n="166"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="M2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">166</mw>
<lb/>much time in one, if a person of any observation and
<lb/>not blinded by fanaticism, without deprecating the
<lb/>practice.  I am fully aware I shall make no friends
<lb/>by an exposure of all I saw and heard there, but I
<lb/>hope no enemies.  I hope, fervently hope, that no
<lb/>order of men have become so depraved, as to hate
<lb/>or persecute any one who dares to avow a difference
<lb/>of opinion, or for speaking the truth, however re­
<lb/>pugnant to their own views or feelings.  Should it
<lb/>be asked, where has this history been all this time?
<lb/>I answer, safe locked up in my desk.  Why has it
<lb/>never been published before?  because it has never
<lb/>been called for:  the occasion which has called it
<lb/>forth has never been so pressing.  Men's eyes are
<lb/>now partially open to the great evils of fanaticism
	  <lb/>generally, and of <name>Camp-Meetings</name> in particular;  and
<lb/>every thing known on that subject ought to come
<lb/>out. The following diary or memorandum, or
<lb/>whatever it may be called, was taken at the time,
<lb/>except a very little added from memory.  Were it
<lb/>necessary, I could give the names of many of the
<lb/>characters mentioned:  but it is not with a view of
<lb/>injuring individuals, or dragging before the public
<lb/>names of persons known only for their modesty and
<lb/>domestic virtues, that this is brought before the
<lb/>world;  but with the hope that it may have a tenden­
<lb/>cy to assist in putting down a great evil, a sore afflic­
<lb/>tion in the land, a pestilence walking in darkness,
<lb/>an enormity that calls loudly for the strong arm of
<lb/>the law, in the opinion of many good judges.  A
<lb/>thing much more to be dreaded than even the­
<lb/>atrical entertainments, inasmuch as it goes un­
<lb/>der the name of religion;  whereas the former is
<lb/>called by all sorts of evil names that can serve to
<lb/>warn people.  When people go to the theatre they
<pb n="167"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="M3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">167</mw>
<lb/>know where they are going.  They go with
<lb/>their eyes open.  They know it is at best but a
<lb/>profane entertainment, and they go against the
<lb/>warnings of the pious of all denominations.  But
<lb/>when they go to a Camp ground, they do not
<lb/>know of the dangers that lurk there and menace
<lb/>them at every step:  they do not know who or
<lb/>what mingles with the motley assembly that sur­
<lb/>rounds them.  They are told that by going there
<lb/>they may <emph rend="slant(italic)">find religion</emph>, (a most absurd phrase by
<lb/>the way) as though religion could only be imbibed
<lb/>in certain places and situations.  They are taught
<lb/>that the spirit of God, whose still small whispers
<lb/>may be heard at all times when the soul is dis­
<lb/>posed to retire within itself and listen to its hea­
<lb/>venly breathings, that the spirit of God is in a very
<lb/>peculiar manner dispensed at those scenes of noise
<lb/>and confusion, even without measure, if we may
<lb/>credit their often uttered expressions of <said>I'm full,</said>
<lb/><said>I'm running over,</said> &amp;c.  Many really honest people
<lb/>are induced by the hope of being converted there,
<lb/>without any trouble of their own, to attend fre­
<lb/>quently, to the great detriment of their families
<lb/>who too often are suffering for their care at home.
</p>
        <p>The feelings of the really pure and pious and
<lb/>intellectual among these assemblies must often be
<lb/>outraged—though they endure it thinking they
<lb/>are doing God service, and it must be right be­
<lb/>cause their councils permit or decree it.
</p>
        <p>Mistaken beings, there is a way that seemeth
<lb/>right to a man, but the end thereof is death. I
<lb/>am fully aware of all the arguments made use of
	  <lb/>to defend <name>Camp-Meetings</name>—but they are futile;  and
<lb/>fully aware as will be seen by this of their im­
<lb/>posing effect at first sight.</p>

        <p>Who can contend that this free intermingling of
<lb/>society is not dangerous, this tumbling and falling
<lb/>about not indecent.  That the familiar habit of life
<lb/>practised there is not full of temptation;  to prove this
<lb/>would be to prove that the persons who frequent
<lb/>them are not made of flesh and blood, a thing that
<lb/>abundantly proves itself.
</p>
        <p>Who can prevent the neighborhood of a <name>Camp
<lb/>Meeting</name> from swarming with drunkards and gam­
<lb/>blers, and horse jockies and pickpockets, and of­
<lb/>fenders of every other description, who go about
<lb/>seeking whom they may devour.  It is said now,
<lb/>that <said>bad people are driven off the ground,</said> but if
<lb/>so where do they go to?  it is certain that hack loads
<lb/>and wagon loads of very bad people are always seen
<lb/>following a <name>Camp Meeting</name> as regular as to a field of
<lb/>battle.  If it is purposely to call sinners to repentance
<lb/>that these out door meetings are held, why not
<lb/>have a place assigned them, where they may hear
<lb/>and be profited by the preaching of the word—and
<lb/>kept in sight that people may know what they are
<lb/>about, rather than be driven into the bushes to pol­
<lb/>lute the place with all sorts of enormities.  I am
<lb/>not however contending for their admission at all, if
<lb/>their presence could be avoided, for in my opinion
<lb/>the best place to preach to these people is at home,
<lb/>and admire the plan of domestic missionaries to
<lb/>seek out the abodes of vice.  But if the vilest sin­
<lb/>ners are not to be benefitted by these meetings why
<lb/>not hold them in places of worship where no facili­
<lb/>ties for crime exist?
</p>
        <p>But leaving the out-door evils of <name>Camp Meetings</name>
<lb/>entirely out of the question, it still remains to be
<lb/>asked, are their in-door evils not to be dreaded? is
<lb/>their effect upon the religious society who frequent
<pb n="169"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="M4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">169</mw>
<lb/>them less pernicious?  are not habits of idleness and
<lb/>dissipation (spiritual dissipation though it be) pro­
<lb/>moted by it?  among fanatics especially—among
<lb/>those whose business is at home—among those whose
<lb/>feet ought to abide in their own house?  If we were
	  <lb/>like the wandering <name>Arabs</name> or <name>Tartars</name> whose home is
<lb/>in the fields, in every green spot whereon they
<lb/>may chance to light, it would be a different affair,
<lb/>but in a country like ours where domestic industry
<lb/>and sobriety are of such importance, wandering, idle
<lb/>habits among females are absolutely ruinous.  Add
<lb/>to this the exposure of health.  There can be no
<lb/>doubt that the lives of many delicate females have
<lb/>been sacrificed to the absurd custom of sleeping on
<lb/>the ground, with no covering but a tent to those
<lb/>who have been accustomed to the walls of a house.
<lb/>The want of rest, of sleep, which all who attend
<lb/>these meetings must suffer more or less, must be
<lb/>great.  And last but not least, the low and dishon­
<lb/>oring thoughts of religion which the constant hear­
<lb/>ing of such familiarity with Deity must unavoidably
<lb/>create.  Why it is impossible people can know what
<lb/>they are saying, when they use such expressions as
<lb/>are frequently used at these places.  They frequent­
<lb/>ly speak of the Almighty, and speak to him too, as
<lb/>though he were an equal, and even an inferior;  for
<lb/>people very seldom address an equal in the impera­
<lb/>tive.
</p>
        <p>We have one thing to hope, however, if people
<lb/>will not submit to be reasoned with;  that as the light
<lb/>of science breaks upon their minds, bigotry, super­
<lb/>stition and fanaticism will vanish.  Unless, indeed,
<lb/>it be a combination for civil purposes, as in the case
<lb/>of the Romish Church, where, as her clergy became
<lb/>more enlightened, they only became more accom­
<pb n="170"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">170</mw>
<lb/>plished to do evil;  and in proportion to their knowl­
<lb/>edge, so did their tyranny, and extortion, and op­
<lb/>pression of their simple hearers, increase.
</p>
        <p>It is possible that some very hard thoughts and
<lb/>still harder speeches may be the reward of the wri­
<lb/>ter from those who differ in opinion, but why?
<lb/>How many have we heard of the Methodist denom­
	  <lb/>ination inveighing against <name>Masonry</name>—not because
	  <lb/><name>Masonry</name> ever did them any injury, but merely be­
<lb/>cause it had become so obnoxious to so large a pro­
	  <lb/>portion of the people—and contending that <name>Masons</name>
<lb/>ought to give up their charters, if it was only in
<lb/>compliance with public prejudice and to restore
<lb/>general harmony.  This was certainly sound and
<lb/>correct reasoning:  but it applies equally well to
	  <lb/><name>Camp Meetings</name>, and to the case of <persName>E. K. Avery</persName>.</p>

                <p>The long expected time at length arrived, the
<lb/>meeting was to be held in an extensive wood about
<lb/>nine miles from the town of — several very respec­
<lb/>table young ladies had agreed to stay at a house
<lb/>within two miles of the meeting, where they could
<lb/>ride backwards and forwards as often as they chose
<lb/>through its continuance.  The weather was exces­
<lb/>sively warm and the season unusually dry, and from
<lb/>dust and heat, most uncomfortable riding.  For my
<lb/>own part I felt determined to endure all hardships
<lb/>rather than be disappointed in this opportunity of
<lb/>seeing and hearing.  So many stories had been told
<lb/>me of <name>Camp Meetings</name>, and such various and con­
<lb/>tradictory ones, that I felt determined to see and
<pb n="171"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="M5r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">171</mw>
<lb/>hear for myself.  The meetings had not commenced
<lb/>upon our arrival, but the Camp was said to be in or­
<lb/>der, and so great was our impatience to see it, that
<lb/>we accepted of a ride with a company of friends
<lb/>who were going from the house where we staid, and
<lb/>proceeded to the camp ground.
</p>
                <p>There was an avenue opened through the wood
<lb/>from the road to the camp, perhaps of about a quar­
<lb/>ter of a mile in length, but as it had just been clear­
<lb/>ed, was exceedingly dangerous riding.  However,
<lb/>we arrived safe at the entrance, and dismounting,
<lb/>passed the barrier, and found ourselves within the
<lb/>circle of the camp.  I was never more amazed than
<lb/>by the scene before me.  It was a beautiful spot in
<lb/>a pine wood.  The trees were felled here and there
<lb/>with a sufficiency left for shade, and had the ap­
<lb/>pearance of a fine grove within an impenetrable
<lb/>wood.  The spot prepared was entirely round in
<lb/>shape, and its circumference I do not know, but it
<lb/>was quite extensive.  The setting sun lent its last
<lb/>bright beams to the scene, while the snowy tents
<lb/>stretched far and wide, discovered many happy faces
<lb/>peeping from beneath their white curtains.  Here
<lb/>and there an old man or woman was setting in the
<lb/>door enjoying the refreshing odour from the pines,
<lb/>or rapt in contemplation of the scene before them,
<lb/>upon which they appeared to gaze with much plea­
<lb/>sure.
</p>
                <p>I was lost in admiration:  a holy calm took pos­
		  <lb/>session of my soul:  I thought of the camp of <persName>Israel</persName>
		  <lb/>—of <persName>Abraham</persName> sitting in his tent door in the cool of
<lb/>the day—of the patriarchs of old, who, as the in­
<lb/>spired historian informs us, were <said>plain men dwell­
<lb/>ing in tents.</said> My imagination ran through the
		  <lb/>whole scene of sacred history, from <persName>Adam</persName> down to
<pb n="172"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="M5v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">172</mw>
		  <lb/><persName>Moses</persName>—the plains of <placeName>Mamre</placeName>—the desert of
<placeName>Sinai</placeName>
<lb/>was before me—I heard in imagination <said>the trump
<lb/>of God, and witnessed the proclamation of the law.</said>
<lb/>In short it was some time before I could descend to
<lb/>earth and seriously consider the object that brought
<lb/>me there.
</p>
                <p>The plain dress of the people was very pleasant
<lb/>to me, and about the place there was an air of quiet,
<lb/>inviting to heavenly contemplation.  And is this, I
<lb/>asked, a <name>Camp Meeting</name>?  I do not believe a word
<lb/>about the confusion.  Ill natured world that it is,
<lb/>what can be more proper than to retire into the de­
<lb/>sert to pray?  What more likely to keep in mind
<lb/>that we are strangers and pilgrims here, than to be­
<lb/>come the inhabitant of a tent for a certain season?
<lb/>They came doubtless to recollect that <said>here we
<lb/>have no continuing city—to remember that we have
<lb/>no certain habitation but that house eternal in the
<lb/>heavens, whose builder and maker is God.</said> And
<lb/>here too, doubtless, they came to mourn for the sins
<lb/>that made us pilgrims and exiles in a world that but
<lb/>for our disobedience would still have been man's
<lb/>Paradise.  In this state of exile, of humiliation, they
<lb/><said rend="pre()">eat their bread with tears, and mingle their drink
<lb/>with weeping.</said> What can be more useful?  what
<lb/>more proper?  what more salutary?  Surely my God
<lb/>must look with complacency upon a scene like this.
</p>
                <p>With a heart too full for conversation, I walked
<lb/>around the ground.  My companions too were not
<lb/>very loquacious.  I imagine the scene struck them
<lb/>something as it did me, except one who was not so
<lb/>ignorant as myself.  To her I made the remark,
<lb/><said>it is very quiet here.</said>  She answered, <said>the meet­
<lb/>ings have not began.</said>
</p>
                <p>Upon re-entering the avenue our wagon had to
<pb n="173"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="M6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">173</mw>
<lb/>turn out often for companies of rude young men,
<lb/>who, though the pass was so extremely dangerous,
		  <lb/>drove <persName>Jehu</persName>-like, unmindful of stumps or stones, and
<lb/>appeared in a high frolic.  I inquired the meaning
<lb/>of this.  The landlord's son who was driving us,
<lb/>answered, <said>They were professional gamblers and
<lb/>horse jockies, who followed a <name>Camp Meeting</name> as reg­
<lb/>ularly as crows a<choice><sic>u</sic><corr>n</corr></choice>d vultures followed an army.</said>  I
<lb/>was amazed, but I soon forgot the circumstance and
<lb/>relapsed into my former pleasing reverie.
</p>
                <p><name>Tuesday</name>, we rode into the camp ground immedi­
<lb/>ately after breakfast.  Upon arriving in sight of the
<lb/>tents, I remarked to one of my companions, we had
<lb/>never seen an army encamped, and I hoped we
<lb/>never might, but this must resemble it in appearance
<lb/>except in warlike preparations.  <said rend="pre()post()">But here,</said> exclaim­
<lb/>ed I with enthusiasm, <said rend="pre()post()">they wage a holy war.  These
<lb/>are engaged in a warfare that must never end, and
<lb/>their vigilance must exceed that of those whose sen­
<lb/>tence is death for slumbering at their post.  Their
<lb/>foes are from within as well as from without;  but
<lb/>they fight under a powerful leader, and be their foes
<lb/>ever so numerous, the banner of the cross will final­
<lb/>ly prevail.</said>
</p>
                <p>Under the impression of such feelings, I entered
<lb/>the circle ready to join the people in their holy work.
<lb/>The ground is what is called an inclined plane, that
<lb/>is of rather gradual descent, and towards the lower
<lb/>part was erected a small platform, intended for the
<lb/>pulpit, called familiarly <said>the preacher's stand.</said>  A
<lb/>man was standing there when we entered and loud­
<lb/>ly calling upon the people to repent:  there was little
<lb/>sense or connection in what he said, but he seemed
<lb/>to be very earnest and sincere, and had I think, the
<lb/>loudest voice I ever remember to have heard, but
<pb n="174"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="M6v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">174</mw>
<lb/>his exertions seemed thrown away, for except a stroll­
<lb/>ing party occasionally halted near him, he had no
<lb/>auditors.  We agreed to take a walk round and see
<lb/>what had become of the <emph rend="slant(italic)">good people</emph>.  They were
<lb/>mostly in their tents, cooking and eating, and in
<lb/>another apartment (for they were usually divided
<lb/>into two or three) reclining on the straw—men and
<lb/>women promiscuously chatting and laughing, and
<lb/>sometimes casting a furtive glance towards the
<lb/>preacher, whose extreme earnestness apparently ex­
<lb/>cited little interest.  After a time he was succeeded
<lb/>by another, equally vehement;  and one old man
<lb/>began to cry aloud for mercy, which seemed to en­
<lb/>courage them very much.  Being fatigued, we re­
<lb/>tired to one of the tents where we had some acquaint­
<lb/>ance, to rest.  They informed us that none of their
<lb/>best speakers had appeared yet, and that the even­
<lb/>ing was the time for powerful meetings.  Towards
<lb/>noon, we observed people gathering round one of
<lb/>the tents, and following the multitude we entered.
</p>
                <p>Curiosity had been excited by the falling of a
<lb/>young woman on the ground near the stand.  She
<lb/>had been conveyed into this tent, and was now ly­
<lb/>ing on the straw, while the people who brought her
<lb/>returned to the stand, and seemed to take no further
<lb/>thought of her.  We approached the young woman
<lb/>and felt her pulse, and believing she was in a hys­
<lb/>teric fit, and that it would be highly injurious to let
<lb/>her remain so any time, begged permission to em­
<lb/>ploy restoratives;  but to all applications for them,
<lb/>and remonstrances, they turned a deaf ear.  The
<lb/>people within smiled scornfully at my ignorance—
<lb/>told me she was happy and it would be a sin to re­
<lb/>vive her if they could.  She was very pale and her
<lb/>pulse very low;  but upon my persisting in rubbing
<pb n="175"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="N1r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">175</mw>
<lb/>her and calling for restoratives, backed as I was by
<lb/>a skillful physician who now entered the tent, and
<lb/>was remonstrating in not very gentle terms upon tri­
<lb/>fling thus with human life, they ordered us out of
<lb/>the tent, and fastened down the curtain, which ex­
<lb/>cluded every breath of air, in an intense hot day,
<lb/>with orders for no one to disturb her until the Lord
<lb/>chose to dissolve her trance.
</p>
                <p>From this spectacle we retreated towards the Af­
<lb/>rican tent, which was filled with coloured people,
<lb/>but there was so much talking there at once, and
<lb/>they were so thick, we were obliged to pass on.  A
<lb/>very old man now took his place on the stand, whose
<lb/>hoary head and stooping gait proclaimed that time
<lb/>with him would soon cease to be.  I observed to the
<lb/>young lady who had my arm, that <said>this old man
<lb/>who stands upon the borders of eternity, will cer­
<lb/>tainly feel what he says,</said> and we descended again
<lb/>to the stand.
</p>
                <p>He commenced his discourse by saying—<said>he
		    <lb/>was a very old fashioned <name>Methodist</name>, and he should
<lb/>not be put out if they should <emph rend="slant(italic)">groan</emph>, or say <emph rend="slant(italic)">amen</emph> or
<lb/><emph rend="slant(italic)">hallelujah</emph>—that he had seen nothing that looked
<lb/>like zeal among them yet—no efforts to take the
<lb/>kingdom by force,</said> &amp;c. &amp;c.—and he exhorted
<lb/>them with a degree of violence, which soon exhaust­
<lb/>ed him and compelled him to yield the pulpit, i. e.
<lb/>the stand, to another.  It had seemed the preach­
<lb/>er's object in this discourse to bring his audience to
<lb/>a certain temperature, and I was lost in reflection,
<lb/>thinking if the man could mean that the Lord was
<lb/>not worshipped with acceptance where he was wor­
<lb/>shipped in silence.  But I had little time for reflec­
<lb/>tion on the subject, for a very devout looking person
<lb/>now advanced and requested his brethren to join

<lb/>him in prayer for the multitude.  Being hemmed in
<lb/>in such a manner it was impossible for many of us
<lb/>to kneel, and many doubtless were afraid to.  It is
<lb/>true if we had been engaged just as we ought to
<lb/>have been, we should not have seen what we did
<lb/>see.  But this was impossible without absolute dan­
<lb/>ger to ourselves.  We had just been warned not on­
<lb/>ly against pickpockets, but told women were often
<lb/>grossly insulted there, even in the thickest  of the
<lb/>camp.  Our eyes were therefore about us, and sev­
<lb/>eral young ladies afterwards told us that whenever
<lb/>they closed their eyes, and tried to engage in pray­
<lb/>er, they were aroused by some of the men pressing
<lb/>so near, they could almost feel the pulsation of their
<lb/>hearts, and sometimes press their arms, &amp;c.
</p>
                <p>But our greatest astonishment was to see the
		  <lb/><name>Methodists</name> themselves wandering about in all direc­
<lb/>tions, and some that were kneeling near us did not
<lb/>in the least appear to be engaged in what they were
<lb/>professedly about.  One young woman, who knelt by
<lb/>our side, was busily employed in trying to fit a piece
<lb/>of bark to a log, with a countenance that expressed
<lb/>anything but devotion.  One of our companions,
<lb/>who was watching her, burst into a violent fit of
<lb/>laughter, which she seemed unable to restrain, al­
<lb/>though we gave her very severe looks and shook our
<lb/>heads at her.  She was not a professor of religion,
<lb/>though a most amiable person and a sincere well
<lb/>wisher to the cause;  and she appeared to be very
<lb/>much mortified upon being told of it afterwards,
<lb/>though she assured us, with tears in her eyes, that
<lb/>if her existence had depended upon her suppressing
<lb/>it, she could not have done so.
</p>
                <p>The excessive heat and fatigue drove us back to
<lb/>our lodgings at noon; but towards night we rode
<pb n="177"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="N2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">177</mw>
<lb/>again to the Camp.  We observed, as we came near
<lb/>the wood, the recent erection of stalls to sell liquors
<lb/>and refreshments;  and around many were congrega­
<lb/>ted people notorious for dissolute morals and dis­
<lb/>graceful conduct.  The wood appeared to be swarm­
<lb/>ing with people of all descriptions, and it looked as
<lb/>though it might be extremely hazardous for any one
<lb/>to venture there alone and on foot.
</p>
                <p>The first object that met our eyes upon coming
<lb/>within the barrier was a young woman of extreme
<lb/>beauty, who was staggering through the Camp, with
<lb/>her clothes torn and her locks dishevelled, wringing
<lb/>her hands and mourning that the people were not
<lb/>more engaged.  She was a girl of about middling
<lb/>height, rather fat, with large, languishing black
<lb/>eyes, and a profusion of raven hair which floated on
<lb/>her shoulders and reached below her waist, with
<lb/>the fairest complexion that could be imagined.  She
<lb/>appeared to excite great attention wherever she mo­
<lb/>ved through the crowd.  We observed, as she pass­
<lb/>ed along, that the young men exchanged winks and
<lb/>jogged each others elbows.  We subsequently saw
<lb/>the same young woman lying in a tent, apparently
<lb/>insensible, i. e. in a perfect state of happiness, as
<lb/>they assured us.  There was a great deal of joggling,
<lb/>pinching and looking under bonnets, which was
<lb/>extremely annoying.  We met a young lady from
<lb/>our town, who showed us her arms pinched black
<lb/>and blue by she could not tell who, while she was
<lb/>listening to the preaching of a woman at the stand.
<lb/>She was quite enraged about it, and protested she
<lb/>would get home as soon as she could get her party
<lb/>to go, and that no persuasion should induce her to
<lb/>come again.  Her arm really appeared in a swollen,
<lb/>bad state.  She was a woman of very correct de­
<pb n="178"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="N2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">178</mw>
<lb/>portment, and the conviction that no impropriety
<lb/>on her part could have been the provocation to insult,
<lb/>rendered the circumstance rather alarming; and we
<lb/>resolved to keep very near our friends and return
<lb/>home at an early hour:  though various persons of
<lb/>the meeting tried to prevail on us to stay, saying
<lb/><said>the work of the spirit was much more powerful af­
<lb/>ter dark.</said>  There appeared to be a great deal of
<lb/>uncivil amusement going on, not only in a sly way,
<lb/>in the Camp, but throughout the ground.  The nar­
<lb/>row, dark avenue was exceedingly hard to pass;  dis­
<lb/>solute and drunken people were frequently in the
<lb/>rear of the carriages, swearing and talking in the
<lb/>most profane and indecent manner.  Upon retiring
<lb/>for the night, I had a most serious time of self-exam­
<lb/>ination whether it was right to go again;  but the
<lb/>desire to know the extent of the evil or good prevail­
<lb/>ed, and I resolved to see it out, as the phrase is.
		  <lb/><name>Wednesday</name>, however, I did not go at all, being con­
<lb/>fined with a violent head-ache.  There was no rest
<lb/>in the inn;  constant quarrelling in the road;  the men
<lb/>very profane, talking every thing.  The Landlord of
<lb/>the house where we were, a very quiet man, appear­
<lb/>ed exceedingly annoyed.
</p>
                <p>In the course of the day, we heard often from the
<lb/>Camp.  It waxed warmer there.  Many were struck
<lb/>down, they said, with conviction of their sins, throw­
<lb/>ing themselves in the dirt and calling loudly for mer­
<lb/>cy;  and many more <said><emph rend="slant(italic)">lost their strength</emph></said>: the state
<lb/>of exhaustion described in the preceeding pages.
<lb/>The people without, we were informed, became
<lb/>more noisy and obstreperous.  <said>Oceans of rum,</said> as
<lb/>it was often expressed, were drank in the neigh­
<lb/>borhood.  All that night we slept but little. Some
<lb/>of the profane lodgers, on the other side of the build­
<pb n="179"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="N3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">179</mw>
<lb/>ing, were continually singing hallelujahs and shout­
<lb/>ing <said>Amen!  Glory!</said> &amp;c.  It was in vain the land­
<lb/>lord exerted himself;  before he could get to one
<lb/>room, a louder call from the other end of the build­
<lb/>ing would draw him there, until he gave the matter
<lb/>up in despair, and suffered his obstreperous lodgers
<lb/>to sing themselves to sleep.
</p>
                <p><name>Thursday</name> afternoon, rode again to the Camp,
<lb/>saw the most drunken people in the road I ever saw
<lb/>on any other occasion.  Many of them, I was told,
<lb/>had families at home destitute, even in this land of
<lb/>plenty, of the common necessaries of life.  I could
<lb/>not help groaning in spirit all the way, which was
<lb/>literally perfumed by the odour of the spirit which
<lb/>they had drank.  Of course they, the mob, were dread­
<lb/>fully impudent;  not to us to be sure—the gentle­
<lb/>man who always carried us was uncle to two of the
<lb/>ladies  of our party and well known in that part of
<lb/>the country;  with him, therefore, we always felt
<lb/>perfectly safe.  But he told us he had to dismount,
<lb/>the day before, from his wagon, to rescue some fe­
<lb/>males from insult, two or three times;  and that the
		  <lb/><name>Methodists</name> had sent for two or three sheriffs to
<lb/>come and keep order.
</p>
                <p>When we entered the Camp, there was what
<lb/>they called a powerful preacher, on the stand.  He
<lb/>was exhorting the people to repentance with great
		  <lb/>vehemence and gesticulation.  The bad <name>English</name> he
<lb/>used provoked many a smile from his hearers, while
<lb/>another class of his hearers seemed to listen with
<lb/>profound attention, and expressed their approbation
<lb/>by many an exclamation of delight, accompanied
<lb/>with groans and amens.  One man fell down near
<lb/>us in strong convulsions;  the crowd pressed around
<lb/>him, but the brethren, pushing them back, drew
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">N*</mw>
<pb n="180"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="N3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">180</mw>
<lb/>him into a tent, saying he was <said>full of the spirit,</said>
<lb/>&amp;c.  We now got crowded between a woman of
<lb/>most infamous character and some young men, who
<lb/>were holding a whispering dialogue over our shoul­
<lb/>ders:—astonishing impudence!  We removed to
<lb/>another part of the ground as soon as possible;  and
<lb/>having regained our escort, proceeded to a bench
<lb/>near the upper end of the Camp.  Here, seated be­
<lb/>neath some trees, we could look down upon the
<lb/>crowd, though out of its immediate vicinity.  Here,
<lb/>too, we could hear most of what the preacher said
<lb/>who was then speaking.  One of our acquaintance
<lb/>now advanced from one of the tents, and informed
<lb/>us there had been <said>quite a riot there</said> the prece­
<lb/>ding evening, but that there was <said>no danger now,
<lb/>as there were several officers on the ground, hired
<lb/>to keep the peace.</said>  But there was no solemnity
<lb/>now—all was hubbub and confusion.  A sister
<lb/>came up and asked if we intended to stay in the
<lb/>evening, saying they had <said>such <emph rend="slant(italic)">powerful</emph> meetings
<lb/>in the evening, it was heaven below.</said>  I could not
<lb/>but express to her and several others, that I was
<lb/>about tired of it, and should go away with very
<lb/>strong prejudices against <name>Camp Meetings</name>.  They
<lb/>assured me <said rend="pre()">it was only because I had not seen
<lb/>enough of them, and that if I should remain with
<lb/>them one evening, they doubted not my preju­
<lb/>dices would vanish;  and that I should witness such
<lb/>a display of the power of God, as I never saw before;</said>
<lb/>said I was cold, <said>but she would insure me I should
<lb/>get warmed, if I would only attend their evening
<lb/>prayer meetings.</said>  I told her it was not possible
<lb/>for me to stay that evening, as we expected the wa­
<lb/>gon, to carry us back, before sunset, and I had en­
<lb/>gaged to return with my party;  but that both they
<pb n="181"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="N4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">181</mw>
<lb/>and I intended to pass the last night in the Camp,
<lb/>which would be the next, as we understood they
<lb/>kept up the meetings through the whole of the last
<lb/>night, and we were determined, having heard so
<lb/>much of their evening meetings, to be present one
<lb/>night; and if there was any good to be obtained, to
<lb/>be in the way of it.  She appeared to be much
<lb/>pleased, and we separated.  Our conveyance now
<lb/>arrived for us and we departed;  again past the dark
<lb/>avenue, upon which the shades of twilight were now
<lb/>fast gathering.  The brutal intoxication and pro­
<lb/>fanity visible on the road home was truly shocking;
<lb/>and as we went past the stalls, the thought struck
<lb/>me, that these buyers and sellers were after all per­
<lb/>haps the smallest sinners on the ground;  that they,
<lb/>who were the means of bringing this tumultuous
<lb/>assemblage together, unless there was some redeem­
<lb/>ing merit about it that I had not yet discovered, had
<lb/>much to answer for.  Dismissing such thoughts
<lb/>however, I resolved not to make a final decision
<lb/>against them, until I had witnessed those meetings
<lb/>upon whose influence they counted so much.
</p>
                <p>This evening I overheard some ladies, (of whom
<lb/>there was and had been, a respectable number, and
<lb/>a very respectable company at the inn,) teazing their
<lb/>husbands to carry them to the Camp.  Their hus­
<lb/>bands positively refused, saying it was not a proper
<lb/>place for females in the evening, and that they could
<lb/>not engage to protect them from insult while passing
<lb/>through the wood and its environs;  that they them­
<lb/>selves should go but begged the females to remain
		  <lb/>contented where they were.  Children of <persName>Eve</persName>!  I
<lb/>heard them afterwards resolving at all hazards to
<lb/>know where the danger lay, and threatening if their
<lb/>husbands went without them to hire a conveyance
<pb n="182"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="N4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">182</mw>
<lb/>and go by themselves.  Whether they carried their
<lb/>point or not I did not ascertain.  I saw them all de­
<lb/>part from the inn in company together.
</p>
                <p>A number of young men now repaired to the inn,
<lb/>from the Camp, to get supper, intending to go back
<lb/>again.  They appeared in a high frolic, but one of
<lb/>them was taken alarmingly ill.  Directly after he
<lb/>was seized with a bleeding at the nose, so violent as
<lb/>to induce the belief that it proceeded from the rupture
<lb/>of a blood vessel.  Though at some distance from
<lb/>the apartments of the family, the ladies all volunteer­
<lb/>ed to his assistance.  It was a shocking scene, and
<lb/>with the greatest difficulty the effusion of blood was
<lb/>stopped by the variety of applications used.  He
<lb/>appeared quite grateful for our kindness, and par­
<lb/>ticularly to the landlord, who immediately after had
<lb/>him carried to a cool room and put into bed;  but
<lb/>the effect of the scenes he had just witnessed, had
<lb/>such an effect upon his brain that nothing could
<lb/>keep him silent.  As soon as he was comfortably in
<lb/>bed he commenced singing hallelujah, and kept it
<lb/>up for the greater part of the night.
</p>
                <p><name>Friday</name> was the last day of the meeting, and I who
<lb/>had now firmly resolved to see it out, and be a judge
<lb/>myself how far it was a work of the Spirit, went pre­
<lb/>pared to spend the day and night in the Camp.  We
<lb/>carried refreshments, and all of our party agreed to
<lb/>keep together;  and to ensure our safety, we contri­
<lb/>ved to go in the suite of an officer of justice, who with
<lb/>his family had stopped at the inn on their way.  By
<lb/>the way, we had only occasional glimpses of him
<lb/>after we got there, for being employed by the meet­
<lb/>ing people to keep order, he was obliged to be on
<lb/>the alert.  It was a scene of dreadful confusion to
<lb/>get there in the first place, the road was so full of
<pb n="183"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="N5r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">183</mw>
<lb/>people, the dust (for the earth had been fairly plough­
<lb/>ed up by the multitude of feet) blowing and blinding
<lb/>one.  It was a fact that we not half the time could
<lb/>see our horses heads, as we rode on.  In the Camp
<lb/>there was great confusion.  The crowd had very
<lb/>sensibly augmented.  There was a woman exhor­
<lb/>ting at the stand, and one of our townsmen, who re­
<lb/>cognized me, and knew I was a great stickler for
<lb/>women's preaching, immediately came up and invi­
<lb/>ted me to go down and hear her.  Accordingly we
<lb/>all went down to the stand.  A young female whose
<lb/>appearance bespoke her to be under twenty, was ex­
<lb/>horting.  The first words we distinguished were
<lb/>these, that she <said>did not want a copper of their mon­
<lb/>ey—No I dont want your money,</said> she repeated, <said>not
<lb/>a copper of your money, only the salvation of your
<lb/>souls,</said> and she exhorted the <said>young <emph rend="slant(italic)">Ladies</emph></said> and
<lb/>the <said rend="pre()">dear young Gentlemen</said> to repent, with all the
<lb/>energy she was capable of.  Now I who abominate
<lb/>the epithet of <emph rend="slant(italic)">Ladies</emph> and <emph rend="slant(italic)">Gentlemen</emph> in christian ex­
<lb/>hortations, was turning off, when some one whisper­
		  <lb/>ed, <persName>Mrs. T—</persName> is going to preach.  This lady whom
<lb/>I had once before heard upon a most interesting
<lb/>occasion, was a great favourite with me, and I had
<lb/>inquired several times if she was there.  I therefore
<lb/>took my station on a log, and with my companions
<lb/>heard her discourse.  The woman speaking was of
<lb/>very mild and pleasing manners—a woman of plain
<lb/>good sense, and exceedingly graceful and winning
<lb/>in her manner, when speaking in a house where her
<lb/>voice could be heard without exertion;  but although
<lb/>her discourse which was short, was now, as it always
<lb/>was, good, yet the evidently great exertion she now
<lb/>used, destroyed much of its effect with most of the
<lb/>hearers; the blood looked as though it would burst
<pb n="184"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="N5v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">184</mw>
<lb/>through her face, the veins of her forehead and tem­
<lb/>ples as well as those of her neck, <said>swelled up like
<lb/>whip cords,</said> and her mouth, usually of sweet and
<lb/>placid expression, from her efforts to speak loud,
<lb/>was absolutely disfigured.
</p>
                <p><said xml:id="q028">Is this the <persName>Mrs. T—</persName>,</said> whispered one to me,
<lb/><said xml:id="q029" rend="pre()post()">I have heard you praise so much?  Why, I never wit­
<lb/>nessed such contortions of countenance before.</said>
<lb/>Such remarks proved the woman in my mind to be
<lb/>out of her place, for I had no doubt her discourse
<lb/>was better than any that had been heard there, but
<lb/>the great effort of retaining such a masculine atti­
<lb/>tude entirely destroyed the effect.  She was succeed­
<lb/>ed by a very bold and uncouth looking young female,
<lb/>whose language was as coarse as her look and man­
<lb/>ner.  She called upon the people loudly to repent
<lb/><said>to-day and save their souls.</said>  Some very singular
<lb/>expression she made use of appeared to have an irre­
<lb/>sistible effect upon a part of her auditors, who laugh­
<lb/>ed aloud;  upon which she said she <said rend="pre(“)post()">did'nt care
<lb/>who laughed, she cared for nobody not a snap of her
<lb/>finger,</said> (snapping her fingers in great style.)  Ano­
<lb/>ther loud laugh.  My faith in woman's preaching
<lb/>began to waver, and I was glad to walk off.  We
<lb/>observed an African upon a stump at some distance,
<lb/>near the upper part of the camp, collecting a great
<lb/>crowd around him, who were listening with open
<lb/>ears and gaping mouths.  Some were wiping their
<lb/>eyes, many shouting, and others grinning.  Thither
<lb/>then we bent our course, willing to hear the truth
<lb/>from whatever quarter it might proceed.  The first
		  <lb/>words that met my ear were—<said rend="pre(“)post()"><distinct>Deble fader</distinct> of lies;
		    <lb/>he be liar from <distinct>beginnin</distinct>.  Some say poor niger <distinct>hab
		      <lb/>no shoule</distinct>.  <distinct>Vel dat I dont know, but dis I know</distinct>, I
		    <lb/>got something in my body make me feel <distinct>tumfortable</distinct>,</said>
<pb n="185"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="N6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">185</mw>
<lb/>(clapping his hands vehemently upon his huge
<lb/>chest).  A peal of laughter, long and loud from the
<lb/>profane rabble, was the response.  While nothing
<lb/>daunted he continued to go on in the same strain,
<lb/>not in the least interrupted or annoyed by the con­
<lb/>tinued shouts of the mob, who, clapping their hands,
<lb/>kept crying, <said>go on brother, that's your sort, glory,
<lb/>hallelujah,</said> &amp;c.  with all such sort of encouragement.
<lb/>I need not say we did not stay there long;  and as
<lb/>no interesting preacher now occupied the stand, we
<lb/>resolved to stroll round and look up some of our
<lb/>friends from the neighboring towns, many of whom
<lb/>we doubted not were there.  In passing one of the
<lb/>tents we could not forbear stopping to look at a
<lb/>young woman reclining on the straw in a very lan­
<lb/>guishing attitude, and apparently quite helpless:  two
<lb/>or three young men had seated themselves near her
<lb/>and were enquiring how she felt?  Upon closely ob­
<lb/>serving her I discovered she was the same young
<lb/>woman whose disordered appearance and extraordi­
<lb/>nary beauty had struck me so forcibly, and invited
<lb/>so much observation a few day before.  It was she,
<lb/>but oh how changed!  even in the brief space of time
<lb/>that had intervened since we saw her before.  Her
<lb/>bloom was entirely gone, and her haggard look and
<lb/>tangled hair gave her the appearance of something
<lb/>that had recently escaped from a mad house.  I shud­
<lb/>dered with horror, and thought oh! if you were a sister
<lb/>or daughter of mine how should I feel.  Humanity
<lb/>towards the poor victim induced me to draw near
<lb/>and ask her if she had no mother to take care of
<lb/>her?  She turned a look of scorn and anger upon
<lb/>me, and then exchanged a look with each of the
<lb/>young men, and they all three laughed, and I walk­
<lb/>ed off convinced I had been mistaken.  I afterwards
<pb n="186"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="N6v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">186</mw>
<lb/>mentioned the case of this young woman to some of
<lb/>the persons on the ground, who undertook to explain
<lb/>to me her situation by telling me she had just come
<lb/>to.  Their language I have forgotten, but I under­
<lb/>stood it to mean that she had gone through a process
<lb/>which they considered as perfecting the work of
<lb/>sanctification, and I afterwards was told by some
<lb/>people at the house, that she was probably the same
<lb/>young woman who had lain two full days in a state
<lb/>of stupor, an unusual long time, and that it was pos­
<lb/>sible her intellects might be affected.  Be that as it
<lb/>might, the image of the fair sinner, or saint (for she
<lb/>was no half way character) haunted me for some
<lb/>time.  We afterwards looked into another tent
<lb/>where we saw a girl from our own immediate neigh­
<lb/>borhood, in much the same situation, having just re­
<lb/>covered from a state of torpor, and rejoicing with
<lb/>great appearance of happiness.  My heart sickened
<lb/>at the sight of her, for I believed her a most accom­
<lb/>plished hypocrite, and the end justified my suspic­
<lb/>ions.  In the course of a few months she destroyed
<lb/>the peace effectually of a worthy family, who had
<lb/>taken her from a state of great poverty several years
<lb/>before, and cherished her with all the tenderness of
<lb/>parents.  She had previous to this been a Baptist by
<lb/>profession, but after this attached herself to the peo­
<lb/>ple through whose ministry she professed to have
<lb/>been recovered from her backslidings, and continued
<lb/>with their society until put out of all society.
</p>
                <p>Being exceedingly fatigued we were now obliged
<lb/>to give up our plan of remaining in the Camp;  the
<lb/>wagon in which we came having arrived with some
<lb/>other persons, we concluded to go home and recruit
<lb/>before the services of the evening.  The ride home
<lb/>was no more annoying than when we came;  a certain
<pb n="187"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="O1r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">187</mw>
<lb/>sharp-looking set of fellows seemed to be prowling
<lb/>about the woods, and dodging at every corner—
<lb/>whose very look was sufficient almost to curdle
<lb/>one's blood, but it was now so generally understood
<lb/>that the camp was protected by the officers of justice
<lb/>that none dared to show their colors.
</p>
                <p>Before it was quite dark we returned, and by the
<lb/>time we arrived, the camp was lighted.  I could
<lb/>easily imagine that embellishment added much to the
<lb/>scene.  The disposal of the lights which exhibited so
<lb/>many different groups, and displayed the parapher­
<lb/>nalia of the tents with such a different aspect from
<lb/>what it appeared in the glare of day, was altogether
<lb/>imposing, or rather witching.  For a time we walk­
<lb/>ed, until our protectors returned to the inn to take
<lb/>back the conveyance.  We avowed our determina­
<lb/>tion to pass the night in the Camp;  the gentlemen
<lb/>remonstrated, urged the fatigue, the exposure to
<lb/>health, the danger, unless we kept close under the
<lb/>wing of some person or persons able to protect us—
<lb/>but all to no purpose, we determined to remain.
<lb/>They promised to return and stay until ten or eleven
<lb/>o'clock, and then they said we must take care of
<lb/>ourselves;  and leading us to one of the seats at the
<lb/>upper end of the ground, departed.  There were four
<lb/>of us, nevertheless we experienced some little sinking
<lb/>of heart when we saw our protectors depart.  From
<lb/>the place where we sat we could see the whole
<lb/>ground;  there was a preacher on the stump speak­
<lb/>ing loudly and vehemently;  a black man also on
<lb/>the stand, and nobody attending to either;  the noise
<lb/>could not have been exceeded by the confusion of
<lb/>Babel.  I could not compose my mind to realize it
<lb/>was a place of worship, although the songs of praise
<lb/>and the voice of exhortation mingled with the groans
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">O</mw>
<pb n="188"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="O1v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">188</mw>
<lb/>of despair, and blending in strange confusion with
<lb/>the various dialogues going on, rose each moment on
<lb/>the ear.  Prayer meetings had commenced in the
<lb/>different tents, yet there was a continual travelling
<lb/>from place to place—nobody except the immediate
<lb/>actors in the scene seemed stationary for a moment
<lb/>at a time;  crowds of people passing and repassing all
<lb/>the time.  One woman flew past, throwing her
<lb/>arms abroad, and shouting <said>there are grapes here
<lb/>and they are good, heavenly times! heavenly times!</said>
<lb/>A few moments after our ears were assailed with
<lb/>the most piercing shrieks of a female voice, which
<lb/>proceeded from behind one of the neighboring tents.
<lb/>Two of us sprang up and almost involuntarily ran to
<lb/>the place—the other two rather hung back as they
<lb/>afterwards told us from fear, thinking it might be
<lb/>some one murdered, or some terrible assault, a few
<lb/>moments brought us to the spot, and beheld two
<lb/>young women stretched upon the ground, no human
<lb/>creature touching them, screaming with all their
<lb/>strength.  Some females from the neighboring tents
<lb/>rushed out to them, and sinking down by their side,
<lb/>began to talk to them all at once.  <said xml:id="q030" rend="pre(“)post()">Sink right into
<lb/>Jesus</said>  said one, <said xml:id="q031">and you will <choice><sic>h</sic><corr>b</corr></choice>e happy in a minute.</said>
<lb/>I enquired of an old lady standing by <said rend="pre()post()">what the mat­
<lb/>ter was?</said>  she said <said rend="pre()post()">they were slain, <choice><sic>s</sic><corr>a</corr></choice>nd there was a
<lb/>great many slain there every night.</said>  Several persons
<lb/>now raised them to carry them into the tent, and we
<lb/>in a whisper agreed to follow close in the rear, which
<lb/>by keeping hold of each other's clothes and following
<lb/>close upon the heels of those who had borne in the
<lb/>slain, we succeeded in getting into the centre of the
<lb/>tent, where, within a circle formed by the meeting
<lb/>they were laid upon the straw.  They, the meeting
<lb/>people, were singing a hymn, which rose to deafen­
<pb n="189"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="O2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">189</mw>
<lb/>ing uproar upon our approach.  After the hymn, the
<lb/>women commenced praying over them, using many
<lb/>strange expressions and the most violent gesticula­
<lb/>tion, the power of which was acknowledged by many
<lb/>a groan, shout, and interjection, intermingled with
<lb/>the agonizing shrieks of the slain, which still con­
<lb/>tinued.
</p>
                <p>The loud Amen, the cries for mercy, the groans
<lb/>of distress, (either real or imaginary) resounded
<lb/>from every quarter, while the triumphant exclama­
<lb/>tions of those who shouted <said>I'm full—I'm running
<lb/>over—I'm eating heavenly manna—glory!  hallelu­
<lb/>jah!</said>  &amp;c. &amp;c. were as distinctly heard:  and this,
<lb/>this scene of discordant noise and unseemly riot (as
<lb/>it appeared to me) was what they called <said>the power
<lb/>of God.</said>  Forgive, thou insulted Being, the use I
<lb/>am here obliged to make of thy great and dreadful
<lb/>name!  Occasionally some of the young men who
<lb/>were within the circle would draw near the young
<lb/>women, whose shrieks gradually changed to groans,
<lb/>and ask, in a low voice, <said>do you feel any better?</said>
<lb/>I could not hear that they made any answer.  One
<lb/>young man, while the prayer was going on, began
<lb/>to shake violently, and then falling flat upon the
<lb/>straw, exclaimed <said>God, I'm willing—I will own
<lb/>my Saviour—I will, I will</said>: at the same time, his
<lb/>feet kicking at such a rate, that the dust from the
<lb/>straw nearly suffocated us all.  His feet chancing to
<lb/>lodge, in his fall, just between me and another
<lb/>young lady, we endured no small share of incon­
<lb/>venience.  The young lady actually received seve­
<lb/>ral smart blows;  when a man leaning over our
<lb/>heads (we were seated on a bench) put his cane
<lb/>over and fenced his feet from her, by planting it
<lb/>firmly in the ground.</p>

                <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">190</mw>
                <p>A few people from our town sat near, and, as I
<lb/>thought, seemed to survey the scene with mournful
<lb/>interest; at least they exhibited none of the anima­
<lb/>tion I have described.  <said xml:id="q032">Lord,</said> said one of the
		  <lb/>women in prayer, <said xml:id="q033">what ails the <placeName>Providence</placeName> people?</said>
<lb/>One young woman uttered a sentence in prayer that
<lb/>seemed to fill the audience with inexpressible de­
<lb/>light.  It was in allusion to a sentence in the sister's
<lb/>prayer that spoke before, wherein she asked for the
<lb/>crumbs that fell from her master's table.  <said xml:id="q034">Give us,</said>
<lb/>said the last one, <said xml:id="q035">not only crumbs, but loaves, good
<lb/>God!</said>  and slapping her hands with great violence.
<lb/>The effect was electric, the Amen was echoed in
<lb/>all the different notes of the gamut, while the ex­
		  <lb/>pressions of <said>Come Lord <persName>Jesus</persName>, come quickly,</said> were
<lb/>heard from different parts of the tent.  My soul was
<lb/>momently shocked by those familiar addresses to
		  <lb/>the Deity, <said>God, come down here—<persName>Jesus</persName> come
<lb/>this minute—we want you to-night—we want you
<lb/>now,</said> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.  The din and confusion in­
<lb/>creased every moment.  Stamping, slapping hands,
<lb/>and knocking fists together, formed altogether a
<lb/>scene of confusion that beggars description, and re­
<lb/>ally terrified us.  We looked at each other in des­
<lb/>pair, and then at the door, which was completely
<lb/>wedged up with faces, one above another;  no way
<lb/>to get out, and no one to help us;  when fortunately
<lb/>the uncle of two of the young ladies, (who had re­
<lb/>turned to the Camp on foot, after putting up his
<lb/>horses, and who was now standing at the door of
<lb/>the tent,) descried us, and in a moment compre­
<lb/>hending our distress, opened a passage to the circle,
<lb/>by saying <said>a lady faint! a lady faint!</said>  which was
<lb/>echoed by several, either to aid in getting her out,
<lb/>or to increase the confusion, and thus we escaped
<pb n="191"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="O3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">191</mw>
<lb/>from the crowd.  There was now a general begging
<lb/>among us to return home;  but the uncle protested
<lb/>there was no way at present, and we must stay all
<lb/>night where we were.  However, as we begged so
<lb/>hard, he despatched a man round the barriers to see
<lb/>if any carriage or wagon could be procured.  While
<lb/>search was making, he advised us to walk around
<lb/>the ground; as hundreds, probably thousands, were
<lb/>then doing, thinking we should be safer to be moving
<lb/>with the crowd, than to sit down any where outside
<lb/>the tents.  As we passed one of the tents, where the
<lb/>confusion could only be equalled by the one we had
<lb/>left, we distinguished in prayer that remarkable sen­
<lb/>tence, <said>the Lord is in his holy temple:  let all the
<lb/>earth keep silence before him.</said>  What a place for
<lb/>its repetition!!  One young man began to pray, who
<lb/>got so animated that he kept asking to die; exclaim­
<lb/>ing, <said>Lord, I want to die.  I'm ready to die and
<lb/>fit to die, and Lord, I want to die to-night.</said>  Loud
<lb/>shouting and clapping of hands followed.
</p>
                <p>We now passed a tent entirely closed, fastened
<lb/>down, and dreadful groans within:  they appeared to
<lb/>proceed from one voice, and that of a woman, and
<lb/>evidently betokened great bodily distress.  One of
<lb/>the gentlemen just behind us said he was determin­
<lb/>ed to see what was the distress, and began unfasten­
<lb/>ing the curtains:  we had been forbidden to raise it,
<lb/>by a brother who stood outside, but after the young
<lb/>man had got it part way up, a minister from within
<lb/>called out <said>come in and see the power of God.</said>
<lb/>Thus invited we entered, and behold, a young wo­
<lb/>man laying flat upon the straw, in great apparent
<lb/>agony, calling in frantic terms for the coming of the
<lb/><said>Holy Ghost.</said> I saw no other inmate of the room,
<lb/>except the minister just mentioned, but upon our
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">O*</mw>
<pb n="192"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="O3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">192</mw>
<lb/>coming out, several methodists passed in, and we
<lb/>heard them a moment after singing around this dis­
<lb/>tressed creature, <said>Die in the arms of Jesus, Die in
<lb/>the arms of Jesus &amp;c.</said>  That woman had every
<lb/>appearance of being in strong hysterics.
</p>
                <p><lb/>We had just met with a party of friends from the
<lb/>village of C――― who learning our
distress, kindly of­
<lb/>fered a seat for me to return with them to the inn,
<lb/>where they were to pass.  It was now eleven o'clock,
<lb/>and my companions consented I should leave them
<lb/>upon the promise that I would not rest until I had
<lb/>found some wagon or carriage of some kind to come
<lb/>after them:  while passing to the barrier where the
<lb/>wagons were stationed, we passed a tent where a
<lb/>young female, apparently quite gone, was supported
<lb/>in the arms of a worthless fellow, who had lately
<lb/>gone from our neighbourhood, no one knew whith­
<lb/>er:  they were just without the tent door, and he was
<lb/>trying to bear her in.  A fear for the safety of the
<lb/>girl induced me to ask some one near to rescue her,
<lb/>which they attempted, when out burst two or three
<lb/>men to the relief of their brother, as they called
<lb/>him, and forbade any interference.<anchor xml:id="a032" corresp="#n032" rend="pre(*)"/>

</p>
                <p><lb/>We felt rejoiced that this was the last night of
<lb/>the meeting, for the camp began to smell very offen­
<lb/>sive.  Many were remarking that the danger to
<lb/>health would be very great should the meetings con­
<lb/>tinue twenty-four hours longer.  The people who
<lb/>conveyed me out, got along very well, through a
<lb/>road used for a cart path, and which appeared much
<lb/>more safe and quiet than the great entrance.  We
<lb/>saw a good deal of dodging about, though upon
<lb/>comparing notes with others I discovered I was not
<lb/>solitary in hearing and seeing strange things.  One
<lb/>lady who had been invited to drink tea in one of
<lb/>the tents, observed she had been much shocked by
<lb/>a man coming in and inviting her to stay the even­
<lb/>ing.  He went in shaking violently and saying <said>we
<lb/>shall have the Holy Ghost here to-night!</said>  and said
<lb/>a little niece of hers who stood by, <said>do stay aunt
<lb/>Polly, for I want to see him.</said>  These kind of an­
<lb/>ecdotes were long rehearsed, but I met with no sol­
<lb/>itary being who appeared to have got any good by
<lb/>going.  Heaven grant there might have been some.
<lb/>With a great deal of difficulty I persuaded a man to
<lb/>go down with a carriage for the other ladies.  At
<lb/>last, after finding two men to go and assist him, he
<lb/>went.  He said there had been one carriage just
<lb/>before which had all the harness cut off of it at the
<lb/>entrance of the wood.  I could not rest until the
<lb/>whole company were safely housed.  They return­
<lb/>ed about one o'clock in the morning.  The inhab­
<pb n="194"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="O4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">194</mw>
<lb/>itants of the neighbourhood long had cause to re­
<lb/>member that meeting.  The effects of it were dis­
<lb/>tinctly visible.  Fences torn to pieces, and fields of
<lb/>grain wantonly trod down and destroyed, with other
<lb/>excesses, absurd and unnecessary, bear witness to
<lb/>the little reformation in morals the meeting had oc­
<lb/>casioned;  but over and above all, the haggard and
<lb/>jaded looks of those people, when they commenced
<lb/>their homeward march on the following day.  A
<lb/>rain, the first the earth had been blest with for some
<lb/>time, fell on that day, and many of them must have
<lb/>been caught without a shelter—some with little in­
<lb/>fants in their arms.  One I saw at the camp which
<lb/>the mother told me was three weeks old!
</p>
                <p>It must be obvious to every person, of common
<lb/>sense, that if camp meetings exhibit such scenes to
<lb/>moral persons, to those who penetrate the recesses
<lb/>in their neighbourhood the view must be still more
<lb/>revolting.  Stories have been told and still are, that
<lb/>almost stagger credulity itself, and they carry with
<lb/>them this proof of their authenticity, that the most
<lb/>depraved and abandoned of the human species, are
<lb/>always fond of resorting to them.  If the writer of
<lb/>this true sketch can be a means of opening the eyes
<lb/>of any well disposed persons, who have hitherto been
<lb/>disposed to uphold them, it will be a source of las­
<lb/>ting satisfaction, and a full reward for all the re­
<lb/>sentment which ignorance and fanaticism may
<lb/>award.</p>

          <head rend="slant(italic)">Observations on the foregoing Narrative.</head>
          <p>Upon looking over the preceding pages the author
<lb/>has not been able to discover any mistakes, though
<lb/>there are many things which may be liable to misin­
<lb/>terpretation, and some things omitted which the
<lb/>limits of the book would not permit her to discusss.
<lb/>Of the first of these, the reflection upon spreading
	    <lb/>the report in <placeName>Providence</placeName>, which proved so disastrous
	    <lb/>in the after life of <persName>Miss Cornell</persName>, is not meant to be
<lb/>attributed to the merchants spoken of—the scandal
<lb/>we know was transmitted to the public through other
	    <lb/>organs.  And with respect to the letter from <placeName>Bristol</placeName>
<lb/>to one of the witnesses, containing three dollars,
<lb/>and which is said to be the sum actually due her,
<lb/>dating from the time she was summoned, it is due
<lb/>that witness to state, that in her narration to the
<lb/>author of this, she did not say it was not due her,
<lb/>because she was totally ignorant on that head, but
<lb/>she expressed some surprise that they should have
	    <lb/><said>left it until after <persName>Avery</persName> was taken again</said>—partic­
<lb/>ularly as no recompense had been tendered her for
	    <lb/>her attendance at <placeName>Newport</placeName> where she had been
<lb/><said>summoned by the prisoner and detained much
<lb/>longer.</said>
</p>
          <p>There is one subject upon which we wished large­
<lb/>ly to have descanted in this work, but upon which a
<lb/>few words must suffice:  that is, the great injury and
<lb/>injustice which the publication of the life and char­
	    <lb/>acter of <persName>Sarah M. Cornell</persName>, has done to that class of
<lb/>young women whose lot in life has compelled them
<lb/>to labor in a manufactory.  Many have taken the
<lb/>liberty to say that if all those disgusting particular<choice><sic/><corr>s</corr></choice>
<pb n="196"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="O5v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">196</mw>
<lb/>were true, it proved to demonstration that <said>vice was
<lb/>not regarded among that portion of society as it was
<lb/>in any other community;  that there was little regard
<lb/>to morals among them, or that persons could not
<lb/>have been tolerated and associated with as we know
<lb/>she was—and finally that it ought to be a warning
<lb/>to parents not to let a daughter go to those places,
<lb/>which was going to certain ruin.</said>  Now nothing
<lb/>can be more unjust than this.  There is no person
<lb/>who deprecates the practice of sending little chil­
<lb/>dren into a cotton manufactory more than the author;
<lb/>she avers with truth that she has often been affect­
<lb/>ed to tears at the sight of the little innocents,
<lb/>compelled to leave their beds before the rising of
<lb/>the sun and labor until long after its going down in
<lb/>those establishments, and that perhaps to support
<lb/>some idle, drunken father, or miserable, unfeeling
<lb/>mother;  but when she has again seen healthy,
<lb/>sprightly and well educated girls, laboring to assist
<lb/>some widowed mother, or to give education to some
<lb/>half dozen little brothers and sisters, her feelings
<lb/>have received a different impulse.  There is no way
<lb/>that grown up girls in the present state of society
<lb/>can get better wages—nor where their payment is
<lb/>so sure.  And the privilege of working in manufac­
<lb/>tories to such is a great one.  That these girls are
<lb/>careless of their conduct or their company is scarce
<lb/>ever the case—and the author has known numbers
<lb/>despised and shunned, and hunted from the manu­
<lb/>facturing villages, upon a charge of a much less se­
	    <lb/>rious nature than any of those brought against <persName>S. M.
<lb/>Cornell</persName>, that is, where they had no meeting to shel­
<lb/>ter them—where backslidings and recoveries, expul­
<lb/>sion and reinstation, were a common thing.  In such
<lb/>a case perhaps it might not be known out of the
<pb n="197"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="O6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">197</mw>
<lb/>meeting.  Why, if it were publicly known, as it ought
<lb/>to be, a girl guilty of half the offences she is charg­
	    <lb/>ed with, in the state of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> or <placeName>Connecti­
<lb/>cut</placeName>, would at once find herself in the House of Cor­
<lb/>rection.
</p>
          <p>The publication of this matter however has had
<lb/>one good tendency which is obvious.  It has gen­
<lb/>erated a suspicion of those noisy, ranting professors,
<lb/>who go about interrogating every one they meet, to
<lb/>know <said>if they love the Lord?  if they enjoy relig­
	      <lb/>ion? if they are not ashamed of <persName>Jesus</persName>?</said> &amp;c. &amp;c.
<lb/>which none but grossly ignorant or hypocritical peo­
<lb/>ple ever think of asking.  We hope and trust it has
<lb/>not lessened the respect felt for those modest, prac­
<lb/>tical and retiring christians, who mind their own
<lb/>concerns, and pursue the even tenor of their way,
<lb/>without seeking to obtrude themselves or their re­
<lb/>ligion, except where propriety sanctions, and princi­
<lb/>ple and duty authorize them to do it; and these oc­
<lb/>casions are not rare.  There are daily and hourly
	    <lb/>opportunities for the real <name>christian</name> to shew forth the
<lb/>beauties of holiness, without disgusting people with
<lb/>impertinent interrogations, discovering an impu­
<lb/>dence and boldness inconsistent with their sex and
<lb/>professions.
</p>
          <p>Since writing this book we observe there has been
<lb/>a great hue and cry among a certain class—that
<lb/>religion was in danger from dwelling upon this sub­
<lb/>ject—that it was better to have it smothered, or in
	    <lb/>their language, <said><emph rend="slant(italic)">dropt</emph>,</said> and that every <name>christian</name>
<lb/>who lent his aid to keep it in memory, was strength­
<lb/>ening the hands of infidelity.  To such we would
<lb/>say, we view the subject in a very different light,
<lb/>and we consider it as a very suspicious circumstance
<lb/>in professors or ministers of the gospel when they
<pb n="198"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="O6v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">198</mw>
<lb/>wish to smother <said>spiritual wickedness in high
<lb/>places.</said>  We firmly believe that religion is not so
	    <lb/>inseparably connected with <persName>E. K. Avery</persName>, so identi­
<lb/>fied with him, that it must rise or fall with him, or
<lb/>indeed with any other preacher.  We have always
<lb/>believed that the existence of counterfeits, was itself
<lb/>a proof there was real coin somewhere, and have
<lb/>been accustomed to consider the Christian Church
<lb/>as a net cast into the sea which gathered fish of ev­
<lb/>ery kind, both bad and good.  Our Bibles tell us
<lb/><said>there will be deceivers in the last days.</said> We
<lb/>consider the scripture as fulfilling, and that these
<lb/>enormities being foretold and now accomplishing,
<lb/>proves them true;  but we are not warned to spare
<lb/>such offenders because of their professions, but on
<lb/>the contrary, <said>that judgment must first begin at
<lb/>the house of God.</said>  And we believe whoever is able
<lb/>to assist in this and in pointing out the difference
<lb/>between true and false religion, is doing society and
<lb/>religion itself a great service;  and though men may
<lb/>mistake our motives, we can appeal to the Searcher
<lb/>of all hearts for the purity of them, and we look with
<lb/>hope and confidence for his approbation at the resur­
<lb/>rection of the just.</p>
