          <quote>A wretch! a coward! ay, because a slave!</quote>
        </epigraph>
        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">And</hi> it must be ever thus!—it is in the very nature of slavery
<lb/>to cast a benumbing influence, like that of the torpedo, over its
<lb/>unhappy victims—degrading every nobler faculty, and freezing
<lb/>up the very life-springs of intellectual excellence. Men say,
<lb/>truly, that the slave is a degraded being, debased—ay, almost
<lb/>beneath the level of humanity. What matters it then, that he
<lb/>should be scorned, and despised, and trampled upon? A slave!
<lb/>that vilest thing in creation—who shall extend the hand of be­
<lb/>nevolence to wipe the cold dews of suffering from <emph>his</emph> forehead,
<lb/>or stoop to whisper in his ear the words of hope and consola­
<lb/>tion?—A shade of sadness may cloud the brow of the master,
<lb/>when his faithful <emph>dog</emph> sinks to death at his feet—but will he
<lb/>shed one tear over the grave of the wretch, who has lived from
<lb/>youth to age, toiling, toiling on, through summer's heat, and
<lb/>winter's cold, in one unvarying round of labour for his service?
<lb/>—And why should he?—It was the scourge of the task-master,
<lb/>not the ready impulse of grateful affection, that urged him on
<lb/>in his daily routine of toil—and though his lip might sometimes
<lb/>murmur the words of ready obedience, the tyrant well knew
<lb/>that the low deep curses of deadly hatred were flung back in
<lb/>secret return for oft-repeated blows and menaces.</p>
        <p>What wonder is it that the slave should be the veriest out­
<lb/>cast on the face of God's beautiful creation? But who has made
<lb/>him thus? Was it the omnipotent <persName>Jehovah</persName>!—the God of love,

<lb/>of justice, and of mercy?—No! the answer must come in the
<lb/>deep voice of thunder, and in the still small whisper of the
<lb/>midnight couch—no!—it was man—his brother—created by
<lb/>the same hand, and in the same image—that hath become his
<lb/>oppressor, and wrought him this foul wrong. <quote>Yoked with
<lb/>the brute, and fetter'd to the soil,</quote> with the iron hand of tyran­
<lb/>ny pressing him to the earth—and the thick veil of intellectual
<lb/>darkness drawn forever around him—how could he be other­
<lb/>wise than as he is? But, <quote>give liberty to the captive</quote>—fling
<lb/>aside his fetters—and bid him stand proudly erect in all the
<lb/>majesty of a freeman—and his soul—his mind—his whole
<lb/>character will soon remodel itself to the dignity of his outward
<lb/>form—he will be again a man, the image and noblest work of
<lb/>his Creator! Would to Heaven the hour of his emancipation
<lb/>had already arrived! That it is approaching by slowly pro­
<lb/>gressive footsteps, there can be no doubt. The system of
<lb/>slavery must not, will not, forever cast its dark stigma on the
<lb/>fair pages of our country's annals. Already the voice of jus­
<lb/>tice and of mercy has gone forth. Man has arisen in his
<lb/>compassionate strength, to aid the cause of the oppressed—and
<lb/>the gentler sympathies of woman's soul have been awakened
<lb/>from their long slumber. She has remembered that many of
<lb/>her cherished luxuries have been wet with the tears of wretch­
<lb/>edness, and that the zephyr which flutters around her tasteful
<lb/>garb, comes heavily laden with the sighs of the oppressed.
<lb/>Oh! will she not then cast from her whatever is to others the
<lb/>source of a sore evil—and bathe her lip, and array her form,
<lb/>only in those things which are untainted by the hot breath of
<lb/>human agony? Much may be effected by woman—important
<lb/>consequences have, in all ages of the world, been produced by
<lb/>her influence—and when was she ever a loiterer in the cause
<lb/>of justice and humanity?</p>

        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> great effort of female education should be, to qualify
<lb/>woman to discharge her duties, not to exalt her till she despises

<lb/>ter of the most amiable and intelligent of her sex, rather than
<lb/>aspire to emulate the conduct and capacity of men. In our

<lb/>country, where, under the mild light of <name>Christianity</name>, free insti­
<lb/>tutions guaranty freedom of thought, of expression, of action,
<lb/>the full and free development of mind may be expected; and
<lb/>here, if in any country on earth, women may hope to take their
<lb/>true, their most dignified stations, as the helpers, the companions,
<lb/>of educated and independent men. And while our citizens
<lb/>are endeavouring so to improve their inestimable privileges, that
<lb/>the men of future ages may be better and happier for their
<lb/>labours, have women no share in the important task? Their
<lb/>influence on the manners is readily and willingly conceded by
<lb/>every one; might not their influence on the <emph>mind</emph> be made
<lb/>quite as irresistible, and far more beneficial, and that, too, with­
<lb/>out violating in the least, the <emph>propriety</emph> which, to make their
<lb/>examples valuable, should ever mark their conduct? The bu­
<lb/>siness of <emph>instruction</emph> is one of vast interest, because fraught
<lb/>with such important consequences to <name>Americans</name>. It is neces­
<lb/>sary that <emph>all</emph> our people should be instructed, as universal edu­
<lb/>cation is the main pillar that must eventually support the temple
<lb/>of our liberty. It is therefore a duty sacredly binding on our
<lb/>legislators to provide for the instruction, during childhood and
<lb/>youth, of every member of our republic. But while there are
<lb/>so many pursuits, more lucrative and agreeable to active and
<lb/>ambitious young men, there will be a lack of <emph>good</emph> instructors
<lb/>—of those who are willing to make it their business. Let,
<lb/>then, the employment of <emph>school-keeping</emph> be principally appro­
<lb/>priated to females. They are both by temper and habit admi­
<lb/>rably qualified for the task—they have patience, fondness for
<lb/>children, and are accustomed to seclusion, and inured to self-
<lb/>government. Is it objected that they do not possess sufficient
<lb/>soundness of learning—that their acquirements are showy,
<lb/>superficial, frivolous? The fault is in their education, not in
<lb/>the female mind. Only afford them opportunities for improve­
<lb/>ment, and motives for exertion; let them be assured, that,

<lb/><quote rend="align(center)"><lg type="poem" subtype="indeterminate"><l rend="indent(2)">to sing, to dance,</l><l>To dress, to troll the tongue, and roll their eyes,</l></lg></quote>

<lb/>is not all that is required to make young ladies agreeable or
<lb/>sought by the gentlemen—that they may converse sensibly
<lb/>without the charge of pedantry, and be intelligent without the
<lb/>appellation of a <emph>blue</emph>; in short, that they are expected to be
<lb/>rational, and required to be useful—and they will not disap­
<lb/>point public expectation.</p>

        <head>Dreaming.</head>
        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">It</hi> is a pleasant thing to dream. I do not mean in sleep,—
<lb/>for such dreams are generally too vague and indistinct—but
<lb/>when you are broad awake at mid-day or in the dim twilight.
<lb/>Upon a hot <name>August</name> noon, when there is not one cloud rioting
<lb/>upon the face of the dazzling sky, to give your eye a mo­
<lb/>mentary relief from its intense brightness—when the clear
<lb/>sun-beams are poured, with a scorching light, full upon the
<lb/>glaring brick buildings opposite to your apartment, and reflected
<lb/>back from the hot pavement, till the lazy air, that lingers about
<lb/>among them, seems almost to become visible from the heat it
<lb/>has gathered, and comes to you with a heavy, parching sultri­
<lb/>ness. Or on a dreary <name>November</name> day, when the rain com­
<lb/>mences with a slow, steady drizzle, increasing gradually into
<lb/>larger drops, till it comes down in a heavy, regular, monoto­
<lb/>nous shower—and the trees, if there happen to be any within
<lb/>sight of your window, seem actually to shiver with the damp
<lb/>chilliness of the weather, as they stand stretching out their
<lb/>wet limbs, with the rain dripping rapidly from the few brown
<lb/>and curled leaves left upon them, to those that lie still more
<lb/>withered beneath—oh, it is delicious then to shut the door of
<lb/>your thoughts upon the outward creation that is around you,
<lb/>and forget yourself in an ideal world—glorious and beautiful!
<lb/>Fancy, like a loosened falcon, springs up on an exulting wing,
<lb/>and bears you free and unfettered wherever you may list.—
<lb/>The morning sun seems to light up for your eyes, the magnifi­
<lb/>cence of Alpine scenery; or the twilight air of <placeName>Cashmere</placeName>
<lb/>steals luxuriously over your lips and forehead, bathing them
<lb/>with the gathered fragrance of her roses. You may weave
<lb/>around yourself a tissue of romantic adventures, or exchange
<lb/>the low ceiling and narrow walls of your own apartment, for
<lb/>the mountain breezes of the <placeName>Catskill</placeName>, or the dazzling display
<lb/>of lights, beauty and fashion, in a ball-room at <placeName>Saratoga</placeName>.</p>
        <p>Nor have your own <soCalled rend="pre(“)post(”)">transmogrifications</soCalled> a whit less of the
<lb/>wonderful. Were it not that yourself has been the magician,
<lb/>you would be positively in doubt as to your own identity.
<lb/>Your little lead-coloured eyes, the light of whose beams could
<lb/>never be persuaded to turn in the same direction, are transform­
<lb/>ed into heavenly azure, and their long lids drop over them with
<lb/>a most amiable expression of melancholy—your non-descript

<lb/>nose becomes suddently twisted into perfection, and your whole
<lb/>face, which, after a month's daily inspection in the glass, with
<lb/>the hope of discovering some unobtrusive loveliness, you were
<lb/>compelled to acknowledge monstrously <soCalled rend="pre(“)post(”)">plain,</soCalled> you find as­
<lb/>tonishingly altered into the very extremity of beauty—while
<lb/>your silken tresses, which had formerly approached somewhat
<lb/>too near to the colour of <emph>vermilion</emph>, to be accurately described
<lb/>by the poetical epithet of <mentioned rend="pre(“)post(”)">Golden,</mentioned> in a most appropriate
<lb/>manner <quote>cap the climax</quote> of your loveliness. Then you may
<lb/>imagine yourself peerless and unrivalled, the brightest star on
<lb/>the horizon of fashion—and practise, if you please, the haughty
<lb/>curl of your exquisite lip, with which you intend to receive
<lb/>the adoration of your worshippers, or the graceful bend of
<lb/>your superlative head with which you will accede to Mr. ――'s
<lb/>entreaty that you will allow him that infinity of honour, the
<lb/>pleasure of dancing with you.</p>
        <p>If you prefer the <soCalled rend="pre(“)post(”)">sentimental,</soCalled> you may fancy yourself
<lb/>seated with your guitar, where the quiet moonbeams steal in
<lb/>between clustering branches of the rose and honeysuckle, to list­
<lb/>en to your melody. But woe to your dream, should you forget so
<lb/>deeply as to give sound to the witching of your voice! alas, alas,
<lb/>you have never yet been able to persuade the ungentleness of
<lb/>your voice into the formation of one note of harmony, or pre­
<lb/>vail upon your disobliging ear to retain the recollection of a
<lb/>tune—and the beautiful bubble world of your fancy, with all
<lb/>its glorious rain-bow hues, is dashed at once into nothing!</p>
        <p>But better and pleasanter than all this, is it to go out on a
<lb/>calm <name>Sabbath</name> morning, into the thick woods, and lie down on
<lb/>a green bank, by the twisted roots of an old tree—where the
<lb/>stream that steals with a gentle voice between the grassy banks,
<lb/>hath a purer melody in its tone than the rich swell of church-
<lb/>music;—and the sweet wild flowers, those fair and perishing
<lb/>things, frail as our brightest hopes, and like them springing up
<lb/>everywhere around us—lift up their delicate leaves with a
<lb/>lesson for your heart to study;—and the honey-bee, that
<lb/>comes with its soft hum to drink their sweets, is a kind moni­
<lb/>tor, teaching you thus to gather into the storehouse of your
<lb/>thoughts, the sweet recollections of well-spent moments.</p>
        <p>The dreams of our sleep are sometimes happy—but they
<lb/>have ever their waking hour; and the beautiful creations of
<lb/>our unslumbering fancy, too soon leave us only the remem­

<lb/>brance that they were but shadows—with sometimes, too, a
<lb/>sigh over the far different fate that heaven hath assigned us.
<lb/>But that visionary mood which purifies the heart while it gives
<lb/>it happiness, leaves nothing of bitterness, even when it is
<lb/>broken in upon by the ruder voice of the world.</p>
        <p>You will <quote>find calm thoughts beneath the whispering tree,</quote>
<lb/>and the low rustle of the forest leaves, that comes to you with
<lb/>the cool breeze, hath a soothing influence for the heart. The
<lb/>song of the birds will be understood like a familiar language,
<lb/>and the insect forms that flit past you in the scattered sunshine,
<lb/>have each a separate history; or you may gift them with higher
<lb/>perceptibilities, and they will be to you for friends and fellow
<lb/>worshippers.</p>

        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">We</hi> believe it is generally acknowledged that there is more
<lb/>danger to be apprehended to any cause, from the lukewarm­

<lb/>cause of Emancipation. We have been frequently astonished
<lb/>at the perfect indifference manifested when this subject is ad­
<lb/>verted to, even by those whom we might suppose would be
<lb/>most easily interested, and among some who openly profess to
<lb/>reprobate the system of slavery. You may speak of the
<lb/>wrongs and sufferings of our coloured population; you may
<lb/>tell them of all the evils attendant upon slavery; you may
<lb/>recount, if they will listen to you so long, a harrowing tale of
<lb/>human misery, till your own cheek burns, and heart swells at
<lb/>the recital, and when you have concluded, they will turn coldly
<lb/>away, and answer, <said>All this may be very true—but why do
<lb/>you tell it to us? the fault is not ours, nor the remedy in our
<lb/>power; it is useless, therefore, to distress ourselves with the
<lb/>thought of wretchedness which we cannot relieve.</said> Yet they
<lb/>will almost always conclude with acknowledging that the sys­

<lb/>tem of slavery is both criminal and disgraceful, and with a wish
<lb/>that it was abolished altogether:—while at the same time, to
<lb/>judge from their conduct, they seem perfectly determined not
<lb/>to raise so much as a little finger in aid of that object. <said>And
<lb/>what more can we do,</said> such persons may perhaps exclaim,
<lb/><said>than to give our best wishes to the cause of emancipation?</said>
<lb/>You can do a great deal more—you can give it your <emph>active
<lb/>exertions</emph>—and you <emph>must</emph> do so, if you would ever behold the
<lb/>day when the cry of the oppressed shall be heard no more
<lb/><quote>within our borders.</quote> You should form yourselves into soci­
<lb/><choice><sic/><corr>e</corr></choice>ties for the opposition of slavery. Your interest will, by that
<lb/>means, be kept awake, you will have better opportunities both
<lb/>of acquiring and diffusing information upon the subject, and
<lb/>your aid, altogether, will be more effective. Nor should you
<lb/>imagine you have completed your duty by declaring yourselves
<lb/>the enemies of oppression—you should endeavour to <emph>prevail
<lb/>upon your friends to do likewise</emph>.</p>
        <p>The subject is one of the utmost importance, both to the
<lb/>moral and political interests of our country, and should occupy
<lb/>your thoughts, and be made the theme of your conversation,
<lb/>not only in your stated meetings for its discussion, but while
<lb/>you are engaged in your daily occupations, or when you have
<lb/>gathered into a friendly circle around the evening hearth. We
<lb/>do not expect the influence of women to have any immediate
<lb/>or perceptible effect upon the councils of the <name>Senate-house</name>—
<lb/>but let their efforts be steadily directed to arousing the public
<lb/>mind to the importance of this subject, and keeping awake that
<lb/>attention by every means in their power, and we have no
<lb/>doubt but they will be speedily and beneficially felt. It is use­
<lb/>less to talk of the difficulties of the case, of the danger of
<lb/>intermeddling with a subject which even men approach with
<lb/>timidity, and of the total impossibility of our effecting any
<lb/>change in the course of circumstances. We do not see the
<lb/>least impossibility in the matter, and we deny that there is any.
<lb/>But we do know that it is impossible to remove from the bosom
<lb/>of our country a crime that should weigh her plumed head in
<lb/>shame to the very dust, by sitting passively down, and wishing
<lb/>it were otherwise. That there may be difficulties in the case,
<lb/>we admit, but it would be absurd to suppose that it is entirely
<lb/>without remedy. Let the general attention be but thoroughly
<lb/>excited, let men be forced into the necessity of acting, and effi­

<lb/>and so we may yet see the folds of our <quote>star-spangled ban­

<lb/>hath so long polluted our country, atoned for and forgiven.</p>

        <p><said><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">It</hi> will do not good</said>—is an answer we have received so
<lb/>often, when endeavouring to awaken our friends to the subject
<lb/>of emancipation, that we are positively weary of hearing it
<lb/>repeated, and almost out of patience—just as if the success or
<lb/>failure of our endeavours could in the least affect the question
<lb/>of right or wrong!</p>
        <p>Is the performance of duties to God and our fellow-creatures
<lb/>the less emphatically urged upon us, because we choose to
<lb/>imagine it will have no effect on the mass of human crime and
<lb/>misery? Nay, is there not even guilt in such reasoning?
<lb/>Because we think that other people will do wrong in spite of
<lb/>our efforts to prevent them, should we join in upholding them
<lb/>in their iniquity, and participate with them in the enjoyment of
<lb/>the fruits of it? And in such a case we need scarcely demand,
<lb/>which would be most deeply criminal—those who thoughtlessly
<lb/>and blindly press forward on a career of guilt, or those, who,
<lb/>fully awake to its sinfulness, persist in lending their support?</p>
        <p>That the system of slavery, as existing among us in the very
<lb/>bosom of these free <placeName>States</placeName>, is a dark outrage upon justice and
<lb/>humanity, we presume there are few among our own sex hardy
<lb/>enough to dispute. If there be any such, they must daringly
<lb/>maintain a false argument in the very face of conscience, or
<lb/>have been strangely blinded by a long series of years of
<lb/>prejudice.</p>
        <p><said>But what signifies our combating an evil that we can never
<lb/>subdue?</said> What signifies a conscience void of offence in the
<lb/>sight of the everlasting One? What signifies the calm retro­
<lb/>spective reflection of the twilight hour, broken in upon by no
<lb/>secret consciousness of blood-guiltiness? It is only for you to
<lb/><emph>act</emph>, and to leave to Him—the Omnipotent—the judgment and
<lb/>direction of your usefulness.</p>
        <p>Because you, in the short-sightedness of morality, behold
<lb/>no way for the redemption out of their bonds, of an oppressed

<lb/>on the offering, however humble, of a sincere and contrite spirit,
<lb/>he will bestow his blessing? We are told that faith—trusting
<lb/>and unfaltering faith—in the power of the Almighty, is suffi­
<lb/>cient for the removal of mountains—and yet you, because to
<lb/>the eye of human reason your path seems clouded with diffi­
<lb/>culties, sit down in utter apathy, nor lift up even so much as
<lb/>your voices of prayer, in behalf of a smitten people!</p>
        <p>Yet, though there are a fearful number who still listen with
<lb/>a strange indifference to the soul-harrowing eloquence of hu­
<lb/>man suffering, thank heaven! we have no cause of despair.
<lb/>A voice has gone forth over the sleeping pool, to trouble its
<lb/>waters, and there are many who have already gone down and
<lb/>cleansed themselves from the guilt of African oppression. A
<lb/>spirit is at work among the people that will not easily be quieted
<lb/>—a leaven, whose vital principle will not be destroyed till the
<lb/>whole mass is leavened.</p>

        <p>Now which of all these principles does not slavery violate?
<lb/>Where is the long suffering that our slave-holders exhibit, when
<lb/>the most trifling offence on the part of their human cattle is
<lb/>visited by the horsewhip? What is their kindness in claiming
<lb/>from their brethren a daily routine of unmitigated, unrewarded
<lb/>toil, through a long series of years, to feed their luxury?</p>
        <p><quote>Charity envieth not</quote>—and truly envy herself could scarcely
<lb/>grudge the few poor comforts we have left the slave—but is not
<lb/>envy of the superior luxuries and comforts of others, one of
<lb/>the main inducing causes of that oppression? As for that hu­
<lb/>mility which is so distinguishing a feature in charity and in
<lb/>the Christian religion, we know that it is utterly 
inconsistent
<lb/>with the very nature of absolute power. Are we not mightily
<lb/>puffed up with out own superiority? Do we not proudly vaunt
<lb/>ourselves as being even of a higher species than our negro
<lb/>brethren? And is it seemly that we should cause oppression
<lb/>with a high hand to rule upon the earth, rioting in the groans
<lb/>of human agony? Charity seeketh not even that which is her
<lb/>own, but we uphold those who wring with violence from the
<lb/>hands of others that which is not their own. Go ask the poor
<lb/>victim, a female, too, perhaps—who stands there all bleeding
<lb/>and lacerated with many stripes, what was the magnitude of
<lb/>the offence that hath been punished with such severe chastise­
<lb/>ment—and what will be the answer? Some trifling employ­
<lb/>ment forgotten or neglected—or perhaps the passionate out­
<lb/>pourings of grief for some beloved one from whom she has
<lb/>been forcibly separated!</p>
        <p>Yet will this very text, in the very seat of slavery, be sol­
<lb/>emnly pronounced from the pulpit, and be characterised as
<lb/>containing some of the sublimest principles of our religion, and
<lb/>commented upon with overpowering eloquence, till the heart
<lb/>of man will glow within his bosom, and the warm tears gush
<lb/>out from the gentle eyes of women—and they will go out
<lb/>from the house of worship, and forget that they are nourishing
<lb/>up within their own households, a system that is at open vari­
<lb/>ance both with that, and every other principle of the Chris­
<lb/>tian religion.</p>

        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">Is</hi> it not a delightful evening? 
We will go down the hill
<lb/>by the old school-house—but we shall not meet any merry
<lb/>groups of the scholars, for it is the harvest holy-days—then
<lb/>turn at the mill, and pass <persName>Robert Harman's</persName> pretty farm-house.
<lb/>If you look over the hill, you can see the top of one of its
<lb/>chimneys peeping out from among the trees, now;—there—
<lb/>where that smoke-curl is rising.</p>
        <p>The wood sweeps in a curve round the foot of the hill before
<lb/>we reach it; but you will not be fatigued, for when we descend
<lb/>a few steps further we shall quite lose the warm sunshine. How
<lb/>beautiful it looks on the top of that old wood—and here on this
<lb/>hill slope, the long tree-shadows are drawn so distinctly!</p>
        <p>When we pass this clump of oaks, we shall come within
<lb/>sight of the open fields and meadows. Do you see yon clover­
<lb/>field? It is quite purple with blossoms, and the first breeze
<lb/>that comes this way will be loaded with perfume; there is
<lb/>mingled with it a scent of fresh hay, too—farmer <persName>Harman</persName>
<lb/>cannot yet have finished carrying in his first crop. Ah! there
<lb/>he is, with his <soCalled rend="pre(“)post(”)">hands</soCalled> all busily employed around him; the
<lb/>wagon has just been brought out, and they are about to com­
<lb/>mence loading. I intend you shall be acquainted with <persName>Robert
<lb/>Harman</persName>: he is one of the finest specimens of our western
<lb/>country farmer—the most useful man in the neighbourhood,
<lb/>and respected by all about him. He was elected to a seat in
<lb/>the state legislature, a couple of years since, and there is con­
<lb/>siderable talk of his being held up for senator at the next
<lb/>election.</p>
        <p>Ha! there goes <name>Rolla</name> scampering across the field, to seek
<lb/>out his crony, little <persName>George Harman</persName>. Many a joyous frolic
<lb/>have they had together, while I have looked on and wondered
<lb/>which of the two was most delighted—the boy or the dog.
<lb/>There is <persName>Ned</persName>, too, staggering under the weight of a fork-load
<lb/>of hay, which he fancies he can deposit on the wagon.—There
<lb/>it comes! down in a thick shower about his head, almost
<lb/>smothering him: he is fairly covered with it! I wish you
<lb/>could see his face now, as he turns to romp with <name>Rolla</name>. I can
<lb/>almost see the flash of his black eyes from here! He is one
<lb/>of the wildest young rogues in the neighbourhood, and almost
<lb/>as big as his brother <persName>Robert</persName>, who is two 
years older.—<persName>Bob</persName> is

<lb/>most like his mother, both in looks and character—quieter and
<lb/>more delicate. Yet gentle and timid as you would take him
<lb/>to be, there are few <emph>men</emph> more inflexible or more courageous on
<lb/>any point of duty or principle: the <name>Indian's</name> torture would
<lb/>scarcely make him flinch.</p>
        <p>Here is the house: you cannot more than catch an occasion­
<lb/>al glimpse of the stone walls, it is so thickly covered with vines.
<lb/>That multiflora rose almost covers the end of the long piazza—
<lb/>and the beautiful coral, and the scented monthly honeysuckle,
<lb/>creep in twisted luxuriance up its pillars. Then there are the
<lb/>sweet clematis, and the passion-vine, and the jessamine, scat­
<lb/>tered about on frames; but the two last are not yet in bloom.
<lb/>Then there are the Washington-bower, and the glacina, with
<lb/>its profusion of blue flowers, climbing up the sides of the house,
<lb/>and almost covering even the chimney. Those trees, almost
<lb/>bending beneath the multitude of their blossoms, are the scented
<lb/>acacia: that which is loaded with red flowers, on the other side
<lb/>of the house, is a horse-chestnut—and this so covered with
<lb/>white waxen-like flowers is the philadelphus. Then do but
<lb/>look what a quantity of roses! white and red, of all shades!—
<lb/>from the delicate purity of the white bramble, to the deep
<lb/>crimson of the small burgundy, or still deeper coloured velvet
<lb/>rose. Some of them almost look in at the windows of the
<lb/>pretty little parlour; and if you would look in there too, you
<lb/>would see a plain room, to be sure, but the most perfect neat­
<lb/>ness, and a large book-case filled with well selected books.
<lb/>You would know that by the very binding—and the last num­
<lb/>bers of several periodicals, lying on the table. There is a
<lb/>piano, too—and some good engravings and pictures in water­
<lb/>colours hanging about the wall.</p>
        <p>There is <persName>Mary Harman</persName> herself!—spreading the supper-table,
<lb/>under that great tree. She is a pretty woman, and she is what
<lb/>is a great deal better—very amiable, and an excellent wife and
<lb/>mother. Let us walk on a little further, to a seat which I
<lb/>will find for you on the banks of the creek, and I will tell you
<lb/>something of her history.</p>
        <p>Do you recollect the large house situated on the left of <persName>Col.
<lb/>Carlington's</persName> plantation, in <placeName>Virginia</placeName>? That, with the farm at­
<lb/>tached to it, was formerly the property of <persName>Robert Harman</persName>. It
<lb/>was a much handsomer place then, than it is now; for the trees

<lb/>have been cut down from about it, and the shrubbery has been
<lb/>sadly neglected of late years.</p>
        <p>Well, I will tell you of a conversation that took place be­
<lb/>tween <persName>Robert</persName> and his wife, on the green lawn in front of that
<lb/>very house. <persName>Little Bob</persName>, the oldest boy, was just one year old
<lb/>at the time, and his father had given the slaves a holy-day,
<lb/>because it was his birth-day.</p>
        <p><said>How happy their black faces looked!</said> said <persName>Robert</persName>, as they
<lb/>left the lawn, after having each received a trifling present from
<lb/>their mistress. <persName>Mary</persName> turned her face towards her husband;
<lb/>but there was a shade of sadness mingled with the tenderness
<lb/>of its expression.</p>
        <p><said>Nay, now,</said> continued he, laughing, <said>I know all you are
<lb/>going to say about happiness being incompatible with slavery
<lb/>—but I am sure they are better off than if they were free, you
<lb/>are so kind to them!</said></p>
        <p><said>They are slaves, nevertheless:</said> said she, <said>and though
<lb/>they may seem gay and mirthful—even contented—their light­
<lb/>heartedness is only the absence of immediate care, not the in­
<lb/>dwelling sense of a deep happiness. How can they know the
<lb/>fullness of bliss which I feel when hanging on your arm, or
<lb/>pressing my lips upon the fair forehead of my babe, in the
<lb/>consciousness, that no hand, save that of our God, hath the
<lb/>power to separate us! What do they know of the delight of
<lb/>studying the beauties of the natural or the intellectual world!
<lb/>You say truly, that your plough-horses know scarcely less of
<lb/>the harassing cares of life than they! but is the mere absence
<lb/>of care sufficient for the happiness of a rational being? Would
<lb/>you, dear <persName>Robert</persName>, purchase a dull forgetfulness of evil, at the
<lb/>expense of the high nature of your intellectual being, sensitive
<lb/>as it is to pain, as well as gladness? I know you would not!
<lb/>Yet, poor as it is, even that much of bliss is denied to the slave—
<lb/>for, debased as his nature may be, he is still human—and he
<lb/>can <emph>think!</emph> We imagine they rush exultingly to the dance,
<lb/>when it may be only to drown the bitterness of their dark fore­
<lb/>bodings. I wish you had sometimes watched their dark coun­
<lb/>tenances, as I have done, when you have carelessly spoken of
<lb/>liberty! and then the sin—oh! <persName>Robert</persName>, surely there must be
<lb/>deep sin in making merchandize thus of our brethren—deem­
<lb/>ing them scarcely better than the clods they till—they whom
<lb/>God hath created in his own image.</said></p>

        <p>
          <said>But what can I do, dear <persName>Mary</persName>? I will acknowledge that
<lb/>I do not think the system of slavery is right; but you know
<lb/>that I received most of them from my father, with the planta­
<lb/>tion. The estate is already mortgaged for more than half its
<lb/>value, and if I free the slaves, which form the most valuable
<lb/>part of my property, I shall probably have to dispose of it alto­
<lb/>gether. For myself, I should care but little, for I am already
<lb/>almost wearied of this life of inaction; but I could not become
<lb/>a tiller of the earth <emph>here</emph>—where we have mated with the
<lb/>proudest—for your sake, I could not! Could I bear to see
<lb/>eyes look coldly on you, that have been accustomed to gaze
<lb/>only in admiration and respect? Can I drag you down from
<lb/>the station in which I found you in your father's house, and
<lb/>plunge you in comparative poverty?—Would not our boy, too,
<lb/>in future upbraid me? I wish, from the bottom of my soul, I
<lb/>wish that the system of slavery was abolished altogether—it is
<lb/>a national iniquity—a shameful blot upon our boasted constitu­
<lb/>tion—but for an individual to attempt its extinction were folly!</said>
        </p>
        <p><persName>Mary</persName> raised her eyes—they were suffused with tears.
<lb/><said>Dearly as I love you, <persName>Robert</persName>, dearly as I love this boy; bet­
<lb/>ter, far better, than my own life, I would rather behold you,
<lb/>even day by day, winning an uncertain subsistence by your
<lb/>own exertions, than to share with you in this guilty luxury and
<lb/>splendour—for guilty that must be, which is purchased with
<lb/>wrong to another. Do not think of me, do not fear for me—
<lb/>the loss of wealth cannot render me unhappy—oh no! the
<lb/>thought of wealth like that comes with a deadly sickness upon
<lb/>the heart, a sensation of utter hollowness! even poverty, abject
<lb/>poverty, would be preferable to such splendour; but that will
<lb/>not be consequent on the emancipation of your slaves; it is but
<lb/>somewhat to circumscribe our wishes, and we shall still be in­
<lb/>dependent. We must both be more actively employed, it is
<lb/>true—but it will be better than living in idleness on the labour
<lb/>of others. Then how many temptations will you not escape
<lb/>from! From how many evils will this boy be preserved! for
<lb/>what is there so likely to harden the heart, and to nourish up
<lb/>all its evil passions, as the possession of absolute power?</said></p>
        <p><said>Well, Mary,</said> said her husband, <said>my slaves shall be free!
<lb/>—but then we must leave here; and I have no other property
<lb/>than those western lands—will you go there?</said></p>

        </p>
        <p>Her face was still wet with that passion of grateful tears,

        <p>It was a century since, almost, that the meek girl of whom I
<lb/>spake, stood up within that low-roofed worship-house, to
<lb/>breathe the vows of her unchangeable fidelity. She was of
<lb/>the race of <placeName>England's</placeName> noblest; but the power of God's word
<lb/>had come upon her heart and smote her, so that all the gauds
<lb/>and vanities of her high estate became to her as nothing, and
<lb/>she grew to be one of the humblest worshippers of a despised
<lb/>sect—a sister in the faith of <persName>Fox</persName> and <persName>Penn</persName> and <persName>Whitehead</persName>.</p>
        <p>Then the magnificence of her apparelling, the brilliance of
<lb/>her dazzling jewelry, and the splendour of her father's house,
<lb/>came to be as a heavy burden upon her gentle spirit; her heart
<lb/>turned sick within her at the empty glories of the world, and for
<lb/>the sake of her soul's peace, she dared not any more bow down
<lb/>to its idle vanities. So the affectionate girl was made to endure
<lb/>rather to be an alien from her father's house, and from the love
<lb/>of her stately mother, than to win back their parental blessing
<lb/>and forgiveness by a sinful apostacy from the high nature of
<lb/>her religious testimony.</p>
        <p>Many a sore struggle had she, that gentle creature, with the
<lb/>yearning tenderness, the agonising affection of her smitten
<lb/>heart, before her spirit was made strong for the sacrifice, and
<lb/>she gave herself wholly up to God. Then there was a deep
<lb/>peace settled upon her soul; and in her meek humility, she
<lb/>became a beloved friend in the house of one who had once
<lb/>been a menial in that of her father. And they came hither to
<lb/>this beautiful wilderness—her aged protectors in the calm un­
<lb/>bendingness of their piety, and that young <name>Christian</name> unfaltering
<lb/>in her high trust, that they might worship in the peacefulness
<lb/>of their pure religion.</p>
        <p>But the glorious spirit of that exalted creature was not long
<lb/>uncompanied here in these solitary places. There was a
<lb/>youth, not indeed of her own proud rank, but one who, for the
<lb/>majestic capacities of his intellect, might have been the mate
<lb/>of princes. But he, too, had subdued the earthliness of his

<pb n="23"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B6r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">23</mw>

<lb/>spirit, till his pulse stirred no longer at the promptings of am­
<lb/>bition, and he became to her a dear friend.</p>
        <p>It was by his side that she stood up, beneath that forest-
<lb/>covered roof, at the time of which I told you, to breathe, in
<lb/>the calm steadfastness of her heart, the promise of her nuptial
<lb/>troth. It was the first Christian bridal that had been celebrated
<lb/>in these, then, almost untrodden places, and there was a still
<lb/>profounder depth of sympathizing silence gathered over their
<lb/>lone temple, as they rose up and stood side by side, with their
<lb/>hands clasped together, she, in the stainlessness of her exceed­
<lb/>ing beauty,—a most sublime creature,—with the simplicity of
<lb/>her bridal robes, bearing no other ornament than their perfect
<lb/>whiteness; and he bending over her in the depth of his holy
<lb/>affection, and uttering the solemn words of his love, severally
<lb/>and distinctly, in the low, deep cadences of the heart's tones.</p>
        <p>There was a short pause, and then her sweet musical voice
<lb/>spake over the same words, only less audible, and disturbed
<lb/>with the swelling up of a few tears.</p>
        <p>But why should I go on to tell you further? For a brief
<lb/>space she moved about, the light and blessing of his quiet
<lb/>home. But there was a gradual change at work upon her,
<lb/>breathing still more of spirituality into the dazzlingness of her
<lb/>beauty, and seeming even in this world to be overpowering the
<lb/>remains of her mortal nature, till it became as a mere shadow,
<lb/>and then she slept.</p>

<lb/>with half its leaves still uncut, is lying upon your table—or if

<lb/>when you sit among your <quote>pleasant company of books,</quote> list­
<lb/>less and discontented; when your heart turns sick with the
<lb/>long details of human crime and misery, written within your
<lb/>volumes of history; when biography serves but to humble
<lb/>you, with the knowledge that the best have been so frail, and the
<lb/>wisest so ignorant; when philosophy, which has led you with
<lb/>a proud wing among the secret influences of nature, leaves you
<lb/>but a knowledge of your own ignorance—and poetry, glorious

<lb/>the most perfect humility, full of a simple majesty, yet gentle
<lb/>as a very child, unfaltering in its quiet self-denial, and un­
<lb/>bending to its own weaknesses, assuming no superior sanctity,
<lb/>lifting not up the voice of stern judgment against the frail­

        <head rend="pre(#rule)">Opposition to Slavery.</head>
        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> subject of Emancipation appears, frequently, to be consi­
<lb/>dered merely as one of taste or fancy, which is to be engaged in
<lb/>only by those whose inclination leads them to consider it an
<lb/>object of interest. But opposition to slavery is not a thing to

<pb n="28"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="C2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">28</mw>

<lb/>be entered upon only through a transient excitement, or for a
<lb/>display of benevolent feeling, or the indulgence of an amiable
<lb/>humanity; and which it is allowable to neglect in the absence
<lb/>of these or any other selfish motives. It should be considered
<lb/>the conscientious discharge of an imperative duty, and the only
<lb/>means of avoiding a participation in guilt. It is folly to say
<lb/>that we have no agency in the oppression of the slave, while
<lb/>we are revelling in the luxuries produced by his extorted labour.
<lb/>It is vain to endeavour to clear ourselves of the obloquy, by
<lb/>heaping execrations on those more immediately concerned; so
<lb/>long as we continue to be partakers of its fruits, are we active
<lb/>supporters of the system of slavery. It may be said that we
<lb/>do this unwillingly—that we cannot, in fact, altogether avoid
<lb/>it—and that our principles are in direct opposition to slavery.
<lb/>But this does not absolve us from the necessity of making
<lb/>some <emph>exertion</emph> to remedy the evil of which we complain. If
<lb/>it is so very difficult, in the present state of things, to keep
<lb/>ourselves from partaking of the fruits of iniquity, then ought
<lb/>we to feel the more urgently constrained to make use of every
<lb/>effort in our power to exterminate the system which so widely
<lb/>extends its poisonous influence.</p>
        <p>If you find it impossible now to obtain all the articles you
<lb/>may wish, <quote>uncontaminated by the taint of slavery,</quote> then it
<lb/>rests with you to relax not your endeavours until it is <emph>no longer</emph>
<lb/>impossible. Make use of the products of free labour, when­
<lb/>ever by any efforts you are able to procure them. Do not
<lb/>suffer yourselves to remain inert, because you suppose your ex­
<lb/>ertions will be unfelt: it is well to be engaged in a good cause,
<lb/>even if all the energies devoted to its service should be ineffectual
<lb/>to advance its interests one step. But here your exertions will not
<lb/>be wasted—you can do much. Besides promoting the con­
<lb/>sumption of free produce, the influence of woman may be
<lb/>widely felt in awaking a more general interest in the cause of
<lb/>Emancipation. By forming societies for the publication and
<lb/>distribution of tracts and pamphlets relative to that subject, in­
<lb/>formation respecting slavery might be largely disseminated,
<lb/>and the feelings of many hitherto unthinking persons aroused
<lb/>into detestation of a system which is a source of so much
<lb/>misery and degradation. The evil is of a nature, that, in the
<lb/>present state of mental cultivation, cannot be long or generally
<lb/>tolerated, after its character has been fully exposed and reflect­

<lb/>ed upon. In <placeName>England</placeName> much good has been done by this means.
<lb/>Thousands of pamphlets and cards, containing a concise
<lb/>account of the nature of colonial slavery, have been distributed
<lb/>by female societies, and a large portion of our own sex are en­
<lb/>gaged, heart and hand, with their brethren in the work of its
<lb/>extermination. The same measure would, no doubt, here be
<lb/>productive of equally beneficial results, and we hope ere long
<lb/>to see it adopted.</p>

<lb/>There was a fearful conflict here, too—and I was in the midst,

          <p>
Then for a while there was an indistinctness in the vision,
<lb/>till presently I was no longer in the open air, and my whole
<lb/>frame was burning with insupportable agony. The groans of
<lb/>the maimed and dying wretches who were near me, rang con­
<lb/>tinually in my ears, and unknown faces were bending over me
<lb/>in offices of kindness. I was sensible then, and I knew that I
<lb/>was dying, and the thought of my mother came like a gush
<lb/>of fiery lead upon my heart. Yet <emph>then</emph>, after the dream had
<lb/>left me, I cared but little for its monitions. I felt, it is true,
<lb/>that I ought not to come here bathing my hands causelessly in

<lb/>appeared hurrying forward at a quick run, and in a few mo­

        <p>The day was fast wearing to a close. The smoke-clouds
<lb/>were still hovering over the war-field of <placeName>Brandywine</placeName>, but its
<lb/>wild uproar had died away into a fearful silence; for the vic­
<lb/>tory was won and lost. On what had been that day the scene
<lb/>of the deadliest conflict, stood the low walls and shaded roof
<lb/>of a Quaker worship-house. On its floor warm life-blood was
<lb/>poured out, as if it had been a libation of red wine; and in­
<lb/>stead of the quiet prayer and thanksgiving that had been wont
<lb/>to ascend from those walls, the convulsive groans of mortal
<lb/>agony, and the wild beseeching prayer for mercy to the parting
<lb/>spirit, now went up together.</p>
        <p>The floor and the rude benches were covered with the wound­

<lb/>last <name>Sabbath</name> in their accustomed worship, were now, though
<lb/>sick and pale with the carnage around them, administering aid
<lb/>and comfort to the sufferers. One of these knelt to support the
<lb/>head of a young officer, who lay apparently lifeless in his arms,
<lb/>while another bent over his form, holding one of his hands,
<lb/>and occasionally moistening his lips, and bathing his pale
<lb/>brow.</p>

        <p><persName>Ashton</persName> gazed a moment upon that still white countenance,

he exclaimed in his agony, <said>will you

        <p>His voice seemed to rekindle for an instant the fleeting spark
<lb/>of animation in the bosom of <persName>Percy</persName>, for he half lifted his

<lb/>following in his footsteps, like pity after sorrow, and <quote>pouring

<lb/>Summer, with his hot breath, his thunderbolts, his forked

<lb/>Autumn, gathering those fruits into the garner, and again
<lb/>pressing upon the brow of Nature the signet of decay,—have
<lb/>fingered with us for their allotted time, and have all departed.</p>
        <p>It is well for us, at the close of the year, to look back at the
<lb/>moments that have past, and consider whether they have made
<lb/>us wiser and better than we were at its commencement, or
<lb/>whether too great a portion of them has not been unprofitably
<lb/>wasted. When we call back to memory these forgotten hours,
<lb/>what shall we find in the account which they have carried in
<lb/>against us? Have we been properly grateful for the good gifts
<lb/>we have received from the Giver of all good, and bowed sub­
<lb/>missively to the afflictions with which he has been pleased to
<lb/>visit us? Have we offered up <quote>the morning and the evening
<lb/>sacrifice</quote> of a spirit conscious of its own frailties, and seeking
<lb/>after holier things? Or have we to reproach ourselves, that
<lb/><quote>we have left undone those things which we ought to have
<lb/>done; and have done those things which we ought not to have 
<lb/>done?</quote> That we have nurtured pride and vanity secretly
<lb/>within our hearts, and suffered anger and discontent too fre­
<lb/>quently to obtain an undue empire over us?</p>
        <p>A year! How rapidly it has passed away! seeming to
<lb/>some of us scarcely more than the memory of an indistinct
<lb/>dream, it has wrought upon us so little change. To others it
<lb/>has been an important era, crowded with eventful incident, and
<lb/>indelibly impressed upon the recollection by the alterations it
<lb/>has made in character, or feeling, or circumstance. Thousands
<lb/>hailed its entrance with gladness, whose hearts are now crushed
<lb/>by some unsparing desolation, or lie cold and pulseles<choice><sic>r</sic><corr>s</corr></choice> beneath
<lb/>the withered grass.</p>
        <p>And who, of those that now interchange the customary
<lb/>salutations of the <name>New Year</name>, may say that they will ever be
<lb/>witnesses of its dying hour? Surely, then, it is fitting that the

<lb/>and the serious thoughts that ought to be gathered around its
<lb/>passing hours, shall the poor and miserable plead in vain for
<lb/>the dole of compassion? Woman was not formed to look upon
<lb/>scenes of suffering with a careless eye: it is alike her privilege
<lb/>and her duty to impart consolation to the sorrows of the afflict­

        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">That</hi> the errors of one person are no excuse for those of
<lb/>another, most persons are very willing to admit—when the
<lb/>aphorism is not used in application to themselves. Yet how
<lb/>often is it urged in palliation of offences, that others are equally
<lb/>guilty! If we had no conscience; if the laws of God were
<lb/>neither written upon our hearts, nor within the volume of
<lb/>truth, this plea might justly be available. But as it is, how­
<lb/>ever powerful the force of example may be, the errors of the
<lb/>best and wisest cannot justify those of the weakest individual.
<lb/>Therefore, the moment it is proved to us by those laws, that
<lb/>any course of conduct is wrong, that instant it behoves us to
<lb/>alter it, before an infatuated persistence deepens out fault into
<lb/>a dark iniquity. No matter though it is a subject which all
<lb/>whom we have been accustomed most to reverence, look upon
<lb/>with carelessness and indifference—no matter for the example
<lb/>of the most pious—if you are acting contrary to the commands
<lb/>of God, shall the opinions of men sustain you in a career of
<lb/>sinfulness? If the characters of the most righteous are still im­
<lb/>perfect, then it is needful that they become better than they
<lb/>have yet been; and for those who have many sins to rise up
<lb/>against them, is there not more cause that they should garner
<lb/>up the memory of some good deeds in the store-house of con­
<lb/>science? It is true that in many matters there exists a great

<lb/>contrariety of opinion; some persons esteeming innocent those

<lb/>can exist only with regard to secondary duties—the <quote>weightier
<lb/>matters of the law</quote> are so plain, that unless they are wilfully
<lb/>blind, <quote>those who run may read;</quote> and those things we can
<lb/>neither neglect ourselves, nor support the violation of them in

        <p>If, then, right and wrong are distinctly pointed out before us,
<lb/>are we to be governed in our choice of them by <emph>expediency</emph>,
<lb/>or the customs of the world, or the opinions of men? Certainly
<lb/>not. We are not to calculate upon the good or the evil, that
<lb/>may ensue by our adherence to the principles of right—nor
<lb/>what sacrifices must be made—nor what privations may have

        <p><said rend="pre()post()">How very beautiful!</said> I exclaimed mentally.</p>
        <p>I was in a village house of worship, and the above observa­
<lb/>tion was excited by a female who sat opposite to me. She was
<lb/>not very young—she might have been twenty-eight, or possibly
<lb/>thirty years; but her features were finely regular, and her
<lb/>complexion still wore an undiminished brilliancy. It <emph>must</emph>
<lb/>have been undiminished in its beauty, for it was one of the
<lb/>most perfect whiteness I have ever seen, smooth and polished
<lb/>—more like a sheet of hot-pressed letter-paper than any thing
<lb/>else I can think of—and with a tinge of carmine scarcely deep­
<lb/>er than that of the most delicate petal of the damask rose.
<lb/>In common with many others, she had laid aside her bonnet
<lb/>on account of the excessive heat of the weather, and her dark
<lb/>hair, arranged with the utmost simplicity beneath a plain gauze
<lb/>cap, contrasted beautifully with the fine intellectual forehead
<lb/>over which it was parted. Her lip had probably once been red­
<lb/>der than it was at present, and past hours might have seen a
<lb/>more frequent flush of laughing sunlight upon her cheek, for
<lb/>now the long fringes of her eye bent over it with a continual
<lb/>pensiveness. For that eye—think of all the descriptions you
<lb/>have ever read in poetry of the eye of woman—of its veined

<pb n="36"/>

<mw type="pageNum">36</mw>  

<lb/>lid, with the long drooping curled lash—its expressive diamond
<lb/>light—its melting liquid lustre—and its pencilled, arched, inde­
<lb/>scribable brow—and separate whatever may seem to you most
<lb/>beautiful, to attach to the idea of a large melancholy hazel eye.</p>
        <p>It was this subdued sadness, mingled too as it was with so
<lb/>much sweetness of expression, such perfect unrepiningness,
<lb/>that interested me far more than I should otherwise have been.
<lb/>Even the gladness of the lovely faces that sometimes flit around
<lb/>me like scattered sunshine, frequently awakens only a feeling
<lb/>of pensiveness that it should be so little abiding—but a counte­
<lb/>nance like hers, over which the world's sorrow had already
<lb/>flung a veil of spirituality—how could I pass it by unnoticed?</p>
        <p> By her sat a little urchin as unlike her as possible. Not in
<lb/>feature, for in that there was some trifling resemblance—but
<lb/>in her whole manner and character. I never saw such an
<lb/>expression of untameable joy, as was exhibited in the face of
<lb/>that child; it seemed blended with the very existence of the
<lb/>light-hearted creature; and though it was now subdued into
<lb/>comparative seriousness, the lashes of her dark blue eyes were
<lb/>occasionally lifted with an animated glance that actually seem­
<lb/>ed to emit flashes of light. You could scarcely look on her
<lb/>without a feeling of gladness—yet once, when she looked up
<lb/>suddenly, while her mother's eyes were fixed on her in sad
<lb/>tenderness, the smile for a moment entirely forsook her lip, and
<lb/>I saw a large tear gathering over her eye-lashes.</p>
        <p>After the worship was concluded, I enquired the history of
<lb/>that woman. They told me she was one to whom the <name>Angel
<lb/>of Grief</name> had ministered—but that I already knew—and that
<lb/>she had drunk deeply of the bitterness of his vial.</p>
        <p>She had wedded in her bright youth, with a high hope that
<lb/>life should be to her a long sunny dream of happiness. But
<lb/>she had leaned her heart upon a broken reed, and it gave way
<lb/>and crushed her. They told me there were three graves out
<lb/>in their grassy burial place, over which hot tears had fallen,
<lb/>when were laid there the perished blossoms of her heart—and
<lb/>the strong stem, round which its tendrils had entwined them­
<lb/>selves—perhaps too fondly.</p>
        <p>I told you that she had wedded with high hopes;—but they
<lb/>had been crushed by another hand than that of death. <emph>He</emph>
<lb/>came by only to finish the ruin. Long before <persName>Harriet Rogers</persName>
<lb/>became a widow, had her husband ceased to be worthy of her.

<pb n="37"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="D1r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">37</mw>  

<lb/>Yet intemperate and unprincipled as he became, she still clung
<lb/>to him, in the steadfastness of her woman's heart, with a depth
<lb/>of holy affection that no unkindness could subdue, with a hope
<lb/>of his being yet restored to virtue, that no unworthiness could
<lb/>crush.</p>
        <p>But death, a fearful unprepared-for doom, came suddenly
<lb/>upon him; and then she felt that all the tears she had shed
<lb/>over the pure beings whom she had already laid to rest, were
<lb/>happiness—ay bliss—to the few scalding drops that fell as if
<lb/>they were wrung one by one from her seared heart, slowly
<lb/>and separately upon his still brow;—noble and beautiful as it
<lb/>was, and yet so stricken with the shame of guilt!—about to
<lb/>go down to the grave with such a deep cloud forever resting
<lb/>upon it! And then the thoughts of what was beyond those
<lb/>gloomy portals!—she could not dwell upon it, and with a
<lb/>half-uttered groan, she covered up her face, and they bore her
<lb/>away insensible.</p>
        <p>She did not see him again; but day by day there grew to
<lb/>be less of agony in her prayers, and as the darkness passed
<lb/>gradually away from her heart, she mingled once more, as she
<lb/>had been wont to do, among her beloved friends. The pure
<lb/>piety of her spirit, refined and deepened by suffering, dared
<lb/>not waste itself in gloomy repinings:—but, though long years
<lb/>had passed away, she never could forget.</p>
        <p>And I wondered no more at the melancholy written upon
<lb/>her beautiful countenance.</p>

<lb/>the skies, for having refused the use of <emph>tea</emph> during the revolu­
<lb/>tionary contest, because that article had been one of the excit­

<lb/>circumstances, most of them, at the present day, would act
<lb/>after the same manner. And do not the calls of patriotism, as
<lb/>well as of religion, still more imperatively urge to every exer­
<lb/>tion that may tend to remove their country from the darkness
<lb/>of crime and infamy? Yet they, who, amid the gloom of
<lb/>former years, unhesitatingly bore privations and sacrifices, that
<lb/>they might strengthen the hands of those, who, on the field of
<lb/>warfare, were contending for liberty, now shrink not from the
<lb/>luxuries which have been wrung with heart-sickening inhu­

<lb/>were no other cause for hate, to the system of slavery, its

<lb/>in opprobrium against it. But when we reflect, that disgusting
<lb/>and dishonourable as it is, this is one of the fairest traits in its
<lb/>character, it is really surprising how the gentle and the good
<lb/>can be so little offended by its vileness. We should imagine
<lb/>that the tears of contrition for the past, could be dried only by
<lb/>the high resolve of instant reformation, and the nobler and bet­
<lb/>ter conduct of future life. But, alas! how few are there, who,

<lb/>that can refuse to weigh the claims of interest against those of
<lb/>right. Yet the cause of emancipation is a holy one, and how­
<lb/>ever tardy may be its progress, there can be no doubt but it
<lb/>will eventually triumph. With reference to this subject, we
<lb/>have liberty to quote the encouraging sentiments of one of our

<lb/>temple, where thousands of my own sex were gathered to wor­
<lb/>ship the presiding divinity. The rarest productions of the loom,
<lb/>of various kinds, but of the finest texture, and the choicest co­
<lb/>lours, were fantastically twisted around each other, so as to
<lb/>form a kind of throne, on which she was seated. On the altar
<lb/>before her, lay heaps of jewelry, strings of pearl, diamonds,
<lb/>and other precious stones, and all manner of personal orna­
<lb/>ments, piled up in glittering confusion. Envoys from different
<lb/>quarters of the globe, were continually bringing their offerings
<lb/>to her feet, and numberless females, who officiated as priestesses,
<lb/>were employed about her person, altering its decorations, and
<lb/>adorning her in a different manner. But I observed that her
<lb/>dress had no sooner been adjusted according to her directions,
<lb/>than she became dissatisfied with it, and ordered some other
<lb/>form substituted for that which she had but the instant before
<lb/>applauded.</p>
        <p>These various changes were instantly imitated by her votaries,
<lb/>whose manner of worship seemed to be by thus humouring her
<lb/>caprice. Those who were too far distant to discover the man­

<lb/>where they were publicly sold. Still I watched their destina­

<lb/>labour were claimed by others. Those to whom my attention
<lb/>was principally directed, were employed in the care and culti­
<lb/>vation of a species of tree, from whose pods, when ripe, they
<lb/>gathered a white, downy substance, which was collected into
<lb/>large quantities, and carried away into a place where hundreds
<lb/>of beings—many of them squalid, debased, and miserable—
<lb/>were employed throughout their whole lives, in causing it to
<lb/>undergo various operations, till it came from their hands trans­
<lb/>formed into fabrics of exquisite delicacy and beauty, meet to
<lb/>be employed in forming the garments of Fashion. Others
<lb/>passed their days in watching the life and death of successive
<lb/>races of a certain species of insect, that from its shroud they
<lb/>might form her festival robes. Men dared the torrid sunbeams,
<lb/>that they might minister to her fancied wants, or gathered the
<lb/>spoils of the cold regions of the north, that her votaries might
<lb/>lay them at her footstool.</p>
        <p>Neither was it over dress only, that she exercised so despotic
<lb/>a sway. Manners, opinions, and taste, were all regulated ac­
<lb/>cording to her will. Nay, so enthusiastically infatuated were
<lb/>some of her worshippers, that they would unhesitatingly sacrifice
<lb/>comfort, health, moral principle, and the holiest affections of
<lb/>the heart, in obedience to her dictates.</p>
        <p>But without, in front of the temple, methought I heard the
<lb/>clamour of many voices, uttering murmurs and revilings against
<lb/>the witcheries of the tyrant, and the obsequious compliance
<lb/>with which her orders were attended to. These were fathers
<lb/>and husbands, who had been ruined, both in happiness and
<lb/>wealth, by the folly and extravagance of their relatives. The
<lb/>voice of lamentation, mingled also with that of execrations for
<lb/>some who had stood high among her list of favourites, after
<lb/>having expended their whole fortune in her service, were now
<lb/>cast out destitute, to wail their former devotion to her will, or
<lb/>for their lost station, now occupied by more fortunate compe­
<lb/>titors.</p>
        <p>I was about to give utterance to some very wise and moral
<lb/>reflections, upon the folly of the assembled multitude, when the
<lb/>strange old man, with an exclamation of impatience, dashed
<lb/>the spectacles violently from my eyes, and the whole scene
<lb/>vanished. The old man, too, had vanished—cap, beard, and
<lb/>all—I began to be in doubt of my own substantiality! Yet
<lb/>there I was, broad awake, too, by this time, with my disorgan­

<lb/>on the hearth during my dream, and was almost totally con­
<lb/>sumed. Fortunately, however, the fashion had changed while
<lb/>I was asleep, and the quantity of stuff which had been required
<lb/>for the formation of one sleeve, was now amply sufficient for

        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">One</hi> of the worst features in the character of slavery, is the
<lb/>perpetual darkness which it so assiduously gathers round the
<lb/>minds of its victims. Knowledge and rebellion appear to be
<lb/>almost synonymous terms in the mind of the slaveholder, or at
<lb/>least the idea of the latter appears to succeed that of the for­
<lb/>mer, almost as regularly as though it were thus properly de­
<lb/>fined. Then, too, it affords such a convenient avenue to
<lb/>escape from the reproaches of others, or of their own con­
<lb/>sciences, from the degrading ignorance of their negroes to plead
<lb/>the danger that would result from their instruction. But if
<lb/>mention is made of the propriety of emancipating the slaves in
<lb/>their present condition, then instantly their masters are alarmed
<lb/>at the consequences that they are pleased to think must neces­
<lb/>sarily ensue, if so many uneducated and degraded beings were,
<lb/>as they term it, <said>let loose upon society.</said> Thus, although they
<lb/>acknowledge that slavery is an evil, and very willingly join in
<lb/>lamentations for its existence, they cannot consent that it should
<lb/>be abolished, until their slaves are fitted for emancipation by a
<lb/>preparatory education, and still, on account of a just regard to
<lb/>their own safety, cannot suffer them to receive the blessings
<lb/>of instruction while they continue in a state of bondage. This,
<lb/>we believe, is nearly the sum of much of the reasoning employed
<lb/>by the southern planters with regard to the subject in ques­
<lb/>tion. We are willing to make all due allowances for the effects
<lb/>of long continued habits and prejudices; we feel more disposed
<lb/>to compassionate than to blame—but we cannot acknowledge
<lb/>that any arguments are reasonable, which have for their object
<lb/>the support of injustice. Yet even if elevating and refining
<lb/>their minds by some degree of literary attainments, might have
<lb/>some tendency to render the weight of their fetters a less en­
<lb/>durable burden, surely, not the least shadow of such danger

<lb/>power may lie, contribute their utmost to the advancement of
<lb/>the eternal welfare of those immortal beings, over whom for­
<lb/>tune has given them the temporal control. Will they not ex­
<lb/>tend the hand of christian and sisterly fellowship to those, who,
<lb/>females though they be, are debarred from so many of the
<lb/>dearest privileges of the sex? Will they not plead with those
<lb/>over whose minds they may exercise a pure and rightful influ­
<lb/>ence, to rescue the female slave from her present state of de­
<lb/>gradation? Certainly, we may hope that they will do so, unless
<lb/>the poisonous properties of slavery are such as to deaden the
<lb/>vital principle of every good thing within the reach of its
<lb/>effects.</p>

<lb/>by a participation in this evil, an abhorrence of the idea of

<lb/>Slavery:</p>
        <quote rend="pre()bestow((pre(“))(p))">
          <p>The infamy of being the first who brought the miserable
<lb/>sons of <placeName>Africa</placeName> as slaves from their native soil, attaches itself
<lb/>to the <name>Portuguese</name>, who, as early as <date when="1481">1481</date>, built a castle on the
<lb/><placeName>Gold coast</placeName>, and from thence ravaged the country, and carried
<lb/>off the inhabitants to <placeName>Portugal</placeName>, where they were sold into
<lb/>bondage. In <date when="1503">1503</date>, slaves were first taken from the Portuguese
<lb/>settlements in <placeName>Africa</placeName> to the Spanish possessions in <placeName>America</placeName>;
<lb/>and from that time to <date when="1511">1511</date>, large numbers were exported to
<lb/>the colonies of <placeName>Spain</placeName>, by permission of <persName>King Ferdinand V</persName>.
<lb/>After his death, a proposal was made to the regent of <placeName>Spain</placeName>,
<lb/><persName>Cardinal Ximenes</persName>, by <persName>Las Casas, Bishop of <placeName>Chiapa</placeName></persName>, to establish
<lb/>a regular commerce in African slaves, under the plausible and
<lb/>well-intentioned, but fallacious pretext of substituting their
<lb/>labour in the colonies for that of the native <name>Indians</name>, who were
<lb/>rapidly becoming exterminated by the severity of their labour,
<lb/>and the cruel treatment of their Spanish masters. To the im­
<lb/>mortal honour of <persName>Cardinal Ximenes</persName>, he rejected the proposition
<lb/>on the ground of the iniquity of slavery itself in the abstract,
<lb/>and also, the great injustice of making slaves of one nation,
<lb/>for the liberation of another. The Cardinal appears, there­
<lb/>fore, to have been the first avowed opponent of this traffic in
<lb/>men.</p>

<lb/>in <date when="1517">1517</date>, encouraged the slave-trade, and granted letters patent

        <p>The importation of slaves into the British colonies was

<lb/>of those who are now most tenacious of the evil thus entailed
<lb/>upon them. Can any circumstances have occurred since then,
<lb/>to render slavery more humane or more christian-like in its
<lb/>character? We think not. Every succeeding year that has
<lb/>been suffered to elapse without an effort to remove this stain,
<lb/>has but served, in an increasing ratio, to magnify the iniquity
<lb/>of the practice. Every year—nay, every month, every day,
<lb/>that still passes idly by, must continue to deepen the enormity
<lb/>of our country's guilt.</p>
        <p>Can then the female sex, who form so large a part of her
<lb/>population, be free from the pollution of this sin? Had they
<lb/>all used properly their influence as christian women, in oppo­
<lb/>sition to this crime, would it till this day have darkened the
<lb/>volumes of our country's history? We have no hesitation in

<lb/>duty to perform for the advancement of its abolition.</p>

<lb/>your dearest friends, without your ever <quote>laying it to heart,</quote>
<lb/>that you or they are partaking in the unrighteousness you
<lb/>reprobate. It is true that you have the ready plea of custom
<lb/>and the laws of the state, but the very arguments that are
<lb/>used for its palliation, tend only to prove the whole system
<lb/>radically wrong. We do not impute to you any other than
<lb/>gentle and humane treatment of those under your charge—
<lb/>we do not allude reproachfully to the circumstance of your
<lb/>possessing them. You have grown up with this system of
<lb/>things tolerated everywhere around you, till it appears to you
<lb/>natural, and you almost forget the possibility of its being
<lb/>otherwise. You have so long seen it sanctioned by the
<lb/>practice of those whom you have been accustomed to esteem
<lb/>and reverence, that you scarcely look upon it as requiring in­
<lb/>dividual disapprobation; though were you questioned on the
<lb/>subject, you would probably express a wish that it had never
<lb/>been introduced into our country. There are others among
<lb/>you, who would not so far tolerate the practice of slavery, as
<lb/>to hold negroes in their own possession, and who probably
<lb/>consider, that by this passive act, they perform all the duty
<lb/>that is required of them in this respect. But what difference
<lb/>can there be, whether the luxuries with which their tables are
<lb/>spread, or the tasteful garb that arrays their forms, be the pro­
<lb/>ductions of slaves in the employ of another or themselves?
<lb/>We beseech all those whom we are addressing, to reason with
<lb/>themselves calmly upon this subject. Think of slavery as it
<lb/>exists in other states of the union—think of the domestic
<lb/>slave-trade, with all its horrors—wives and husbands forcibly
<lb/>torn asunder—parents parted from their children—friend from

<lb/>We need not attempt any further to excite your compassion for
<lb/>the slave, nor horror for the system which is the source of his
<lb/>calamities. If a knowledge of the sufferings of the one, and
<lb/>the iniquity of the other, has not been sufficient to awaken
<lb/>these feelings, and your own benevolent natures have failed to
<lb/>prompt your ready sympathy, we can have but little hope of
<lb/>arousing the dormant principle. But we think not that your

<lb/>we know that there are at least some among you, who have

<lb/>who look with anxiety and regret on the broad cloud that flings
<lb/>its deep shadow over their country—and reflect with pain and

<lb/>upon so many of her children. We would converse with
<lb/>you, then, on the means that may be most efficient in alleviating
<lb/>their condition, and most successful in loosening the fetters of
<lb/>their bondage; and in what measure your own power may be
<lb/>instrumental in effecting this purpose. Shrink not back under

<lb/>from the shackles of human slavery, your influence, like a re­
<lb/>viving leaven, will be silently diffusing a corresponding feeling
<lb/>over the minds of others, and thus, to speak in the figurative
<lb/>language of the <name>Indian</name>, clearing away the briars that now ob­
<lb/>struct the path of Emancipation. Let an association be formed
<lb/>among you, having for its object the support of the free system
<lb/>and the diffusion of your principles. Union will give you
<lb/>activity and strength—it will enable you to devise and carry
<lb/>into effect plans, which you would find it otherwise impossible
<lb/>to execute; and while it imparts authority to the sentiments
<lb/>you inculcate, will give a wider extent to the sphere of your
<lb/>usefulness. In other states of the <name>Union</name>, the voice of woman
<lb/>has been already heard pleading that the bruised reed, <placeName>Ethiopia</placeName>,
<lb/>may not be utterly broken; that the wounds that have been
<lb/>inflicted upon her heart may be bound up, and the tears of suf­
<lb/>fering may be wiped away from her eyes. And will not you,
<lb/>also, stretch forth the ready hand of assistance, and strive to
<lb/>lift up from the earth, the mourning brow of the trodden and
<lb/>oppressed one? Can you be insensible to the bliss of shedding
<lb/>light over the soul that was in darkness, or of pouring the oil
<lb/>of gladness over the heads of them that were despised and
<lb/>afflicted? No: it is impossible that you should be thus dull
<lb/>to the pleasures of benevolence—the warm gush of your feel­
<lb/>ings may have flowed in hidden places, but its well-spring is
<lb/>not the less deep for its hitherto silent course. Let that fountain
<lb/>now shed its refreshing streams over the parched ground of this
<lb/>wilderness, and the blessing of the Holy One may cause it to
<lb/>become a fruitful land.</p>
        <p>One thing further we would forcibly impress upon your
<lb/>minds—do not delay the commencement of this good work
<lb/>until a more convenient season. Procrastination is highly pre­
<lb/>judicial both to yourselves and the objects of your mercy; and
<lb/>you know not how long the power of usefulness may be grant­
<lb/>ed you. Consult, therefore, immediately with each other, and
<lb/>you know not how long the power of usefulness may be grant­

<lb/>with your own hearts, upon the duties that may be allotted
<lb/>you to perform, in removing from your land a system that

        <p>Is the necessity of opposing it impressed upon them, they
<lb/>will object, that their own daily participation in its fruits ren­
<lb/>ders them unfit labourers in the soil of emancipation. This
<lb/>might be supposed to be favourable, as it leads immediately to
<lb/>a discussion of the advantage of encouraging free labour, and
<lb/>the wished-for point is already looked upon as half gained.
<lb/>But this is far from succeeding as a natural consequence. A
<lb/>long array of arguments respecting its inconvenience, useless­
<lb/>ness, &amp;c. are set forth in formidable order, concluding with
<lb/>alleging the utter impossibility of refraining in all instances
<lb/>from the produce of slavery, or of articles that proceed either
<lb/>directly or indirectly from that source. This is acknowledged,
<lb/>but not without still pleading for even a partial patronization
<lb/>of the free system, just so far as may not be <emph>very</emph> inconveni­
<lb/>ent; and this is answered with the opinion, that unless they

<lb/>of such principles, were we to suffer ourselves to apply them
<lb/>to our general character and actions. They do not consider
<lb/>that they are absolved from all moral or religious duties, be­
<lb/>cause it is difficult to mould themselves into absolute perfection.
<lb/>They do not think it useless to place any restraint upon their
<lb/>angry feelings in a moment of provocation, because they may
<lb/>sometimes be hurried into an impatient expression; nor to
<lb/>withhold the relief that it is in their power to afford to poverty,
<lb/>because it is impossible to supply the wants of all to whom it
<lb/>is a source of suffering. Neither should they refuse to con­
<lb/>tribute, with what strength they may, towards breaking the

        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">In</hi> this age of intellectual advancement, when the cultivation
<lb/>of the mind is considered an object of primary importance, and
<lb/>such strenuous efforts are making for a wider diffusion of know­
<lb/>ledge through almost all classes of society, it is strange that
<lb/>the education of one portion, and that a very extensive one,
<lb/>should be almost totally forgotten or neglected.</p>
        <p>Men will cheerfully tear themselves away from the delights
<lb/>of home and society, and even peril their lives in order to con­
<lb/>vey the words of the gospel into distant climes, and implant in
<lb/>the bosoms of those who know not Christ, a knowledge of the
<lb/>divine principles of <name>Christianity</name>. Woman will resign her orna­
<lb/>ments, abridge her pleasures, and exert all her influence for the
<lb/>same purpose; and yet at the same time, almost at their doors
<lb/>—nay, in the very bosoms of their families, there are beings
<lb/>far more ignorant and degraded than those distant ones whom
<lb/>they are struggling to save.</p>
        <p>It may be that the religious tenets of the <name>Hindoo</name>, or the
<lb/><name>American Indian</name>, have been formed in error, that

<lb/>yet who can doubt that, according to their knowledge, many
<lb/>of them worship the God of their fathers, with all the sincerity
<lb/>of deep devotedness, and that they possess many noble and
<lb/>surprising traits of character? But the slave—what knowledge,
<lb/>—what instruction, religious or moral, can he obtain, but that
<lb/>which we ourselves see fit to impart to him? And if those to
<lb/>whose charge he is particularly entrusted, suffer his mind, his

<pb n="52"/>

<lb/>very soul, to consume away in the most debasing ignorance,
<lb/>how will they be prepared to answer the solemn question—
<lb/><quote>Why put ye not my money to the exchangers, that at my
<lb/>coming I might have received mine own with usury?</quote></p>
        <p>Let not his moral character be complained of, nor his intel­
<lb/>lectual powers be vilified, until the experiment of his instruction
<lb/>has been fairly tried. There are many who are perfectly con­
<lb/>vinced of the injustice of the system of slavery, and who would
<lb/>joyfully aid in its abolition, did they not consider its victims,
<lb/>by their long formed habits and character, totally unfitted for
<lb/>liberty, and that their enfranchisement would be alike an evil
<lb/>to themselves, and to their former masters. Here then is a
<lb/>field in which the influence of woman may effect much. Let
<lb/>it be her task—the task of those who wish to behold their
<lb/>country freed from a crime, in which they are perhaps com­
<lb/>pelled to participate,—to extend the hand of compassionate
<lb/>guidance to those unfortunate beings, who are rising up beneath
<lb/>their care—to instil, with unwearying gentleness, into their
<lb/>young minds, the sublime truths of the Christian religion, and
<lb/>impress them firmly with unfaltering principles of morality—
<lb/>and there can be no doubt but the effects of her benevolence
<lb/>will be widely visible. Let it not be said that the slave popu­
<lb/>lation can only be kept in subjection while in a state of igno­
<lb/>rance. Will the knowledge that his patient endurance of suffer­
<lb/>ing, is complacently beheld in heaven, teach the slave to rebel
<lb/>against his earthly master? or will an undoubting faith in those
<lb/>promises which tell that his ready forgiveness of injuries will
<lb/>win for him the privilege to

<lb/><quote rend="align(center)pre(“)post(”)"><lg type="poem" subtype="indeterminate"><l>Wear his immortality as free,</l><l>Beside the crystal waters,</l></lg></quote>

<lb/>as those who have been his oppressors, dispose him to forfeit
<lb/>that happiness by fostering a spirit of revenge? It is clear
<lb/>that it cannot! and it is sincerely hoped that societies among
<lb/>the ladies of the south, for the education of the youthful slave
<lb/>population, will, ere long, hold a conspicuous place among
<lb/>those which have been already formed for the benefit of that
<lb/>class of our citizens.</p>

<lb/>to what you laughingly term my <quote>dark-visaged enthusiasm.</quote>
<lb/>But I have extracted from you a promise to listen to me pa­
<lb/>tiently, and no fears of your raillery must deter me from
<lb/>attempting to inspire you with a portion of the interest which
<lb/>I feel for the wronged children of <placeName>Africa</placeName>.</p>
        <p>What would I not give to know that you had entered, heart
<lb/>and soul, into their cause! It surprises me that you have not
<lb/>already done so—and the more deeply I reflect on your cha­
<lb/>racter, so in proportion does my astonishment increase.—You
<lb/>fire at the mention of the wrongs of <placeName>Greece</placeName>! The name of
<lb/>liberty you cherish like a sacred thing. I have seen your
<lb/>cheek glow and your eye flash with the ardour of your patri­
<lb/>otic feelings—yet you look coldly and calmly on the blot that
<lb/>so foully dishonours your country's escutcheon! Strange!—
<lb/>good too, and pious as you are—gentle and merciful, even to the
<lb/>meanest worm that crawls in its worthlessness beneath your
<lb/>tread—with a heart so alive to the impulses of humanity, so
<lb/>full of tenderness and high romantic feeling, and so steadily
<lb/>calm in the execution of its duties—and yet on this subject—
<lb/>one that should long since have stirred every pulse of your
<lb/>heart, every sympathy of your bosom— so carelessly, so culpably
<lb/>indifferent!—Think not that I am harsh, dear <persName>Isabel</persName>: even
<lb/>you acknowledge that the system of which I speak is a great
<lb/>evil—you admit that it is sinful to press the iron yoke of op­
<lb/>pression upon the neck of any of God's creatures: how much
<lb/>less then upon those whom he hath created in his own image!
<lb/>and how can you escape the infection of that guilt, unless you
<lb/>openly lift up your hand in remonstrance against it? It is not
<lb/>sufficient that you are not an immediate participant in this in­
<lb/>iquity. You are a willing partaker in its advantages, you

<lb/>hope to fling from you all its awful responsibility! But when

<lb/>will be held guiltless, who have stood by and beheld the iron
<lb/>of his fetters wearing away into his very soul, and yet have
<lb/>lifted no hand to shield, no voice beseeching mercy for the suf­
<lb/>ferer? Oh, believe it not! Do not, I entreat you, soothe
<lb/>yourself into a fatal calmness with this hope! You may shut
<lb/>your ear <emph>now</emph> to the cry of the oppressed; you may persuade
<lb/>yourself that the sphere of your duty extends not thus far;—
<lb/>but when the last shadowy film has gathered over your eye,
<lb/>and your spirit hath passed through the valley of the shadow
<lb/>of death—when all the deceitful mists you had so industriously
<lb/>folded about you are suddenly scattered, and every sense is
<lb/>rendered fearfully acute by the absence of the weakness of
<lb/>mortality—when every unforgiven sin rises up to your recol­
<lb/>lection with a terrible distinctness—when, with all the intensity
<lb/>of an immortal nature, with a love, to which the warmest
<lb/>transports of earthly enthusiasm are cold and feeble, you shall
<lb/>adore the perfection and the excellence of the Holy One—do
<lb/>you not think that you will then remember, with all the bitter­
<lb/>ness of regret, that when the voice of the agony of his people
<lb/>went forth over the land, you gave it no heed? that when you
<lb/>saw them smitten wrongfully, bruised and wounded without a

<lb/>to pour over their wounds the healing tears of compassion?</p>
        <p>Do not, my friend, drive this subject from your mind, as

<lb/>believe that it is demanded of <emph>you</emph>, who are so vastly inferior
<lb/>in all these points, particularly to concern yourself about the
<lb/>subject—especially as you are convinced that all your sacrifices
<lb/>would be of no avail.</p>
        <p>Methinks that <soCalled rend="slant(italic)pre(“)post(”)">inconvenience</soCalled> 
is a strange term, <persName>Isabel</persName>, to
<lb/>associate with an act of duty—for it is as such I would press
<lb/>it upon your attention:—and the circumstance of this strikingly
<lb/>momentous subject having been hitherto so long and so strangely
<lb/>neglected, is the very reason that your exertions are necessary
<lb/>now; for if apathy and indolence had not long since applied
<lb/>the same salve to the rebukes of conscience, slavery would ere
<lb/>this have ceased to exist.</p>
        <p>Then the conduct of others can be no excuse for you. If the
<lb/>path of duty is plain before you, ought you to wait for the
<lb/>example of others to incline you to enter it? Surely not! you
<lb/>know, my friend, that we are to be answerable each for our­
<lb/>selves; we can claim no forgiveness for neglected duties be­
<lb/>cause others have offended in the same manner. Their educa­
<lb/>tion, their prejudices, may have gathered a mist around their
<lb/>mental vision, causing them to behold objects totally reversed
<lb/>from their real situation, as sailors are said sometimes to be­
<lb/>hold a distant vessel with its hull apparently elevated in the air,
<lb/>and its masts resting on the waters; and surely in such a case
<lb/>you would not join with the ignorant and misinformed, in as­
<lb/>serting that such was its actual situation!</p>
        <p>Slavery, my friend, must be either positively right, or posi­
<lb/>tively wrong. There is no <emph>middle</emph> point on which it may rest.
<lb/>It is not a thing to be merely <emph>disapproved</emph> of—coldly warred
<lb/>with as a venial offence. It violates <emph>all</emph> the most essential prin­
<lb/>ciples of the Christian religion. I am not raving, <persName>Isabel</persName>! I
<lb/>can appeal to that volume which I have seen wet with your
<lb/>own repentant tears, for the truth of my assertions! If the
<lb/>most distinct, the most sublime declarations of the gospel are
<lb/>to be wholly <emph>reversed</emph> in their acceptation, then indeed is slavery
<lb/>innocent, and I may lay down my pen, and congratulate you
<lb/>that our country is indeed blessed—a shining light to all the
<lb/>inhabitants of the earth! But do you, can you, for one instant
<lb/>imagine slavery to be consistent with the holy principles of
<lb/><name>Christianity</name>? And if it is not, surely it is at our own peril that
<lb/>we trifle with our knowledge of its guilt! As to the availing­
<lb/>ness of your exertions, it is not for you to judge:—even if they

<pb n="56"/>

<lb/>should be apparently unfelt, (which <emph>you cannot tell</emph>,) still it is
<lb/>as imperatively your duty to cleanse your hand from injustice.</p>
        <p>Do you wait for an express call? till your angry conscience
<lb/>shall press you down to the dust with its terrible upbraiding?
<lb/>Alas, my friend, that hour may come too late! If the case
<lb/>were a doubtful one, then indeed it might be right to wait till
<lb/>the finger of God had expressly taught you; but when your
<lb/>person and your heart tell you that you are lending your sup­
<lb/>port to a system of crime and injustice, can you expect to be
<lb/>absolutely <emph>forced</emph> into righteousness? You know that I love
<lb/>you, dearest <persName>Isabel</persName>—you cannot doubt that: but even at the
<lb/>risk of alienating your affection, must I speak thus plainly!—
<lb/>I entreat, I implore, I conjure you, before you God, to com­
<lb/>mune with your own heart upon this subject—and then answer
<lb/>to your conscience, whether I have not spoken to you the truth!</p>

<lb/>offering a few sacrifices of inclination and luxury upon their
<lb/>altar? If it were for no other purpose but to give evidence of
<lb/>your sincerity, you ought willingly to submit to so trifling a
<lb/>deprivation—for trifling I cannot but consider it, in relation to
<lb/>the momentous object it is intended to support. But it is not a

<lb/>—and surely, my friend, we have enough of thoughtless, un­

<lb/>think of it, <persName>Isabel</persName>—an <emph>eternity</emph> of after life—when we reflect
<lb/>that there will come a fearful, retributive hour, when we must
<lb/>answer for <quote>the deeds done in the body</quote>—and think how we

<lb/>other mourning over the darkness of his soul—a darkness
<lb/>which we have either formed or perpetuated—when we think
<lb/>upon the subject in this light, my friend,—of what overwhelm­
<lb/>ing importance does it not appear!</p>
        <p>Our country has long lain in a state of slumbering lethargy;
<lb/>as if she had forgotten all the misery and the iniquity she was
<lb/>fostering within her bosom. But she is now awake, conscious
<lb/>of the full enormity of the evil, and the guilt—and woe be to
<lb/>her if she cleanse not her polluted hands! We have not the
<lb/>excuse of early and long cherished prejudices—or of ignorance
<lb/>of the fatal effects of the Upas breath of slavery—the proof is
<lb/>before us—the guilt and the consequences have been thoroughly
<lb/>made known to us, and at our peril it must be, if we refuse to
<lb/>listen to the warning voice of admonition!</p>

<lb/>that it may impose upon you; or that the temptations of luxury
<lb/>will overpower your self-denial.—No, dear <persName>Isabel</persName>! your gen­
<lb/>tle spirit will appreciate too well the consciousness of having
<lb/>done right. Your simple meal will be sweetened with the re­
<lb/>flection that it is at least unpolluted, and though your form may
<lb/>perhaps be arrayed less daintily, there will be a calm satisfac­
<lb/>tion within your bosom, which the amplest gratification of an
<lb/>idle vanity could never afford. Yet although you have thus
<lb/>resolved upon taking an open stand in opposition to slavery,
<lb/>you still accuse me of exaggeration, and unnecessary warmth
<lb/>when speaking of this subject. But believe me, <persName>Isabel</persName>, I have
<lb/>not done so;—nay, I had almost said that it was impossible I
<lb/>could. What, my friend, can it be exaggeration to say that it

<pb n="58"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="E5v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">58</mw>  

<lb/>is a dark and fearful wickedness to make merchandise of men?
<lb/>Why, do we not hold up as fit objects of punishment those who
<lb/>are guilty of purloining the property of their fellows, and those
<lb/>who would wilfully become dealers therein? Then what terms
<lb/>of abhorrence can there be sufficiently strong to apply to a 
<lb/>system which causes so many thousands to become robbers, or
<lb/>the upholders of those who are robbers, of the property of the
<lb/>immortal God! Is not this trade in human beings carried on
<lb/>in the very bosom of our own country, tearing husbands from
<lb/>their wives, parents from their children, and trampling down
<lb/>all the holy relations of social and domestic life, as if it were
<lb/>meant by the Eternal that they should be of no avail? And
<lb/>can it be possible that too much warmth can be used in speak­
<lb/>ing upon this subject?</p>
        <p>But even looking upon slavery in its mildest form, allowing
<lb/>the slave to be kindly treated, and well provided for—though
<lb/>he may not <emph>at present</emph> be miserable, what warrant has he for
<lb/>the continuance of these blessings? Death, or pecuniary ruin,
<lb/>may overtake his master, and the negro be transferred at once
<lb/>into wretchedness. But how seldom is it that their situations
<lb/>are thus favourable!</p>
        <p>But we will speak more of this anon, dear <persName>Isabel</persName>. In the
<lb/>mean time, do not rest satisfied with what you have now done.

<lb/>torn fibres of their hearts were all quivering and bleeding with
<lb/>their agony and indignation, to be buried, suffocated, in that hor­
<lb/>rible dungeon, till the hot air that they gaspingly inhaled seemed
<lb/>like liquid fire to their burning lips and throats that were parched
<lb/>to a scorching dryness—and they raved and shrieked in their
<lb/>delirious agony, and tore their flesh that they might once
<lb/>more moisten their lips, even if it were with their own blood!
<lb/>Then, in the deep hush of midnight, when the empty sails
<lb/>swung heavily around the masts, when the glassy waters lay
<lb/>unheaving in the calm moon-lit sleep, and the smothered cry,
<lb/>that rose up at intervals from the bosom of that ship, came
<lb/>fearfully upon the depth of that profound silence—then ever
<lb/>and anon the sound of a dull, heavy plunge into the still wa­

<lb/>were indeed a very demon! And this is the work of <mcr rend="case(smallcaps)">Slavery</mcr>!
<lb/><emph>Can</emph> the denunciations that are heaped upon it, be too severe,

<lb/>of slavery, till you are melancholy and discouraged. You ask
<lb/>me when the dispositions of men will ever be softened into

<lb/>be felt to be stronger than those of interest—and how—even
<lb/>if they were willing to make some atonement to the negro for
<lb/>his past wrongs—the abolition of slavery might be accom­
<lb/>plished? I will tell you frankly, <persName>Isabel</persName>, I do not know. I will
<lb/>acknowledge that there is but too much cause for melancholy,
<lb/>while reflecting on the situation of our enslaved brethren—yet
<lb/>do not for this, my friend, suffer yourself to become discouraged
<lb/>in a good work. We know that liberty is the natural right
<lb/>of every man, who has not by his crimes rendered it a forfeit
<lb/>to the laws of his country: we know that our negroes have
<lb/>been by no just laws deprived of their freedom, and we know
<lb/>that it is one of the deadliest in the long catalogue of human
<lb/>crimes, thus to desolate and ruin the hearts and the immortal
<lb/>souls of men. Surely then, the path we are to pursue is plain
<lb/>before us; and it becomes us not to suffer ourselves to be dis­
<lb/>quieted with vain doubtings. Were there scarce any hope, to
<lb/>the eye of human reason, that slavery would ever be abolished,
<lb/>still, I should not consider that we had sufficient cause to remit
<lb/>our exertions;—the principles of justice are forever the same,
<lb/>and a knowledge of duty is not with impunity to be trifled

<lb/>with. Yet we are not without a reasonable hope of the speedy
<lb/>approach of the hour of emancipation. If those who profess
<lb/>themselves favourable to that cause, would give it something
<lb/>beside mere wishes, there can be no doubt but important alter­

<lb/>Do you recollect the description in the <title rend="pre(“)post(”)">Lady of the Lake,</title>
<lb/>of the almost magical effect produced by the approach of the
<lb/>signal-cross of <persName>Roderick Dhu</persName>? With such an awakening spirit
<lb/>should the call of benevolence and justice go forth, gathering
<lb/>all hearts to their standard! Is it not strange that men will
<lb/>make such sacrifices, as they frequenly do, only to obtain dis­
<lb/>tinction in the sight of men, and are so dead to emulation in
<lb/>deeds for which they might glory in the sight of heaven! The
<lb/>question of <emph>how</emph> abolition will be accomplished, must be the
<lb/>province of other and wiser heads than ours to determine—but
<lb/>though to the minds of those whose perceptions have become
<lb/>clouded by the suggestions of prejudice or interest, there may
<lb/>appear to be darkness, or difficulty, upon the path, yet we know
<lb/>there is one, whose power can turn the gloom of midnight

<lb/>breaking in silence? But now that you have learned to reflect,
<lb/>to think of the happiness of others, as well as your own, and
<lb/>to gaze upon the varied and accumulated forms of misery,
<lb/>portrayed upon the pages of the world's volume, and worse
<lb/>than this—when you witness the selfishness and heartlessness
<lb/>of your fellow mortals,—I wonder not, dear <persName>Isabel</persName>, that you
<lb/>should turn away and weep. But these feelings will gradually
<lb/>pass away from you, my friend, and though you may still

<lb/>consciousness of having done all in your power, will give you
<lb/>a far deeper happiness than you could have won by stifling
<lb/>the impulses of compassion amidst the excitement of gaiety
<lb/>and mirth.</p>
        <p>You tell me that you can do little else but weep over the
<lb/>sufferings of those slaves, whose condition you would almost
<lb/>give your life to alleviate. And would you rather not give
<lb/>those tears, than to purchase exemption from the sadness that
<lb/>occasions them, with an increase of cold-hearted selfishness?
<lb/>I think you would. If there were no other life to look forward
<lb/>to, than the few years that are allotted us in this world, we
<lb/>might, perhaps, be justifiable in seeking to forget both our un­
<lb/>happiness, and that of others; since forgetfulness would be
<lb/>the highest bliss that we could hope. But when we regard
<lb/>this world only <quote>as a school of education for the next,</quote> we
<lb/>need not grudge the few hours of sadness that compassion may
<lb/>give to the crimes and miseries of our fellow-beings. Pursue
<lb/>steadily the course you have begun, my friend, with respect to
<lb/>slavery—and though it may appear to others, and even to your­
<lb/>self, that all your exertions are totally unfelt <quote>as the dust of
<lb/>the balance,</quote> yet you have a witness in your own soul, <persName>Isabel</persName>,
<lb/>that will tell you it is well to pursue the path of duty for its
<lb/>own sake. Shall we refuse to hearken to the commands of
<lb/>God, that we should <quote>do justly and love mercy,</quote> until we
<lb/>have stipulated that a reward for our obedience shall be given
<lb/>us in the success of our works? Surely it is enough of grace
<lb/>for us that we are permitted to place our humble offerings at
<lb/>his footstool! and we should be guilty of insolent presumption,
<lb/>did we dare to solicit a further recompense. What! may we
<lb/>stand chaffering and parleying with the Eternal, respecting the

<lb/>have formed, as it were, the several stages of our intellectual
<lb/>progress. There are probably few persons who have not felt
<lb/>a gush of exultation, when the opinions or partialities of child­

<lb/>or who do not remember with satisfaction the enthusiastic de­
<lb/>lights which attended the acquisition of certain ideas. Not

<lb/>been thrown by at that moment, for those imperfectly recollect­

<lb/>over my imagination, till I felt as though I were in the midst
<lb/>of a new creation. I know not whether the world may have
<lb/>given its voice of praise to these volumes, or whether they do
<lb/>actually possess any superior degree of interest, for I have
<lb/>never since examined them—but I gave myself up unresistingly
<lb/>to their fascination. It was like being ushered into the midst
<lb/>of a new creation—and I paused not to inquire whether it was
<lb/>one of imagination or reality. The recollection of what I had
<lb/>read, followed me to my pillow, and in my dreams; and when
<lb/>the <name>Sabbath</name> morning interposed betwixt me and the still unfin­
<lb/>ished history, I stole away to the drawer where it was deposited,
<lb/>to gaze upon the cover of the leaves which I dared not open.
<lb/>I have since wondered that I did resist the temptation of doing
<lb/>so—it was an instance of juvenile self-control, that might shame
<lb/>many of the weaker resolutions of my after years. Thus fresh­
<lb/>ly, and so hoarded up as treasures, do the memories of infancy
<lb/>come back upon the heart in after years, yet <emph>then</emph>, when the
<lb/>world itself seems but little more than a visionary creation of
<lb/>romance, we look forward to the <emph>coming</emph> hours of life, as those
<lb/>which are the storehouses of life's richest pleasures;—and this,
<lb/>in despite of all that is said of the unshadowed bliss of our in­

<lb/>envy the happiness of childhood, there are but few who would

        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">This</hi> has been said to be the predominant feeling of all hearts,
<lb/>mingling with the best and noblest traits of character, and the
<lb/>main-spring of all our virtues. We love our country and our

<lb/>but a species of refined selfishness.</p>
        <p>But however true it may be, that the practice of the gener­
<lb/>ous virtues is productive of happiness to ourselves, in a pro­

<lb/>portion equal to that which it may be the means of bestowing
<lb/>upon others, yet the feelings which invite their possessors
<lb/>to such a course of action are very different from the sordid
<lb/>egotism to which we are accustomed to apply the name of
<lb/>selfishness.</p>
        <p>That this principle does frequently influence our conduct to
<lb/>a degree of which we are ourselves conscious, must be admitted;
<lb/>but it is extremely wrong to suffer our exertions in behalf of
<lb/>our fellow-creatures, to be limited in their extent, by this feeling.
<lb/>But we cannot do this, without openly violating our express
<lb/>duties. We were not intended to live solely for ourselves, even
<lb/>if it were possible for all our hopes and wishes to be thus con­
<lb/>centred; nor can we serve one Divine Master as we ought,
<lb/>while we are regardless of the happiness of one human being;
<lb/>and to know of the existence of misery, should even be suffi­
<lb/>cient to call forth our instant exertions for its relief. It is not
<lb/>the least among the blessings with which we have been favour­
<lb/>ed by a kind of Providence, that we should have so strong an in­
<lb/>centive to good deeds in the knowledge that they bring to our feel­
<lb/>ings. The gifts of God are a double blessing, because they
<lb/>are not only the source of happiness to ourselves, but impart
<lb/>to us the higher privilege of bestowing it upon others.</p>
        <p>But it must not be supposed that the offered boon is one which
<lb/>we are permitted to receive or decline, at pleasure. When we
<lb/>neglect to employ the means with which we have been thus fa­
<lb/>voured, even though it should amount to no more than the pos­
<lb/>session of <soCalled rend="pre(“)post(”)">one talent,</soCalled> we become unworthy of the goodness
<lb/>of our Creator, and deserve to be deprived of that which we
<lb/>have as a just reward, for the selfishness with which we have
<lb/>suffered our hearts to be corroded. Is it not well then, when
<lb/>we sum up the blessings by which we are ourselves surrounded,
<lb/>to enquire of our hearts how much we have done to alleviate
<lb/>the distresses and calamities of others? Nay, even though we
<lb/>ourselves are miserable, cannot we contribute something to
<lb/>lessen the unhappiness of others? Undoubtedly we may, and
<lb/>ought, to the utmost of our power, do so. When we, there­
<lb/>fore, take a survey of the world as it exists around us, and ex­
<lb/>amine the various forms of wretchedness that we behold, what

<pb n="68"/>

<lb/>do we find most forcibly to claim the interference of our bene­
<lb/>volent energies? Is there not one word, one name, that con­
<lb/>centrates in itself all our ideas of degradation and misery? and
<lb/>that name men have given to the being whom they have made
<lb/>the lowest and vilest in the scale of human existence. That
<lb/>word is slavery—that being is the slave! Some calamities
<lb/>with which the human race are afflicted, appear to be the par­
<lb/>ticular visitation of God; but this has its origin wholly in the
<lb/>wickedness of man. To the extirpation of this great evil, should
<lb/>be given the prayers and the sympathy of every heart—the
<lb/>aid of every hand. We are not to confine our views only to
<lb/>alleviating the temporal condition of the slave; his moral and
<lb/>intellectual elevation is an object of tenfold more importance,
<lb/>but his emancipation must be first accomplished, for till then,
<lb/>these cannot be effectually secured. The possibility of the sub­
<lb/>ject being one which can excite no interest in our bosoms,
<lb/>should not be allowed to have the least weight in determining
<lb/>our conduct. We are not to consider whether our exertions in
<lb/>behalf of suffering humanity will be productive of gratification
<lb/>to our own selfish feelings, but whether we shall not disobey
<lb/>the reiterated commands of God by withholding them.</p>

<lb/>reflect on the enormities that are combined in this system of
<lb/>slavery.</p>
        <p>There are many among us who are alike ignorant and care­
<lb/>less of the guilt and the wretchedness, which they are thought­
<lb/>lessly or unconsciously assisting to support. These should be
<lb/>aroused from their torpid insensibility; they should be remind­
<lb/>ed that their boasted banner of freedom waves over thousands
<lb/>of degraded slaves—that while they bear the name, and profess
<lb/>the principles, of <name>Christians</name>, they are openly nourishing in­
<lb/>justice—that the stain of blood-guiltiness and oppression is upon
<lb/>their land, and that each of them is in some degree responsi­
<lb/>ble for her crimes, unless they lift up their voice against them.</p>
        <p>We know that there are many among our own sex, who
<lb/>are sincerely averse to slavery, and who deeply commiserate
<lb/>the condition of those who are suffering beneath its op­
<lb/>pression;—why then will they not decisively attempt some­
<lb/>thing for the relief of its victims? Are these ladies impressed
<lb/>with the belief that their utmost exertions would be unavailing?
<lb/>We can only entreat them at least to make a trial of them;
<lb/>and if they do fail, it will not be without the satisfaction of
<lb/>knowing that they have done what they could, to promote the
<lb/>welfare of their fellow-creatures, and that though in the sight of
<lb/>men their efforts may have been wasted, there is <mcr rend="case(smallcaps)">One</mcr> eye that
<lb/>has looked upon them approvingly. But much the greater de­
<lb/>gree of probability is on the side of their success—gradual it
<lb/>may be,—perhaps almost imperceptible in its immediate effects,
<lb/>but not the less productive of certain benefit. The moral feel­
<lb/>ing of our country requires renovation. She is hard of heart
<lb/>and tyrannical, while she fancies herself humane and gene­
<lb/>rous. With one hand she displays to the nations of the earth
<lb/>her ensigns of liberty and justice, with the other she presses
<lb/>the brow of humanity to the dust. To instil juster sentiments
<lb/>into the minds of those who are to be the future guardians of
<lb/>her welfare, her statesmen and her counsellors, should be the
<lb/>task of woman. But to effect this, her own feelings must be
<lb/>warmly and generally interested in the cause of emancipation:
<lb/>there must be a unison of purpose and sentiment, which cannot
<lb/>be attained but by means of associations. Opposition to
<lb/>slavery can be rendered popular and general by no other me­
<lb/>thod; and whether they are intended for the support of free
<lb/>labour, or for the circulation of such sentiments as may give a

<lb/>right tone to public opinion on the subject of slavery, or, what

<lb/>are calculated to be of essential service to the cause they ad­
<lb/>vocate. They give the supporters of that cause an opportunity
<lb/>of numbering their friends—they are an evidence that the
<lb/>opinions expressed are not merely the effervescence of excited
<lb/>feeling in scattered individuals, and that the members of them
<lb/>are willing to labour for the extermination of the evil of which
<lb/>they disapprove; while many, with whom the impulses of
<lb/>what they may, perhaps, consider a doubtful duty, would be
<lb/>too weak a spring to invite them to action, might be led by the

<lb/>necessary. She has been said to divide the palm of poetic
<lb/>merit with <persName>Miss Landon</persName>; but while we would detract nothing
<lb/>from the excellence of the younger rival, we believe there are
<lb/>few who do not turn with pleasure from the noonday bright­
<lb/>ness of her page—the scorching breath of woman's blighted
<lb/>heart, and the dazzling splendour of chivalric tournament, to
<lb/>the gentle pensiveness of the moonlight genius of <persName>Hemans</persName>.
<lb/>Her name, amid those of the sister votaries of the muse, is like
<lb/>the star <name>Lyræ</name> amid the constellation from which it derives its

        <p>We confess the remarks do not so well apply to the volume
<lb/>which we intend particularly to notice at present, as to some
<lb/>of her other productions. Yet, from its title, the <title rend="pre(“)post(”)">Records of
<lb/>Women</title> should have been one of the best among them; for in
<lb/>what should female genius be supposed capable of excelling,
<lb/>if not in dwelling proudly on the exalted merits of her own
<lb/>sex, or extracting from their heart's chords all their hidden
<lb/>melody, to pour in a flood of inspiration over her page? It is

<lb/>true, there are many beautiful passages scattered throughout
<lb/>the volume—as we intend presently to show—but they are fre­
<lb/>quently weakened by repetition, and by the ideas being too
<lb/>much diffused. <title rend="pre(“)post(”)"><persName>Arabella Stewart</persName>,</title> the first and longest piece
<lb/>in the volume, together with the above faults, contains some
<lb/>extremely fine passages. <persName>Mrs. <choice><abbr>H.</abbr><expan>Hemans</expan></choice></persName>, after a short narrative of
<lb/>the history of the heroine, says the poem is <quote>meant as some
<lb/>record of her fate, and the imagined fluctuation of her thoughts
<lb/>and feelings</quote> during her imprisonment and separation from
<lb/>her husband.—It is supposed to commence while she is yet

<quote rend="pre(“)post(”)indent(2)"><lg type="poem" subtype="indeterminate"><l rend="indent(4)">Fostering for his sake</l><l>A quenchless hope of happiness to be;</l><l>And, feeling still, her woman spirit strong</l><l>In the deep faith that lifts from earthly wrong</l><l>A heavenward glare,</l></lg></quote>—

<lb/>and before a fruitless effort to escape had quenched the bright
<lb/>lamp of reason. The following lines pourtray very finely the
<lb/>buoyant spirit of youthful hope, and the rich, deep feelings of
<lb/>womanly affection:—

<quote rend="pre(“)post(”)indent(2)"><lg type="poem" subtype="indeterminate"><l>I bear, I strive, I bow not to the dust,</l><l>That I may bring thee back no faded form,</l><l>No bosom chill'd and blighted—</l><l>And thou art, too, in bonds! yet droop thou not,</l><l>Oh, my beloved! there is <emph>one</emph> hopeless lot,</l><l>and that not ours.</l></lg></quote>

<lb/>Again, after measures had been secretly taken for her escaping
<lb/>and rejoining <persName>Seymour</persName>—her husband—she exclaims—

<quote rend="pre(“)post(”)indent(2)"><lg type="poem" subtype="indeterminate"><l>We shall meet soon—to think of such an hour!</l><l>Will not my heart, o'erburden'd with its bliss,</l><l>Faint and give way beneath me, <emph>as a flower</emph></l><l><emph>Borne down and perishing by noontide's kiss!</emph></l></lg></quote></p>

        <p>The simile which ends the verse, we think uncommonly
<lb/>beautiful. She succeeded in making her escape, but was un­
<lb/>fortunately discovered, and conducted back into captivity.
<lb/>The ensuing passage is finely expressive of the total blight of
<lb/>her heart after this event:

<quote rend="pre(“)post(”)indent(2)"><lg type="poem" subtype="indeterminate"><l rend="indent(5)">Oh, never in the worth</l><l>Of its pure cause, let sorrowing love on earth</l><l>Trust fondly—never more!—the hope is crush'd</l><l>That lit my life, the voices within me hush'd,</l><l>That spoke sweet oracles—and I return</l><l>To lay my youth as in a burial urn,</l><l>Where sunshine may not find it.</l></lg></quote>—</p>
        <p>The above passages we think some of the most beautiful in
<lb/>the book:—and they are beautiful. There are others, perhaps,
<lb/>equally so, and some that are vastly inferior—but with these
<lb/>we will have nothing to do. We wish to extract only such as
<lb/>may be read again and again without weariness:—but the
<lb/>volume which can produce such passages is certainly worth a
<lb/>perusal throughout, even if a considerable portion of its con­
<lb/>tents does fall below their standard. Passing over several
<lb/>shorter pieces, we come to <title><persName>Properzia Rossi</persName>.</title> This poem is
<lb/>more spiritual throughout, and is not so long as the first men­
<lb/>tioned. It is in many parts equally beautiful, though of a dif­
<lb/>ferent character. The heroine—a sculptor—is supposed to
<lb/>be engaged on her last work, a statue of <persName>Ariadne</persName>:

<quote rend="pre(“)post(”)indent(2)"><lg type="poem" subtype="indeterminate"><l rend="indent(4)">The bright work grows</l><l>Beneath my hand, unfolding, as a rose,</l><l>Leaf after leaf to beauty; line by line,</l><l>I fix my thought, heart, soul, to burn, to shine</l><l>Through the pale marble's veins—it grows, and now</l><l>I give my own life's history to thy brow,</l><l>Forsaken <persName>Ariadne</persName>! thou shalt wear</l><l>My form, my lineaments; but oh, more fair!</l><l>Touch'd into lovelier being by the glow</l><l>Which in me dwells, as by the summer's light</l><l>All things are glorified.</l></lg></quote>

<lb/>After describing the blight in her heart, she adds—

<quote rend="pre(“)post(”)indent(2)"><lg type="poem" subtype="indeterminate"><l rend="indent(4)">Yet the world will see</l><l>Little of this, my parting work, in thee—</l><pb n="73"/><milestone unit="sig" n="G1r"/><mw type="pageNum">73</mw><l>Thou shalt have fame!

        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">I</hi> waked from my first slumber in <placeName>Pennsdale</placeName>, on a bright
<lb/><name>Sabbath</name> morning—or, in the phraseology of my uncle's fam­
<lb/>ily, <name>First-day</name>—and after breakfast, prepared for a three or four
<lb/>miles' ride to meeting. The usual distance was this day to be
<lb/>somewhat lengthened, in order to attend a funeral—that of an
<lb/>aged man, one of the patriarchs of <placeName>Pennsdale</placeName>. I had long
<lb/>known him by name, for he had been throughout the course of
<lb/>a long life the most intimate friend of my grandfather; and it
<lb/>was not without a feeling of saddened interest, that I listened,
<lb/>as we rode slowly up the lane towards the house, to a short
<lb/>account of his life and character from the lips of my uncle.—
<lb/>He concluded with saying—<said>Yet though few men have been
<lb/>more generally regarded with a feeling of affectionate venera­
<lb/>tion, his death will not be very bitterly lamented. It was not
<lb/>one of those which afflict the heart of the survivor alike with
<lb/>grief and terror; he had outlived most of the friends of his
<lb/>youth, and had long been like a ripened sheaf waiting for the
<lb/>harvester.</said></p>
        <p>In a few moments, I was standing by the coffin. The face

<lb/>before me was deeply furrowed with the lines of age, but the
<lb/>expression it still wore was so calm, so peaceful, so full of be­
<lb/>nevolence, that I felt I could have dearly loved him; and the
<lb/>tears almost started to my eyes at the thought that he could
<lb/>not now bestow on me one look of kindness.</p>
        <p>His son, a man considerably advanced in years, was seated
<lb/>by the head of the coffin. His face was sorrowful, but calm
<lb/>and perfectly resigned. The grand-children of the deceased
<lb/>were seated near him, but though the tears fell fast and almost
<lb/>unconsciously from many of their eyes, they were rather the
<lb/>tears of tenderness than of deep affliction;—called forth by
<lb/>the memory of all the happy hours they had spent by his
<lb/>side, or seated on his knee, and the thought of all his gentle
<lb/>words of admonition and affection.</p>
        <p>The coffin was at length closed, and placed in the simple
<lb/>hearse, and the procession moved forward. The meeting-house
<lb/>of <placeName>Pennsdale</placeName> was situated in a still, secluded spot, and was
<lb/>completely embowered by large forest trees, while the ground
<lb/>on all sides rose from it in a gentle slope, seeming almost to
<lb/>shut it out from the world, and from all sights save the azure
<lb/>of the heavens and the universal green of the earth. It was
<lb/>an old stone building, and very small, and as plainly construct­
<lb/>ed as possible. Behind it was the grave-yard;—enclosed by
<lb/>low stone walls, and shaded all round by immense elms, though
<lb/>none were suffered to intrude within its limits. I was scarcely
<lb/>ever more surprised than on entering it. The Quaker burial
<lb/>places in general—I have been in many of them—present
<lb/>nothing but an undulated surface of verdure. But here every
<lb/>grave had its memorial—rose bushes planted at the head and
<lb/>foot, entwining their branches and scattering their perfume,
<lb/>and their luxuriant branches over the remains of the beloved
<lb/>ones—sometimes half hiding from view a simple tablet of wood
<lb/>or marble. The sweet-briar and wild honeysuckle almost
<lb/>covered the walls, filling the air with their fragrance—while
<lb/>the song of the woodland bird and the ceaseless hum of the
<lb/>honey-bee went up for hymn and requiem.</p>
        <p>We gathered round the open grave, and there was a deep
<lb/>silence—silence in the heart as well as in the outward world.
<lb/>Most of those who were assembled there, remembered well the
<lb/>face that was now to be seen of them no more; and while
<lb/>their thoughts wandered over the scenes of his past life, they

<lb/>could not fail to return to their bosoms strengthened and puri­
<lb/>fied. A few solemn words were spoken, and then that form
<lb/>was shut from them on earth forever.</p>
        <p>We retired into the meeting-house.—There was one seat
<lb/>left vacant—one that had seldom been so, even amid summer's
<lb/>heat or winter's storms, for upwards of thirty years past.
<lb/>The time of worship passed over in silence, but the faces of
<lb/>those about me became gradually lightened, and when it was
<lb/>concluded, the usual friendly greetings were interchanged and
<lb/>kindly words spoken, by voices that were indeed more serious
<lb/>than their accustomed tone, but from hearts that were peaceful
<lb/>and happy.</p>

        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">As</hi> the increased expense, incurred by making use of the
<lb/>productions of free labour, is often among the reasons assign­
<lb/>ed for neglect of that method of opposition to Slavery, it may
<lb/>perhaps be well to examine how far such an objection is en­
<lb/>titled to consideration. For our own part, we do not think it
<lb/>should be allowed the least weight in determining our conduct.
<lb/>We do not conceive that it is any more excusable to make use
<lb/>of slave-wrought articles, on account of their cheapness, than
<lb/>we have to indulge in whatever else may please our fancy, at
<lb/>the expense of the unpaid creditor. Yet, as a close attention
<lb/>to household economy is certainly the duty of every female,
<lb/>let us enquire if it is not possible to indulge their feelings of
<lb/>humanity, and satisfy the claims of justice, without extending
<lb/>the limits they have prescribed for their expenses. The differ­
<lb/>ence in the price of the articles, though trifling, may still,
<lb/>when the income of a family is barely sufficient to cover its
<lb/>expenses, deserve to be taken into account. But if the express­
<lb/>ed philanthropy is sincere, if there is really a wish felt to lift
<lb/>the yoke from the neck of our enslaved countrymen, in every
<lb/>case, short of actual poverty, might the change from slave to
<lb/>free produce be made without adding one item to the expen­
<lb/>diture, or even in the least encroaching on the aggregate of
<lb/>comfort. It is but to forego some paltry gratification, to resign
<lb/>some trifle in which the vanity only is concerned, (and who
<lb/>has not such offerings to make,) and a fund is at once provided,

<lb/>sufficient for the purpose. Is it not better to eat coarse food,
<lb/>unspoiled by rapine and injustice? Is it not better to wear a
<lb/>plain garb, than to be pranked out in delicate or fashionable
<lb/>array, which has been won by oppression? Surely it is! and
<lb/>if the importance of the subject was more frequently and care­
<lb/>fully examined, we believe there are many who would be not
<lb/>unwilling to give such a proof of their devotion to the cause of
<lb/>emancipation.</p>

        <p>Such were the opinions entertained with regard to slavery,
<lb/>at the commencement of this horrible traffic, which has since
<lb/>poured out such an ocean of innocent blood. Opinions express­

<lb/>the free, the liberal, and the enlightened of the earth. The
<lb/>foreign Slave-trade has, it is true, been abolished—has been
<lb/>declared piracy. But our country still clings to the guilt, of
<lb/>which, in the face of the world, she has, by that act, openly
<lb/>avowed her conviction; and the domestic traffic in human
<lb/>flesh, is still unforbidden. The dark shadow of the slave ves­
<lb/>sel yet lies upon our bright rivers, and the long shriek of hearts
<lb/>in their mortal agony, rises on the ear, as the brutal driver
<lb/>hurries before him his brother herd, and the dearest natural ties
<lb/>are parted forever.</p>
        <p>Strange inconsistency! that we should foster at home, what
<lb/>we denounce as deadly iniquity abroad! As if the American
<lb/>air, hostile to every finer feeling, had deadened all kindly emo­
<lb/>tions, as well in the bosom of the slave as of his tyrant, and
<lb/>their ties of home, of kindred, and of friends, were no longer
<lb/>worthy a regardful thought. True, the ravage of fertile plains,
<lb/>the glare of burning villages, and the horrors attendant upon
<lb/>the <soCalled rend="pre(“)post(”)">middle passage,</soCalled> are no longer sanctioned. But what then?
<lb/>are we to consider the evil abolished, because an attempt has
<lb/>been made to confine it to our own door? Do fetters cease to
<lb/>gall when they are worn beneath an American sun; or does a
<lb/>breaking heart agonize less when its cords are, one by one,
<lb/>torn away, that it must more slowly sink to death, than when
<lb/>a fierce grasp has severed them at once, and it bursts with its
<lb/>first throb of unendurable anguish?</p>
        <p>Oh, if we would but teach ourselves to reflect! If we would
<lb/>think on all the hearts that so bleed and die beneath the torn
<lb/>fibres of affection—on all the misery that is daily endured—
<lb/>on all the guilt that is incurred—if we would picture to our­
<lb/>selves the infant, wrenched shrieking from the clinging arms
<lb/>of its mother—the wretched wife, torn away in her frantic grief,
<lb/>from the last embrace of her purchased husband—brethren and

        <head>The Enfranchisement.</head>
        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">It</hi> was a pretty-looking cottage—with its roof half covered
<lb/>with the boughs of a great tree, and vines creeping up about
<lb/>the doors and windows. The garden, with its gay flowers,
<lb/>tempting berries, and fine vegetables, was almost without a
<lb/>weed; while the paling that surrounded both that and the grass-
<lb/>plot, in front of the house, fairly glistened with its fresh cover­
<lb/>ing of white-wash.</p>
        <p>The old woman was seated in a large arm-chair, just out­
<lb/>side of the door. Her countenance was one of the finest I
<lb/>have ever seen. She had probably past seventy summers, but
<lb/>her brow yet remained as dark as the still brilliant eye over
<lb/>which it was arched. The lines of age were distinctly, but not
<lb/>deeply traced upon her cheek and forehead; and her mouth
<lb/>and chin, though wearing them much more visibly than her
<lb/>other features, retained their characteristic marks of firmness
<lb/>and dignity. Her whole face was beaming with mingled bene­
<lb/>volence, gratitude, and devotion. By her side was sitting a
<lb/>little dark-faced urchin of some half dozen years—and grouped
<lb/>round them, either seated on the grass, or on a long bench be­
<lb/>neath the tree, several other descendants of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, whose hap­
<lb/>py faces, glowing with intelligence and feeling, spoke nothing
<lb/>of that consciousness of abasement and degradation, which is
<lb/>so often written upon the countenances of their race.</p>
        <p>Shall I tell you the history of that group? It is a tale of
<lb/>female generosity, and negro gratitude.</p>
        <p>That woman—she in the elbow-chair, with the open bible
<lb/>upon her knee—was a native, and till within these few years
<lb/>a resident, of <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>. Her husband was an owner of slaves
<lb/>—her father had been—and in her youth she thought but little
<lb/>of the sinfulness of laying unrighteous hands upon the property
<lb/>of God. But when the gentle creatures that called her
<lb/><mentioned rend="pre(“)post(”)">mother,</mentioned> gathered about her with their loving eyes, and she
<lb/>listened to their soft voices in the evening twilight, she felt how
<lb/>wretched would be <emph>her</emph> lot, if it were in the power of man's
<lb/>hand to tear them from her arms forever; and she thought of
<lb/>them, and commiserated the condition of the miserable slave.
<lb/>At first it was compassion only that led her to sympathise with

<pb n="79"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">79</mw>

<lb/>their unhappy fate; but the conviction soon came to her heart,
<lb/>that slavery was unjustifiable wickedness in the sight of the
<lb/>Almighty. She entreated her husband, almost with the earnest­
<lb/>ness of one beseeching for her own life, to liberate their slaves.
<lb/>He refused—and she wept secretly and in silence—but by every
<lb/>means in her power she strove with tireless perseverance to
<lb/>alleviate the bitterness of their lot. She was their instructor,
<lb/>their friend, their benefactress, moving about among them more
<lb/>like a parent than a mistress, preserving their respect by the
<lb/>quiet dignity of her manner, and winning their enthusiastic
<lb/>gratitude and love, by her kindness and affection.</p>
        <p>When her husband died, they were distributed among their
<lb/>children, who had all married, and left the paternal roof. Again
<lb/>she renewed her solicitations for the freedom of those objects
<lb/>of her care—and again she was repulsed—ay, even by her
<lb/>own children was her prayer refused to be granted. She did
<lb/>not stoop to remonstrance, but her resolution was taken—and
<lb/>great as was the sacrifice, she accomplished the holy purpose of
<lb/>her heart. She purchased those slaves, from the oldest to the
<lb/>youngest—she accompanied them here, to <placeName>Ohio</placeName>, where she
<lb/>might bestow on them the blessing of liberty—she expended
<lb/>almost her last cent in the performance of her high deed of
<lb/>justice; and they flung themselves at her feet in an overwhelm­
<lb/>ing burst of gratitude—disenthralled—enfranchised!</p>
        <p>And they have never forgotten her kindness. She owes all
<lb/>the comforts with which she is surrounded, to their unwearying
<lb/>industry: to labour for her, to serve her, and to obey her light­
<lb/>est word, is alike their pride and their happiness—and on this
<lb/>evening they are all met together at her cottage, to celebrate
<lb/>the anniversary of their emancipation.</p>
        <p>
          <said>Is it a true story?</said>
        </p>
        <p>Why—recollect 't is summer twilight, and there is the moon,
<lb/>just rising over the tree-tops; so a little embellishment may be
<lb/>pardonable. But the circumstance of that widow having thus
<lb/>purchased and manumitted those slaves, and the story of their
<lb/>gratefully labouring for her support—is really the truth.</p>

<lb/>excited to more sedulous perseverance; while an allusion to
<lb/>the subject, in the presence of others, may open the door to an
<lb/>instructive discourse, awaken the dormant sensibilities, and
<lb/>perhaps arouse into action those who have never before had
<lb/>their attention directed to the subject. Opportunities for this
<lb/>are rarely wanting in society, and a few words so uttered may
<lb/>perhaps leave an abiding impression on a mind previously un­
<lb/>occupied by prejudices, and prepare it to receive, with attention,
<lb/>any future information relative to the system. Let not any be
<lb/>discouraged from adverting to this topic by the belief that they
<lb/>shall fail to interest their hearers; it is better to risk the mortifi­

<lb/>of using every proper exertion, in a cause where so much is
<lb/>needful in order to ensure success. Besides, where there is

<lb/>sometimes rewarded by a more than ordinary display of it;—
<lb/>or, if productive of no immediate effect, the words may be
<lb/>like bread, which, being <quote>cast upon the waters, shall be found
<lb/>after many days.</quote> If those who are now most deeply interested
<lb/>for our slave population endeavour to trace those feelings of

<lb/>as though it was parched and shrunken by extreme age; but
<lb/>the restless and uneasy wanderings of his eye told that he still
<lb/>claimed some companionship with earthly feelings.</p>
        <p>He was a slave, and for more than an hundred years he had
<lb/>gone forth to the daily toil of a bondman. It was said that in
<lb/>the <soCalled rend="pre(“)post(”)">father-land,</soCalled> from which he had been torn by unprinci­
<lb/>pled violence, he had been a prince among his people. In the
<lb/>first days of his slavery, he had been fierce and ungovernable,
<lb/>nor could his haughty spirit ever be tamed into subjection until
<lb/>it had been subdued by gratitude. The father of his present
<lb/>master had, in his childhood, by interfering to save him from
<lb/>punishment, received on his own body the blows intended for
<lb/>the slave; and from that moment he became to his youth­
<lb/>ful master a devoted servant. The child had grown up to
<lb/>manhood, flourished throughout his term of years, and faded
<lb/>away into the grave, but still the aged <name>Afric</name> lingered upon the
<lb/>earth; and it was for the son of that man that he now waited,

        <p>At length the light of the low cabin door was darkened, as

        <p>The negro raised himself up with a sudden energy, and

<lb/>you:—I am going home,—to revisit the scenes of my youth—
<lb/>to mingle with the spirits of my friends! Suffer me not to re­

<lb/>their native wilds—they sought out the lion in the midst of his
<lb/>secret recesses—they subdued the strength of the savage
<lb/>tiger—they were conquerors in battle—they never bowed to
<lb/>man—they would spurn a bondman from their halls! <emph>Oh tell
<lb/>me</emph>,</said> exclaimed he, seizing his master's hand in the rising ex­

<lb/>the sound, that I am once more free!</said></p>
        <p><said>Your wish is granted,</said> said his master, <said>you are a

<lb/>his couch, and clasping his hands above his head with all his
<lb/>remaining energy—<said>write it for me, master!</said></p>
        <p>The gentleman tore a leaf from his pocket-book, and pen­
<lb/>cilling a hasty certificate of his freedom, handed it to the slave.
<lb/>The old man lifted up his head once more, as he received it,
<lb/>and the last ray of sunlight streamed across his countenance,
<lb/>as with a strange smile he gazed upon the paper; then falling
<lb/>suddenly back, he once more repeated the name of freedom,

        <p><quote><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">He</hi> has lived long, who has lived well,</quote> was the impressive
<lb/>sentiment we lately read on a tombstone in a country burial
<lb/>place. It was twilight: a few moments earlier, the merry
<lb/>voices of <quote>the playful children just let loose</quote> from the school-
<lb/>house, that stood a few paces distant, had thrilled in the clear
<lb/>evening air over the cold gray memorials of death, but the
<lb/>place was now deserted and silent, except the hum of the wind
<lb/>through the branches of the scattered cedars. It was a time
<lb/>for serious thought; and as we stood in that place of graves,
<lb/>we gave ourselves up to the reflections it was so well calculated
<lb/>to excite. There lay the head of infancy, and the weary
<lb/>brow of the <quote>ancient of days</quote>—the arm of manly strength,
<lb/>and the flowing tresses of beauty—the pastor, amid his silent
<lb/>but inattentive congregation, not as heretofore uttering the
<lb/>monitions of the Christian law, but with a lip despoiled of all its
<lb/>eloquence.</p>
        <p>There were none among the tombstones whose inscription
<lb/>arrested our attention more forcibly than the one above men­
<lb/>tioned;—it told so much of the value of our passing moments—
<lb/>of the rich treasure of a few hours that have been crowded with
<lb/>good deeds. Who would not rather die in early youth, with
<lb/>their parting moments brightened by the consciousness of
<lb/>having been useful to their fellow-creatures, than to fritter
<lb/>away the years of a <persName>Methusaleh</persName> in vanity and nothingness?
<lb/>And yet how many of the hours of life are thus wasted! How
<lb/>many of the bitter tears of misery, which might so easily be
<lb/>wiped away, if each one were less devoted to a selfish pursuit
<lb/>after happiness, are suffered to flow on, uncared for, and unre­
<lb/>garded! The influence of Woman, in determining the amount
<lb/>of human felicity, is, perhaps, even more powerful than that

<lb/>of her brethren. <emph>They</emph> must go out, and endure the rudest
<lb/>buffetings of the world, in nerving their minds to a stern pur­
<lb/>suit of their various purposes; but she, in the sheltered bower
<lb/>of her domestic retirement, has leisure to analyse the strange
<lb/>workings of the human heart, and to instil into it high principles
<lb/>of virtue. It should never satisfy her to be a merely brilliant
<lb/>and fascinating being. Her own gratification should ever be
<lb/>to a woman only a secondary consideration; and though her
<lb/>lot may thus be one of endurance and self-denial, she will
<lb/>learn that the endeavour to secure happiness for others, will
<lb/>impart it also to her own bosom. Let her look abroad upon
<lb/>the immensity of suffering that is poured upon the hearts of
<lb/>her fellow-creatures from the vial of slavery; let her behold
<lb/>her unoffending sisters, with a bleeding heart, and too often
<lb/>with lacerated limbs, driven out to their daily labour—the
<lb/>parent torn from the embraces of the child, the wife from her
<lb/>husband, the sister from the brother: let her think how many
<lb/>of life's severest trials she would endure—sickness, abject
<lb/>poverty, nay, even death itself, rather than such a separation,
<lb/>and resolve, at once, however long her efforts may seem to be
<lb/>exerted unavailingly, in endeavouring to relax the unyielding
<lb/>hand of oppression, never for one instant to remit them, till
<lb/>her own heart is cold in death, or injustice has ceased to
<lb/>triumph.</p>

<lb/>certainly very disagreeable to be obliged so frequently to dis­
<lb/>appoint the kindness of my friends; neither is it at all pleasant
<lb/>to appear singular in one's notions, which however is not now
<lb/>greatly to be feared, since abstinence from slave articles has
<lb/>become lately quite common. But even if that was not the
<lb/>case, my reasons are, I believe, sufficiently strong to render
<lb/>singularity in this respect entirely proper, and to enable me to
<lb/>bear the imputation of it patiently.</said></p>
        <p>
          <said>But you have eaten of such things all your life, till lately,
<lb/>and never thought it wrong; and all the rest of your family
<lb/>make use of them, so that, begging your pardon, cousin <persName>Helen</persName>,
<lb/>I cannot think it otherwise than very silly for you to make
<lb/>such a fuss about it now.</said>
        </p>
        <p>
          <said>In telling me that I have made use of slave produce
<lb/>through the whole of my life until lately, you have mentioned
<lb/>an excellent reason, my dear <persName>Maria</persName>, why I should patiently
<lb/>and cheerfully endure any privations that an abstinence from
<lb/>it may impose upon me now. But because I have done wrong
<lb/>ignorantly, or because those whom I most love have not the
<lb/>same views with myself in that respect, shall I continue to sin
<lb/>against my conscience?</said>
        </p>
        <p>
          <said>I suppose you should not, if the use of slave produce
<lb/>really were wrong, or could be done without altogether;—but
<lb/>other people do not think it wrong, and why should you be
<lb/>more particular?</said>
        </p>

          <said>Shall I tell you why I think it wrong, <persName>Maria</persName>?</said>
        </p>
        <p>
          <said>Oh! now, you want to tell me some horrid story about the

<lb/>think and talk about such things.</said>
        </p>
        <p>
          <said>How, then, dear <persName>Maria</persName>, can you wonder that I should re­
<lb/>fuse to assist in <emph>creating them</emph>. It is indeed very painful to
<lb/>think upon the vast amount of suffering produced by slavery
<lb/>but not half so painful, cousin, as to assist in producing it. Do
<lb/>not imagine that I think I deserve credit for my abstinence from
<lb/>slave luxuries, or what I suppose you would call necessary
<lb/>articles. I claim none—to partake of them would be to me
<lb/>far the greater punishment. There are times when I almost
<lb/>shudder at the thought, and when I feel as if I could almost

<lb/>of the slave-grown cane! It is wonderful to me how any fe­
<lb/>male, who has even a partial knowledge of the horrors of
<lb/>slavery, can be willing to support such a system, or can receive
<lb/>the least enjoyment from the indulgence in comforts and lux­
<lb/>uries which are purchased by the sacrifice of so many lives.
<lb/>We shudder to think of the immolation of human beings by
<lb/>savage nations, at the altars of their gods; but when our own
<lb/>gratification is in question, we become careless of the poured-
<lb/>out blood of thousands!</said>
        </p>
        <p>
          <said>Now you are severe, <persName>Helen</persName>! Do you think I would con­
<lb/>tinue to use slave produce, especially when I could avoid doing
<lb/>so by any means, if I thought all I made use of would occasion
<lb/>the loss of life to any human being?</said>
        </p>
        <p>
          <said>Yet you must acknowledge, <persName>Maria</persName>, for I believe you are
<lb/>aware of the fact, that, even excluding those who have sunk
<lb/>under the pressure of long continued toil and hardships, the
<lb/>number of the miserable beings who have been deprived of
<lb/>their lives by actual violence is immense. And the cause of
<lb/>slavery, and all its attendant ills, can only be found in the prof­
<lb/>its of its extorted labour.</said>
        </p>
        <p>
          <said>But, cousin, all the slave produce I should use in the whole
<lb/>course of my life would make no difference in the number of
<lb/>slaves. Abstinence would only punish myself, without any
<lb/>benefit to those you compassionate.</said>
        </p>
        <p>
          <said>The articles you make use of cannot be produced without
<lb/><emph>some</emph> time and labour, be the quantity what it may. Allowing
<lb/>the labour of a slave for six or twelve years to produce all the
<lb/>various slave-grown products which you may use during the
<lb/>course of your life, would not he who was so occupied be in
<lb/>effect <emph>your slave</emph>, during the time he was thus employed? Do
<lb/>you not receive as much benefit from his oppression as the in­
<lb/>dividual who is his nominal owner, but in fact, for that length
<lb/>of time, only your agent? Nor will the circumstances of this
<lb/>portion of labour, being divided among many persons, create
<lb/>any difference. You must excuse me for considering that for
<lb/>the time that is necessary to produce the articles you consume,
<lb/>you are a slave-holder; or that you are doing worse, by paying
<lb/>another for the commission of a crime which you would not
<lb/>dare to commit yourself!</said>

        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">It</hi> appears to be considered no small grievance by some of
<lb/>our gentle sisters, that the subject of slavery should so fre­
<lb/>quently be forced before their attention by the friends of Eman­
<lb/>cipation. They complain that it is but little short of persecution
<lb/>or slavery in itself, to be so frequently obliged to endure re­
<lb/>monstrances on their inactivity, to be so perpetually called upon
<lb/>for their aid and sympathy, or so often reminded of what, they
<lb/>are told, is their duty.</p>
        <p>To us, this extreme sensitiveness seems not to belong to con­
<lb/>sciences so wholly untouched by the subject as they would be
<lb/>willing to appear. Persons are not usually disturbed at the
<lb/>approach of what is totally indifferent to them. We should
<lb/>rather suppose that their irritations proceeded, perhaps truly
<lb/>unconsciously, from a fear that such troublesome interference
<lb/>might dissipate the slumbers, which they have been at some
<lb/>pains to force upon a sense of duties which it might be trouble­
<lb/>some to perform. Yet, if they were really as indifferent as
<lb/>they would persuade themselves they have a right to be, that
<lb/>would not be a sufficient reason why the voice of remonstrance
<lb/>should be silenced. Were it a subject that concerned only the
<lb/>personal gratification of the pleaders, then indeed their friends
<lb/>might justly complain if they were wearied with importunity.
<lb/>But this is not the case. Opposition to slavery is not a theme to
<lb/>be taken up merely in compliance with a prevailing fashion, or
<lb/>an individual taste or inclination. It is a question which con­
<lb/>cerns the vital interests of millions of human beings—of thou­
<lb/>sands—of hundreds of thousands of our own sex; and those

<lb/>of us who feel that the influence of woman must and will be
<lb/>felt in its discussion, have a right to demand that it should be
<lb/>examined patiently. What! are we to behold our fellow-crea­
<lb/>tures suffering and oppressed—must we see, as it were, tears of
<lb/>blood wrung out, drop by drop, from the crushed hearts of our
<lb/>sisters, and yet stifle the indignant agony of our own bosoms,
<lb/>and fear to lift up our voices in their behalf, because you have
<lb/>grown weary of the harrowing tale of their anguish? Shall
<lb/>we smother the convictions of conscience, and silence the
<lb/>promptings of humanity, rather than intrude a disagreeable
<lb/>theme upon your ear? And turning to the helpless beings
<lb/>whose cause our God and our religion command us to plead
<lb/>as earnestly as if it were our own, shall we tell them, as the
<lb/>dim eye is lifted towards us in passionate supplication, that we
<lb/>are conscious our united efforts would release them from their
<lb/>soul-destroying bonds, but that you are wearied of the subject,
<lb/>and we like not to press it upon your attention! Would you
<lb/>not condemn, as a heartless wretch, the individual who could
<lb/>act thus by one single sufferer? How much less then may we
<lb/>so betray the cause of thousands! <quote>Strike me,</quote> said the
<lb/>Athenian orator, <quote>if you will but hear me!</quote> and shall we de­
<lb/>sist to press upon your attention a subject of far greater
<lb/>moment than any merely political one that was ever agitated,
<lb/>because you have grown impatient of the often repeated topic?
<lb/>No! we must still again and again present it before you. We
<lb/>must not cease to assail you with our importunity till weariness
<lb/>is changed into interested and active compassion. If your
<lb/>hearts turn sickening away from the thought of so much
<lb/>wretchedness, reflect, then, that no exertions, no sacrifices of
<lb/>yours can be too great, that have for their object the alleviation
<lb/>of the lot of those who are actually groaning under its en­
<lb/>durance. Even though you may not be certain of success, it
<lb/>is worth while, at least, to endeavour to do good; and should
<lb/>your efforts fall short of their desired end, you will be amply
<lb/>rewarded for them in the satisfaction of having done what you
<lb/>could, and in the consciousness that your brothers' blood will
<lb/>never lie with a burning weight upon your souls.</p>

        <head>Reasons for Flogging the Slaves.</head>
        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">To</hi> those whose humane feelings have not been utterly de­
<lb/>based, the afflictions of suffering nature, when the heart is
<lb/>bereaved of the dearest objects of its affection, appeal with an
<lb/>irresistible claim for compassion and sympathy. Who will not
<lb/>say that the heart must be dead to even the most common feel­
<lb/>ings of humanity, ere it can witness without some softening,
<lb/>the grief of an affectionate child for the loss of a beloved pa­
<lb/>rent? Who would not shudder to make the sorrows of a
<lb/>bereaved wife the object of ridicule, still less to convert the na­
<lb/>tural exhibition of her woe into an offence demanding the
<lb/>infliction of a barbarous punishment? What mother, bending
<lb/>over the cold and pale brow of her beautiful and loved, would
<lb/>not feel it an inhuman cruelty to be denied the privilege of pour­
<lb/>ing out her grief in tears and lamentations? And how still
<lb/>more barbarous would such a restriction seem to her, if instead
<lb/>of resigning her darling in his unspotted innocence into the
<lb/>arms of God, he had been wrested from her by the hand of
<lb/>violence, and forced far and forever from her sheltering arms,
<lb/>to struggle alone beneath all the bitterness of life, and die at
<lb/>last on the bosom of ignominy? Yet such is the lot of the
<lb/>slave. Not only are all the dearest and strongest ties of her
<lb/>heart wantonly rent asunder, but the gushing forth of the natu­
<lb/>ral feelings of her affection and tenderness, are arrested with
<lb/>cruel punishment. It is criminal in a slave to sink, heart-
<lb/>broken, under oppression. The possession of the best and
<lb/>holiest feelings with which the merciful God has enriched the
<lb/>human heart, is assigned as a reason why they must be ranked
<lb/>with the stubborn brutes, and, even more unmercifully than
<lb/>they, lacerated with the horse-whip! A female writer, on the
<lb/>subject of slavery in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>, says, that a naval officer,
<lb/>who had been in the <placeName>East Indies</placeName>, was trying to prove to her,
<lb/><quote>that the negroes <emph>must</emph> be flogged;</quote> and his proof was this:
<lb/><quote>that when they lose a father, or mother, or perhaps a lover,
<lb/>they sulk, (that is, they are broken-hearted,) and then <emph>nothing
<lb/>will do but flogging them</emph>, and flogging them severely.</quote></p>
        <p>Nor is it only in the <placeName>West India Islands</placeName>, that the lash is thus
<lb/>used to silence the affecting bursts of filial or maternal sorrow.

<lb/>The broad, still, beautiful expansion of a summer landscape—
<lb/>the stealing in of the sunlight by glimpses among the trees—
<lb/>the unexpected meeting with a favourite blossom, half hidden
<lb/>among the luxuriant verdure—the sudden starting of a wild
<lb/>bird, almost from beneath your feet—the play of light and
<lb/>shade upon the surface of the gliding brook, and the ceaseless,
<lb/>glad, musical ripple of its waters—the gushing melody poured
<lb/>from a thousand throats, or the rapid and solitary warble, break­
<lb/>ing out suddenly on the stillness, and withdrawn again almost
<lb/>as soon as heard—the soft, hymn-like murmur of the honey-
<lb/>bees—and above all, the majesty of the blue, clear, bending
<lb/>sky!—from all these steals forth a spirit of calm enjoyment,
<lb/>that mingles silently with the darker thoughts of the heart, and
<lb/>removes their bitterness.

        <p>Yet there are moods of the soul, that even the ministering

<lb/>scenes of nature have been made the theatre of wrong and

<lb/>rounded by the broad evidences of omnipotent love, has persist­
<lb/>ed, unrelenting, in the selfishness of its own device.</p>
        <p>There was all the gloriousness of summer beauty round the
<lb/>little bay, in whose sleeping waters rested a small vessel, almost
<lb/>freighted for her departure. A few human beings, only, were
<lb/>to be added to her cargo, and as her spiry masts caught the first
<lb/>rays of the beaming sunlight, the frequent hoarse and brief
<lb/>command, and the ready response of the seamen, told that they
<lb/>were about to weight anchor and depart. Among those who
<lb/>approached the shore, was a household group, a mother and
<lb/>her babes, the price of whose limbs lay heaped in the coffers
<lb/>of one who called himself a <name>Christian</name>, and who were now
<lb/>about to be torn from the husband and the father forever. It
<lb/>was a Christian land; and, perchance, if the bustle of the de­
<lb/>parting vessel had not drowned its murmur, the voice of praise
<lb/>and prayer to the merciful and just God, might have been
<lb/>dimly heard floating off upon the still waters. But there was
<lb/>no one to save those unhappy beings from the grasp of unright­
<lb/>eous tyranny. The husband had been upon the beach since
<lb/>day-break, pacing the sands with a troubled step, or lying in
<lb/>moody anguish by the water's edge, covering his face from the
<lb/>breaking in of the glorious sunlight, and pleading at times with
<lb/>the omnipotent God, whom, slave as he was, he had learned to
<lb/>worship, for strength to subdue the passionate grief and indig­
<lb/>nation of his heart, and for humility patiently to endure his
<lb/>many wrongs.</p>
        <p>A little fond arm was twined about his neck, and the soft
<lb/>lip of a young child was breathing loving, but half sorrowful
<lb/>kisses all over his burning forehead.</p>
        <p>
          <said>Father! dear father! we are going! will you not come
<lb/>with us? look where my mother, and my sisters and brothers
<lb/>are waiting for you.</said>
        </p>
        <p>With a shuddering and convulsive groan the unhappy man
<lb/>arose, and lifted the frighted child to his bosom.</p>
        <p><said>Will you not go with us, father?</said> repeated the boy: but
<lb/>the slave made him no answer, except by straining him to his
<lb/>bosom with a short bitter laugh, and imprinting one of his sob­
<lb/>bing kisses upon his cheek. With a convulsive effort for the
<lb/>mastery, he subdued the workings of his features, and with a
<lb/>seemingly calm voice and countenance, approached his children.
<lb/>One by one he folded them in his arms, and, breathing over

<lb/>them a prayer and a blessing, gave them up forever. Then
<lb/>once more he strove to nerve his heart for its severest trial.—
<lb/>There was one more parting;—one more sad embrace to be
<lb/>given and returned.—There stood the mother of his children
<lb/>—his own fond and gentle wife, who had been for so many
<lb/>years his heart's dearest blessing; and who, ere one short hour
<lb/>had passed, was to be to him as if the sea had swallowed her
<lb/>up in its waves, or the dark gloomy earth had hidden her be­
<lb/>neath its bosom! A thousand recollections and agonizing feel­
<lb/>ings came rushing at once upon his heart, and he stood gazing
<lb/>on her, seemingly bewildered and stupified, motionless as a 
<lb/>statue, and with features to which the very intensity of his pas­
<lb/>sion gave the immobility of marble; till suddenly flinging up
<lb/>his arms with a wild cry, he dropped at once senseless to the
<lb/>earth, with the blood gushing in torrents from his mouth and
<lb/>nostrils. And the miserable wife, amid the shrieks of her de­
<lb/>spair, was hurried on board the vessel, and borne away from
<lb/>him, over the calm, sleeping, and beautiful sea, forever.  <anchor xml:id="a01" corresp="#n01" rend="pre(*)"/></p>

<lb/>We behold her, day by day, with a patience and perseverance

<lb/>ship, we behold her endeavouring to instil into their minds les­
<lb/>sons of moral and intellectual brightness—watching with affec­

<lb/>and seeking to turn their minds to the source from which she
<lb/>herself sought direction and assistance in her arduous task.
<lb/>With what affectionate interest does she speak of them!—the
<lb/>portals of her heart were not rudely barred against them because
<lb/>their brows were darker than her own! Then came the closing
<lb/>scene. It is ever an awful thing to die, yet there are times
<lb/>and circumstances by which even a death-bed may be illumined

<lb/>ing in their soft influences; and the heart even of the <name>Chris­

<lb/>when light is thus gleaming in at both its portals. But to be

        <p>There seems to be prevalent, a strange opinion, that it is in­
<lb/>cumbent upon none to become advocates for the rights of hu­
<lb/>manity, in the persons of the enslaved <name>Africans</name>, but those who
<lb/>have received an especial intimation of their duty in that re­

<lb/>its foundation and support, may be freely partaken of by all

<lb/>might not be gainsayed. In other things we listen to the tones
<lb/>of reason, we seek her guidance to the gate of conscience, and ask
<lb/>her interpretation of the hidden responses of the bosom oracle.
<lb/>Shall we not then, in like manner, expect to be enlightened in
<lb/>this matter, by a patient investigation and search after know­
<lb/>ledge? We know that many persons have been called from
<lb/>a life of sin and disobedience, by the terrible voice of God,
<lb/>sounding like a clear trumpet-note to the innermost recesses of
<lb/>their bosoms. But who would therefore be so mad, as to sup­

<lb/>until an irresistible summons comes to turn us from our path,
<lb/>as to <persName>Saul</persName> of <placeName>Tarsus</placeName>, at the broad noon-day? So neither have
<lb/>we any reason to believe, that a particular revelation will be
<lb/>vouchsafed to us with regard to our conduct here. If the sys­
<lb/>tem is repugnant to the known general laws of religion and
<lb/>morality; if it is contrary to the written commands of God,
<lb/>and to those which are whispered, in the heart's silent hour, to
<lb/>the spiritual ear, then we know of a truth it must be wicked­
<lb/>ness; and it follows, as a natural and inevitable consequence,
<lb/>that we are called upon to lend our influence to its destruction,
<lb/>and that we cannot innocently in any way be partakers therein.
<lb/>We know that the enslaved negroes are human beings;—our

<lb/>to fear to enter lightly and with unconsecrated foot upon a field
<lb/>which presents a work of such magnitude, that God's own
<lb/>hand seems only competent to the completion of the task.

<lb/>were to wear away without a consciousness of their capabilities
<lb/>of mind, without knowledge, without thought, without religion.
<lb/>And yet these beings were men! men upon whom a merciful
<lb/>Creator had bestowed the boon of an immortal nature; whose
<lb/>souls had been kindled from the same spark as that which gave
<lb/>animation to the haughty forms of their oppressors. They were
<lb/>human beings, and they who bought and they who sold them,
<lb/>were in form and fashion like unto themselves. Nay, they
<lb/>called upon one God as their mutual Father,—upon one
<lb/>Saviour for redemption and everlasting life. Was it strange
<lb/>that I should gaze with a sick incredulity upon the paper which
<lb/>gave evidence of such broad and heartless contempt of the

<lb/>the mention of a sale of human beings is heard by many per­
<lb/>sons with as little emotion as if they were unbreathing chattels.
<lb/>To others, the very enormity of the circumstance gives it an
<lb/>air of unreality. The reason may yield an unwilling assent
<lb/>to the facts, but the imagination turns loathing away from the
<lb/>view of so detestable a traffic, and the mind refuses to receive
<lb/>the comprehension of such a scene. To some, indeed, the ex­
<lb/>istence, at the present day, of so foul a disgrace to our country,
<lb/>is almost unknown. The abolition of the foreign slave-trade
<lb/>is conceived to have removed from slavery the most objection­
<lb/>able features, and they are not aware that piratical traders
<lb/>abroad, and regular unblushing dealers in human flesh and
<lb/>sinews in our own land, still pour out to the children of <placeName>Africa</placeName>
<lb/>a cup of intolerable cruelty.</p>
        <p>These reflections were suggested by our accidentally meeting
<lb/>the other day with a short narration of the following circum­
<lb/>stance. A gentleman who visited the prison in <placeName>Washington
<lb/>City</placeName>, found in one of the cells a negro mother and three chil­
<lb/>dren, who had been brought from <placeName>Maryland</placeName>, and were confined
<lb/>there for sale. They were offered in <soCalled rend="pre(“)post(”)">one lot,</soCalled> or for the
<lb/>accommodation of purchasers they would be parted and dis­
<lb/>posed of separately to different individuals. Upon enquiring
<lb/>more particularly into their history, the gentleman found that
<lb/>she was the mother of nine children, and the wife of a free
<lb/>man. He had toiled industriously and hard to provide for his
<lb/>family, and as they grew of an age to satisfy the rapacious
<lb/>cravings of the monster who claimed them for his prey, the
<lb/>children had been torn one by one from the sheltering arms of
<lb/>parental affection, and sold into a distant captivity. At last
<lb/>his wife, and his three only remaining ones, were snatched
<lb/>away, and he was left, in his declining years, alone and deso­
<lb/>late, to weep beside his forsaken hearth-stone.</p>
        <p>And she—to whose woman's heart had come all that weight
<lb/>of unutterable suffering—what was to be her future lot?
<lb/>Were the loving eyes that she had gazed upon so long, and
<lb/>the soft voices whose tones she had treasured up in her heart
<lb/>till they had become her world of happiness, to be seen and
<lb/>heard no more forever? Who could know the agony of her
<lb/>bereaved spirit, as she sat amid the dark loneliness of that
<lb/>damp cell! who could tell what images of despair were gather­
<lb/>ing with a horrid distinctness about her brain, as the thought

<lb/>of a still further separation came upon her soul, when the hol­

<lb/>a wild shriek she sprang forward and clasped her infants to
<lb/>her bosom as if she would have hidden them in the very centre
<lb/>of her heart from the grasp of the spoiler! And can woman
<lb/>—free, happy, cherished woman—think unmoved upon these
<lb/>things? She whose compassionate nature is moved for the
<lb/>sufferings of the lowest of the animal creation; whose sympa­
<lb/>thy may be won upon even by the passing grief of happy
<lb/>childhood! Surely she will not forget the tears shed openly
<lb/>and in secret by her victim sister under the stinging lash, over
<lb/>the unaccomplished task at hot noon-day, in the silence of the
<lb/>dark midnight, upon the faces of the doomed infants, and amid

<lb/>own hands do not, it is true, wield the blood-extorting lash, or
<lb/>rivet the fetter, but they know that it is done by others, in or­
<lb/>der to afford at the cheapest rate the luxuries which they will
<lb/>neither resign, nor make one exertion to obtain from the hands
<lb/>of freemen. They have no hesitation in branding the trafficker
<lb/>in human flesh with the stigma of shame and cruelty; but while
<lb/>they would not for the universe engage personally in the exer­

<lb/>iota of the comforts it procures for them. Is this consistency?
<lb/>Is such fastidiousness the result of humanity;—or has it not
<lb/>rather, if fairly examined, its root in mere selfishness? Their
<lb/>education has unfitted them for mingling actively in scenes of
<lb/>cruelty; they would sicken and shudder at the sight of wantonly
<lb/>shed blood, and the agonizing cries of a breaking heart would
<lb/>frighten sleep from their pillows, or were like a haunting spirit
<lb/>to their dreams. Is it so vastly meritorious, then, to consign
<lb/>to other hands what would be revolting to their feelings? Or
<lb/>may such sensibility claim its spring from the nobler principles
<lb/>of beneficence and justice, while they unhesitatingly receive
<lb/>from the hands of another, that which they have not <emph>nerve</emph>
<lb/>enough to obtain for themselves? Let them remember when
<lb/>they execrate the enormities of the slave system, that it is
<lb/>themselves who hold out the inducements for their perpetration.
<lb/>Guilty as the slave-holder may be, let them not flatter them­

<lb/>to advance in behalf of their heartless conduct, who, with the

<lb/>him in his error? Nothing, absolutely nothing, beyond the
<lb/>miserable and even criminal plea of self-convenience, or a dis­
<lb/>inclination to encounter a trivial portion of salutary self-denial!
<lb/>—And they, who can so lightly weigh their own gratification
<lb/>against the intolerable anguish of their sister's lot,—who count
<lb/>the sacrifice of a few paltry luxuries, too vast a ransom for the
<lb/>redemption of thousands and tens of thousands of their fellow-

<lb/>of our sex. One would suppose that the bare knowledge of
<lb/>the terrible price at which those cherished comforts have been
<lb/>procured, would cause a woman to turn shuddering and loath­
<lb/>ingly away as though they were infected with a taint of blood.
<lb/>And the curse of blood is upon them! Though the dark red
<lb/>stain may not be there visibly, yet the blood of all the many
<lb/>thousands of the slain, who have died amid the horrors and
<lb/>loathsomeness of the slave-ship—been hurled by capricious
<lb/>cruelty to the yawning wave, or sprang to its bosom in the
<lb/>madness of their proud despair—of those who have pined away
<lb/>to death beneath the slow tortures of a broken heart, who have
<lb/>perished beneath the tortures of inventive tyranny, or on the

<lb/>luxury and wealth in which it first originated, and by which it

<lb/>effects of slavery on those who are its victims, are too painfully
<lb/>obvious to require a portraiture. On these, therefore, we need
<lb/>not dwell, but may turn at once to their fairer, and more fortu­
<lb/>nate sisters.</p>
        <p>It is on all sides acknowledged, that the domestic circle is
<lb/>the proper sphere of woman. We do not say that her talents
<lb/>and influence should be confined within these boundaries, but
<lb/>however beneficially they may be felt abroad, if homebred use­
<lb/>fulness forms no part of her character, be her claims on our
<lb/>respect and admiration what they may, she fails of one half
<lb/>of her perfection. A knowledge of <soCalled rend="pre(‘)post(’)">household</soCalled> good is one of
<lb/>the most essential branches of female education. <quote>I will ven­
<lb/>ture to affirm,</quote> says the venerable <persName>Hannah More</persName>, <quote>that let a
<lb/>woman know what she may, yet if she knows not this, she is
<lb/>ignorant of the most indispensable, the most appropriate branch
<lb/>of female knowledge.</quote> It is not in the fair, fluttering thing of
<lb/>fashion, the beautiful wonder and admiration of the hour, lovely
<lb/>though she may be, and possibly even gifted with high attain­
<lb/>ments of mind and character, that we are to look for the
<lb/>true standard of female excellence. <quote>Ye cannot serve God
<lb/>and Mammon,</quote> is not a more undeniable allegation, than that
<lb/>woman cannot at once satisfy the demands of fashionable and
<lb/>domestic life. They are wholly incompatible with each other,
<lb/>and whatever is yielded to the importunity of the one, detracts
<lb/>from the power of satisfying the claims of the other. In de­
<lb/>ciding this destiny of our country-women in unfitting them for
<lb/>the calm pleasures of domestic life, and leading them into the
<lb/>tumultuous vortex of folly and vanity—in giving them an edu­
<lb/>cation of showy accomplishments, instead of cultivated minds,
<lb/>and well regulated tempers—in teaching them the wish to
<lb/>shine, rather than the ambition to be useful—the desire of
<lb/>wealth and expensive pleasures, rather than intellectual advance­
<lb/>ment—in leading them to prefer the uneasy excitement of a
<lb/>crowd, to the quiet enjoyment of books, retirement, and ration­
<lb/>al conversation—the flattery and admiration of the many, to
<lb/>the sober approbation of the few—in teaching them to consult
<lb/>rather their inclinations than their duty—to follow the dictates
<lb/>of fancy or caprice, instead of reflective judgment—we believe
<lb/>the slave system will be found a powerful agent. Those who
<lb/>have been accustomed from youth to the ready service of de­
<lb/>pendants, rarely acquire habits of industry and extensive use­

<lb/>fulness. The mind as well as the body sinks into habits of
<lb/>listless indolence, and is suffered to remain inactive and unoc­
<lb/>cupied, or fritters away its noble energies in the trifling excite­
<lb/>ments of vanity and fashion.—Wealth becomes of immense
<lb/>importance as the means of supporting her extravagance, and
<lb/>of rivalling or eclipsing her compeers in their love of folly:
<lb/>her responsibility, her high nature as a rational creature are almost
<lb/>forgotten or unheeded; anxious rather to outshine her equals
<lb/>in their petty distinctions of splendour and display, than to
<lb/>raise those who are beneath her to a higher standard of intel­
<lb/>lectual and moral worth, she learns to trifle away the loan of
<lb/>her existence, and to waste in selfish gratifications, the thousands
<lb/>that have been wrung with the most odious injustice from the
<lb/>hand of unrewarded toil. Thus with a heart undisciplined by
<lb/>self-control, a mind enervated by frivolous pursuits, and a
<lb/>temper accustomed to the indulgence of all its humours, how
<lb/>frail is the bark of her happiness! How imperfectly is she
<lb/>calculated to fill the station and perform the duties assigned
<lb/>her by the hand of Providence. In prosperity, a thing, it may
<lb/>be, of beauty and grace, but of unsubstantial endowments—in
<lb/>adversity without support, and without resource, and in neither
<lb/>performing the duties of a consistent <name>Christian</name>. Nor is the
<lb/>evil we speak of confined to that district to which slavery is
<lb/>limited. The frequent intercourse between the inhabitants of
<lb/>the different states, gives a ready transmission to manners and
<lb/>habits. The ladies of the north imitate those of the south, and
<lb/>a fondness for show, ornament, and extravagance, almost to the
<lb/>exclusion of a desire for the better wealth of substantial acquire­
<lb/>ments and moral excellence, invades all classes of society.</p>

        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">It</hi> is thy favourite season, Coz. The gorgeous clouds of
<lb/>sunset have almost departed, and the air has grown dim amidst
<lb/>its perfect tranquility, like a starry eye whose brightness hath
<lb/>been shadowed by the depth of a delicious feeling.—Come, let
<lb/>us go abroad, and stand upon that old bridge thou wot'st of,
<lb/>where we may watch the still shadows that lie on the smooth
<lb/>deep places of the stream, and the flashing ripples that go on
<lb/>singing to the gentle light. Or, if thou sayest, we will take
<lb/>the wood path, that leads over the scattered stones of yonder
<lb/>drawling rivulet, to where the green sod slopes away nearly to
<lb/>the water's edge from the heaped-up pile of webs, and the old
<lb/>half-burnt tree stands in its bleakness, like a solitary watcher
<lb/>in the solemn twilight. Is it not pleasant to be so together in
<lb/>the gentle hush, while indistinct shadowings of happiness come
<lb/>over the heart, like the soft dimness upon the clinquant waters?

<lb/>—and, look, friend, seest thou not yonder bright spark—the
<lb/>star thou lovest—a beautiful and lonely thing in the blue hea­
<lb/>vens, shining like a far-seen beacon, to summon all hearts to
<lb/>the gathering place of prayer! The wild-bird catches the light
<lb/>of its pale beams as he hurries homeward to his nest, and its
<lb/>first twinkling ray is the signal that

<lb/>from his day-long task of industry. Oh, there is gladness of
<lb/>spirit in the twilight hour to those who are indeed free, and
<lb/>who may eat in fearlessness of heart, amidst their band of loved
<lb/>and loving ones, the bread which they have wrung with a
<lb/>strong sinew from the earth.—What matters it that, from the
<lb/>rising to the setting of the sun, they may have bent their limbs
<lb/>to the service of another? The twilight brings them their re­
<lb/>ward, and they go onwards to their humble homes with an un­
<lb/>stooping mien, and the blessed consciousness that no hand dare
<lb/>invade the privileges of their home sanctuary. But the slave
<lb/>—how may he lift up a glad eye to yon bright messenger? A
<lb/>release from toil, if release indeed it brings him, lifts not the
<lb/>heavy yoke of servitude from off his neck, nor gives to his
<lb/>heart one delightful throb of security and happiness. He too
<lb/>may have a home, a wife, and a smiling group of young loving
<lb/>ones, yet happy amid their childish ignorance, who have been
<lb/>wont to meet his returning step with the fond name of father.
<lb/>But the threshold and the hearth-stone that he left at the early
<lb/>dawn, surrounded by faces of glad innocence, may now be
<lb/>stripped and desolate, or echo back from its solitary walls only
<lb/>the sad voice of maternal lamentation. He knows not but to­
<lb/>morrow's sun may find him a far distant wanderer, torn away
<lb/>from all the breathing affections of his bosom, and transferred
<lb/>to another master and another scene, as reckless as though his
<lb/>heart were pulseless as the unsuffering clod. May the peace­
<lb/>fulness of the pure twilight impart its tranquillity to his bosom
<lb/>—or soothe with its tender light the darkness of his fate? Will
<lb/>it teach him to forget that he is a slave?—a wronged, depised,
<lb/>degraded slave! Alas, the scar of his fetters is too deeply
<lb/>printed in his soul, and the dim air cannot cover it with its
<lb/>shadow.</p>
