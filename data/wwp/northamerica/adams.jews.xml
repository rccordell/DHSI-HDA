            <p>So denominated from the name <name>Judah</name>, as this tribe obtained

<lb/>ligious privileges; (<regMe>1 Chron. ix. 3.</regMe>) became incorporated with them,

            <p>The <name>Samaritans</name> were originally heathen colonies from differ­
<lb/>ent countries. After the king of <placeName>Assyria</placeName> had taken <placeName>Samaria</placeName>, the
<lb/>capital of the ten tribes, he removed the greatest part of the <name>Israel­
<lb/>ites</name> into <placeName>Babylon</placeName> and <placeName>Assyria</placeName>. And in order to repeople the de­
<lb/>solate country, he brought colonies from <placeName>Babylon</placeName>, <placeName>Cutha</placeName>, <placeName>Ava</placeName>,
<lb/><placeName>Hamath</placeName> and <placeName>Sepharvaim</placeName>, and established them in the cities of <placeName>Sa­
<lb/>maria</placeName> instead of those whom he had carried into captivity. These
<lb/>people being immediately after their settlement much infested
<lb/>with lions, attributed this calamity to their neglect of the tutelary
<lb/>deity of this country, and petitioned the king to send one of the cap­
<lb/>tive <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> priests to instruct them how to worship the God of
<lb/><name>Israel</name>. A priest was accordingly sent back, who took up his resi­
<lb/>dence at <placeName>Bethel</placeName>, and established the worship of the true God. Yet
<lb/>while <persName>Jehovah</persName> was feared because of his supposed influence in that
<lb/>land, the gods of the <name>Babylonians</name> and other countries had divine
<lb/>honours paid to them. This mixture of idolatry with the <rs type="properAdjective">Mosaic</rs>
<lb/>worship continued till the building of the Samaritan temple on

            <p>The grand council of the nation called the <orgName>Sanhedrim</orgName>, which
<lb/>assembled in an apartment of the temple at <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, possessed
<lb/>the power of life and death. The <name>Jews</name> styled it a hedge to the
<lb/>laws, because the members of the council had authority to interpret
<lb/>it at certain times and on certain occasions, as they thought proper.
<lb/>Its authority extended over all the synagogues in <placeName>Judea</placeName> and remote
<lb/>countries, and no appeal could be made from its sentence. Wheth­
<lb/>er this consistory of seventy elders was a perpetual, or only a tempo­
<lb/>rary institution, is a subject of dispute. The <name>Jews</name>, and after them
<lb/><persName>Grotius</persName>, <persName>Selden</persName>, <persName>Lightfoot</persName>, 
and several other learned <name>christians</name>,
<lb/>maintain that it was first instituted by <persName>Moses</persName>; that the seventy-
<lb/>two elders appointed to assist him were its first members; and that
<lb/>the <orgName>Sanhedrim</orgName>, so famous in the latter ages of <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> polity, sub­
<lb/>sisted after his time until the destruction of the temple. But <persName>Bas­

            <p>Learned men differ respecting the origin of the <name>Pharisees</name>.
<lb/>Some suppose that they arose about an hundred and fifty years
<lb/>before the appearance of our Saviour. <persName>Josephus</persName>, who was him­
<lb/>self of this sect, speaks of it as flourishing in the time of <persName>Jonathan</persName>
<lb/>the high priest. The dissentions between the schools of <persName>Hillel</persName> and
<lb/><persName>Shammai</persName>, a little before the <rs type="properAdjective">christian</rs> era, increased the number
<lb/>and power of the <name>Pharisees</name>. <persName>Hillel</persName>, having acquired a profound
<lb/>knowledge of the most difficult points of the <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> law, became
<lb/>master of the chief school in <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, and laid the foundation of
<lb/>the <title>Talmud</title>. <persName>Shammai</persName>, one of his disciples, deserted his school,
<lb/>and formed a college, in which he taught doctrines contrary to his
<lb/>master. He rejected the oral law, and followed the moral only in
<lb/>its literal sense. These different schools long disturbed the Jew­
<lb/>ish church by violent commotions. However, the party of <persName>Hil­
<lb/>lel</persName> was at last victorious.<bibl rend="pre(—)slant(italic)"><author><persName>Enfield's</persName></author> <title>Philosophy</title>.</bibl> <mcr rend="slant(italic)">See also <ref>Section

<lb/>because they not only spread desolation before them, but were held

<pb xml:id="p1079a" corresp="#p1079"/> 
<lb/>their gods and emperours, which they carried in their standards, by
<lb/>which they swore, and to which they sacrificed. The usual orna­
<lb/>ments of these standards gave such offence to the <name>Jews</name>, that, in

<lb/>and <persName>Vitellius</persName> at the request of some eminent <name>Jews</name>, humanely avoid­
<lb/>ed marching his forces through <placeName>Judea</placeName> on account of these ensigna.
<lb/>When therefore they were planted within sight of the city and
<lb/>temple, when they stood within the holy precincts of <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>,
<lb/>rivalling, as it were, the God of <name>Israel</name>, this was a hostile contempt
<lb/>of the <name>Jews</name>, and is justly placed among the presages of their utter

            <p>The vast number of people shut up by the war, occasioned
<lb/>pestilential diseases, and afterwards famine of course advanced

<lb/>use of, the strictness of the siege, and the noisome smell of so ma­
<lb/>ny dead bodies lying in heaps in the city itself, and in the vallies and
<lb/>ditches without the walls, should have produced a plague. But
<lb/>nothing of this kind appears in the history; which must have been
<lb/>owing to the special interposition of divine providence. <persName>Josephus</persName>,
<lb/>in some of the places, where he speaks of the putrefaction of the
<lb/>dead bodies, may use expressions equivalent to pestilential; but he
<lb/>never shews, that there was an infection; if there had been, it would
<lb/>have equally affected the <name>Romans</name> and the <name>Jews</name>, and the siege of the

            <p>The chief heads of the cabbalistic doctrine, are thus deline­
<lb/>ated by the above mentioned author.</p>
            <quote rend="bestow((pre(“))(p))">
              <p>From nothing, nothing can be produced; since the distance
<lb/>between existence and non-entity is infinite. Matter is too imper­
<lb/>fect in its nature, and approaches too near to non-entity to be self
<lb/>existent. The Being from whom all things proceed is a spirit, un­
<lb/>created, eternal, intelligent, percipient, having within itself the
<lb/>principles of life and motion, existing by the necessity of its nature,
<lb/>and filling the immensity of space. This spirit is <name rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="he">Enseph</name>, the infi­
<lb/>nite Deity. This Eternal Fountain of existence sends forth from
<lb/>himself natures of various orders, which, nevertheless, are still uni­
<lb/>ted to their source. The world is a permanent emanation from
<lb/>the Deity, in which his attributes and properties are unfolded, and
<lb/>variously modified. The nearer any emanation is to the First Foun­
<lb/>tain, the more perfect and divine is its nature; and the reverse.</p>
              <p>
Before the creation of the world, all space was filled with the
<lb/><foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="he">Or Haen Soph</foreign>, 
or infinite intellectual light. But, when the volition
<lb/>for the production of nature was formed in the divine mind, the
<lb/>eternal light, hitherto equally diffused through the infinite ex­
<lb/>panse, withdrew itself to an equal distance in every direction, from
<lb/>a certain point, and thus left about this centre, a spherical portion
<lb/>of empty space, as a field for the operation of emanation, by which
<lb/>all things were to be produced. In the space from which the di­
<lb/>vine light was thus withdrawn, there were still, however, some
<lb/>portions or traces left of the divine essence, which were to become
<lb/>the receptacle of rays, sent forth from the Eternal Fountain, or the
<lb/>basis of future worlds. From a certain part of the concavity of infi­
<lb/>nite light, which surrounded the opaque sphere, the energy of ema­
<lb/>nation was first exerted, and rays were sent forth in right lines, into
<lb/>the dark abyss. The beam of light, thus produced, formed a chan­
<lb/>nel, through which streams were to flow for the production o<choice><sic> </sic><corr>f</corr></choice>
<lb/>worlds. This beam was united to the concave of light, and was di­
<lb/>rected towards the centre of the opaque sphere. From this lumi­
<pb xml:id="p1122a" corresp="#p1122"/>
<lb/>nous channel, streams of light <unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">flo</unclear>wed, at different distances from
<lb/>the centre, in a circular path, and formed distinct circles of light,
<lb/>separated from the concave of light, or from each other, by por­
<lb/>tions of dark or empty space. Of these circles of light, ten were
<lb/>produced, which may be called <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="he">Sephiræ</foreign>, or <mcr rend="slant(italic)">Splendours</mcr>.</p>
              <p>
The rectilineal beam of light, which is the first emanation from
<lb/>the eternal fountain, and is itself the source of all other emana­
<lb/>tions, may be distinguished by the name of <persName rend="slant(italic)">Adam Kadman</persName>, the first
<lb/>man, the first production of divine energy, or, the <mcr rend="slant(italic)">Son of God</mcr>.
<lb/>The Sephiræ are fountains of emanation, subordinate to <persName>Adam
<lb/>Kadman</persName>, which send forth rays of divine light or communicate es­
<lb/>sence and life to inferiour beings. The ten Sephiræ are known, ac­
<lb/>cording to the order of emanation, by the names, Intelligence, or
<lb/>the Crown, Knowledge, Wisdom, Strength, 
Beauty, Greatness,
<lb/>Glory, Stability, Victory, 
Dominion.</p>
              <p>These are not the instruments of the divine operations, but
<lb/>media, through which the Deity diffuses himself through the sphere
<lb/>of the universe, and produces whatever exists. They are not be­
<lb/>ings detached from the Deity, but substantial virtues or powers,
<lb/>distinctly, but dependently, sent forth from the eternal source of
<lb/>existence through the mediation of <persName>Adam Kadman</persName>, the first ema­
<lb/>nating power, and becoming the immediate source of existence to
<lb/>subordinate emanations. They are dependent upon the First Foun­
<lb/>tain, as rays upon a luminary, which is conceived to have sent
<lb/>them forth with a power of drawing them back, at pleasure, into
<lb/>itself.</p>
              <p>
The first infinite source of being, is the <mcr rend="slant(italic)">Enzophic</mcr> world, or
<lb/>world of infinity, within which, after the manner above described,
<lb/>four worlds are produced by the law of emanation, according to
<lb/>which the superiour is the immediate source of the inferiour; these
<lb/>are <name rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="he">Aziluth</name>, 
or the world of emanation, including the Sephiræ;
<lb/><name rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="he">Brish</name>, 
or the world of creation, containing certain spiritual na­
<lb/>tures, which derive their essence from the Sephiræ; 
<name rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="he">Jezirah</name>, or
<lb/>the world of forms, composed of substantial natures, derived from
<lb/>the superiour spiritual substances, and placed within ethereal vehi­
<lb/>cles, which they inform; and <name rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="he">Asiah</name>, or the material and visible 
<pb xml:id="p1123a" corresp="#p1123"/>
<lb/>world, comprehending all those substances which are capable of
<lb/>motion, composition, division, and dissolution.</p>
              <p>
These derived worlds are different evolutions, or expansions
<lb/>of the divine essence, or distinct classes of beings, in which the in­
<lb/>finite light of the divine nature is exhibited with continually de­
<lb/>creasing splendour, as they recede from the First Fountain. The
<lb/>last and most distant production of the divine energy of emana­
<lb/>tion is matter; which is produced when the divine light, by its re­
<lb/>cession from the Fountain, becomes so attenuated as to be lost in
<lb/>darkness, leaving nothing but an opaque substance, which is only
<lb/>one degree above non-entity. Matter has no separate and inde­
<lb/>pendent existence, but is merely a modification and permanent ef­
<lb/>fect of the emanative energy of the divine nature.</p>
              <p>The Sephiræ, or first order of emanative being, existing in 
<name rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="he">Azi­
<lb/>luth</name> are superiour to spirits, and are called 
<foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="he">Parzuphim</foreign>, <mcr rend="slant(italic)">Persons</mcr>,
<lb/>to denote that they have a substantial existence. The inhabitants
<lb/>of the second world are called Thrones, on account of the domin­
<lb/>ion, which they possess over the various orders of Angels, which
<lb/>inhabit the third world. The fourth, or material world, is the re­
<lb/>gion of evil spirits, called <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="he">Klippoth</foreign>, the dregs of emanation. These
<lb/>are the authors of the evil, which is found in the material world,
<lb/>but they are continually aspiring towards the Sephiræ, and will, in
<lb/>the great revolution of nature, return into the inexhaustible foun­
<lb/>tain of deity. Spirits of all orders have a material vehicle, less
<lb/>pure and subtile in proportion to their distance from <name rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="he">Ensoph</name>; and
<lb/>this vehicle is of the nature of the world next below that to which they
<lb/>belong. <name rend="slant(italic)">Metatron</name> is the prince of 
<name rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="he">Jezirah</name>, or the angelick world,
<lb/>in which they are ten distinct orders; <name rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="he">Sandalphon</name> of 
<name rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="he">Aziah</name>, or
<lb/>the material world; these together with the hosts over which they
<lb/>preside, animate aerial vehicles, capable of impression from corpo­
<lb/>real objects, and in different ways requiring renovation.</p>
              <p>
The human soul, proceeding by emanation from the Deity, is an
<lb/>incorporeal substance of the same nature with the divine intellect.
<lb/>Being united to the body, one complex nature is produced, endued
<lb/>with reason, and capable of action. The human soul consists of
<lb/>four parts, <name rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="he">Nephesh</name>, 
or the principle of vitality; <name rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="he">Ruach</name>, or the
<pb xml:id="p1124a" corresp="#p1124"/>
<lb/>principle of motion; <name rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="he">Neschamah</name>, 
or the power of intelligence; and
<lb/><name rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="he">Jechidah</name>, a divine principle, 
by means of which it contemplates
	    <lb/>superiour natures, and even ascends to the <mcr rend="slant(italic)">Ensophic</mcr> world. All
<lb/>souls were produced at once, and pre-existed in <persName>Adam</persName>. Every hu­
<lb/>man soul has two guardian angels, produced by emanation at the
<lb/>time of the production of souls.</p>
              <p>The mind of man is united to the divine mind, as the radius of
<lb/>a circle to its centre. The souls of good men ascend above the
<lb/>mansion of the angels, and are delighted with the vision of the first
<lb/>light, which illuminates all the worlds.</p>
              <p>The universe continues to exist by the divine energy of ema­
<lb/>nation. Whilst this energy is exerted, different forms and orders
<lb/>of beings remain; when it is withheld, all the streams of existence
<lb/>return into their fountain. The <name rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="he">Ensoph</name>, or Deity, contains all
<lb/>things within himself; and there is always the same quantity of ex­
<lb/>istence, either in a created or uncreated state. When it is in an
<lb/>uncreated state, God is all; when worlds are created, the Deity is
<lb/>unfolded, or evolved, by various degrees of emanation, which con­
<lb/>stitute the several forms and orders of created nature.</p>

            <p>The crusades, or expeditions to recover the holy land from
<lb/>the hands of the <name>Mahometans</name>, commenced about the year <date when="1095">1095</date>.
<lb/>The foundation of these expeditions was a superstitious veneration
<lb/>for those places where our Saviour performed his miracles, and
<lb/>finished the work of redemption. <persName>Peter the hermit</persName>, a native of
<lb/><placeName>Amiens</placeName> in <placeName>Picardy</placeName>, 
had made the pilgrimage to <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, and be­
<lb/>ing deeply affected with the dangers to which the pilgrims were
<lb/>exposed, as well as the oppressions which the eastern <name>Christians</name>
<lb/>endured, formed the bold design of leading into <placeName>Asia</placeName>, from the
<lb/>furthest extremities of the west, armies sufficient to subdue that
<lb/>warlike nation, which then possessed the holy land. This fanatical
<lb/>monk ran from province to province, with a crucifix, exciting
<lb/>princes and people to the holy war; and wherever he came kin­
<lb/>dled the same enthusiastick ardour with which he himself was an­
<lb/>imated. People of all ranks caught the contagion; not only the
<lb/>gallant nobles of the age with their martial followers, but men in
<lb/>the m<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">or</unclear>e humble and pacifick stations in life; ecclesiasticks of every
<lb/>order, and even women and children engaged with emulation in
<lb/>an undertaking which was deemed sacred and meritorious. If we
<lb/>may believe the concurring testimony of cotemporary authors,
<lb/>six millions of persons assumed the cross, which was the badge that
<lb/>distinguished such as devoted themselves to this holy warfare. Nor
<lb/>did the fumes of this enthusiastick zeal evaporate at once; the
<lb/>phrenzy was as lasting as it was extravagant. During two centuries
<lb/><placeName>Europe</placeName> seems to have had no object but to recover, or keep pos­
<lb/>session of the holy land; and during this period vast armies con­
<lb/>tinued to march to <placeName>Palestine</placeName>.<bibl rend="pre(—)slant(italic)"><author><persName>Robertson's</persName></author> <title>History of <persName>Charles V.</persName></title><lb/><biblScope>Vol. I. p. 22</biblScope>.</bibl></p>

            <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> history of the <name>Jews</name> since their dis­
<lb/>persion has been but little investigated even by
<lb/>the literary part of the world, and is almost
<lb/>entirely unknown to the general mass of man­
<lb/>kind. The design of this work, including the
<lb/>introduction, is to give a brief sketch of their
<lb/>situation, after their return from the <name>Babylonian</name>
	  <lb/>captivity, to the <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth century</date>. The com­
<lb/>piler is sensible, that the subject is not calcu­
<lb/>lated to engage the attention of those readers
<lb/>whose object is merely amusement. Instead
<lb/>of a narration of new and entertaining events,
<lb/>they will find a tedious succession of oppres­
<lb/>sions and persecutions, and probably turn with
<lb/>disgust from the gloomy picture of human
<lb/>guilt and wretchedness.</p>
            <p>To the speculative and inquisitive part of
<lb/>mankind the subject must, however, appear
<lb/>more interesting. The history of the <name>Jews</name> is
<lb/>remarkable, above that of all other nations,
<lb/>for the number and cruelty of the persecutions
<lb/>they have endured. They are venerable for
<lb/>the antiquity of their origin. They are dis­
<lb/>criminated from the rest of mankind by their

<lb/>wonderful destination, peculiar habits, and re­
<lb/>ligious rites. Since the destruction of <placeName>Jeru­
<lb/>salem</placeName>, and their universal dispersion, we con­
<lb/>template the singular phenomenon of a nation
<lb/>subsisting for ages without its civil and reli­
<lb/>gious polity, and thus surviving its political
<lb/>existence.</p>
            <p>But the <name>Jews</name> appear in a far more interesting
<lb/>and important light when considered as a
<lb/>standing monument of the truth of the chris­
<lb/>tian religion; as the ancient church of God
<lb/>to whom were committed the sacred oracles;
<lb/>as a people selected from all nations to make
<lb/>known and preserve the knowledge of the true
<lb/>God. To them the gospel was first preached,
<lb/>and from them the first <rs type="properAdjective">christian</rs> church in
<lb/><placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> was collected. To them we are in­
	  <lb/>debted for the scriptures of the <rs type="title">New</rs>, as well
	  <lb/>as of the <rs type="title">Old Testament</rs>. To them were given
<lb/>the spirit of prophecy, and power of working
<lb/>miracles. From them were derived an illus­
<lb/>trious train of prophets and apostles. To use
<lb/>the language of an inspired writer, <quote>To them

              <p>It appears from the sacred records, that the
<lb/><name>Jews</name>, after their return from captivity, were in
<lb/>a feeble state under the first <rs type="properAdjective">Persian</rs> monarchs.
<lb/>They were exposed to the envy and malice of

<lb/>edict which <persName>Haman</persName> obtained against them,
<lb/>from which they were saved by the powerful
<lb/>intercession of <persName>queen Esther</persName>, that they were
<lb/>in danger of being destroyed upon the least in­
<lb/>timation of the king's pleasure. By degrees,
<lb/>however, their affairs were established, and
<lb/>though they were subjected to an easy tribute,
<lb/>they lived under their own laws, in the form of
<lb/>a commonwealth, governed by the high priest,
<lb/>and the council of seventy two elders; and ex­
<lb/>ercised among themselves the power of life and

              <p>After the death of <persName>Nehemiah</persName>, the govern­

<lb/>priests received their authority.<anchor xml:id="a0012" rend="pre(†)" corresp="#n0012"/> This circum­
<lb/>stance induced many persons to aspire to that
<lb/>high office merely through ambition and ava­
<lb/>rice who were destitute of zeal for religion, or
<lb/>love for their country. For whole centuries
<lb/>the office of high priest being the chief object
<lb/>of men's ambition, the violent contests for the
<lb/>sacerdotal dignity, and the arbitrary conduct of
<lb/>those who obtained it, involved the <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> na­

              <p><anchor xml:id="a0013" corresp="#n0013"/>A remarkable instance of the truth of this

<lb/>asserted that <persName>Bagoses</persName>, the governour of <placeName>Syria</placeName>,
<lb/>had promised to transfer the sacred dignity to
<lb/>him. A dispute immediately ensued, and
<lb/><persName>Joshua</persName> was slain in the interior court of the
<lb/>temple. <persName>Bagoses</persName> receiving intelligence of this
<lb/>event, severely upbraided the <name>Jews</name> with defil­
<lb/>ing the habitation of their God, and imposed
<lb/>a heavy fine upon the pontiff, which was not
<lb/>taken off till the death of <persName>Artaxerxes</persName> changed
<lb/>the face of affairs. The <name>Jews</name> were, however,
<lb/>by no means free from trouble in the reign of

<lb/>rious arms into <placeName>Judea</placeName>; reduced <placeName>Jericho</placeName>, and

<lb/>died, and was succeeded by his son <persName>Jaddua</persName>.<anchor xml:id="a0014" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0014"/></p>
              <p>After the Babylonish captivity the <name>Jews</name> re­
<lb/>tained a constant aversion to idolatry, which
<lb/>they justly supposed was the principal cause
<lb/>of their expulsion from their native land.</p>
              <p>It has been assigned as a reason for this
<lb/>change, that previous to the captivity they had
<lb/>no <mcr xml:id="a0015" rend="post(†)" corresp="#n0015">synagogues</mcr> for public instruction, nor

<lb/>and the cities of the <name>Levites</name>. In consequence
<lb/>of which the divine laws were neglected and
<lb/>forgotten, and they were easily allured into the
<lb/>superstitious practices of their idolatrous neigh­
<lb/>bours. But after their return, they had syna­
<lb/>gogues erected among them in every city,
<lb/>which were opened not for ceremonial wor­
<lb/>ship, as sacrificing, for this was confined to the
<lb/>temple; but for praying, preaching, reading
<lb/>the law,<anchor xml:id="a0016" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0016"/> divine worship and social duties.
<lb/>The people repaired to the synagogue morn­
<lb/>ing and evening for prayer, and on <name>sabbaths</name>
<lb/>and festivals the law was read and expounded
<lb/>to them. The custom of reading the scrip­
<lb/>tures and preaching in the synagogues is sup­
<lb/>posed to have been introduced by <persName xml:id="a0017" rend="pre(†)" corresp="#n0017">Ezra</persName>.</p>

              <p>The reformation, begun by <persName>Ezra</persName> and others,

<lb/>rupt the law of <persName>Moses</persName>, by introducing certain
<lb/>precepts and institutions which they professed
<lb/>to have received by oral tradition from the

<lb/>which chiefly respected religious ceremonies,
<lb/>fastings and other practices distinct from the

<lb/>found awe at the sight of this solemn proces­

<lb/>expressed their astonishment, that the victori­

              <p>The impious monarch, not yet satiated with

<lb/>minister, well versed in all the rites of Gre­

<lb/>and set up his statue on the altar of burnt

<lb/>The king also promulgated an edict, making it

<lb/>In short, an energetick attempt was made to de­

              <p>During Christ's ministry on earth the tem­
<lb/>ple was used as a place of merchandize, and
<lb/>the most sacred offices, even the high priest­
<lb/>hood, were sold. The chief priests, who pur­
<lb/>chased their places by bribes, maintained their
<lb/>ill acquired authority by the most abominable
<lb/>crimes. The inferiour priests, and those who
<lb/>possessed any degree of authority, had become
<lb/>dissolute and abandoned in the highest de­
<lb/>gree; while the multitude, excited by their
<lb/>corrupt example, run headlong into every kind
<lb/>of iniquity, and, by their endless seditions, rob­
<lb/>beries, and extortions, armed against them­

              <p>The <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> nation, at the time of our Sa­

<lb/>variety of sects. The principal points in dis­
<lb/>pute among them respected the law of <persName>Moses</persName>,
<lb/>the immortality of the soul, the resurrection of
<lb/>the body, future rewards and punishments, and
<lb/>the nature of virtue. All admitted the divine
<lb/>authority of the <rs type="properAdjective">Mosaical</rs> law. All agreed in
<lb/>thinking, that their religious tenets and observ­

<lb/>ances were the only objects worthy of their
<lb/>attention.<anchor xml:id="a0123" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0123"/></p>
              <p>The rabbies, or the teachers of each sect,
<lb/>defended their tenets with the greatest zeal
<lb/>and pertinacity. The <name>Jews</name> and <name>Samaritans</name>
<lb/>were, in particular, violently opposed to each
<lb/>other. The latter, at first, were heathens, who
<lb/>worshipped the God of <name>Israel</name>, in conjunction
<lb/>with other deities, till <persName>Menasses</persName>, who was made
<lb/>their high priest, with other fugitive <name>Jews</name>,
<lb/>coming to them from <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, brought with
<lb/>them the book of the law, and taught them to
<lb/>worship the true God only, according to the
<lb/><rs type="properAdjective">Mosaic</rs> institution. From this period they are
<lb/>considered a sect of the <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> religion. They
<lb/>looked upon the temple of <placeName>Gerizim</placeName> as the only
<lb/>place, where God is pleased to be worshipped,
<lb/>and the centre of true religion. They receiv­
<lb/>ed no other scriptures but the book of <persName>Moses</persName>,
<lb/>except <title>Joshua</title> and <title>Judges</title>, which, however,
<lb/>they did not allow to be of divine authority

              <p>The <name>Pharisees</name> were the most distinguished,
<lb/>flourishing, and popular sect among the <name>Jews</name>.
<lb/>They assumed this name on account of their
<lb/>separating themselves for superiour strictness
<lb/>in ritual observances. Their separation con­

<lb/>ing religious ceremonies, and does not appear

<lb/>worship, in which the <name>Jews</name> of every sect al­
<lb/>ways seemed to have been united.<anchor xml:id="a0125" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0125"/></p>
              <p>It appears from the frequent mention, which
<lb/>is made by the evangelists, of the Scribes and
<lb/><name>Pharisees</name> in conjunction, that the greatest num­
<lb/>ber of <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> teachers, or doctors of the law,
<lb/>were at that time of the pharisaical sect. The
<lb/>ecclesiastical scribes were the learned of the
<lb/><rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> nation, who expounded the law, and
<lb/>taught it to the people.<anchor xml:id="a0126" rend="pre(†)" corresp="#n0126"/></p>
              <p>The <name>Pharisees</name> were principally distinguish­
<lb/>ed by their zeal for the traditions of the elders,
<lb/>which they not only maintained to be of equal
<lb/>authority with the written law, but in many
<lb/>cases explained the former by the latter, en­
<lb/>tirely contrary to its true intent and meaning;
<lb/>and thus made the <mcr rend="slant(italic)">commandments of God of no
<lb/>effect by their traditions</mcr>. They pretended
<lb/>that those traditions, which they called the oral
<lb/>law, were delivered by God to <persName>Moses</persName>, on
<lb/><placeName>Mount Sinai</placeName>, and preserved through succes­
<lb/>sive generations. They were charged with
<lb/>maintaining, that by observing both the writ­
<lb/>ten and oral law, man may not only obtain jus­
<lb/>tification before God, but perform meritorious

<lb/>works of supererogation; that fasting, alms,
<lb/>ablutions, and confessions are sufficient atone­
<lb/>ment for sin; that thoughts and desires are
<lb/>not sinful, unless they produce evil actions.
<lb/>They acknowledged the immortality of the soul,
<lb/>future rewards and punishments, and the re­
<lb/>surrection of the body.<anchor xml:id="a0127" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0127"/> According to <persName>Jose­
<lb/>phus</persName>, they maintained the doctrine of predes­
<lb/>tination; but supposed, that the divine decrees
<lb/>did not interfere with the freedom of the hu­
<lb/>man will.<anchor xml:id="a0128" rend="pre(†)" corresp="#n0128"/></p>
              <p>This denomination, by their apparent sanc­
<lb/>tity of manners, had rendered themselves ex­
<lb/>tremely popular. It appears both from the
<lb/>scripture, and the testimony of <persName>Josephus</persName>, that
<lb/>the common people were entirely at their dis­
<lb/>posal, and gave their suffrage to every religious

<lb/>tained their sanction. The great, who feared
<lb/>their artifice, were frequently obliged to court
<lb/>their favour. Hence they obtained the high­
<lb/>est offices both in the state and priesthood;
<lb/>and assumed the chief direction both of pub­
<lb/>lick and private affairs.<anchor xml:id="a0129" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0129"/></p>
              <p>The peculiar manners of this sect are strong­
<lb/>ly marked in the writings of the evangelists;
<lb/>particularly their exactness in performing the
<lb/>rites and ceremonies of the law, both written
<lb/>and traditionary; the rigour of their discipline
<lb/>in washings, fastings, and ablutions; their
<lb/>scrupulous care to avoid every kind of ritual
<lb/>impurity; their long and frequent prayers,
<lb/>made not only in the synagogues and temples,
<lb/>but in the publick streets; their philacteries
<lb/>on the borders of their garments, on which
<lb/>were written sentences of the law; their assi­
<lb/>duity in making proselytes; their ostentatious
<lb/>charities; and, under all this specious mark of
<lb/>zeal and purity, their abominable and atrocious
<lb/>vices. According to our Saviour's represen­
<lb/>tation of them, they were a race of the most
<lb/>demure hypocrites, that ever disgraced human
<lb/>nature, resembling whited sepulchres, which
<lb/>outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly are
<lb/>full of putrefaction and horrour.<anchor xml:id="a0130" rend="pre(†)" corresp="#n0130"/></p>

              <p>The above account is confirmed by the tes­
<lb/>timony of the <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> writers themselves. The
<lb/>Talmudic books mention several distinct clas­
<lb/>ses of <name>Pharisees</name>, under characters, which show
<lb/>them to have been deeply immersed in super­
<lb/>stition. Among these were the truncated
<lb/><name>Pharisee</name>, who, that he might appear in pro­
<lb/>found meditation, as if destitute of feet, scarce­
<lb/>ly lifted them from the ground. The mortar
<lb/><name>Pharisee</name>, who, that his contemplations might
<lb/>not be disturbed, wore a deep cap in shape
<lb/>of a mortar, which would only permit him to
<lb/>look upon the ground at his feet; and the
<lb/>striking <name>Pharisee</name>, who, shutting his eyes, as he
<lb/>walked, to avoid the sight of women, often
<lb/>struck his head against the wall. They prac­
<lb/>tised many painful austerities and mortifica­
<lb/>tions, frequently observed severe fasts, cover­
<lb/>ed their features with gloom and solemnity,
<lb/>and used every artifice to captivate the admira­
<lb/>tion of the populace.<anchor xml:id="a0131" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0131"/></p>
              <p>The sect of the <name>Sadducees</name> was inconsidera­
<lb/>ble in number; but some of those, who pro­
<lb/>fessed its tenets, were of illustrious families,
<lb/>and others distinguished for their opulence.
<lb/>We find that <persName>Caiaphus</persName> an high priest was of
<lb/>this denomination, and <persName>Josephus</persName> mentions
<lb/>several other <name>Sadducees</name>, who were exalted to

    <pb xml:id="p1059" n="059"/>
    <milestone unit="sig" n="E6r"/>
    <mw type="pageNum">59</mw>

<lb/>the supreme power in church and state. The
<lb/>chief heads of the doctrine of this sect are as
<lb/>follow.</p>
              <p>All laws and traditions not comprehended
<lb/>in the written law, are to be rejected as merely
<lb/>human inventions. Neither angels nor spirits
<lb/>have a distinct existence, separate from this
<lb/>corporeal vestment. The soul of man there­
<lb/>fore does not remain after this life, but expires
<lb/>with the body. There will be no resurrection
<lb/>of the dead, nor any rewards and punishments
<lb/>after this life. Man is not subject to irresisti­
<lb/>ble fate, but has the framing of his condition
<lb/>chiefly in his own power. Polygamy ought
<lb/>not to be practised.<anchor xml:id="a0132" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0132"/></p>
              <p>The sect of the <name>Caraites</name>, though its history
<lb/>be exceedingly obscure, is not to be confounded
<lb/>with that of the <name>Sadducees</name>. The name denotes
<lb/>a scripturist, and seems intended to distinguish
<lb/>those, who adhere to the scriptures as the
<lb/>whole and only rule of their faith and practice.
<lb/>This denomination was given them about thir­
<lb/>ty years before Christ, when, upon the dissen­
<lb/>sion betwixt <persName>Hillel</persName> the president of the <orgName>San­
<lb/>hedrim</orgName>, and <persName>Shammai</persName> the vice president, by
<lb/>which their respective pupils were divided in­
<lb/>to two parties, betwixt whom there were per­
<lb/>petual contests, those, that were of the opinion

<lb/>of the <name>Caraites</name>, sided with the school of <persName>Sham­
<lb/>mai</persName>, and those, who were zealous for traditions,
<lb/>with that of <persName>Hillel</persName>. According to <persName>Dr. Pri­
<lb/>deaux</persName> they did not absolutely reject all tradi­
<lb/>tions, but only refused them the same authority
<lb/>with the written oracles of God. They were
<lb/>distinguished from the <name>Sadducees</name>, by maintain­
<lb/>ing the doctrines of the immortality of the
<lb/>soul, and future rewards and punishments.<anchor xml:id="a0133" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0133"/></p>
              <p>The <name>Essenes</name> differed from all the above
<lb/>mentioned sects, as they secluded themselves
<lb/>not only from politicks and publick affairs, but,
<lb/>as much as the nature of man and constitution
<lb/>of society will admit, from the common con­
<lb/>cerns and intercourse of private life. Some
<lb/>suppose they took their rise from the disper­
<lb/>sion of their nation, after the Babylonish cap­
<lb/>tivity; others, that they began when the per­
<lb/>secution of <persName>Antiochus</persName> compelled the <name>Jews</name> to
<lb/>retire to the woods and mountains. They
<lb/>maintained, that rewards and punishments ex­
<lb/>tended to the soul alone, and regarded the
<lb/>body as a mass of malignant matter, and the
<lb/>prison of the immortal spirit. The greatest
<lb/>part of this sect considered the laws of <persName>Moses</persName>
<lb/>as an allegorical system of spiritual and myste­
<lb/>rious truth, and renounced all regard to the
<lb/>outward letter in its explanation. The lead­

<lb/>ing traits in the character of this sect were,
<lb/>that they were sober, abstemious, peaceable,
<lb/>lovers of retirement, and had a perfect com­
<lb/>munity of goods. They paid the highest re­
<lb/>gard to the moral precepts of the law; but ne­
<lb/>glected the ceremonial, excepting what regard­
<lb/>ed personal cleanliness, the observation of the
<lb/><name>sabbath</name>, and making an annual present to the
<lb/>temple at <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>. They commonly lived
<lb/>in a state of celibacy, and adopted the children
<lb/>of others, to educate them in their own prin­
<lb/>ciples and customs. Though they were, in
<lb/>general, averse to swearing, or to requiring an
<lb/>oath, they bound all, whom they initiated, by
<lb/>the most sacred vows, to observe the duties
<lb/>of piety, justice, fidelity, and modesty; to
<lb/>conceal the secrets of the frate<choice><sic/><corr>r</corr></choice>nity; to pre­
<lb/>serve the books of their institutions; and with
<lb/>great care to commemorate the names of the
<lb/>angels.<anchor xml:id="a0134" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0134"/></p>
              <p><persName>Philo</persName> mentions two classes of <name>Essenes</name>; one
<lb/>of which followed a practical institution, the
<lb/>other professed a theoretical system. The
<lb/>latter, who were called <name>Theraputæ</name>, placed their
<lb/>whole felicity in the contemplation of the di­
<lb/>vine nature. Detaching themselves entirely
<lb/>from secular affairs, they transferred their
<lb/>property to their relations and friends, and re­

<lb/>tired to solitary places, where they devoted

<lb/>ciety of this kind was formed near <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>,

              <p>Besides these eminent <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> sects, there
<lb/>were several of inferior note, at the time of

<lb/>ed by the sacred writers, and the <name>Gaulonites</name>,
<lb/>by <persName>Josephus</persName>.</p>
              <p>The <name>Herodians</name> derived their name from
<lb/><persName>Herod the great</persName>, and were distinguished by
<lb/>their coinciding with the plan of that monarch
<lb/>to subject himself and his dominions to the
<lb/><name>Romans</name>; and also by complying with many
<lb/>of the heathen usages. Their distinguished
<lb/>tenet appeared to be, that it is lawful, when
<lb/>constrained by superiours, to comply with
<lb/>idolatry, and with false religion. <persName>Herod</persName> seems
<lb/>to have formed this sect, in order to justify
<lb/>himself in his practice in studying every arti­
<lb/>fice to ingratiate himself with the emperour,
<lb/>and to secure the favour of the principal per­
<lb/>sonages in the court of <placeName>Rome</placeName>. We find the
<lb/><name>Sadducees</name> readily embraced the tenets of this
<lb/>party; for the same persons, who, in one of

<lb/>the gospels, are called <name>Herodians</name>, are in anoth­

              <p>The <name>Gaulonites</name> were <name>Galileans</name>, who deriv­
<lb/>ed this name from one <persName>Judas Theudas</persName>, a na­
<lb/>tive of <placeName>Gaulon</placeName>, in upper <placeName>Galilee</placeName>, who, in the
<lb/>tenth year of <persName>Jesus Christ</persName>, excited his country­
<lb/>men, the <name>Galileans</name>, and many other <name>Jews</name>, to
<lb/>take arms, and venture, upon all extremities,
<lb/>rather than pay tribute to the <name>Romans</name>. The
<lb/>principles he instilled into his party were, not
<lb/>only that they were a free nation, and ought
<lb/>not to be in subjection to any other; but, that
<lb/>they were the elect of God, that he alone was
<lb/>their governour, and that therefore they ought
<lb/>not to submit to any ordinance of man. Though
<lb/><persName>Theudas</persName> was unsuccessful, and his party, in
<lb/>their very first attempt, entirely routed and
<lb/>dispersed; yet so deeply had he infused his
<lb/>own enthusiasm into their hearts, that they ne­

            <p>While the <rs type="properAdjective">Roman</rs> forces were besieging

<lb/>reduced, after an obstinate siege. All the men,
<lb/>amounting to 15,000, were massacred; and the
<lb/>women and children made prisoners. About

<lb/>by suicide; others were swallowed up by the

<lb/>such as were enabled to reach the shore were
<lb/>killed by the merciless <name>Romans</name>. The sea was

            <p>After <persName>Vespasian</persName> had refreshed his troops,

<lb/>zeal for the law of God, and the religious cus­
<lb/>toms of their ancestors, vehemently opposed
<lb/>all pacifick measures. This faction, which was
<lb/>far the most numerous and powerful, con­
<lb/>sisted of men of the vilest and most aban­
<lb/>doned characters ever recorded in history.
<lb/>They were the remains of the sect of the <name>Gau­

            <p><persName>John</persName>, who had fled from <placeName>Gischala</placeName>, put him­

<lb/>and assassins, seized upon the temple for a
<lb/>fortress, and that holy place was made a thea­
<lb/>tre of civil war. The opposite party, under
<lb/>the conduct of <persName>Ananus</persName>, a wise and venerable
<lb/>man, among the chief priests, armed in their
<lb/>own defence; and, after an obstinate contest,
<lb/>forced the <name>Zealots</name> into the inner cincture of
<lb/>the temple, where they were closely invested.
<lb/><persName>John</persName>, who had pretended to agree with those,
<lb/>who desired peace, was sent to the <name>Zealots</name> with
<lb/>terms of accommodation; but he betrayed his
<lb/>trust, and earnestly exhorted them to persevere
<lb/>with unshaken firmness. He intimated to
<lb/>them the necessity of foreign assistance; and
<lb/>persuaded them to enter into a treaty with the

            <p>On the night the <name>Idumeans</name> were excluded,

<lb/>prevailing terrour and confusion, sawed the
<lb/>bolts and hinges of the temple gates without
<lb/>being heard, forced the guards, sallied into the
<lb/>city, and introduced twenty thousand of their
<lb/>allies. After being thus strengthened and as­
<lb/>sisted, they perpetrated the most horrid cruel­
<lb/>ties. Twelve thousand persons of noble
<lb/>birth, and in the prime of life, upon their re­
<lb/>fusal to join them, were inhumanly murdered.
<lb/><persName>Ananus</persName> and <persName>Jesus</persName>, the chief priests, were next
<lb/>put to death, and their dead bodies left with­
<lb/>out burial. After massacreing many persons
<lb/>of distinction, they turned their sanguinary
<lb/>cruelty upon the citizens and lower classes,
<lb/>and the ill fated capital was filled with blood
<lb/>and carnage. At this dreadful period, none
<lb/>dared publickly to lament the loss of his near­

<lb/>the last melancholy rites of interment. This
<lb/>cruel despotism compelled many to forsake
<lb/><placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, and take refuge with the <name>Romans</name>,
<lb/>though the attempt was extremely hazardous,
<lb/>as the avenues of the city were strictly guard­
<lb/>ed; and all, who were detected in attempting
<lb/>to escape, were immediately put to death.
<lb/>The <name>Idumeans</name>, who were of <persName>John's</persName> party, at

            <p>The <name>Zealots</name>, after they had massacred or
<lb/>driven away all, who were capable of opposing
<lb/>them, turned their murderous weapons against
<lb/>each other. A new faction was formed against

<lb/>acter, and daring spirit, who had his head quar­
<lb/>ters in the fortress of <placeName>Masada</placeName>. To increase
<lb/>his party, he published a proclamation, in
<lb/>which he promised liberty to the slaves, and
<lb/>suitable encouragement to all freemen, who
<lb/>would enlist under his banners. After he had,
<lb/>by this stratagem, collected many followers, he
<lb/>invaded <placeName>Idumea</placeName>, perpetrated all kinds of cruel­
<lb/>ty, corrupted the general of that country, and
<lb/>having gained possession of their military
<lb/>forces, advanced towards <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, and en­
<lb/>camped before the city. This army destroyed
<lb/>the <name>Jews</name> without the walls, and were more

            <p>The inhabitants of <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, in order to

<lb/>Accordingly, they entered the metropolis, and

<lb/>at length an affair took place in <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>,
<lb/>which filled the inhabitants with consternation

            <p>The <name>Romans</name>, having pursued the attack with

<lb/>which occasioned <persName>Titus</persName> to remark, that they

<lb/>When <persName>Josephus</persName> was sent for the last time to

<lb/>also seized the sacred oil, which was to maintain

<lb/>and fight on more proper ground, in order to
<lb/>preserve that sacred edifice from the fury of
<lb/>his troops. But, as they persisted in their in­
<lb/>flexible obstinacy, <persName>Titus</persName>, after several bloody
<lb/>engagements, took possession of the outward
<lb/>court of the <name>Gentiles</name>, and forced the besieged
<lb/>into that of the priests. The <rs type="properAdjective">Roman</rs> com­
<lb/>mander had determined in council not to burn
<lb/>the temple, considering the existence of so
<lb/>proud a structure an honour to himself. He,
<lb/>therefore, attempted to batter down one of the
<lb/>galleries of the precinct; but as the strength of
<lb/>the wall eluded the force of all his engines, his
<lb/>troops next endeavoured to scale it, but were
<lb/>repulsed with considerable loss. When <persName>Titus</persName>
<lb/>found, that his desire of saving the sacred build­

<lb/>the gates of the outer temple, which, being

<lb/>desirous of preserving the temple, caused the

<lb/>seized some of the blazing materials, and, with
<lb/>the assistance of another soldier, who raised
<lb/>him from the ground, threw them through a
<lb/>window into one of the apartments, that sur­

<lb/>to suppose Heaven had forsaken them, rushed in
<lb/>with violent lamentations, and spared no effort,
<lb/>not even life itself, to preserve the sacred edifice
<lb/>on which they had rested their security.</p>
            <p><persName>Titus</persName>, being awakened by the outcry, hast­

            <p>Still, as the flames had not reached the in­

<lb/>chief officers, entered the sanctuary and most
<lb/>holy place, which excited his astonishment
<lb/>and admiration. After having in vain repeat­
<lb/>ed his attempts to prevent its destruction, he
<lb/>saved the golden candlestick, the table of shew
<lb/>bread, the altar of perfumes, which were all of
<lb/>pure gold; and the volume of the law, wrapped
<lb/>up in a rich golden tissue. Upon his leaving

            <p>A horrid massacre soon followed, in which

<lb/>the battlements of their falling temple. Six

<lb/>their attachment to the oral traditions and un­

<lb/>agreed in thinking, that their religious rites
<lb/>and observances were the only objects worthy
<lb/>their attention, it followed, that their literary

            <p>After the devastation and ruin of their coun­

<lb/>part escaped into <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and part withdrew
<lb/>into <placeName>Babylon</placeName>; in both which countries the re­

<lb/>where they also revived their forms of wor­

            <p>The secret doctrine of the <name>Jews</name> was that,
<lb/>which treated of the mysteries of the divine

	  <lb/>called <name>cabbala</name>, from a <rs type="properAdjective">Hebrew</rs> word, which
<lb/>signifies to receive, because it was received
<lb/>by tradition. After the manner of the Pytha­

<lb/>only to certain persons, who were bound, under
<lb/>the most solemn anathema, not to divulge it.</p>
            <p>The <name>cabbala</name> is divided into three sorts. By
<lb/>the first, the <name>Jews</name> extract from the words of
<lb/>scripture recondite meanings, which are some­
<lb/>times ingenious, but always fanciful. The
<lb/>second is a kind of magick in employing the
<lb/>words and letters of the scriptures in certain
<lb/>combinations, which they suppose have pow­
<lb/>er to make the good and evil spirits of the in­
<lb/>visible world familiar with them. The third,
	  <lb/>which is properly the <name>cabbala</name>, is an art, by
<lb/>which they profess to raise mysterious expo­

<lb/>tences, to which they apply them.<anchor xml:id="a0227" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0227"/></p>
            <p>The <name>Jews</name> assert, that the mysteries of the

<lb/>ligion, which, to be fully comprehended by

<lb/>And when <persName>Adam</persName> received this book, angels

<lb/>branch of the <name>Sadducees</name>, for they denied the

<lb/>to chance. The <name>Hellenists</name> were the <name>Jews</name>,
<lb/>who spoke <name>Greek</name>, and read the Septuagint in

<lb/>some jealousy between them and their breth­

<lb/>But, after they found, that the <name>Christians</name>, in dis­

            <p>The tranquillity, which the <name>Jews</name> enjoyed in

<lb/>used every method that human ingenuity could

            <p>In pursuance of his general design of op­

<lb/>In this letter he honours the patriarch with the
<lb/>title of brother. He compassionates their mis­

<lb/>self their gracious protector, and concludes
<lb/>with a promise, that, if he should return vic­

<lb/>build <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, and pay his grateful vows to

<lb/>event of a <rs type="properAdjective">Persian</rs> war. He resolved to erect
<lb/>a stately temple on the commanding summit
<lb/>of <placeName>Moriah</placeName>; to establish an order of priests,
<lb/>whose interested zeal would detect the arts,

            <p>For this purpose, the emperour assigned

<lb/>own. This minister, having obtained the
<lb/>strenuous support of the governour of <placeName>Pales­

<lb/>A celebrated author, who has deeply interested

<lb/>to this query.</p>

              <p>The resistance of the <name>Jews</name> in their last

<lb/>if there be any religion capable of offending
<lb/>the vanity of those, who are not followers of it,
<lb/>without doubt it is that of the <name>Jews</name>. Its di­
<lb/>vine author gave it this spirit with a view to
<lb/>raise a barrier between his people and the cor­
<lb/>ruption of those idolatrous nations, by whom
<lb/>they were surrounded. <name>Judaism</name> is an exclu­
<lb/>sive worship; and though it imposes the obli­
<lb/>gation of universal philanthropy, its singular­
<lb/>ity tends to make other men be considered as
<lb/>odious and profane. As it professes that
<lb/>there is only one God, the <name>Gentiles</name> revolted
<lb/>against a dogma which sapped the very foun­
<lb/>dation of <name>Paganism</name>; besides, they never spoke
<lb/>of circumcision, the most ancient of all rites,
<lb/>but with a smile of derision; and the passage
<lb/>from ridicule to contempt is immediate. It is
<lb/>a principle in morals, that people do not hate
<lb/>what they despise; but the misfortunes of the
<lb/><name>Jews</name> have rendered them an exception. Con­
<lb/>tempt consigned them to disgrace, and fury to
<lb/>torture. The <name>Christians</name>, beholding in them
<lb/>the authors of a Deicide, sometimes forgot the
<lb/>example of their Founder, who, when upon
<lb/>the cross, implored forgiveness for his execu­
<lb/>tioners. <persName>Mahomet</persName> at first shewed a great
<lb/>respect for the <name>Jews</name>; but this sentiment
<lb/>soon gave place to fury. His Koran was filled
<lb/>with violent declamation against men, enemies

<lb/>to his doctrine; and the <name>Mussulmans</name>, who ar­
<lb/>gued with the sabre, included the <name>Jews</name> in the
<lb/>proscription of all religions different from
<lb/><name>Islamism</name>. Length of time gave strength to
<lb/>this animosity, which became hereditary, be­
<lb/>cause fathers took care to inspire it into their
<lb/>children. Soon after, it was supposed that
<lb/>the <name>Jews</name>, irritated, but too weak to oppose
<lb/>striking vengeance to barbarous oppression,
<lb/>privately occasioned publick misfortunes; and
<lb/>the vulgar, adopting this idea without exami­
<lb/>nation, massacred them in the most brutal
<lb/>manner. The <name>Jews</name>, forced to follow usurious
<lb/>practices, when they became rich excited en­
<lb/>vy by their opulence, which rendered them
<lb/>still more odious. Such are the sources of
<lb/>the hatred which the whole world have sworn
<lb/>against the <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> people, and of the perse­
<lb/>cution that has every where followed them.</p>
              <p>
The result of these events exhibits action
<lb/>and re-action. The <name>Jews</name> of the same sect
<lb/>have always been united together, because
<lb/>there was little disproportion among them of
<lb/>rank and fortune, and very little luxury. Their
<lb/>years of Jubilee brought them very near to the
<lb/>primitive equality, which civil institutions con­
<lb/>tinually destroy; and their misfortunes have
<lb/>made this union closer, and strengthened its
<lb/>ties. But, being banished, proscribed, and

            <p>The family of the <persName>Kimkis</persName> has been emi­

<lb/>literature. <persName>Joseph Kimki</persName> was a man of great
<lb/>learning, but a violent enemy to the <name>Christians</name>,
<lb/>whom he inveighed against in his writings.
<lb/><persName>David Kimki</persName>, his son, one of the most zealous

<lb/>at the end of the <date notBefore="1101" notAfter="1200">twelfth</date>, and at the commence­
<lb/>ment of the <date notBefore="1201" notAfter="1300">thirteenth century</date>. This cele­
<lb/>brated rabbi far excelled his father in ability
<lb/>and learning, and had not imbibed such strong
<lb/>prejudices against the <name>Christians</name>. His writings
<lb/>have been held in such high estimation by his
<lb/>nation, that they supposed it impossible to at­
<lb/>tain to any eminence in letters and theology
<lb/>without studying them. He composed a
<lb/>grammar and dictionary of the <rs type="properAdjective">Hebrew</rs> lan­
<lb/>guage, by which he acquired the reputation of
<lb/>excelling all the <name>Jews</name> who preceded him in
<lb/>grammatical knowledge. He also was the

	  <lb/>other books of the <rs type="title">Old Testament</rs>. Part of

<lb/><persName>Abraham Halevi</persName> was a learned cabbalistical
<lb/><name>Jew</name>, who, having placed himself at the head
<lb/>of the traditional party, violently attacked the
<lb/><name>Caraites</name>; but, being inferiour to them in point
<lb/>of argument, he had resource to <persName>Alphonso
<lb/>VII.</persName> for whom he had performed signal ser­
<lb/>vices, and who rewarded him by commanding
<lb/>his opponents to be silent.<anchor xml:id="a0507" rend="pre(†)" corresp="#n0507"/></p>

            <p>Another learned rabbi, named <persName>Judas Halevi</persName>,
<lb/>was born at <placeName>Cologn</placeName>; and after many confer­

<lb/>the prince of the captivity was so well versed
<lb/>in the law and <title>Talmud</title>, that many resorted to
<lb/>her for instruction, and that she read lectures
<lb/>through the lattice of her window, in order to
<lb/>be heard without being seen by her pupils.</p>
            <p>It appears from the <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> annals, that some
<lb/>of the nation have been raised to the highest
<lb/>offices in the courts of princes. Others have
<lb/>acquired applause at the head of armies; in
<lb/>particular, the celebrated <persName>don Solomon</persName>, a Por­
<lb/>tuguese <name>Jew</name>, who was as much distinguished
<lb/>for his knowledge in philosophy, as for his
<lb/>skill in the military department. His merit
<lb/>raised him, in <date when="1190">1190</date>, to the dignity of field-mas­
<lb/>ter-general; and he discharged the duties of
<lb/>his office with such fidelity, that he soon ob­
<lb/>tained the command of the whole army. The
<lb/>envy and jealousy of the <name>Grandees</name> was at length
<lb/>excited by his valour and success. But he
<lb/>subdued their enmity by his remarkable hu­

            <p>In the <date notBefore="1101" notAfter="1200">twelfth century</date> several learned <name>Jews</name>
<lb/>renounced their religion. For instance, <persName>Sam­
<lb/>uel Ben Jehudah</persName>, or, as he is commonly called,
<lb/><persName>Asmouil</persName>, deserted the synagogue, and pro­
<lb/>fessed the <rs type="properAdjective">Mahometan</rs> faith. In order to
<lb/>prove the sincerity of his conversion, in <date when="1174">1174</date>

<lb/>he wrote a book against his nation, in which he
<lb/>charges them with having altered the law of
<lb/><persName>Moses</persName>. This accusation was received with
<lb/>such applause by the <name>Mahometans</name>, that they
<lb/>forbade the quoting or translating any part of
<lb/>the <title>Pentateuch</title> according to the <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> or
<lb/><rs type="properAdjective">Christian</rs> copies.<anchor xml:id="a0511" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0511"/></p>
            <p>One of the <rs type="properAdjective">christian</rs> converts received the
<lb/>name of <persName>Peter Alphonso</persName> at his baptism. After
<lb/>he deserted the synagogue, he wrote dialogues

            <p>It is indeed surprising, that the learned rab­

<lb/>enlighten their nation as to prevent their being

<lb/>greater than in any preceding or subsequent
<lb/>century. In <date when="1137">1137</date>, a false Christ arose in
<lb/><placeName>France</placeName>, and engaged his followers to hold un­
<lb/>lawful assemblies. In consequence of the im­
<lb/>postor's crimes, the government caused many
<lb/>of the synagogues to be demolished. But at

<lb/>were apprehended and put to death.<anchor xml:id="a0513" rend="pre(‡)" corresp="#n0513"/></p>

            <p>The following year the <name>Persians</name> were dis­
<lb/>turbed by a <name>Jew</name> who called himself the Mes­
<lb/>siah; and collected a formidable army of his
<lb/>nation. The <rs type="properAdjective">Persian</rs> monarch hired him to
<lb/>disband his soldiers; but when the stipulated
<lb/>sum was paid, the king finding himself out of
<lb/>danger, compelled the disarmed <name>Jews</name> to reim­
<lb/>burse him the money, and caused the impostor
<lb/>to be beheaded.<anchor xml:id="a0514" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0514"/></p>
            <p>In <date when="1157">1157</date>, another false Messiah appeared in
<lb/><placeName>Spain</placeName>. He was a native of <placeName>Cordova</placeName>, and was
<lb/>supported in his imposture by one of the great­
<lb/>est rabbis in that city, who had previously
<lb/>written a book to prove the near approach of
<lb/>his manifestation by the stars. The majority
<lb/>of the most intelligent <name>Jews</name> regarded him as
<lb/>insane; but the great body of this infatuated
<lb/>people believed in him, and many were ruined
<lb/>by their blind credulity.<anchor xml:id="a0515" rend="pre(†)" corresp="#n0515"/></p>
            <p>Ten years after, another impostor declared
<lb/>that the Messiah would manifest himself in the
<lb/>course of a year. This person appeared in the
<lb/>kingdom of <placeName>Fez</placeName>, and involved the <name>Jews</name>, who
<lb/>were dispersed through the country, in a new
<lb/>persecution.</p>
            <p>The same year an <rs type="properAdjective">Arabian</rs> <name>Jew</name> assumed the
<lb/>title of the Messiah, and pretended to work
<lb/>miracles, and gained many followers. But at

<lb/>length he was apprehended, and brought be­
<lb/>fore the <rs type="properAdjective">Arabian</rs> king. When he was ques­
<lb/>tioned by the monarch, what had induced him
<lb/>to act this imposture, he boldy replied, that he
<lb/>was indeed a prophet sent from God. The
<lb/>king then asked him, what miracle he could
<lb/>perform to confirm his mission? Cut off my
<lb/>head, said he, and I will return to life again.<anchor xml:id="a0516" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0516"/>
<lb/>The monarch took him at his word, promising
<lb/>to believe in him, if his prediction was ful­
<lb/>filled. After his death his deluded followers
<lb/>cherished the expectation, that though he did
<lb/>not immediately rise from the dead, he would
<lb/>at length reanimate their hopes by his appear­
<lb/>ance. But they were compelled to give up
<lb/>the idea, and were severely fined and punished
<lb/>for their blind credulity.<anchor xml:id="a0517" rend="pre(†)" corresp="#n0517"/></p>
            <p>Some time after, a <name>Jew</name> who dwelt beyond
<lb/>the <placeName>Euphrates</placeName>, called himself the Messiah, and
<lb/>drew vast multitudes after him. He founded
<lb/>his pretensions on his having been a leper, and
<lb/>being wonderfully healed in one night of this
<lb/>obstinate disease. The <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> doctors soon
<lb/>persuaded him and his followers, that this sup­
<lb/>posed miracle was not a sufficient evidence of

<lb/>his mission. The populace became ashamed
<lb/>of their blind credulity; but, as they had taken
<lb/>arms in his cause, a fresh persecution was rais­
<lb/>ed against them. One of their writers informs
<lb/>us, that, exhausted with their sufferings on his
<lb/>account, ten thousand of this miserable people
<lb/>renounced their religion; which has rendered
<lb/>the memory of this impostor odious to the
<lb/>whole nation.<anchor xml:id="a0518" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0518"/></p>
            <p>In the year <date when="1174">1174</date>, another pretended Mes­
<lb/>siah arose in <placeName>Persia</placeName>. This impostor seduced
<lb/>multitudes of the common people, and in­
<lb/>volved his nation in a new and severe perse­
<lb/>cution.</p>
            <p>A <name>Jews</name>, named <persName>David Almusser</persName>, appeared in
<lb/><placeName>Moravia</placeName>, in the year <date when="1196">1196</date>, who set up for the
<lb/>Messiah, and boasted that he possessed the
<lb/>power of rendering himself invisible whenever
<lb/>he pleased. Vast multitudes followed him,
<lb/>and were deceived by his artifice. In order to
<lb/>prevent the ill consequences of his popularity,
<lb/>the king promised him his life on condition
<lb/>that he would surrender himself. He com­
<lb/>plied; but the prince caused him to be im­
<lb/>prisoned. He had the address, however, to
<lb/>escape; and for some time eluded all pursuit.
<lb/>At length the king summoned the <name>Jews</name> to de­

            <p><persName>David Alroi</persName>, or <persName>El-David</persName>, was the most
<lb/>famous impostor, who appeared during the
<lb/><date notBefore="1101" notAfter="1200">twelfth century</date>. He was a native of <placeName>Almaria</placeName>,
<lb/>which city contained about one thousand <name>Jews</name>,
<lb/>who paid tribute to the king of <placeName>Persia</placeName>. In the
<lb/>year <date when="1199">1199</date> he assumed the title of the Messiah;
<lb/>and being a man of learning, and well versed
<lb/>in all the arts of deception, he attracted many
<lb/>followers. After he had deluded the populace
<lb/>by his pretended miracles, he prevailed upon
<lb/>them to arm themselves in his cause. The
<lb/><rs type="properAdjective">Persian</rs> king, alarmed at the rapid progress of
<lb/>the insurgents, commanded the impostor to re­
<lb/>pair to court, promising, that if he proved him­
<lb/>self the Messiah, he would acknowledge him
<lb/>as a king, sent from heaven. <persName>El-David</persName>, con­
<lb/>trary to expectation, obeyed the summons,
<lb/>and assured the king that he was really the
<lb/>Messiah. Upon which he was ordered to be
<lb/>imprisoned till he could prove his mission by
<lb/>extricating himself by a miracle. He had the
<lb/>address to escape, and though the king des­

<lb/>On his part he engaged, when the time fix­

            <p>When the appointed time arrived, the king

            <p>The <name>Jews</name> flourished in <placeName>Lithuania</placeName> during the

<lb/>them liberty of conscience and other privileges,
<lb/>which they preserved under his successors.
<lb/>Their prosperity excited the envy of the pop­

<lb/>the council of <placeName>Vienna</placeName>, which was convened in

<lb/>proportion to what they might have considered
<lb/>themselves entitled, had their families been
<lb/><rs type="properAdjective">christian</rs>. The council also enacted, that they
<lb/>should be compelled to demolish the new and
<lb/>superb synagogues which they had erected, and
<lb/>be contented with their former places of wor­

<lb/>The clergy were, therefore, necessitated to

            <p>A new regulation was made at <placeName>Augsburg</placeName>

<lb/>they supposed even these solemn engagements
<lb/>were annulled on the great day of expiation;
<lb/>and could, therefore, be of force for only one

<lb/>to reward them for some important services,
<lb/>treated them with great indulgence, and, at
<lb/>his death, recommended them to the States.
<lb/>But these, instead of allowing them the full
<lb/>enjoyment of their religion, endeavoured to

<lb/><name>christianity</name> upon condition of being permitted
<lb/>to marry into the richest and noblest families
<lb/>in the kingdom. To their great surprise
<lb/>these terms were accepted, and they were
<lb/>obliged to accede to their own proposal.
<lb/>Those, however, who could not form advan­
<lb/>tageous connexions, soon relapsed into <name>Juda­
<lb/>ism</name>. A monk of <placeName>Trani</placeName> resolved to punish
<lb/>them for their dissimulation; and, to effect this
<lb/>purpose, concealed a cross in a heap of earth,
<lb/>and charged a <name>Jew</name> of the city with the fact.
<lb/>Exasperated at this supposed crime, the peo­
<lb/>ple rose, and a massacre immediately followed.
<lb/>The tumult extended to <placeName>Naples</placeName>, where the

<lb/>He excommunicated them; but the anathemas
<lb/>of the church made little impression on that

<lb/>upon pretence of poisoning the rivers, he
<lb/>exerted himself to the utmost to suppress the

<lb/>the cruelty of the inquisition, which raged
<lb/>with unrelenting fury against the <name>Albigenses</name>.
<lb/>Under his protection they even maintained a

<lb/>he was a person of great learning, and very conversant in <rs type="properAdjective">Hebrew</rs>
<lb/>literature, and probably lived much with the <name>Jews</name>, his mentioning

<lb/>the narrative is pronounced fabulous by <persName>Menasses Ben Israel</persName>; and
<lb/>his authority has the greater weight, because, at the very time of
<lb/>the publication in question, he was negotiating with <persName>Cromwell</persName> for

<lb/>composed a concordance to the <rs type="properAdjective">Hebrew</rs> Bible, for the use of his

<lb/>the chapters into verses. And thus, as the <name>Jews</name> borrowed the di­

<lb/>courses which he thought suspicious, went immediately and in­
<lb/>formed the grand master. The suspected persons were instantly

            <p><persName>M. Jacobson</persName> in a letter to the senator
	  <persName>Gregoire</persName>, dated
<date when="1810-12"><name>De­
<lb/>cember</name>, 1810</date>, with a copy of which the latter had the goodness to
<lb/>favour the compiler of this history, observes:</p>
            <quote rend="post()bestow((pre(“))(p))">
              <p>It must be confessed, thanks be given to Providence! several
<lb/>of my establishments fructify, and afford me moments dear to my
<lb/>heart. The sun of light and truth dissipates many a cloud in the
<lb/>house of <name>Jacob</name>.</p>
              <p><placeName>Westphalia</placeName> reckons already many <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> soldiers of different
<lb/>grades, who fight with courage under their beneficent king, and
<lb/>for their new country. A part of the <name>Israelites</name> devote themselves
<lb/>much more than in past times to the arts and sciences. The
<lb/>youths detach themselves more and more from commerce, they
<lb/>apply themselves to trades, and exercise them with success.</p>
              <p>Since all these metamorphoses have been produced within a
<lb/>few years, the future presents to us an interesting prospect, such
<lb/>as every friend of humanity would desire.</p>
              <p>We see the singular phenomenon, that the military service
<lb/>numbers several <name>Israelites</name> who have enlisted of their own accord.
<lb/>Others march from pure patriotism, after having furnished their
<lb/>substitutes, and others serve also as substitutes.</p>
              <p>As President of the Israelitish consistory I labour incessantly
<lb/>in clearing as far as possible the chaos of our interior constitution.
<lb/>Some enlightened rabbis and secular members of the college exert
<lb/>themselves in the same pious work. We already see the country
<pb xml:id="p2146a" corresp="#p2146"/>
<lb/>towns adopt more simple and better regulated courses. We may
<lb/>also hope from that quarter for a more happy and consoling futurity.</p>
              <p>A new regulation relative to the synagogues puts an end to dif­
<lb/>ferent abuses that are found in our divine service, and renders it
<lb/>more worthy of its object.</p>
              <p>Better schools, particularly religious schools, have been estab­
<lb/>lished in different parts of <placeName>Westphalia</placeName>. As for my institute at
<lb/><placeName>Seezen</placeName>, I particularly apply myself to educate in it artisans and ar­
<lb/>tists.</p>
              <p>I have caused to be raised in the inclosure, a temple of a beau­
<lb/>tiful style and regular architecture. I have caused to be built in it
<lb/>an organ. <choice><sic>i</sic><corr>I</corr></choice>t is surmounted by a tower and bell.</p>
              <p rend="post(”)">On the <date when="1810-07-17">seventeenth of
<name>July</name>, 1810</date>, I celebrated the dedication
<lb/>of the Temple. The ceremony was august and solemn, notwith­
<lb/>standing every thing breathed in it the most open gaiety. There
<lb/>were present several hundreds of all religious denominations, par­
<lb/>ticularly <rs type="properAdjective">Catholick</rs>, <rs type="properAdjective">Lutheran</rs>, and Reformed clergymen, besides

            <p><persName>Mr. de Chateaubriand</persName>, a celebrated French author, who visit­
<lb/>ed <placeName>Palestine</placeName> in the year <date when="1807">1807</date>, has given the following account of
<lb/>the miserable condition of the <name>Jews</name> who still reside in <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>.</p>
            <p>After a striking description of the piety and humanity of the
<lb/><rs type="properAdjective">christian</rs> monks who constantly perform their devotions at the
<lb/>tomb of our Saviour, he observes, <quote>While the <placeName>New Jerusalem</placeName> is
<lb/>seen shining in the midst of the desert, you may observe between
<lb/><placeName>Mount Zion</placeName> and the temple, another spectacle of almost equal in­
<lb/>terest; it is that of the remnants of another people, distinct from
<lb/>the rest of the inhabitants; a people individually the objects of
<lb/>universal contempt; who suffer the most wanton outrages without
<lb/>a murmur; who endure wounds and blows without a sigh; who,
<lb/>when the sacrifice of their life is demanded, unhesitatingly stretch
<lb/>forth their necks to the sabre. If a member of the community
<lb/>thus cruelly proscribed and abused happens to die, his companion
<lb/>buries him clandestinely during the night in the valley of <placeName>Josaphat</placeName>,
<lb/>within the purlieus of the <name>temple of Solomon</name>. Enter their habita­
<lb/>tion and you find them in the most abject squalid misery, and for the
<lb/>most part occupied in reading a mysterious book to their children,
<lb/>with whom again it becomes a manual for the instruction of suc­
<lb/>ceeding generations. What these wretched outlaws from the jus­
<lb/>tice and compassion of the rest of mankind did in past ages, they
<lb/>do still. Six times they have witnessed the destruction of <placeName>Jerusa­
<lb/>lem</placeName>, and are not yet discouraged; nothing can operate to divert
<lb/>their looks from <placeName>Zion</placeName>. We are surprised, no doubt, when we ob­
<lb/>serve the <name>Jews</name> scattered over the face of the earth; but to expe­
<lb/>rience an astonishment more lively, we have but to seek them
<pb xml:id="p2190a" corresp="#p2190"/>
<lb/>in <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>. The legitimate masters of <placeName>Judea</placeName> should be seen as
<lb/>they are in their own land, slaves and strangers; they should be
<lb/>seen awaiting, under the most cruel and oppressive of all despo­
<lb/>tisms, a king who is to work their deliverance. Near the temple
<lb/>of which there does not remain <quote rend="slant(italic)">one stone upon another,</quote> they
<lb/>still continue to dwell; and with the cross as it were planted upon
<lb/>their heads, and bending them to the earth, still cling to their er­
<lb/>rours, and labour under the same deplorable infatuation.</quote><bibl rend="pre(—)slant(italic)"><title>Ameri­

              <quote>In the peace of God, the king, which has made the earth ac­
<lb/>cording to his pleasure. To this God I, <persName>Airvi Brahmin</persName>, have lifted
<lb/>up my hand, and have granted by this deed, which many hundred
<lb/>thousand years shall run—I, dwelling at <placeName>Cranganor</placeName>, have granted,
<lb/>in the thirty sixth year of my reign, in the strength of power I

<lb/>the name and dignity; to have the lamp of the day; to walk upon
<lb/>carpets spread upon the earth; and to have trumpets and cymbals

<lb/>be <quote rend="post()">chief and governour of the houses of congregation, (the syna­

<lb/>What proves the importance of the <name>Jews</name> at the period when this
<lb/>grant was made is, that it is signed by seven kings as witnesses.
<lb/>There is no date in this document, further than what may be col­
<lb/>lected from the reign of the prince, and the names of the royal wit­
<lb/>nesses. Dates are not usual in old Malabaric writings. One fact
<lb/>is evident, that the <name>Jews</name> must have existed a considerable time in
<lb/>the country before they could have obtained such a grant. The
<lb/>tradition before mentioned assigns for the date of the transaction,
<lb/>the year of the creation 4250, which is, in <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> computation, <date when="0490">A.D.
<lb/>490</date>. It is well known, that the famous <rs type="properAdjective">Malabaric</rs> king, <persName>Ceram

<lb/>tus</persName>, seventy or eighty thousand <name>Israelites</name> penetrated as far as the
<lb/>coast of <placeName>Malabar</placeName>. The king <persName>Cheram Iberimal</persName> assembled, and gave
<lb/>them the city of <placeName>Cranganor</placeName>, with a certain extent of territory and
<lb/>divers privileges, which were engraven on tables of brass. These
<lb/><name>Israelites</name> brought two trumpets of which the <name>Levites</name> in the tem­
<lb/>ple made use. <placeName>Cranganor</placeName> having at length been taken from
<lb/>them, they took refuge in <placeName>Cochin</placeName>.</quote>

            <p><quote>The <name>Jews</name> of <placeName>Cochin</placeName>,</quote> says our author, <quote>loaded him with ci­
<lb/>vilities, and gave him a number of entertainments. Though the
<lb/>climate had rendered them so swarthy that they were almost mu­
<lb/>latoes, they would have considered themselves dishonoured, if they
<lb/>had eaten, drank, or prayed with the black or negro <name>Jews</name> of <placeName>Mal­
<lb/>abar</placeName>, because the last were descended from the slaves in the ser­
<lb/>vice of the <name>Jews</name> at <placeName>Cranganor</placeName>, who were afterwards emancipated.
<lb/>The negro <name>Jews</name> had nine synagogues, three in <placeName>Cochin</placeName>, and the
<lb/>others in the vicinity. In the French translation of the travels of
<lb/><persName>P. Paulin de St. Barthelemy</persName> it is said they formed four hundred
<lb/>and sixty families.</quote> This account is copied verbatim from the re­
<lb/>lation of <persName>Paiva</persName>; and the elements of which his calculation is com­
<lb/>posed give as a total number four hundred and sixty five. The other
<lb/><name>Jews</name> ground their aversion towards them on the pretence that the

<lb/>when the subject is concerning themselves as a nation; for though

<lb/>let my right hand forget her cunning.</quote> They speak of <placeName>Palestine</placeName>
<lb/>as being close at hand, and easily accessible. It is become an ordi­

<lb/>thusiasm of the credulous people, and prepar­

            <p>At this period <persName>Zabathai <ref xml:id="er05" type="error" target="#ec03">Trevi</ref></persName> proclaimed
<lb/>himself the Messiah and deliverer of <name>Israel</name>, to
<lb/>whom he promised a glorious kingdom of
<lb/>prosperity and peace. This famous, or rather
<lb/>infamous impostor, was born at <placeName>Aleppo</placeName>, of
<lb/>mean and obscure parents. But, as he early
<lb/>discovered a taste for learning, he made great
<lb/>proficiency in that kind of literature which
<lb/>was taught by his nation. As soon as he came
<lb/>from school he began to preach in the streets
<lb/>and field, even before the <name>Turks</name>; and though
<lb/>ridiculed by them, he had the address to gain
<lb/>a number of disciples by whom he was great­
<lb/>ly admired. He studied the prophecies so as­
<lb/>siduously, in order to apply them to himself,
<lb/>that it was supposed his intellect was derang­
<lb/>ed. He imagined, or pretended to fancy, that
<lb/>he could ascend above the clouds, as <persName>Isaiah</persName> had
<lb/>foretold; and upbraided his disciples with their
<lb/>blindness, because they would not acknowl­
<lb/>edge they had seen him in the air. He also
<lb/>pretended to perform other miracles by the
<lb/>power of the name <name>Jehovah</name>. Upon which ac­
<lb/>count, some of the most intelligent <name>Jews</name> sum­

<lb/>moned him to appear before the synagogues,
<lb/>and condemned him to death. But, as they
<lb/>could not prevail upon any to execute the sen­
<lb/>tence, they contented themselves with banish­
<lb/>ing the impostor.</p>
            <p>He passed over to <placeName>Salonichi</placeName>, and, as the
<lb/><name>Jews</name> were numerous in this city, he supposed
<lb/>it a proper theatre on which to act his part.
<lb/>But being expelled from thence, as well as
<lb/>from <placeName>Athens</placeName> and several other <rs type="properAdjective">Greek</rs> towns, he
<lb/>retired to <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, where he acquired great
<lb/>celebrity. After travelling into the <placeName>Morea</placeName> and
<lb/><placeName>Tripoli</placeName> he arrived at <placeName>Gaza</placeName>, and there preach­
<lb/>ed repentance, and faith in himself so effectual­
<lb/>ly, that the <name>Jews</name> gave up <mcr xml:id="a0747" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n0747">business</mcr> and ap­
<lb/>plied themselves wholly to devotion and alms.
<lb/>But in order to render his character more
<lb/>agreeable to the predictions of the prophets, it
<lb/>was necessary that he should be ushered in by
<lb/>a precursor. For this purpose he made choice
<lb/>of a <name>Jew</name> of great reputation at <placeName>Gaza</placeName>, named
<lb/><persName>Nathan Levi</persName>, whom he easily persuaded to
<lb/>act this part. The time was favourable, for

<lb/>was to be celebrated in the month of <date when="--06"><name>June</name></date> fol­
<lb/>lowing, because mourning was improper at the
<lb/>joyful period of the Messiah's appearance.
<lb/>He then declared <persName><ref xml:id="er07" type="error" target="#ec03">Trevi</ref></persName> was their long expect­
<lb/>ed deliverer, and specified the time for the con­
<lb/>quest and ruin of the Grand Seignor. Part of
<lb/>the nation believed in the impostor; but the
<lb/>most sensible men among them clearly perceiv­
<lb/>ed, that the intended insurrection would cause
<lb/>their destruction in the <name>Ottoman empire</name>.
<lb/>They, therefore, anathematized and condemn­
<lb/>ed him to death, alleging that he neither pos­
<lb/>sessed the characteristicks of the Messiah, nor
<lb/><persName>Levi</persName> those of his precursor.</p>
            <p>Being obliged to quit <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, he came
<lb/>to <placeName>Smyrna</placeName>, and from thence to <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>,
<lb/>where he expected to gain numerous disciples.
<lb/>But the <name>Jews</name> in this city had previously re­
<lb/>ceived letters from twenty five rabbis, who
<lb/>had excommunicated him, in which they pro­
<lb/>nounced him <quote>an impious wretch, and de­

<lb/>many souls.</quote> This induced <persName><ref xml:id="er08" type="error" target="#ec03">Trevi</ref></persName> to return
<lb/><placeName>Smyrna</placeName>, where he received four ambassa­
<lb/>dors sent by his precursor to acknowledge
<lb/>him as the Messiah. As <persName>Levi</persName> was a man of
<lb/>eminence among his brethren, this embassy
<lb/>greatly increased the followers of the impos­
<lb/>tor, and even imposed upon part of the learn­
<lb/>ed rabbis. The multitude, dazzled by his af­
<lb/>fected humility, frequent washings, diligent
<lb/>and early attendance at the synagogues, and
<lb/>more especially by his pathetick sermons, ac­
<lb/>knowledged him for their Messiah and king,
<lb/>and brought him magnificent presents to sup­
<lb/>port his dignity.<anchor xml:id="a0749" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0749"/></p>
            <p>In the mean time <persName>Levi</persName> was employed in
<lb/>persuading his nation in different parts, that
<lb/><persName><ref xml:id="er09" type="error" target="#ec03">Trevi</ref></persName> was their long expected deliverer, who
<lb/>was about to subvert the <placeName>Ottoman empire</placeName>.
<lb/>He asserted that, after being concealed nine
<lb/>months, this mighty conqueror would appear
<lb/>in glory, mounted upon a celestial lion; and
<lb/>that a superb temple would descend from
<lb/>heaven, in which sacrifices were continually to
<lb/>be offered. While <persName>Levi</persName> was at <placeName>Damascus</placeName>, he
<lb/>wrote to <persName><ref xml:id="er10" type="error" target="#ec03">Trevi</ref></persName>, and thus began his letter,

            <p>At this period, the <name>Jews</name> in all the <rs type="properAdjective">Turkish</rs>
<lb/>dominions entertained great expectations of
<lb/>glorious times. They were devout and peni­
<lb/>tent, prayed, fasted, and inflicted severe pen­
<lb/>ances upon themselves. Business was neg­
<lb/>lected, superfluities were sold, and the poor
<lb/>provided for by immense contributions.<anchor xml:id="a0750" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0750"/></p>
            <p>The <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> doctors at <placeName>Smyrna</placeName> convened
<lb/>again to consult upon an affair which daily be­
<lb/>came more important. The most judicious
<lb/>among them, not finding the character of the
<lb/>Messiah in <persName><ref xml:id="er12" type="error" target="#ec03">Trevi</ref></persName>, condemned him to death.
<lb/>But the impostor's party being far the most
<lb/>numerous, he caused them to assemble in the
<lb/>great synagogue in this city, celebrated a new
<lb/>feast, repeatedly pronounced the name <name>Jehovah</name>,
<lb/>and altered the <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> liturgy. His audience
<lb/>acknowledged his authority, and supposed they
<lb/>beheld something divine in his person. A
<lb/>third sentence of death pronounced by the rab­
<lb/>bis did not intimidate him, because he was
<lb/>convinced none would presume to execute it.
<lb/>He repaired, however, to the cadi, whom his
<lb/>friends had found means to gain, and put him­
<lb/>self under his protection.</p>

            <p>Some of the credulous multitude affirmed,
<lb/>that fire proceeded from his mouth when he
<lb/>addressed the cadi, that a pillar of fire had ter­
<lb/>rified the <rs type="properAdjective">Turkish</rs> governour, and deterred him
<lb/>from putting <persName><ref xml:id="er13" type="error" target="#ec03">Trevi</ref></persName> to death. The multitude
<lb/>conducted him from the cadi's presence in
<lb/>triumph, singing these words from <regMe>Psalm
<lb/>cxviii. 16</regMe>, <quote>The right hand of the Lord is ex­
<lb/>alted,</quote> &amp;c.<anchor xml:id="a0751" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0751"/></p>
            <p>The next step taken by the impostor was to
<lb/>cause a throne to be erected for himself and his
<lb/>queen, from which he addressed his subjects.
<lb/>He composed a new summary of belief, which
<lb/>the people were obliged to receive with im­
<lb/>plicit faith, as coming from the hand of their
<lb/>Messiah. Some, who had the temerity to op­
<lb/>pose it, were compelled to save themselves by
<lb/>flight. Many who had been incredulous now
<lb/>professed to believe in him to whom they ap­
<lb/>plied the prophecies of the <rs type="title">Old Testament</rs>.
<lb/>When he had attained this height of authority,
<lb/>he ordered the <name>Jews</name>, who were in the habit of
<lb/>praying for the grand seignor in their syna­
<lb/>gogues, to erase his name from their liturgy,
<lb/>and substitute his own. He styled himself
<lb/><quote>King of the kings of <name>Israel</name>,</quote> and <persName>Joseph</persName> his
<lb/>brother, <quote>King of the kings of <name>Judah</name>;</quote> he

<lb/>also elected princes to govern his brethren in
<lb/>their march to the holy land, and to administer
<lb/>justice to them after they obtained the posses­
<lb/>sion of their beloved country. At length, he
<lb/>declared he was called of God to visit <placeName>Con­
<lb/>stantinople</placeName>, where he had a great work to per­
<lb/>form; and accordingly embarked in a small
<lb/>vessel for this city, while many of his disciples
<lb/>followed him by land. The sultan, being in­
<lb/>formed of his arrival, despatched orders to
<lb/>his vizier to apprehend and confine him in
<lb/>prison.<anchor xml:id="a0752" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0752"/></p>
            <p>This event, instead of discouraging, strength­
<lb/>ened the faith of the <name>Jews</name>; for they recollected
<lb/>that <persName>Levi</persName> had predicted, that the Messiah was
<lb/>to be concealed nine months. They main­
<lb/>tained that the sultan had not power to put him
<lb/>to death. The criminal, upon his examination,
<lb/>asserted that his nation had compelled him to
<lb/>assume the title of king. This answer induced
<lb/>the vizier to treat him with great mildness,
<lb/>and permit the <name>Jews</name> to visit him in prison.
<lb/>Those of <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> were as infatuated as
<lb/>their brethren in <placeName>Smyrna</placeName>. They forbade com­
<lb/>merce, and refused to pay their debts. Some
<lb/>English merchants not knowing how to recov­
<lb/>er what was owing to them from the <name>Jews</name>,

<lb/>took this occasion to visit <placeName>Tzevi</placeName>, and make
<lb/>their complaints to him against his subjects;
<lb/>upon which he wrote to them as follows:</p>

              <quote xml:id="a0753" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n0753">To you of the nation of the <name>Jews</name>, who ex­

<lb/>to us to order you to make satisfaction for
<lb/>your just debts, which, if you refuse to do, be

<lb/>our joys and dominions.</quote>

            <p><persName>Tzevi</persName> remained a prisoner in <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>

<lb/>the price of provisions upon those who visited
<lb/>their pretended Messiah, and the profit in­
<lb/>duced them to connive at the attention which

            <p>The impostor, during his confinement, com­
<lb/>manded the <name>Jews</name> to celebrate his birth day
<lb/>with feasting, illuminations, and musick; and
<lb/>abolished the solemn fast which had been ob­

<lb/>dors to various parts to proclaim him the Mes­

<lb/>in the cabbala and eastern languages. It is

<lb/>tures there ought to be a twofold Messiah; one
<lb/>the son of <persName>Ephraim</persName>, a poor and despised teach­

<lb/>a mighty conqueror. <persName>Nehemiah</persName> was contented
<lb/>to be the former, and leave the dignity and
<lb/>glory of the latter to <persName>Tzevi</persName>. But he accused
<lb/>him of too great forwardness and presumption
<lb/>in assuming the character of the son of <persName>David</persName>
<lb/>previously to the appearance of the son of
<lb/><persName>Ephraim</persName>. <persName>Tzevi</persName>, exasperated at this reproof,
<lb/>excluded <persName>Cohen</persName> from any share in the trans­
<lb/>action. Upon which the latter went to <placeName>Adri­
<lb/>anople</placeName>, and informed the ministers of state, that
<lb/>the impostor was a dangerous person, who
<lb/>sought to subvert the <rs type="properAdjective">Turkish</rs> government.
<lb/>The grand seignior, at the request of his prin­

<lb/>in making this glorious profession of the true

            <p>The news of <persName>Tzevi's</persName> having embraced the
<lb/><rs type="properAdjective">Mahometan</rs> religion soon spread through the
<lb/><rs type="properAdjective">Turkish</rs> dominions. His deluded followers
<lb/>were filled with consternation, grief, and
<lb/>shame, and exposed to the contempt and de­
<lb/>rision of their enemies. Several of the <name>Jews</name>
<lb/>still continued to use, in their publick worship,
<lb/>the forms prescribed by this <rs type="properAdjective">Mahometan</rs> Mes­

            <p>During these transactions, the <name>Jews</name>, in more
<lb/>remote parts, instead of attending to commerce,
<lb/>wrote letters to their brethren, filled with ac­
<lb/>counts of the wonderful works performed by
<lb/><persName>Tzevi</persName> their Messiah. They reported, that
<lb/>when the grand seignior sent messengers to
<lb/>apprehend him, he caused them all to be
<lb/>struck dead; but upon being requested, re­
<lb/>called them to life. They added that though
<lb/>the prison in which <persName>Zabathai</persName> was confined
<lb/>was fastened with strong iron locks, he was
<lb/>seen to walk the streets with numerous attend­
<lb/>ants, and that his chains were converted into

<lb/><name>Jews</name> of <placeName>Italy</placeName> sent legates to <placeName>Smyrna</placeName> to inquire
<lb/>into the truth of these reports, who, upon
<lb/>their arrival, were mortified and astonished at
<lb/>the intelligence, that their pretended Messiah
<lb/>had embraced the <rs type="properAdjective">Mahometan</rs> faith. But the
<lb/>brother of <persName>Tzevi</persName> attempted to persuade them
<lb/>that it was only his apparition which appeared
<lb/>in a <rs type="properAdjective">Turkish</rs> habit; that he had been trans­
<lb/>lated to heaven, and that God would again
<lb/>send him down to earth at a proper season.
<lb/>He added, that <persName>Nathan</persName> his precursor, who had
<lb/>wrought many miracles, would soon arrive at
<lb/><placeName>Smyrna</placeName>, reveal hidden things, and confirm
<lb/>their faith. But this pretended <persName>Elias</persName> was not

            <p>The moderation of <persName>Reuchlin</persName> exposed him

            <p>The progress of the reformation in <placeName>Ger­

            <p>Notwithstanding these oppressions, this king­

<lb/>and perplexed by the miseries of a captivity
<lb/>protracted through sixteen centuries, resolved
<lb/>to hold a national council for the complete in­
<lb/>vestigation of the great question, whether <mcr rend="slant(italic)">the
<lb/>Messiah was already come</mcr>. The plain of <placeName>Age­
<lb/>da</placeName>, about <measure>thirty leagues</measure> from <placeName>Buda</placeName>, was se­
<lb/>lected for the assembly. This place was chosen
<lb/>on account of the war between the <name>Turks</name> and
<lb/>king of <placeName>Hungary</placeName>, both parties having given
<lb/>the nation permission to convene in this part
<lb/>of the country. Three hundred of the most
<lb/>eminent rabbis, and a vast multitude of other
<lb/><name>Jews</name>, assisted at the council; and <persName>Zechariah</persName>,
<lb/>of the tribe of <name>Levi</name>, was chosen their president
<lb/>and speaker.<anchor xml:id="a0812" rend="pre(†)" corresp="#n0812"/></p>

            <p>After the assembly had excluded all who
<lb/>could not prove themselves of <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> origin,
<lb/>the president thus proposed the following
<lb/>question: <quote>We have convened in this place to
<lb/>examine whether the Messiah is really come,
<lb/>or whether we must still expect his appear­
<lb/>ance?</quote> Some professed themselves inclined
<lb/>to believe that he had already come, since the
<lb/>calamities which their nation had suffered dur­
<lb/>ing a series of ages could not be owing to
<lb/>their idolatry, a crime which they had careful­
<lb/>ly avoided since their return from the Babylo­
<lb/>nian captivity. But the majority of the coun­
<lb/>cil agreed, that the Messiah had not appeared,
<lb/>and that his delay was owing to their sins and
<lb/>impenitence.<anchor xml:id="a0813" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0813"/></p>
            <p>They next debated in what manner their

<lb/>self; and readily agreed, that he would appear
<lb/>as a mighty conqueror, and deliver them from
<lb/>all foreign dominion. After the session had
<lb/>continued six days, a learned rabbi, named
<lb/><persName>Abraham</persName>, strenuously urged upon the council
<lb/>the necessity and propriety of strictly examining
<lb/>into the pretensions of the <rs type="properAdjective">Christian</rs> Messiah,
<lb/><persName>Jesus of <placeName>Nazareth</placeName></persName>. The <name>Pharisees</name>, who over­
<lb/>ruled the assembly, answered, that he could
<lb/>not be that distinguished personage, because
<lb/>he appeared in a humble and despised state; but
<lb/>the Messiah was to manifest himself in a glo­
<lb/>rious and triumphant manner. <persName>Abraham</persName>, who
<lb/>was dissatisfied with the Pharisaic reasoning,
<lb/>strongly insisted upon Christ's miracles, and
<lb/>asked by what power he could perform them?
<lb/><persName>Zebedee</persName>, one of the chiefs of this sect, answer­
<lb/>ed, that <quote>he wrought them by the magic art.</quote>
<lb/><persName>Abraham</persName> replied, that <quote xml:id="a0814" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n0814">no magic art could
<lb/>give sight, hearing, and speech to those who
<lb/>were born blind, deaf, or dumb.</quote></p>
            <p>It appears, that, in consequence of the re­
<lb/>monstrances of this learned rabbi, some Chris­
<lb/>tian priests were admitted, and asked to ex­
<lb/>plain the nature and grounds of their faith.
<lb/>These priests were <name>Roman Catholicks</name>, who,

<lb/>emonies, and authority of their church. The
<lb/>council, highly irritated, exclaimed, in a tumul­
<lb/>tuous manner, <quote><emph rend="slant(italic)">No Christ! No God-man!
<lb/>No intercession of saints! No worship of im­
<lb/>ages! No prayers to the virgin <persName>Mary</persName>!</emph></quote> They
<lb/>also rent their clothes, and cast dust upon their
<lb/>heads, crying, <quote>blasphemy! blasphemy!</quote> In
<lb/>this manner they broke up the assembly, and
<lb/>refused to receive any further information re­
<lb/>specting Christ.<anchor xml:id="a0815" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0815"/></p>
            <p>The assembly met again only to agree upon
<lb/>another council, which was to be held three
<lb/>years after in <placeName>Syria</placeName>. It is said, that some of
<lb/>the <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> doctors acknowledged that what
<lb/>had passed had rendered them wavering and
<lb/>unsettled in their former belief; and that they
<lb/>expressed a desire to converse with some
<lb/><rs type="properAdjective">protestant</rs> divines. But the presence of so
<lb/>many monks deterred them, and made them
<lb/>apprehend some tragical conclusion to the as­

<lb/>The pretended demoniacs, being accordingly

<lb/>One third of the <name>Israelites</name> in <placeName>Rome</placeName> were oblig­

            <p>In process of time <persName>Orobio</persName>, being suspected
<lb/>of <name>Judaism</name>, was suddenly seized and thrown
<lb/>into the inquisition, where he suffered such ex­

<lb/>Sometimes he imagined that his past life was
<lb/>only a dream, and that the dungeon in which
<lb/>he was confined was his true birth place, and
<lb/>would also prove the place of his death. At
<lb/>other times, as he had a very metaphysical
<lb/>turn, he first formed arguments of that kind,
<lb/>and then resolved them, acting thus the three
<lb/>different parts of opponent, respondent, and
<lb/>moderator at the same time. In this way he
<lb/>diverted himself from time to time, and not­
<lb/>withstanding the cruel tortures which he en­
<lb/>dured, had the fortitude constantly to deny
<lb/>that he was a <name>Jew</name>. At last, after three years
<lb/>confinement, the inquisitors, finding themselves
<lb/>baffled by his perseverance, ordered his wounds

<lb/>by <persName>rabbi Uziel</persName>, and made such rapid progress
<lb/>in this and other branches of knowledge, that,
<lb/>after his tutor's death, he was chosen to suc­
<lb/>ceed him in the rabbinical chair at <placeName>Amsterdam</placeName>
<lb/>when he was only eighteen years old. At the
<lb/>age of fifteen he began to preach, and his dis­
<lb/>courses at that early period were highly ap­
<lb/>plauded by his brethren. He pursued his

<lb/>which was reprinted six years after with ad­

            <p><persName>Uriel Acosta</persName> was born in <placeName>Portugal</placeName> towards
<lb/>the close of the <date notBefore="1501" notAfter="1600">sixteenth century</date>. His parents

<lb/>father, however, was really a <name>Christian</name>, and
<lb/>carefully instilled the principles of religion in­
<lb/>to the mind of his son. It appears, by <persName>Acosta's</persName>
<lb/>account of his life, that he received a liberal
<lb/>education, and, having been instructed in var­
<lb/>ious sciences, applied himself to the study of
<lb/>the law, and afterward had an ecclesiastical
<lb/>benefice. The activity and zeal he exhibited
<lb/>in the service of the church, his assiduity in

<lb/>the sacred scriptures, his regular and exem­

    <mw type="pageNum">103</mw>

<lb/>which he then began to feel respecting religion
<lb/>disturbed all his happiness. Being terrified
<lb/>with the idea of suffering eternal death, he
<lb/>sought relief by conforming to all the precepts
<lb/>of the church, by assiduously studying the
<lb/>scriptures, and consulting the creed of the
<lb/>confessors. But still his distress increased;
<lb/>and at length, being reduced to a state of de­
<lb/>spair, he experienced the most terrible mental
<lb/>agonies.<anchor xml:id="a0896" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0896"/></p>
            <p>After <persName>Acosta</persName> had decided that he could not
<lb/>be saved by the religion he had imbibed in his
<lb/>infancy, he began to inquire into the grounds
<lb/>and reasons of his faith. These inquiries ren­
<lb/>dered him more and more wavering and unde­
<lb/>cided; and his dissatisfaction with the <rs type="properAdjective">Roman</rs>
<lb/><rs type="properAdjective">Catholick</rs> church induced him to study <rs type="properAdjective">Jew­
<lb/>ish</rs> authors until, at length, he became a con­
<lb/>vert to the religion of his ancestors. But as
<lb/>he could not profess <name>Judaism</name> in <placeName>Portugal</placeName>, he
<lb/>gave up an honourable and profitable employ­
<lb/>ment, left an elegant house which his father
<lb/>had built in the most delightful part of <placeName>Lisbon</placeName>,
<lb/>and embarked for <placeName>Amsterdam</placeName> with his mother

            <p>It was not long, however, before he dis­
<lb/>covered, to use his own words, <quote>that the
<lb/>modern <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> rabbis were an obstinate and
<lb/>perverse race of men, strenuous advocates for
<lb/>the odious sect of the <name>Pharisees</name> and their in­
<lb/>stitutions.</quote> He declared that they did not
<lb/>conform to the law of <persName>Moses</persName> either in their
<lb/>rites, or morals, and censured their conduct
<lb/>with the utmost asperity. The chiefs of the
<lb/>synagogue, however, gave him to understand,
<lb/>that he must exactly observe their tenets and
<lb/>customs; and that his deviation from them,
<lb/>even in the minutest points, would expose him
<lb/>to excommunication. But this threat did not
<lb/>intimidate him; and, having left an elegant sit­
<lb/>uation in his native country purely to enjoy
<lb/>the liberty of professing his sentiments with
<lb/>freedom, he thought it would show both want
<lb/>of courage and piety to submit to a set of rab­
<lb/>bis without any proper jurisdiction. He, there­
<lb/>fore, persisted in his invectives, and was ex­
<lb/>communicated. In consequence of this sen­
<lb/>tence his own brothers dared not to speak to

<lb/>him, not salute him when they met him in the

            <p><persName>Acosta</persName> wrote a book in his justification,
<lb/>wherein he endeavoured to shew, that the rites
<lb/>and traditions of the <name>Pharisees</name> were contrary
<lb/>to the writings of <persName>Moses</persName>; and soon after adop­
<lb/>ted the opinion of the <name>Sadducees</name>. His adver­
<lb/>saries were overjoyed at this change in his sen­
<lb/>timents, which they foresaw would tend great­
<lb/>ly to justify, in the sight of the <name>Christians</name>, the
<lb/>proceedings of the synagogue against him.
<lb/>They, therefore, made application to the mag­
<lb/>istrates of <placeName>Amsterdam</placeName>, and represented him as
<lb/>a person who endeavoured to undermine the
<lb/>foundation both of the <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> and <rs type="properAdjective">Christian</rs> re­
<lb/>ligions. Upon this information he was thrown
<lb/>into prison, but bailed out in about ten days
<lb/>after. However, all the copies of his works
<lb/>were seized, and he himself fined <measure>three hun­
<lb/>dred florins</measure>. Yet he was not deterred from
<lb/>proceeding still farther in his scepticism, and,
<lb/>at length, he not only denied the authority of
<lb/>the <rs type="properAdjective">Mosaic</rs> law, but the truth of all revealed
<lb/>religion.<anchor xml:id="a0898" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0898"/></p>

<lb/>from professing <name>Judaism</name>. He was summoned

<lb/><persName>Acosta</persName>, however, found with astonishment

<lb/>miliation, being dressed in mourning with a
<lb/>black torch in his hand. After reading a re­
<lb/>cantation of his errours, and confessing that he
<lb/>deserved a thousand deaths, he was subjected
<lb/>to a severe and disgraceful corporal punish­

            <p><persName>Acosta</persName> was so highly exasperated at the

            <p><persName>Benedict Spinoza</persName>, another extraordinary

<lb/>father was originally a native of <placeName>Portugal</placeName>, and
<lb/>by profession a merchant. After having learnt
<lb/><name>Latin</name> of a sceptical physician, <persName>Spinoza</persName> applied
<lb/>himself for many years to the study of theol­
<lb/>ogy, but began very early to be dissatisfied
<lb/>with the <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> religion; and, as his temper
<lb/>was naturally open, he did not attempt to con­
<lb/>ceal his doubts from the synagogue. The
<lb/><name>Jews</name>, it is said, offered to tolerate his infidelity,
<lb/>and even promised him a pension of <measure>one thou­
<lb/>sand dollars</measure> per annum, if he would continue
<lb/>externally to practise their ceremonies. If this
<lb/>proposal was really made, and he rejected it,
<lb/>his refusal was owing to his dislike of hypoc­
<lb/>risy, or rather from a fear of the restraint it
<lb/>would impose upon him. He also refused a
<lb/>very considerable fortune to the prejudice of
<lb/>the natural heirs, and learnt the art of polishing

<lb/>a <name>Jew</name>, as he was coming from the theatre.
<lb/>The wound was slight; but he believed the as­
<lb/>sassin designed to murder him. From that
<lb/>time he separated from his brethren, which was
<lb/>the reason of his exommunication. After
<lb/>leaving the synagogue he professed to be a

<lb/>churches of the <name>Lutherans</name> and <name>Calvinists</name>, but
<lb/>frequently exhorted others to attend, and high­
<lb/>ly recommended some particular preachers.
<lb/>But that he was only outwardly a <name>Christian</name> ap­
<lb/>pears not only from his writings, but from
<lb/>many anecdotes which are preserved of his
<lb/>life. The <name>Jews</name>, finding all their attempts

            <p>In his exile he studied mathematicks and

            <p><persName>Cromwell</persName> was inclined to recall the <name>Jews</name>;
<lb/>but, being apprized of the unpopularity of the

<lb/>a convention of divines and other influential
<lb/>men to debate whether it would be advisable

<lb/>declared to the assembly, <said>that since there was

<lb/>strenuously opposed their return, and alleged,

<lb/>possessing synagogues was not only an evil in
<lb/>itself, but a scandal to all <rs type="properAdjective">christian</rs> churches.
<lb/>The intolerant sentiments advanced in this
<lb/>assembly convinced the protector that the

<lb/>He, therefore, dismissed the assembly, saying,

<lb/>not a single act of the <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> legislature was

<lb/>It is even said, that they offered to prove

<lb/>tending other business, were several times in­
<lb/>dulged by the protector with a private audi­
<lb/>ence. They offered to purchase all the He­
<lb/>brew books and manuscripts belonging to the
<lb/><orgName>university of Cambridge</orgName>, but he rejected the
<lb/>proposal with contempt. They afterwards, it
<lb/>is said, embraced an opportunity to inquire
<lb/>among his relations where he was born, and
<lb/>whether any of his ancestors in the male line
<lb/>could not be proved of <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> origin. These
<lb/>inquiries, however, were not conducted with

<lb/>transpired at <placeName>London</placeName>; and, on account of the

            <p>Soon after, another deputation, with <persName>Me­

            <p>The <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> ministry countenanced and en­

<lb/>contract a warm attachment to the English

            <p>On the other hand those who opposed the

<lb/>they were admitted to the rank of citizens they
<lb/>would engross the whole commerce of the

<lb/>prophecies, were to remain without country or
<lb/>habitation until they should be converted and
<lb/>collected together in the land of their ances­

            <p>This act, which during the last session had

            <p>It is but justice to the <name>Jews</name> to acknowledge,
<lb/>that the learning and liberality of mind exhib­

<lb/>which have been taken in their favour. Among
<lb/>those who have promoted the literary improve­

<lb/>tinguished.</p>
            <p>This illustrious philosopher was born at
<lb/><placeName>Dessau</placeName>, a city of <placeName>Anhalt</placeName> in upper <placeName>Saxony</placeName>, in
<lb/><date when="1729">1729</date>. He received the rudiments of his ed­

<lb/>school-master. In these schools, which were
<lb/>formed merely for the children of the <name>Hebrews</name>,
<lb/>the summit of their education terminated with
<lb/>an introduction to the <title>Talmud</title>, and the student
<lb/>wasted the season of youth in studying this

            <p><persName>Mendolsohn</persName>, who possessed a vigorous and

<lb/>acquire knowledge, soon selected from the
<lb/>mass of rabbinical writings the superior works
<lb/>of <persName>Maimonides</persName>. But such was his intense

    <pb xml:id="p2133" n="133"/><milestone unit="sig" n="M6r"/><mw type="pageNum">133</mw><lb/>application, and the irritability of his frame,
<lb/>that, at the early age of ten years, he was at­
<lb/>tacked with a nervous disorder of a very pe­
<lb/>culiar nature. In addition to this misfortune,
<lb/>he suffered all the embarrassments of poverty,
<lb/>being obliged to travel on foot to <placeName>Berlin</placeName> to find
<lb/>employment for subsistence. He lived in the
<lb/>city several years, indigent, unknown, and
<lb/>often destitute of the necessaries of life. This
<lb/>houseless wanderer was, at length, invited by a
<lb/>rabbi to transcribe his manuscripts; and this
<lb/>man initiated him into the mysteries of the the­
<lb/>ology, the jurisprudence, and the scholastic
<lb/>philosophy of the <name>Jews</name>.<anchor xml:id="a0948" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n0948"/></p>
            <p>A Polish <name>Jew</name> named <persName>Israel Moses</persName>, who
<lb/>was distinguished for the freedom of his in­
<lb/>quiries and his love of philosophy, taught him
<lb/><persName>Euclid's</persName> elements from the <rs type="properAdjective">Hebrew</rs> version.
<lb/>After the premature death of his beloved friend,
<lb/><persName>Dr. Kisch</persName>, a <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> physician, supplied him
<lb/>with books, and devoted some part of his time
<lb/>to the instruction of a student, whose strength
<lb/>of intellect he had the discernment to perceive,
<lb/>and the affection to aid. Under the instruction
<lb/>of this valuable friend he was soon enabled to
<lb/>read <persName>Locke</persName> in a <rs type="properAdjective">Latin</rs> version.</p>

<lb/>added a knowledge of the mathematics, and
<lb/>was well acquainted with the modern lan­

<lb/>now applied himself to the living languages,
<lb/>chiefly to the <name>English</name>, that he might read his

            <p>In <date when="1751">1751</date> he published some philosophical
<lb/>dialogues; a translation of <persName>Rousseau's</persName> essay
<lb/>on the inequality of man; and a dissertation

<lb/>man language was then in a neglected and un­
<lb/>polished state, and the clearness, precision, and
<lb/>dignity of the style of the <rs type="properAdjective">Hebrew</rs> philosopher
<lb/>was exhibited to great advantage. He next
<lb/>associated himself with <persName>Lessing</persName>, <persName>Ramier</persName>, and
<lb/><persName>Nicolai</persName>, in writing a journal, composed in the
<lb/>form of letters, on <rs type="properAdjective">German</rs> literature; and this
<lb/>work obtained great celebrity. In <date when="1767">1767</date> he

<lb/>sidered as a most curious disquisition on a
<lb/>subject so abstract and sublime, and diffused
<lb/>the fame of <persName>Mendolsohn</persName> through literary <placeName>Ger­

<lb/>for the strength of his reasoning, and <quote>the Jew­

            <p>After these publications, amidst the daily

            <p>The questions proposed to the assembly of
<lb/><name>Israelites</name> were generally answered in a manner
<lb/>agreeable to the French monarch. The epi­
<lb/>tome of their answers is as follows: They de­
<lb/>clared in the first place, that in all <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs>
<lb/>countries they conformed to the general prac­
<lb/>tice of marrying only one wife. But that, as
<lb/>several individuals in some preceding ages in­
<lb/>dulged in the practice of polygamy, a synod
<lb/>was convened at <placeName>Worms</placeName> in the <date notBefore="1001" notAfter="1100">eleventh cen­
<lb/>tury</date>, composed of one hundred rabbis, with
<lb/><persName>Guerson</persName> at their head; and this assembly pro­
<lb/>nounced an anathema against every <name>Jew</name> who
<lb/>should in future take more than one wife.
<lb/>Since this prohibition the influence of <rs type="properAdjective">Euro­

            <p>In answer to the second query, concerning
<lb/>divorces, the <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> deputies affirmed, that,
<lb/>though they were allowed by the law of <persName>Moses</persName>,
<lb/>they were not valid if not previously pronoun­
<lb/>ced by the French code; that, though before
<lb/>they were admitted to the rights of French
<lb/>citizens, their religion allowed them the liberty
<lb/>of repudiating their wives, yet it was extreme­
<lb/>ly rare to see it put in practice; and since

<lb/>the revolution that they have acknowledged
<lb/>no other laws on this head but those of the em­
<lb/>pire. At the epocha when they were admitted
<lb/>to the rank of citizens, the rabbis and the prin­
<lb/>cipal <name>Jews</name> appeared before the municipalities
<lb/>of their respective places of abode, and took
<lb/>an oath to conform in every thing to the laws,
<lb/>and to acknowledge no other rules in all civil
<lb/>matters. Consequently, since the <name>Jews</name> have
<lb/>begun to enter into engagements before a civil
<lb/>officer, no one attached to religion can repu­
<lb/>diate his wife but by a double divorce, that
<lb/>pronounced by the law of the state, and that
<lb/>prescribed by the law of <persName>Moses</persName>; so that in this
<lb/>point of view it may be justly affirmed, that
<lb/>the <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> religion agrees with the civil code.<anchor xml:id="a0986" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0986"/></p>
            <p>With respect to the marriages between <name>Jews</name>
<lb/>and <name>Christians</name> the assembly declared, that
<lb/>the prohibition in the <rs type="properAdjective">Mosaic</rs> law in gen­
<lb/>eral applies only to nations in idolatry. The
<lb/><title>Talmud</title> declares, that modern nations are not
<lb/>to be considered as such, since they worship,
<lb/>like us, the God of heaven and earth. And
<lb/>accordingly there has been, at several periods,
<lb/>intermarriages between <name>Jews</name> and <name>Christians</name> in
<lb/><placeName>France</placeName>, in <placeName>Spain</placeName>, and in <placeName>Germany</placeName>; these mar­
<lb/>riages were sometimes tolerated and some­
<lb/>times forbidden by the laws of those sovereigns

<lb/>who had received <name>Jews</name> into their dominions.
<lb/>Unions of this kind are still found in <placeName>France</placeName>;
<lb/>but the opinion of the rabbis is against these
<lb/>marriages. They asserted, that although the
<lb/>religion of <persName>Moses</persName> has not forbidden the <name>Jews</name>
<lb/>to intermarry with nations not of their religion,
<lb/>yet as marriage, according to the <title>Talmud</title>, re­
<lb/>quires religious ceremonies called <name xml:lang="he" rend="slant(italic)">Kiduschim</name>,
<lb/>with the benediction used in such cases, no
<lb/>marriage can be religiously valid unless these
<lb/>ceremonies have been performed. The rabbis
<lb/>being therefore unwilling to bless marriages be­
<lb/>tween <name>Jews</name> and <name>Christians</name>, they were declared
<lb/>valid in a civil, but not in a religious sense.<anchor xml:id="a0987" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0987"/></p>
            <p>In the answers of the deputies to the three
<lb/>questions concerning the relations and conduct
<lb/>of the <name>Jews</name> towards <name>Frenchmen</name>, and the duties
<lb/>which they owed the nation since they were
<lb/>admitted to the privileges of citizens, the as­
<lb/>sembly declared, that the descendants of
<lb/><placeName>Israel</placeName> considered <name>Frenchmen</name> as their brethren,
<lb/>and not as strangers; that the true spirit of
<lb/>the law of <persName>Moses</persName> is consonant with this mode
<lb/>of regarding them, since, when they formed a
<lb/>settled and independent nation, their lawgiver
<lb/>commanded them to love the strangers, for
<lb/>says he to the <name>Israelites</name>, <quote rend="pre()post()">ye were strangers in
<lb/>the land of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>.</quote> They declare, that they

    <pb xml:id="p2162" n="162"/>

<lb/>are bound to love all as their brethren who ob­

<lb/>their religious opinions may otherwise be, that
<lb/>it is their incumbent duty to visit their sick,
<lb/>bury their dead, assist their poor, and perform
<lb/>every act of humanity towards them as well as
<lb/>the <name>Israelites</name>. And, in short, that all the prin­
<lb/>ciples of their religion, as well as gratitude for
<lb/>the recent favours they have received from the
<lb/>government, induce them to consider <placeName>France</placeName>
<lb/>as their country, and <name>Frenchmen</name> as their bre­
<lb/>thren. That consequently the duty prescribed
<lb/>towards <name>Frenchmen</name> not of their religion is the
<lb/>same as that between <name>Jews</name> themselves; and that
<lb/>they do not admit of any other difference but
<lb/>that of worshipping the Supreme Being every
<lb/>one in his own way. At the present time es­
<lb/>pecially, when they are incorporated with the
<lb/>great nation, they declare, that it is impossible
<lb/>for a <name>Jew</name> to treat a <name>Frenchman</name> not of his re­
<lb/>ligion in any other manner than he would treat
<lb/>his Israelitish brethren, and that they consi­
<lb/>der the duty of defending their country as
<lb/>equally sacred and honourable. As a proof of
<lb/>this, during the last wars French <name>Jews</name> have

            <p>In answer to the questions concerning the
<lb/>nomination and jurisdiction of the rabbis, it
<lb/>was asserted, that since the revolution the ma­
<lb/>jority of the heads of families name the rabbis
<lb/>whenever there is a sufficient number of <name>Jews</name>
<lb/>to maintain one, after previous inquiries into
<lb/>the morality and learning of the candidate.
<lb/>This mode of election is not, however, uni­
<lb/>form; it varies in different places; and to this
<lb/>day whatever concerns the election of rabbis is
<lb/>in a state of uncertainty.<anchor xml:id="a0990" rend="pre(†)" corresp="#n0990"/></p>
            <p>The assembly declared, that the rabbis ex­
<lb/>ercise no kind of police jurisdiction among the
<lb/><name>Jews</name>, that the qualification of rabbi is no where
<lb/>to be found in the law of <persName>Moses</persName>, neither did it
<lb/>exist in the days of the first temple; it is only
<lb/>mentioned towards the end of those of the sec­
<lb/>ond. But after the <name>Israelites</name> were totally disper­
<lb/>sed, and formed small communities in different
<lb/>places, a rabbi and two other doctors constituted
<lb/>a kind of tribunal, called a house of justice;
<lb/>the rabbi fulfilled the function of judge, and
<lb/>the other two of his assessors. But the at­

<lb/>tributes, and even the existence of these tri­
<lb/>bunals, have, to this day, always depended on
<lb/>the will of the governments under which the
<lb/><name>Jews</name> have lived, and on the degree of tol­
<lb/>erance they have enjoyed. Since the revolu­
<lb/>tion these rabbinical tribunals are totally sup­
<lb/>pressed in <placeName>France</placeName> and <placeName>Italy</placeName>. The <name>Jews</name>, raised
<lb/>to the rank of citizens, have conformed in every
<lb/>thing to the laws of the state; and accordingly
<lb/>the functions of rabbis, wherever any are estab­
<lb/>lished, are limited to preaching morality in the
<lb/>temples, blessing marriages, and pronouncing
<lb/>divorces. As to the judicial powers they absolutely
<lb/>possess none; for there is among them neither a
<lb/>settled ecclesiastical hierarchy, nor any subor­
<lb/>dination in the exercise of their religious func­
<lb/>tions.</p>
            <p>The <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> deputies asserted, that there
<lb/>were no professions which their law forbids
<lb/>them from exercising; but, on the contrary,
<lb/>the <title>Talmud</title> expressly declares, that the father
<lb/>who does not teach a profession to his child
<lb/>educates him to be a villain.</p>
            <p>In reply to the queries respecting usury, the
<lb/>assembly asserted, that the <rs type="properAdjective">Hebrew</rs> word
<lb/>which has been improperly translated by the
<lb/>term <mentioned rend="slant(italic)">usury</mentioned> means interest of any kind, and not
<lb/>usurious interest. It is, say they, even im­

    <mw type="pageNum">165</mw>

<lb/>tation; for usury is an expression relative to,
<lb/>and compared with another and a lawful in­
<lb/>terest; and the text contains nothing which al­
<lb/>ludes to the other term of comparison. By
<lb/>usury we understand an interest above the rate
<lb/>fixed by law; and, if the law of <persName>Moses</persName> has not
<lb/>fixed the rate, can it be said that the <rs type="properAdjective">Hebrew</rs>
<lb/>word means an unlawful interest?<anchor xml:id="a0991" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n0991"/></p>
            <p>
              <quote rend="post()">The aim of the lawgiver in forbidding the
<lb/><name>Hebrews</name> to lend upon interest to one another
<lb/>was to draw closer between them the bonds of
<lb/>fraternity, to give them a lesson of reciprocal
<lb/>benevolence, and to engage them to assist each
<lb/>other with disinterestedness. The intention
<lb/>of <persName>Moses</persName> was to make of his people a nation of
<lb/>husbandmen for a long time after him, and all
<lb/>his regulations seemed designed to divert their
<lb/>attention from commerce. His prohibition
<lb/>must therefore be considered as a principle of
<lb/>charity, and not as a commercial regulation.
<lb/>According to the <title>Talmud</title> it is to be consider­
<lb/>ed as made to a man in want; for in case of a
<lb/>loan to a merchant, even a <name>Jew</name>, profit adequate
<lb/>to the risk should be considered as lawful.
<lb/>The <rs type="properAdjective">Mosaic</rs> law forbids all manner of interest

<lb/>This venerable assembly passed and agreed to
<lb/>various articles respecting the <rs type="properAdjective">Mosaic</rs> worship,
<lb/>and sanctioned the answers previously given by
<lb/>the <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> deputies. A decree was enacted,

            <p>The seats of the synagogues were to be in
<lb/>the most populous cities; and each of them
<lb/>was to be superintended by a rabbi and two
<lb/>elders. No one can be a member of the con­
<lb/>sistory who had addicted himself to usurious
<lb/>practices. Among other functions which are
<lb/>to be exercised by the consistory, they are to
<lb/>see that the rabbis do not, in publick or pri­
<lb/>vate, give any instructions or explanations of
<lb/>the law, in contradiction to the answers of the
<lb/>assembly confirmed by the decisions of the
<lb/>grand <orgName>sanhedrim</orgName>. They are also directed to
<lb/>do all in their power to encourage the <name>Israelites</name>
<lb/>to follow agriculture and useful professions;
<lb/>and to report to government the names of those
<lb/>who cannot give a satisfactory account of their
<lb/>means of subsistence. The grand sanhe­
<lb/>drim invited the <name>Jews</name> to acquire landed prop­
<lb/>erty; passed a law for the condemnation of
<lb/>usury; and declared, that the profession of

<lb/><name>Jews</name>, who have produced a large number of

<lb/>On the entrance of the French troops into

<lb/>They had the effrontery to declare, that the
<lb/>law of <persName>Moses</persName> forbade his followers the use of
<lb/>arms, and to mingle with the <name>Christians</name> in ci­
<lb/>vil duties.</p>
            <p>The discussions in the national assembly of
<lb/><placeName>Batavia</placeName>, in <date when="1796">1796</date>, attest these notorious facts.
<lb/>But the <name>Jews</name> being well instructed, and sup­

<lb/>dor <persName>Mr. Noel</persName>, saw at length the triumph of
<lb/>reason, and the privileges of the city were de­

<lb/>Four or five were admitted into judicial, mu­

<lb/>resolved to effect their separation, and to erect
<lb/>a new community, styled <name xml:lang="he" rend="slant(italic)">Adath Jesurum</name>.
<lb/>The <name>Syndics</name>, in their fury, forbade all mar­
<lb/>riage alliances with schismatics, attempted
<lb/>as it were to outlaw them, and, but for the as­
<lb/>sistance of the soldiers, would perhaps have

            <p>The <name>Syndics</name> had the boldness, with the
<lb/>money designed for the maintenance of the
<lb/>poor, to institute twenty three unjust and
<lb/>ruinous suits against twenty three members
<lb/>of the new community, in order to sub­
<lb/>ject them to the fine of <measure>one hundred florins</measure>,
<lb/>by virtue of an article in the law before cited,
<lb/>which had been repealed by the sovereign.
<lb/>The defendants, confident that the issue of the
<lb/>suit must be in their favour, waited the decis­
<lb/><choice><sic>s</sic><corr/></choice>ion with impatience; they earnestly entreated
<lb/>that it might be pronounced by the tribunal.
<lb/>But the <name>Syndics</name> by some artifice obtained a
<lb/>continuation of the cause, and the defendants
<lb/>were subjected to the payment of considerable
<lb/>sums for costs. In this cause justice appeared
<lb/>crowned with her diadem, but you might
<lb/>search in vain for her balance. There was
<lb/>even a decree, that the communities should
<lb/>unite, under some vague and unmeaning con­
<lb/>ditions; but it was repealed in consequence of
<lb/>the inflexible firmness of the new community,
<lb/>which was organized upon more rational
<lb/>principles.</p>
            <p>They have discarded from their liturgy

<lb/>tation; sometimes in twenty four and some­
<lb/>times even in twelve hours after the decease.
<lb/>This abuse, which every wise police should
<lb/>prevent, is not permitted in the new commu­
<lb/>nity, which prohibits the interment within for­
<lb/>ty eight hours, unless for urgent reasons, at­
<lb/>tested by the physicians appointed to act on
<lb/>such occasions.</p>
            <p>It is, says the author of this detail, a sub­
<lb/>ject of regret that this community has never
<lb/>found effectual support from the intermedial
<lb/>governours of <placeName>Holland</placeName>; we may, however, ex­
<lb/>cept the grand pensioner <persName>Schimmelpennink</persName>.
<lb/>But in general the professors of the predomi­

<lb/><name>Jews</name> and <name>Catholicks</name> from places of trust;
<lb/>though in excluding them from the privileges
<lb/>they have not exempted them from the charges
<lb/>of offices, for they are seldom forgotten in
<lb/>contributions.</p>
            <p>It seems as if every mean has been used to
<lb/>render the <name>Jews</name> despicable, that we might have
<lb/>a right to despise them. In the tribunals of
<lb/><placeName>Holland</placeName>, a different oath from that of other
<lb/>citizens was exacted from them. Did a <name>Jew</name>
<lb/>demand a passport, the previous attestation
<lb/>of the <name>Syndics</name> was required. <placeName>Amsterdam</placeName>
<lb/>and the <placeName>Hague</placeName> have witnessed societies, the

<lb/>render Jewish children more easily admissible
<lb/>to the apprenticeship of trades. Yet, incredi­
<lb/>ble as it may appear, scarce a <name>Christian</name> in
<lb/><placeName>Amsterdam</placeName> would admit them to his shop.
<lb/>At the <placeName>Hague</placeName>, not one of them would be re­
<lb/>ceived. After this is it surprising, that of
<lb/>three hundred <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> families in this city, but
<lb/>four or five individuals are artisans. A <name>Jew</name>
<lb/>of <placeName>Amsterdam</placeName>, who supported by his exer­
<lb/>tions a superannuated mother, could not,
<lb/>till after the most vexing difficulties and de­
<lb/>lays, obtain permission to pursue the business
<lb/>of a locksmith.</p>
            <p>A society whose views embrace all <placeName>Holland</placeName>,
<lb/>and that has published the most interesting
<lb/>works on various branches of popular instruc­

<lb/>their emulation for every thing great, useful,

            <p>The <name>Syndics</name> refused the invitation to unite
<lb/>with the <orgName>sanhedrim</orgName> of <placeName>Paris</placeName> without consulting
<lb/>the community, the most intelligent part of
<lb/>which has protested against them. They ex­
<lb/>erted themselves to the utmost to prevent the
<lb/>deputation from the new community, the only
<lb/>one that has thrown off their yoke. But the
<lb/>government of <placeName>Holland</placeName>, who, by a wise decree
<lb/>had manifested their pleasure that the <name>Jews</name>
<lb/>should be treated as the <name>Christians</name>, authorized
<lb/>the departure of three deputies from the schis­

<lb/>at <placeName>Paris</placeName>, where they acquired the general es­

<lb/>agreed to the decisions of the grand sanhe­
<lb/>drim.</p>

<lb/>into <placeName>Holland</placeName> the new intrigues of the <name>Syndics</name>,
<lb/>whose expiring despotism had broke out in a
<lb/>fresh outrage.</p>
            <p>But the deputies had on their part courage,
<lb/>the interest of the state, and the justice of their
<lb/>cause, which finally triumphed. A regulation,
<lb/>digested by themselves and adopted by the
<lb/>government, organized their consistory. The
<lb/>institutions contrary to sound reason have been
<lb/>abolished, and measures taken to accelerate the
<lb/>diffusion of knowledge among the children of

<lb/>of publick consideration. The physician <persName>Cap­

<lb/>only to a few words, none of them speaking it
<lb/>familiarly, though many read it. In writing
<lb/><name>Arabic</name> they often use <rs type="properAdjective">Hebrew</rs> letters, as they
<lb/>are said to do in other places with the lan­

            <p>The <name>Jews</name>, more frequently than the other

            <p>Besides the festivals and feasts which are
<lb/>observed by the <name>Jews</name> in general, those of
<lb/><placeName>Aleppo</placeName> keep a voluntary fast of six entire
<lb/>days, in which they abstain from all nourish­
<lb/>ment, even water. The two first days they
<lb/>attend business at the <name>Bazar</name>, but afterwards
<lb/>employ themselves at home in reading the Bi­
<lb/>ble and in prayer. In the evening of the sixth
<lb/>day, at the end of the fast, they moisten their
<lb/>throat with liquids; and afterwards return, by
<lb/>slow degrees, to the use of solid food. It is
<lb/>a long time before they recover their former
<lb/>appetite. Few, however, attempt to keep this
<lb/>fast; not more than twenty five in a year.
<lb/>Sometimes they are obliged to renounce it be­
<lb/>fore it is finished; and it is never observed by
<lb/>the same person more than once in his life.
<lb/>They have also occasional fasts for publick
<lb/>calamities; and individuals observe private
<lb/>devotional fasts. From their extensive com­
<lb/>mercial connexions these fasts cause a stagna­

<lb/>peat blessings and particular praises to God
<lb/>not only in their prayers, but in all accidental
<lb/>occasions, and in almost all their actions. It is
<lb/>a rule among them that no day must be pas­
<lb/>sed without reading a portion of the law at
<lb/>home, nor any affair undertaken till they have
<lb/>implored the divine blessing. They are strict­
<lb/>ly prohibited from all vain swearing, and pro­
<lb/>nouncing any of the names of God without ne­
<lb/>cessity. They abstain from meats forbidden
<lb/>by the Levitical law; for which reason what­
<lb/>ever they eat must be dressed by those of
<lb/>their own nation, in a manner peculiar to them­
<lb/>selves.<anchor xml:id="a1055" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n1055"/></p>
            <p>At the east of every synagogue is an
<lb/>ark, or press, in commemoration of the ark of
<lb/>the covenant, which was in the temple. Here
<lb/>the <title>Pentateuch</title> is deposited, written on a vol­
<lb/>ume or roll of parchment with the utmost ex­
<lb/>actness, and wrapped up in silk curiously em­
<lb/>broidered. When the <name>Jews</name> say their prayers
<lb/>in the morning they put on a thaled or veil
<lb/>over their other clothes, and a robe with frin­
<lb/>ges at the four corners, with tassels, called
<lb/><name>Zitzzitt</name>; and also the <name>Tephilim</name> or <name>Phylac­

            <p>All the rites, precepts, and ceremonies of
<lb/>the <name>Jews</name>, which are not contained in the <title>Pen­
<lb/>tateuch</title>, are founded upon and derive their
<lb/>authority from the <title>Talmud</title>. There is, how­
<lb/>ever, some variation in their customs and cer­
<lb/>emonies, and in the liturgies which the nation
<lb/>have made use of at different times, and in va­
<lb/>rious countries. The <rs type="properAdjective">German</rs>, <rs type="properAdjective">Polish</rs>, and
<lb/><rs type="properAdjective">Russian</rs> <name>Jews</name> follow the same ritual. But the
<lb/><rs type="properAdjective">Spanish</rs>, and <rs type="properAdjective">Portuguese</rs> have another, which

            <p>In the synagogue worship, the <name>Cohen</name> or
<lb/>priest leads the devotional exercises by chant­
<lb/>ing prayers; but laymen are admitted to read
<lb/>the book of the law to the people; the prece­
<lb/>dence is, however, given to the priest. After
<lb/>prayers, the rabbis frequently deliver a sermon;
<lb/>but their discourses are not composed in

            <p>The <name>Jews</name> venerate the <name>sabbath</name> above all
<lb/>other festivals, and observe it with the utmost
<lb/>strictness on account of its being enjoined in
<lb/>various parts of scripture, particularly in the
<lb/>decalogue. On this day they are forbidden to
<lb/>kindle or extinguish any fire; the food is,
<lb/>therefore, prepared on <name>Friday</name>. They are also
<lb/>prohibited from discoursing on any kind of
<lb/><mcr xml:id="a1059" rend="post(†)" corresp="#n1059">business,</mcr> from carrying any burden, from
<lb/>riding on horseback, in a carriage, going by

<lb/>or place where they reside, or playing upon
<lb/>any musical instrument.<anchor xml:id="a1060" rend="pre(‡)" corresp="#n1060"/> They are likewise

<lb/>to circumcise a child, because that ceremony
<lb/>must be performed exactly on the eighth day.</p>
            <p>The <name>sabbath</name> begins on <name>Friday</name>, an hour be­
<lb/>fore sun-set both summer and winter, for they
<lb/>suppose the day commences from the pre­
<lb/>ceding evening, according to <regMe>Genesis i. 5.</regMe>
<lb/>and <quote>the evening and the morning were the
<lb/>first day.</quote> As soon as the time arrives they
<lb/>leave all manner of work, and, having cleansed
<lb/>and decorated themselves in honour of the
<lb/>holy day, repair to the evening service. The
<lb/>women are bound to light a lamp with seven
<lb/>cotton wicks, in remembrance of the days of
<lb/>the week, saying, <quote>Blessed art thou, O Lord,
<lb/>our God! king of the universe, who has sanc­
<lb/>tified us with his commandments, and com­
<lb/>manded us to light the lamp of the <name>sabbath</name>.</quote>
<lb/>The reason why this ceremony is invariably
<lb/>assigned to the women is, that as their original
<lb/>mother, by her crime in eating the forbidden
<lb/>fruit, first extinguished the lamp of righteous­
<lb/>ness, they are to make an atonement for that
<lb/>sin by rekindling it, in lighting the lamp of the
<lb/><name>sabbath</name>.<anchor xml:id="a1061" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n1061"/></p>
            <p>They then spread a clean cloth upon their

<lb/>on <name>Friday</name>, and covered with a napkin, in mem­
<lb/>ory of the manna which fell with dew under

<lb/>and above it, yet descended not on the <name>sabbath</name>,
<lb/>but on the <name>Friday</name> they had a double portion.
<lb/>When they are placed at table, the master of
<lb/>the family takes a cup of wine repeating the
<lb/>three first verses in the <regMe>2nd chapter of Genesis</regMe>,
<lb/>and after giving God thanks, and enjoining
<lb/>them to observe the <name>sabbath</name>, he blesses the
<lb/>wine, drinks, and gives some to the rest of the
<lb/>family. He then blesses and distributes the
<lb/>bread. They repeat the usual grace after sup­
<lb/>per, with the addition of making mention of
<lb/>the <name>sabbath</name>.<anchor xml:id="a1062" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n1062"/></p>
            <p>In the morning they repair to the synagogue
<lb/>later than usual on the week days, where, after
<lb/>the accustomed prayers, besides others which
<lb/>are appropriate to the day, they read a lesson
<lb/>from the law, and afterwards a corresponding
<lb/>portion from the prophets.<anchor xml:id="a1063" rend="pre(†)" corresp="#n1063"/> When the read­
<lb/>ing is concluded they pray for the peace and
<lb/>prosperity of the government under which they
<lb/>live, in observance of the direction in <regMe>Jeremiah
<lb/>xxix. 7</regMe>. Then the law is put into the ark.
<lb/>They then pray that God would be pleased to

<lb/>deliver them from captivity, and bring them to
<lb/>the holy land, where they should be able to
<lb/>perform the offerings of the <name>sabbath</name> according
<lb/>to the law. After some other prayers the
<lb/>morning service is concluded.</p>
            <p>The religious rites observed at dinner are
<lb/>similar to those used at supper. They fre­
<lb/>quently have sermons either in the morning or
<lb/>afternoon, the subject of which is taken from
<lb/>the lesson read that day in the <title>Pentateuch</title>.
<lb/>They make three meals on the <name>sabbath</name>, one on
		    <lb/><name>Friday</name> evening and two the next day in honour
<lb/>of the festival. On this holy day they beseech
<lb/>God to be merciful, and grant them an inheri­
<lb/>tance in that day, which is all <name>sabbath</name>, and eter­
<lb/>nal rest.<anchor xml:id="a1064" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n1064"/> In the evening, as soon as the stars ap­
<lb/>pear, they suppose the <name>sabbath</name> is ended, and
<lb/>that it is lawful to do any work after they have
<lb/>attended the evening prayers at the syna­
<lb/>gogue.</p>
            <p>The <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> year is either civil, or ecclesias­
<lb/>tical. The civil year commences in the month
<lb/><name xml:lang="he">Tishry</name>, or <name>September</name>. The <name>Jews</name> have a tradition
<lb/>that the world was created on the first day of
<lb/>this month, and from this epoch they compute

    <milestone unit="sig" n="U6r"/>
    <mw type="pageNum">229</mw>

<lb/>the age of the world, and make use of this date
<lb/>in all their civil acts. The ecclesiastical year
<lb/>commences about the vernal equinox, in the
<lb/>month <name xml:lang="he">Nisan</name>, which answers to part of <name>March</name>
<lb/>and <name>April</name>. All the religious rites and cere­
<lb/>monies are regulated by the ecclesiastical
<lb/>year.<anchor xml:id="a1065" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n1065"/> On the first of every month they cel­
<lb/>ebrate the feast of the new moon, praying God
<lb/>to restore them to the holy city, and erect the
<lb/>temple at <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, where they could render
<lb/>the offering for the feast according to the law,
<lb/><regMe>Numbers xxviii. 11</regMe>.<anchor xml:id="a1066" rend="pre(†)" corresp="#n1066"/></p>
            <p>On the fourteenth day of the month <name xml:lang="he">Nisan</name>,
<lb/>the celebration of the passover commences,
<lb/>and immediately after the feast of unleavened
<lb/>bread; the whole includes eight days. On the
<lb/>evening preceding the festival, the first born of
<lb/>every family observes a fast, in remembrance
<lb/>of God's mercy in protecting the nation. Dur­
<lb/>ing the whole of this feast the <name>Jews</name> are obliged
<lb/>to eat only <mcr xml:id="a1067" rend="post(‡)" corresp="#n1067">unleavened bread,</mcr> and refrain from
<lb/>servile labour. The two first and two last
<lb/>days are kept as strictly as the <name>sabbath</name>, only

    <pb xml:id="p2230" n="230"/>

    <mw type="pageNum">230</mw>

<lb/>they permit fires to be kindled, and prepare
<lb/>food. As they cannot now offer the paschal
<lb/>sacrifice, the passover cakes are placed on the
<lb/>table with some bitter herbs, and they eat a
<lb/>piece of unleavened bread instead of the pas­
<lb/>chal lamb. The festival concludes with psalms
<lb/>and thanksgivings to God for their great de­
<lb/>liverance, and petitions that he would put a
<lb/>period to their captivity and bring them to
<lb/><placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The feast of <name>Pentecost</name> commences seven
<lb/>weeks after the passover, hence it is called the
<lb/>feast of weeks. It is also styled in scrip­
<lb/>ture, the day of the first fruits, because on that
<lb/>day they offered the first of their fruits in the
<lb/>temple. At present this festival is observed
<lb/>two days, during which time all servile labour
<lb/>is prohibited. As it was instituted to recall
<lb/>the remembrance of the laws being given at
<lb/><placeName>Sinai</placeName>, that part of scripture, which declares the
<lb/>delivery of the decalogue is solemnly read in
<lb/>the synagogue, and all those passages from the
<lb/>prophets which correspond with the subject.
<lb/>They generally have a sermon delivered in
<lb/>praise of the law. Their prayers are suitable
<lb/>to the occasion, concluding with petitions for
<lb/>their deliverance from captivity, and for the
<lb/>welfare of the government under which they
<lb/>dwell.<anchor xml:id="a1068" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n1068"/></p>

            <p>The feast of trumpets is observed on the
<lb/>first and second of <name xml:lang="he">Tisri</name>, or <name>September</name>, the
<lb/>seventh of the ecclesiastical and first of the
<lb/>civil year; hence the first of this month is called
<lb/>new year's day. On this festival, besides a por­
<lb/>tion from the law and prophets, part of the <regMe>two
<lb/>first chapters of the  first of Samuel</regMe> are read.
<lb/>They then pray for the protection of the govern­
<lb/>ment under which they reside, and blow the
<lb/>trumpet, which is made of a <mcr xml:id="a1069" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n1069">ram's horn,</mcr> say­
<lb/>ing, <quote>Blessed be thou, O Lord, our God!
<lb/>king of the universe, who has sanctified us

<lb/>ceremony, they repeat with a loud voice the

<lb/>hear the joyful sound, they shall walk, O Lord,

            <p>On the morning of the second day they re­
<lb/>pair to the synagogue, and repeat nearly the
<lb/>same prayers as on the preceding day. They
<lb/>then read the <regMe>22nd chapter of Genesis</regMe>, which
<lb/>gives an account of <persName>Abraham's</persName> offering his son

<lb/>forever. For, according to their received tra­
<lb/>dition, that great event took place on that day.
<lb/>They, therefore, beseech the Almighty through
<lb/>the merits of this memorable event to bless
<lb/>them. After reading the law and prophets,
<lb/>they blow the trumpet, and pray as usual, that
<lb/>God would gather them from their dispersion,

            <p>The feast of tabernacles is observed on the
<lb/>fifteenth of the month <name xml:lang="he">Tisri</name>, and lasts nine
<lb/>days. Each person at the commencement of
<lb/>the festival, erects an arbour,<anchor xml:id="a1071" rend="post(†)" corresp="#n1071"/> which is covered
<lb/>with green boughs, and decked with a variety
<lb/>of ornaments in remembrance of their miracu­
<lb/>lous preservation in the wilderness. The two
<lb/>first and two last days are kept with great so­
<lb/>lemnity; but the intermediate time is not ob­
<lb/>served with equal strictness. On the first day
<lb/>they take branches of palm, myrtle, willow,
<lb/>and citron bound together, and go round the
<lb/>altar, or <mcr xml:id="a1072" rend="post(‡)" corresp="#n1072">pulpit</mcr>, singing psalms, because for­
<lb/>merly they used to perform this ceremony in
<lb/>the temple.</p>
            <p>The <name>Jews</name> chiefly reside in their respective
<lb/>tabernacles during the feast, both night and

<lb/>meal, during seven days, they are obliged to
<lb/>repeat the following grace: <quote>Blessed art thou,
<lb/>O Lord, our God, king of the universe, who
<lb/>has sanctified us with his commandments, and
<lb/>commanded us to dwell in tabernacles.</quote> Dur­
<lb/>ing the feast they beseech the Lord to be mer­

<lb/>prophets are read in their synagogues.<anchor xml:id="a1073" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n1073"/></p>
            <p>On the seventh day of the festival, they take
<lb/>seven of the laws from out of the ark and carry
<lb/>them to the altar, and those who are possessed
<lb/>of the palm branch, &amp;c. with the reader at their
<lb/>head, go seven times round the altar, in re­
<lb/>membrance of the sabbatical years, singing the
		    <lb/><title>29th Psalm</title>. On the evening of this day the
<lb/>feast of solemn assembly commences, which
<lb/>being a time of rejoicing, they assemble and
<lb/>entertain their friends; but are strictly enjoined
<lb/>not to do any servile labour. They read pas­
<lb/>sages from the law and prophets, and entreat
<lb/>the Lord to be propitious to them, and deliver
<lb/>them from captivity. On the ninth day they
<lb/>repeat several prayers in honour of the law, and
<lb/>bless God for his mercy and goodness in giv­
<lb/>ing it to them by his servant <persName>Moses</persName>, and read
<lb/>that part of scripture which makes mention of

            <p>On the fourteenth of <name xml:lang="he">Adar</name>, or <name>March</name>, the
<lb/><name>Jews</name> celebrate the feast of <name>Purim</name>, in commem­

<lb/>ix</regMe>. <quote>Therefore they called these days <name>Purim</name>.</quote>
<lb/>Previous to the feast, a solemn fast is observed
<lb/>in remembrance of <persName>Esther's</persName> fasting. The
<lb/>whole <title>book of Esther</title> written on parchment is
<lb/>repeatedly read during the feast, and as often
<lb/>as the name of <persName xml:id="a1075" rend="pre(†)" corresp="#n1075">Haman</persName> is mentioned it is cus­
<lb/>tomary for the children, (who have little wooden
<lb/>hammers) to knock against the wall, as a me­
<lb/>morial that they should endeavour to destroy
<lb/>the race of <name>Amalek</name>. Part of the first day is
<lb/>spent in feasting and rejoicing, sending presents

            <p>The <name>Jews</name>, at the present day, observe many
<lb/>festivals which were not appointed by <persName>Moses</persName>.
<lb/>In particular they celebrate the dedication of
<lb/>the altar, which was instituted by the <name>Macca­
<lb/>bees</name>, in remembrance of the victory they ob­
<lb/>tained over <persName>Antiochus Epiphanes</persName>. This tyrant,
<lb/>having profaned the temple, reduced them to
<lb/>the necessity of cleansing and dedicating it
<lb/>anew. The festival is observed in a splendid
<lb/>manner, and lasts eight days; and is ap­
<lb/>pointed to be kept by lighting lamps. The
<lb/>reason they assign for this ceremony is, that,
<lb/>after they had purified and dedicated the
<lb/>temple, there was only enough pure oil left
<lb/>to burn one night, which miraculously lasted
<lb/>eight nights, till they were able to obtain a
<lb/>fresh supply.</p>
            <p>The great day of expiation is observed by
<lb/>the <name>Jews</name>, though they have no high priest to
<lb/>officiate, nor temple wherein to offer the sacri­
<lb/>fice. Before the fast commences, they think
<lb/>it a duty incumbent upon them to ask pardon
<lb/>of those they have offended; to make restitu­
<lb/>tion to those whom they have defrauded of any
<lb/>property; to forgive those who have offended
<lb/>them; and, in short, to do every thing which

<lb/>pentance.<anchor xml:id="a1077" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n1077"/> This great fast is observed on the
<lb/>tenth day of the month <name>Tisri</name>, or <name>September</name>.
<lb/>In the preceding evening<anchor xml:id="a1078" rend="pre(†)" corresp="#n1078"/> they repair to the
<lb/>synagogue, where they remain saying prayers
<lb/>upwards of three hours; and when they return
<lb/>from the synagogue they may not taste any
<lb/>kind of sustenance, and are even prohibited
<lb/>from taking one drop of water. They are also
<lb/>forbidden to do any kind of labour, even to
<lb/>kindle a fire, and observe this day as strictly as
<lb/>the <name>sabbath</name>.</p>
            <p>At six in the morning they attend the syn­
<lb/>agogue, and offer those prayers and supplica­
<lb/>tions for the pardon of their sins, which are
<lb/>peculiar to the occasion. In the course of the
<lb/>service, various portions of scripture are read,
<lb/>particularly part of <regMe>Leviticus xxvi.</regMe> <regMe>Numbers
<lb/>xxix.</regMe> and <regMe>Isaiah lvii</regMe>. They mention in their
<lb/>prayers the additional sacrifice of the day, and
<lb/>entreat God to rebuild their sanctuary, to gath­
<lb/>er their dispersions among the <name>Gentiles</name>, and
<lb/>conduct them to <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, where they may
<lb/>offer the sacrifice of atonement, agreeably to
<lb/>the <rs type="properAdjective">Mosaic</rs> law. In the afternoon service,

    <mw type="pageNum">237</mw>

<lb/>besides portions from the law and prophets,
<lb/>the greatest part of the book of <title>Jonah</title> is read
<lb/>in the synagogues. They beseech God to be
<lb/>propitious, and forgive their sins. The fast
<lb/>continues from morning to night,<anchor xml:id="a1079" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n1079"/> for up­
<lb/>wards of twelve hours, without intermission.</p>
            <p>In <name>Awb</name>, which answers to <name>July</name> or <name>August</name>,
<lb/>in the fifth month of the ecclesiastical year,
<lb/>the <name>Jews</name> observe a strict fast, occasioned by
<lb/>the destruction of the first temple by <persName>Nebu­
<lb/>chadnezzar</persName>. On this day also the second tem­
<lb/>ple was burnt by the <name>Romans</name>. During this
<lb/>fast they not only abstain from all food, but do
<lb/>not even taste a drop of water. In the even­
<lb/>ing they go to the synagogue, and, after their
<lb/>usual prayers, the book of <title>Jeremiah</title> is read
<lb/>in a low mournful voice. In the morning they
<lb/>attend the synagogue early, and read a portion
<lb/>of the law, and part of the 8th and 9th chap­
<lb/>ters of <title>Jeremiah</title>. They go to the synagogue
<lb/>again in the afternoon, and read passages from
<lb/>the law and the prophets suitable to the occa­
<lb/>sion. All their prayers on this day tend to re­
<lb/>mind them of their captivity; and the destruc­
<lb/>tion of their temple, which deprived them of

<lb/>ment was made for their sins.<anchor xml:id="a1080" rend="pre(†)" corresp="#n1080"/></p>

            <p>Besides the publick fasts, which the <name>Jews</name>
<lb/>are commanded to observe, there are some
<lb/>others peculiar to the nation in different coun­
<lb/>tries. The <rs type="properAdjective">German</rs> <name>Jews</name> for instance, both
<lb/>after the passover, and the feast of tabernacles,
<lb/>keep three fasts, viz. on <name>Monday</name>, <name>Tuesday</name>, and
<lb/>the following <name>Monday</name>. The reason assigned
<lb/>for this practice is, that they might, during the
<lb/>preceding feasts,<anchor xml:id="a1081" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n1081"/> have committed some of­
<lb/>fence against God. They fast also on the
<lb/>vigil of the new year, and some on that of
<lb/>every new month. Several other fasts and
<lb/>festivals have been instituted, but not general­
<lb/>ly received, and are not observed at present.<anchor xml:id="a1082" rend="pre(†)" corresp="#n1082"/></p>
            <p>The <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> church is, at present, governed
<lb/>by a presiding rabbi in the city or town where
<lb/>they may be settled, who attaches to himself
<lb/>two other rabbis, and these three combined
<lb/>form a kind of tribunal in sacred or religious
<lb/>cases, and frequently determine private dis­
<lb/>putes. This tribunal is termed <name>Beth Din</name>, or
<lb/>the house of justice. As the priesthood is at
<lb/>present totally abrogated, having ceased with
<lb/>the temple, the term high priest is an explod­
<lb/>ed one, no presiding rabbi now exercising

<lb/>the functions of this pontiff, which were only
<lb/>applicable to the temple. Hence the choice
<lb/>of rabbi is not confined to the tribe of <name>Levi</name>;
<lb/>although that tribe be the only one that they
<lb/>conceive can now be at all distinguished. Its
<lb/>members are all at present considered as lay­
<lb/>men. They have notwithstanding some trif­
<lb/>fling distinctions paid them in the synagogue
<lb/>service; for those among them that are de­
<lb/>scended from the priests, who are called <name>Co­
<lb/>hen</name>, or in the plural <name>Cohenim</name>, perform the
<lb/>benediction, and are called first to the law.
<lb/>They also personate the priest in the ceremo­
<lb/>ny of redeeming the first born, and have some
<lb/>other complimentary precedences paid them.
<lb/>The <name>Levites</name>, i.e. those who are descendants
<lb/>from the singers in the temple, are second in
<lb/>rank, and are called next to the law, and wash
<lb/>the hands of the <name>Cohenim</name> before they go to the
<lb/>benediction, &amp;c. With all this the rabbi has
<lb/>nothing to do, unless he be of this tribe. The
<lb/>ministry of a presiding rabbi, elected for that
<lb/>purpose from the general mass of learned rab­
<lb/>bis in the congregation, whose head he is, con­
<lb/>sists of nothing more than that, as a spiritual
<lb/>director, he solves questions which arise in the
<lb/>ceremonial observances; occasionally preach­

<lb/>A young <name>Samaritan</name> to whom it was proposed

<lb/>They appear not to have any determinate ideas

<lb/>that the original of one of these was written by
<lb/><persName>Abisha</persName>, the grandson of <persName>Aaron</persName>, and that this

<lb/>the <name>Cophts</name> in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and the <name>Jews</name> in different
<lb/>parts of the <name>Ottoman empire</name>; they were habited
<lb/>as decently as their extreme misery would per­
<lb/>mit. They demanded of <persName>Huntington</persName> if there
<lb/>were any <name>Hebrews</name> in his country, he replied
<lb/>affirmatively, and added, that in <placeName>England</placeName> they
<lb/>were called <name>Jews</name>. But as he informed them
<lb/>he read <name>Samaritan</name> with facility, they pretended
<lb/>that a <name>Samaritan</name> alone could have taught him,
<lb/>and that the <name>Hebrews</name> in <placeName>England</placeName> were their

<lb/><quote>that I persuaded them that they had brethren
<lb/>in my country; I supported the contrary opin­

            <p>In this persuasion, the <name>Samaritans</name> in <date when="1672">1672</date>
<lb/>sent to him at <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> a copy of their law

<lb/>in the <rs type="properAdjective">Hebrew</rs> language, (Samaritan charac­
<lb/>ters) written by <persName>Merchib-Ben-Jacob</persName>, the most
<lb/>distinguished personage among them; it is
<lb/>written from <placeName>Naplouse</placeName>, near to <placeName>Gerizim</placeName>, the

            <p><persName>Huntington</persName> enclosed and transmitted the

<lb/>who replied, and kept up a correspondence
<lb/>with them until the time of his death, which
<lb/>happened in <date when="1685">1685</date>. <persName>Marshal</persName> spoke of the dis­
<lb/>obedience of the first man, which had rendered
<lb/>us all children of <persName>Belial</persName>, and brought death
<lb/>and a malediction upon all his descendants.
<lb/>He questioned them concerning the <name>Shiloh</name>, re­
<lb/>called to their remembrance the promise of a
<lb/>deliverer, and insensibly led them to recognize
<lb/><persName>Jesus Christ</persName>. On the other side, the <name>Samari­
<lb/>tans</name> exhibited their doctrines, declaring that
<lb/>they had no images, repelled the charge of
<lb/>idolatry, and the accusation of adoring a dove,
<lb/>(an article which they never could forget) and
<lb/>requested alms. Their letters were translated
<lb/>into <name>German</name> by <persName>Schnurrer</persName>, professor of <placeName>Tu­
<lb/>bingen</placeName>. The care with which they have pre­
<lb/>served the Samaritan <title>Pentateuch</title> attests its au­
<lb/>thenticity. <persName>Huntington</persName> here acknowledges the

<lb/>poli</placeName>, who called the <name>Samaritans</name> <name>Cutheans</name>, a
<lb/>name which they abominated. This rabbi ex­

<lb/>who accompanies the Pacha of <placeName>Damascus</placeName> in

            <p>The consul of <placeName>Aleppo</placeName> observes, that the <name>Sa­
<lb/>maritans</name> inhabit a distinct part of <placeName>Naplouse</placeName>,
<lb/>which bears their name. This quarter is a large
<lb/>khan, composed of ten or twelve houses com­
<lb/>municating with each other, in one of which is
<lb/>a synagogue containing two or three chambers.
<lb/>In the largest of these is a level space on which
<lb/>they place their Bible, concealed by a curtain,
<lb/>which the kakhan alone has a right to draw.
<lb/>The whole assembly rise at the sight of the
<lb/>Bible, on which is sculptured the image of a
<lb/>dove.</p>
            <p>The first day of the passover the <name>Samaritans</name>
<lb/>celebrate at midnight the feast of the sacrifice.
<lb/>The kakhan kills a sheep in the synagogue.
<lb/>They then light a fire in the place prepared for
<lb/>the purpose. The whole victim is roasted, and
<lb/>divided among the assistants, who eat it in the
<lb/>synagogue.</p>

              <p>Article 1st. There are no <name>Samaritans</name> to be
<lb/>found in our eastern countries excepting at <placeName>Nap­
<lb/>louse</placeName> and <placeName>Jaffa</placeName>; but it is now a hundred
<lb/>years since we received letters from <placeName>Genoa</placeName>,

<lb/>a character similar to ours.</p>
              <p>Art. 2d. It is now a hundred years since
<lb/>there have been any <name>Samaritans</name> in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>.</p>
              <p>Art. 3d. The <name>Samaritans</name> at <placeName>Jaffa</placeName> and <placeName>Nap­
<lb/>louse</placeName> amount to two hundred persons, men,
<lb/>women, and children.</p>
              <p>Art. 4th. They consist of about thirty
<lb/>families, and dwell in the quarter of <placeName>Rhadera</placeName>,
<lb/>which was named by our lord <persName>Jacob</persName>, the king
<lb/>of the <name>Samaritans</name>, and where he resided, as is
<lb/>written in our holy Bible.</p>
              <p>Art. 5th. The origin of the <name>Samaritans</name> is
<lb/>derived from the true <name>Israelites</name>. We are really
<lb/>descended from our lord <persName>Jacob</persName>, called <name>Israel</name>,
<lb/>from whom sprang the twelve tribes, who en­
<lb/>tered into <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, amounting to seventy per­
<lb/>sons, and went out again by the number of six
<lb/>hundred thousand. After the miracles per­

<lb/>formed by their minister in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and in the
<lb/>desart by our lord <persName>Moses</persName>, son of <persName>Amram</persName>; and
<lb/>who entered into the land of <placeName>Canaan</placeName>, where we,
<lb/>the descendants of the first settlers, still con­
<lb/>tinue, after all the migrations which have hap­
<lb/>pened to us. We are of the tribe of <persName>Joseph</persName>,
<lb/>son of our lord <persName>Jacob</persName> the <name>Israelite</name>.</p>
              <p>Art. 6th. This is the difference between
<lb/>the <name>Jews</name> and ourselves; the law is one, and
<lb/>consists of six hundred and thirteen precepts
<lb/>according to both. The only difference be­
<lb/>tween us concerns the purification, which we
<lb/>observe, but which they cannot, because they
<lb/>are no longer masters of <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>.</p>
              <p>Art. 7th. Their law is exactly the same as
<lb/>ours from the beginning to the end, but we
<lb/>pronounce it differently from them.</p>
              <p>Art. 8th. Our law is written in the true
<lb/><rs type="properAdjective">Hebrew</rs> language, the same which was found
<lb/>written on the tables of precious stone containing
<lb/>the ten commandments given by God to <persName>Moses</persName>.
<lb/>Some rabbis from <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, having examined
<lb/>the writing of our law, acknowledged it for the
<lb/>ancient <name>Assyrian</name>, handed down on the tables of
<lb/>precious stone.</p>
              <p>From this we shall never deviate, and con­
<lb/>formably to the word of God, <quote>neither add
<lb/>nor diminish.</quote></p>

              <p>Art. 9th. There is then no difference be­
<lb/>tween our law, and that of the <name>Jews</name>, except in
<lb/>the characters.</p>
              <p>Art. 10th. The adoration of the golden im­
<lb/>age of a turtle dove is the greatest disobedience
<lb/>to the law; for God has said in the ten com­
<lb/>mandments, <quote>I am the Lord thy God, thou
<lb/>shalt have no other God but me; make not to
<lb/>thyself any graven image, nor the likeness of
<lb/>any thing which is in heaven, or earth, nor in
<lb/>the waters under the earth, for I the Lord am
<lb/>a jealous God.</quote></p>
              <p>After these prohibitions how can we adore
<lb/>the image of a dove.</p>
              <p>Art. 11th. Our worship is that of God
<lb/>alone, as it is written in our law, <quote>adore the
<lb/>Lord thy God.</quote></p>
              <p>Art. 12th. As to what regards other ani­
<lb/>mals, and golden birds, far, very far, be it from
<lb/>us to worship them, God forbid, that we
<lb/>should act contrary to our law! God has said,
<lb/><quote>thou shalt not make gods of silver and gold.</quote></p>
              <p>How can we adore a dove or any other
<lb/>animal when God has so strictly forbidden us?
<lb/>We worship God alone, the eternal being,
<lb/>who has no beginning or end. We know that
<lb/>God created birds, men, brutes, and all things.</p>
              <p>God says in his law, God is your God,
<lb/>the God of gods, the most excellent, the

<lb/>powerful, the great, the majestic, who makes
<lb/>no distinction of persons, and cannot be tempt­
<lb/>ed by presents.</p>
              <p>God also says, each <name>Israelite</name> ought to
<lb/>repeat the law of God at all times, on entering
<lb/>the house, on the way, in lying down, in rising
<lb/>up. It should be always in his hands, between
<lb/>his eyes, and on the door of his house. For
<lb/>this is the sacred precept there meant, <quote>hear O
<lb/><name>Israel</name>, God is our God, he is one, &amp;c.</quote></p>
              <p>After all these prohibitions, how can we
<lb/>adore images of gold in an apartment, and per­
<lb/>vert the worship of the true God to that of a
<lb/>turtle dove, or other animals wrought by
<lb/>men's hands?</p>
              <p>God says again, thou shalt fear and adore
<lb/>the Lord thy God, and continue in his religion;
<lb/>thou shalt swear by him. How then can we
<lb/>worship images, and forget his commands?
<lb/>There are many similar precepts. God is our
<lb/>God, and we adore him at all times.</p>
              <p>Art. 13th. The sacrifice of sheep and lambs
<lb/>is the foundation of our law, and at the epoch
<lb/>of the tabernacle established by <persName>Moses</persName>, there
<lb/>were in the interior of it many altars for sacri­
<lb/>fice, each for a certain era. One was an altar of
<lb/>expiatory sacrifice, the other for peace offerings.

<lb/>tribes of <name>Israel</name> should offer a sacrifice morning
<lb/>and evening. This took place while the taber­
<lb/>nacle stood. After the end of the time of
<lb/>grace, and the destruction of the tabernacle,
<lb/>our chief priests, of the family of <persName>Aaron</persName>, or­
<lb/>dered us in place of the sacrifices, to make
<lb/>a prayer for a testimony of our fear of God, and
<lb/>to solicit from him pardon and indulgence.</p>
              <p>Art. 14th. The feast of the passover, which
<lb/>God commanded all <name>Israel</name> to observe, is in a
<lb/>fixed and invariable time, which is the first
<lb/>month of the year, as it is said, <quote rend="pre()post()">This is a law
<lb/>for all ages, on the first month, the fifteenth
<lb/>day, at the setting of the sun, it is to be ob­
<lb/>served in the chosen place, which is <placeName>Mount
<lb/>Gerizim</placeName>.</quote> We eat it at midnight, according
<lb/>to the rites prescribed by the law, and that
<lb/>once a year.</p>
              <p>Art. 15th. We offer our victims with the
<lb/>rites which are commanded, as it is said, <quote>You
<lb/>shall take a lamb of the first year, without
<lb/>blemish from the goats or from the sheep, and
<lb/>keep it until the fourteenth day of the month;
<lb/>you shall roast it in the fire, and eat it in haste
<lb/>rejoicing.</quote> This sacrifice is accompanied by
<lb/>other ceremonies, too long to be detailed.</p>
              <p>Art. 16th. These sacrifices ought to be
<lb/>offered on <placeName>Mount Gerizim</placeName>; but for the last

<lb/>twenty years we have made them in the city,
<lb/>as we cannot now repair to the Mountain.</p>
              <p>Art. 17th. We offer our sacrifices in the
<lb/>open air, because God said to our lord <persName>Moses</persName>,
<lb/><quote rend="pre()post()">Say to Pharaoh, let us go three days journey
<lb/>(from the city) and sacrifice to the Lord our

              <p>It was at first commanded that these sacri­
<lb/>fices should be offered in the country. After
<lb/>the entrance of the people of <name>Israel</name> into <placeName>Ca­
<lb/>naan</placeName>, <placeName>Mount Gerizim</placeName> was chosen for this pur­
<lb/>pose, as God has declared in his law. The
<lb/>sacrifice of the passover must not be made in
<lb/>any of the inhabited places which the Lord has
<lb/>given you, but only in the spot which God has
<lb/>designated for this purpose. This place is the
<lb/>mountain above mentioned; this renders it ev­
<lb/>ident, that it can be offered but once a year.
<lb/>Those who are not present at this solemnity
<lb/>ought to celebrate it in the second month.</p>
              <p>Art. 18th. To the question when, and why
<lb/>sacrifices have ceased? we reply; that God
<lb/>forbid that we should omit them, while it is
<lb/>in our power to perform them: but only for
<lb/>twenty years past, instead of <placeName>Mount Gerizim</placeName>,
<lb/>we offer them in the city, because it is com­
<lb/>prised in the chosen place. Therefore we ex­
<lb/>actly observe the prescribed rites.</p>

<lb/>race of <name>Levi</name>, but no <name>Iman</name>, or grand pontiff.
<lb/>In this country, we have had no priests of
<lb/><name>Aaron</name> for one hundred and fifty years past.</p>
              <p>Art. 20th. The grand pontiff is called in
<lb/>the law in <name>Hebrew</name> <name>Hakchem Haggadol</name>, and in
<lb/><name>Arabic</name>, illustrious chief, (<name xml:lang="ar">raies et djalil</name>). His
<lb/>functions, and those of all the tribe of <name>Levi</name>,
<lb/>are prescribed by the law. He may take the

<lb/>judge according to what is written in the law.
<lb/>He has also other privileges which would be
<lb/>too long to detail.</p>
              <p>Art. 21st. You inquire whether the <name>Sa­
<lb/>maritans</name> are divided into different classes, and
<lb/>what are these divisions? There exists among
<lb/>us some known and observed divisions. These
<lb/>are the engagements which God entered into

<lb/>and before these with <persName>Noah</persName>, and also with

              <p>Art. 22d. There are no <name>Caraites</name> among

<lb/>relation with them; we know not what is said
<lb/>of them, nor have we ever even heard their
<lb/>names pronounced.</p>
              <p>Art. 24th. We are separated from all na­

<lb/>the daily sacrifices which were abolished after
<lb/>the destruction of the tabernacle of <persName>Moses</persName>.
<lb/>Since that epoch, prayers were instituted for
<lb/>every festival, with particular ceremonies.
<lb/>There are three prayers for the <name>sabbath</name>, and
<lb/>each holy day has appropriate ones, as the
<lb/>prayers peculiar to the passover; the feast of
<lb/>seven days, when we eat unleavened bread;
<lb/>the pilgrimage to <placeName>Mount Gerizim</placeName>; the feast
<lb/>of <name>Pentecost</name>, which is observed a certain num­
<lb/>ber of days, and is terminated by a solemn fes­
<lb/>tival, in which we present ourselves before
<lb/>God. At that time we do not sleep, and em­
<lb/>ploy ourselves without ceasing, day and night,
<lb/>in reading the law, and praising God. The
<lb/>fifteenth is the feast of tabernacles, which has
<lb/>its own appropriate ceremonies, and we are al­

              <p>Finally, the twenty second is the festival of
<lb/>the closing of all the holy days, with ceremonies
<lb/>conformable to the orders of our high priests.
<lb/>All the above mentioned festivals are perform­

<lb/>the <name>Chasidim</name> are extracted from notice publish­
<lb/>ed in <date when="1799">1799</date>, at <placeName>Frankfort on the Oder</placeName>, by <persName>Is­
<lb/>rael Loebel</persName>, second rabbin from <placeName>Novogroduk</placeName>
<lb/>in <placeName>Lithuania</placeName>. This account was reprinted in
<lb/><date when="1807">1807</date>, in the <title>Sulamith</title>, an interesting journal
<lb/>published at <placeName>Dessau</placeName>, by <name>Frankel and Wolf</name>,
<lb/>which has for its object the diffusion of useful
<lb/>knowledge among the <name>Jews</name>, and their core­
<lb/>ligionists. The following account is an abridge­
<lb/>ment from <persName>Loebel's</persName> own words.</p>
            <p>A rabbin, named <persName>Israel</persName>, rendered himself
<lb/>very famous at <placeName>Miedzyvorz</placeName>, in the <placeName>Ukraine</placeName>,
<lb/>between the years <date when="1760">1760</date> and <date when="1765">1765</date>. He was
<lb/>an ambitious man, who, being destitute of Tal­
<lb/>mudic knowledge, and not able to gain repu­
<lb/>tation by his learning, sought other means to
<lb/>acquire influence, and became an exorcist.

            <p>In order to realize his designs, <persName>Israel</persName> as­
<lb/>sumed the mask of exemplary piety, and joined

		    <lb/>to his name that of <name>Balschem</name>, or possessor of
<lb/>the name of God. The propensity of ignorant
<lb/>and credulous men towards the occult sciences
<lb/>procured him, in less than ten years, more than
<lb/>ten thousand followers, whom he called <name>Chas­
<lb/>idim</name>. This name designated those men, who,
<lb/>not content to follow the ritual laws of <persName>Moses</persName>,
<lb/>laboured to unite themselves more intimately
<lb/>to the Deity by their sanctity. But it was
<lb/>soon discovered, that the connexion between
<lb/><persName>rabbi Israel</persName> and his disciples did not conduce
<lb/>to the end he had announced, and that their in­
<lb/>tentions and their actions were hostile to the
<lb/>principles of piety and morality. It was this
<lb/>which induced the <name>Talmudist</name> <persName>Elias</persName>, grand
<lb/>rabbin of <placeName>Wilna</placeName>, in concert with the elders of
<lb/>the synagogue of <placeName>Brod</placeName>, to write a work against
<lb/>the new sect, in order to prove, that it was in­
<lb/>jurious to the <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> religion, and to the state.
<lb/><persName>Elias</persName>, being near his death, enjoined all who
<lb/>visited him, to proclaim, that whoever loved
<lb/>God and man, ought carefully to shun all com­
<lb/>munication with the <name>Chasidim</name>, who, under the
<lb/>mantle of hypocrisy, concealed the most pro­
<lb/>found immorality.</p>
            <p>The artful <persName>Israel Balschem</persName>, seeing it was
<lb/>necessary to strengthen his party to oppose
<lb/>the orthodox, exerted himself to gain the most
<lb/>opulent people, and published a work, which is

    <pb xml:id="p2282" n="282"/>
    <milestone unit="sig" n="Z2v"/>
    <mw type="pageNum">282</mw>

<lb/>the code of his doctrine, and which contains
<lb/>abominable principles. He prohibits his ad­
<lb/>herents, under the most severe spiritual penal­
<lb/>ties, to cultivate their minds. Those who
<lb/>possess information ought to suppress it; for it
<lb/>is dangerous, said he, to permit reason to inter­
<lb/>fere in matters of religion. He is not willing
<lb/>that those who pray to God should melt into
<lb/>tears; for the father beholds with more pleasure
<lb/>his children cheerful and happy, than discon­
<lb/>tented and sorrowful.</p>
            <p><persName>Israel Loebel</persName>, the writer of this narrative,
<lb/>observes, that <quote rend="post()">these ideas are contrary to the
<lb/><rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> law; for <persName>Moses</persName> commands us to study

<lb/>apply it to enlarge our religious knowledge?
<lb/>Is it not our special destiny on earth to en­
<lb/>deavour to approach the divinity? The suc­
<lb/>cessors of <persName>Moses</persName> in the dignity of prophets
<lb/>have thought and taught like him.</quote></p>

<lb/>in order to increase it, it is necessary to pray

<lb/>nation, indeed, maintain that a large part of

            </p>
            <p>The following is a specimen of the maxims
<lb/>of this sect; if any one has committed, or
<lb/>wishes to commit sin, he can promise himself
<lb/>absolution from his leader, without subjecting
<lb/>himself to a change of conduct, and leading a
<lb/>regular life. This detestable principle, es­
<lb/>pecially among those who have received but
<lb/>little instruction, increased the number of <persName>Bals­
<lb/>chem's</persName> partizans to such a degree, that they
<lb/>amounted to forty thousand at the time of his
<lb/>death, which took place fifteen years after the
<lb/>sect was founded.</p>
            <p>At that time, his plan, both interiour and
<lb/>exteriour, assumed a new form. To a single
<lb/>leader they substituted many directors, who,
<lb/>to defend their doctrine, printed various works,
<lb/>after having published two posthumous ones
<lb/>attributed to their founder.</p>
            <p>One of these productions, called <title xml:lang="he">Kesser
<lb/>Schemtow</title>, appeared at <placeName>Kor<choice><sic>st</sic><corr>ts</corr></choice>chik</placeName> and <placeName>Zul­
<lb/>kiew</placeName>, in two parts. In the first part, he gives
<lb/>to his followers a general absolution for the
<lb/>sins which they have committed, and shall
<lb/>commit, on condition that they educate their
<lb/>sons <name>Talmudists</name>. He asserted, that his soul,
<lb/>being transported in an extacy to heaven, the

<lb/>archangel <persName>Michael</persName>, the protector of the <name>Jews</name>,
<lb/>declared to him, that on this condition every
<lb/>sinner should not only obtain remission, but
<lb/>even a reward for his crimes. In the second
<lb/>part, he invites his adherents to pray to <persName>Abra­
<lb/>ham</persName>, the father of the <name>Jews</name>, who has conducted
<lb/>so many of his unhappy race to the true belief,
<lb/>and who has preserved it in the souls of many
<lb/>disposed to quit it. He condemns all con­
<lb/>nexion between their children and those who
<lb/>do not belong to the <rs type="properAdjective">Hebrew</rs> nation, especially
<lb/>his sect.</p>
            <p>The second posthumous work of <persName>Balschem</persName>,
<lb/>under the title <title xml:lang="he">Likute Amomir</title>, has been prin­
<lb/>ted at <placeName>Lemburg</placeName>, and in the two other cities be­
<lb/>fore mentioned. He teaches, that in order to
<lb/>be united to the divinity it is necessary to com­
<lb/>mit sin upon sin; and that the more horrible
<lb/>they are, the more agreeable are they to him.
<lb/>For God being the first in the scale of beings,
<lb/>and the greatest sinner being in the last grade,
<lb/>there is between them a species of contiguity
<lb/>by representing to ourselves, that the scale is
<lb/>of a circular form.</p>
            <p><persName>Baer Medsirsitz</persName>, rabbin of <placeName>Kortschik</placeName>, and
<lb/>one of the directors of this sect, has commented
<lb/>upon the principles of the founder in a work in
<lb/>which he proscribes every exercise of virtue.
<lb/>But the most abominable book, entitled <title xml:lang="he">Noam

<lb/>Hamelech</title>, has for its author <persName>Melech</persName>, another
<lb/>of the directors, and grand rabbin of <placeName>Lezanst</placeName>.
<lb/><persName>Balschem</persName> had granted a general absolution
<lb/>upon conditions which could not always be
<lb/>performed. <persName>Melech</persName> goes much further; he
<lb/>teaches, that each of the directors can absolve
<lb/>the greatest crimes, past and future, if one of
<lb/>the directors wishes to commit them; and, at
<lb/>the same time, encourages men to abandon
<lb/>themselves to vicious practices, by assuring
<lb/>the guilty, that, having no terrestial power to
<lb/>fear, they will controul nature by their prayers,
<lb/>provided, however, that the sect will remain
<lb/>faithful to their engagements. In this work
<lb/>he prohibits the use of medicine to the sick,
<lb/>seeing that he who can give them eternal life,
<lb/>may at his pleasure prolong their temporal life.</p>
            <p>From these specimens, drawn from the
<lb/>books of this sect, we see how pernicious it is
<lb/>to the state, and apprehend, that it must have
<lb/>found many adversaries. But the <rs type="properAdjective">Hebrew</rs>
<lb/>works published against these sectarians, are
<lb/>less of the polemic kind, than exhortations to
<lb/>preserve themselves from the contagious prin­
<lb/>ciples of the <name>Chasidim</name>. In combating them in
<lb/>this manner they hoped to restore the lost sheep
<lb/>to the fold of <name>Israel</name>. Unhappily these expec­
<lb/>tations have failed, and while we render justice
<lb/>to the talents and integrity of the authors, we

<lb/>ried two hundred and fifty copies of my two
<lb/>works. In the course of my travels I had the
<lb/>satisfaction of recovering a few of the secta­

<lb/>my arrival at <placeName>Cracow</placeName>, I applied to the admin­

<lb/>to examine my writings, that I might obtain a

<lb/>continue every where my exhortations. But
<lb/>upon my arrival at <placeName>Stsechow</placeName>, where the sect
<lb/>were powerful, they imputed to me the pro­
<lb/>ject of endeavouring to bring evils upon my
<lb/>coreligionists, and reproached me with having
<lb/>introduced books from the Prussian territories
<lb/>into the country subject to <placeName>Austria</placeName>. In con­

<lb/>moral subjects, without making mention of the
<lb/>sect. But soon after, two emissaries arrived
<lb/>from the cantons through which I had passed,
<lb/>who pointed me out to the rabbins of <placeName>Lemburg</placeName>
<lb/>as an enemy to the <name>Chasidim</name>. They repeated

<lb/>that some members of the sect of pious <name>Jews</name>,
<lb/>(<gloss xml:lang="de">die fromen juden</gloss>) had made remonstrances
<lb/>against them.</p>
              <p>I perceived then the necessity of a journey

<lb/>was, that the <name>Chasidim</name> were prohibited from

              <p>During my residence in the east, my mind
<lb/>was much occupied with the present state and

<lb/>which it has almost instantaneously created in
<lb/>the publick mind, are sure prognostics of its
<lb/>perpetuity. It is one of those institutions,
<lb/>which, like the <orgName>Bible Society</orgName>, needs only to be
<lb/>proposed, to recommend itself to the minds of
<lb/>men, by its perfect reasonableness and propri­
<lb/>ety; and I may add by the divine obligation it
<lb/>involves. I entertain a confident hope, that
<lb/>this society, or some institution analogous to it,
<lb/>wil be perpetual in the church of Christ, and
<lb/>that it will endure, to use an oriental expres­
<lb/>sion, as long as sun and moon endure; or, at
<lb/>least, as long as there is a <name>Jew</name> in the world, who

              <p>There is a measure I would propose to the

<lb/>would suggest to you to open a correspondence

<lb/>This is the colony of the <name>White</name> and <name>Black Jews</name>
<lb/>of <placeName>Cochin</placeName>. The number is calculated to be
<lb/>about sixteen thousand. <persName>Mr. Frey</persName> informs

<lb/>gard and attention of your society.</p>
              <p>I visited <placeName>Cochin</placeName> soon after the conquest
<lb/>of the province. The <name>Jews</name> received me hos­
<lb/>pitably, and permitted me to examine their
<lb/>libraries and their synagogues; and they pre­
<lb/>sented to me many valuable manuscripts, which
<lb/>are deposited in the library of the <orgName>university of
<lb/>Cambridge</orgName>. One of these is a roll of the <title>Pen­
<lb/>tateuch</title>, on goats' skins dyed red; one of the
<lb/>most ancient perhaps which the east can pro­
<lb/>duce. The <name>White Jews</name> live on the sea coast,
<lb/>and have commerce with foreign nations; the
<lb/><name>Black Jews</name> live chiefly in the interiour of the
<lb/>country. The <name>Hindoos</name> call them <name>Israeli</name>; they
<lb/>call themselves <name>Beni-Israel</name>, and not <name>Jews</name>; for
<lb/>their ancestors did not belong to <persName>Judah</persName>, but to
<lb/>the kingdom of <name>Israel</name>. They consider them­
<lb/>selves to be descended from those tribes which
<lb/>were carried away at the first captivity. In
<lb/>some parts of the east, the <name>Beni-Israel</name> never
<lb/>hear of the second temple; they never heard
<lb/>of the <rs type="properAdjective">christian</rs> account of the coming of the
<lb/>Messiah. Some of them possess only the
<lb/><title>Pentateuch</title>, the <title>Psalms</title>, and <title>Book of Job</title>;
<lb/>others have no portion of scripture left. But
<lb/>their countenance, and their observance of the
<lb/><name>sabbath</name>, and of peculiar rites, demonstrate that
<lb/>they are <name>Jews</name>. The <name>White Jews</name> of <placeName>Cochin</placeName>
<lb/>despise the <name>Black Jews</name>, as being of an inferiour

<lb/>them, because they do not belong to the second
<lb/>temple. Both among <name>White</name> and <name>Black Jews</name>
<lb/>I found that there was a general impress on
<lb/>that there would soon be a rumour of wars,
<lb/>and a commotion among the people on their

<lb/><rs type="properAdjective">Syrian</rs> <name>Christians</name> before them. These ancient
<lb/><name>Christians</name> live in the vicinity, and are your wit­
<lb/>nesses. At one place in the interiour of the
<lb/>country, which I visited, there is a <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> syn­
<lb/>agogue, and a <rs type="properAdjective">christian</rs> church in the same
<lb/><rs type="properAdjective">Hindoo</rs> village. They stand opposite to each
<lb/>other, as it were the law and the gospel; bear­
<lb/>ing testimony to the truth, in the presence of
<lb/>the heathen world.</p>
              <p>I was informed, that many years ago one of
<lb/>the <name>Jews</name> translated the <rs type="title">New Testament</rs> into
<lb/><name>Hebrew</name> for the purpose of confuting it, and
<lb/>of repelling the arguments of his neighbours,
<lb/>the Syrian <name>Christians</name>. The manuscript fell in­
<lb/>to my hands, and is now in the library of the
<lb/><orgName>university of Cambridge</orgName>. It is in his own
<lb/>hand writing, with the first interlineations and
<lb/>erasures; and will be of great use in preparing
<lb/>a version of the <rs type="title">New Testament</rs> in the <rs type="properAdjective">Hebrew</rs>
<lb/>language. It appears to be a faithful transla­
<lb/>tion as far as it has been examined; but about
<lb/>the end, when he came to the epistles of <persName>St.
<lb/>Paul</persName>, he seems to have lost his temper, being
<lb/>moved perhaps by the acute arguments of the
<lb/>learned <name>Benjamite</name>, as he calls the apostle; and
<lb/>he has written here and there a note of execra­
<lb/>tion on his memory. But behold the provi­
<lb/>dence of God! The translator became himself

<lb/>a convert to <name>christianity</name>. His own works sub­
<lb/>dued his unbelief. <quote>In the lion he found sweet­
<lb/>ness;</quote> and he lived and died in the faith of
<lb/>Christ. And now it is a common superstition
<lb/>among the vulgar in that place, that if any <name>Jew</name>
<lb/>should write the whole of the <rs type="title">New Testament</rs>
<lb/>with his own hand, he will become a <name>Christian</name>
<lb/>by the influence of the evil spirit.</p>
              <p>This even occurred in the south of <placeName>India</placeName>;
<lb/>but a conversion no less remarkable took place,
<lb/>some time afterwards in the north. <persName>Jacob Le­
<lb/>vi</persName>, a <name>Jew</name> from <placeName>Smyrna</placeName>, travelled over land to
<lb/><placeName>Calcutta</placeName>, and heard the gospel from one of the
<lb/>Lutheran preachers, belonging to the society
<lb/>for promoting <rs type="properAdjective">christian</rs> knowledge, and be­
<lb/>come a convert to the truth. He delivered a
<lb/>testimony to the <name>Jews</name>, <name>Hindoos</name>, <name>Mahomedans</name>,
<lb/>and <name>Christians</name>; for he was acquainted with
<lb/>various languages, and spoke eloquently, like
<lb/><persName>Apollos</persName>. But his course was short. He was
<lb/>ordained, like many witnesses of the <rs type="properAdjective">christian</rs>
<lb/>faith, to abide but for a moment. These soli­
<lb/>tary instances of the power of the gospel seem
<lb/>to occur, in almost every nation, previous to
<lb/>the general illumination. The conversion of
<lb/><persName>Jacob Levi</persName> is recorded in the proceedings of
<lb/>the society, in <name>Bartlett's Buildings</name>, <placeName>London</placeName>.</p>
              <p>But there is another body of <name>Jews</name>, not a
<lb/>colony, but a kingdom of <name>Jews</name>, to which this

<lb/>society may also address itself; and that is the
<lb/>ten tribes. For the ten tribes, so long lost,
<lb/>have, at length, been found. It has been suffi­
<lb/>ciently ascertained by the investigation of the
<lb/>learned in <placeName>India</placeName>, that the Affghan and Pyran
<lb/>nations consist of the descendants of the <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs>
<lb/>tribes of the first description.</p>
              <p>When I was in the south of <placeName>India</placeName>, I asked
<lb/>the <name>Black Jews</name> where their brethren, the great
<lb/>body of the ten tribes, were to be found? They
<lb/>answered promptly, that they were to be found
<lb/>in the north, in the regions adjacent to <placeName>Chaldea</placeName>,
<lb/>the very country whither they were first car­
<lb/>ried into captivity. On my return to <placeName>Calcutta</placeName>,
<lb/>I prosecuted the inquiry, under the advantages
<lb/>which my superintendance of the <orgName>college of
<lb/>Fort William</orgName> afforded me. <persName xml:id="a1140" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n1140">Sir William

<lb/>authorities. A further investigation confirmed
<lb/>the judgment of this illustrious scholar. There
<lb/>were Affghan <name>Jews</name> in <placeName>Calcutta</placeName> at the time;
<lb/>one of my own servants was an <name>Affghan</name>. The
<lb/><name>Affghans</name> are generally reputed by us to be
<lb/><name>Mahomedans</name>. I asked my servant if he was a

<lb/>homedan <name>Jew</name>.</quote> I plainly discovered in his
		      <lb/>countenance the features of the <placeName>London</placeName> <name>Jew</name>.
<lb/>The general account of the <name>Affghans</name> is this;
<lb/>that their ancestors were <name>Jews</name>; that their
<lb/>common histories record the names of <persName>David</persName>,
<lb/><persName>Saul</persName>, and other kings of <name>Israel</name>; that the <name>Ma­
<lb/>homedans</name> came upon them with an invading

<lb/>well as you; we observe circumcision, and

<lb/>their sacred books began to diminish in num­
<lb/>ber; and it came to pass at last, that in many

<lb/><name>Jews</name> by their countenance, by tradition, by
<lb/>peculiar rites, and the observance of the sab­

            <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> ten tribes who were carried captive by the king
<lb/>of <placeName>Assyria</placeName> have been lost for more than two thousand
<lb/>years. Various conjectures have been formed, both by
<lb/><name>Jews</name> and <name>Christians</name>, respecting the place of their resi­
<lb/>dence; some of which shall be briefly mentioned.</p>
            <p><persName>Menasses Ben Israel</persName>, in a work styled <title rend="pre(“)post(”)">The Hope of
<lb/>Israel,</title> has attempted to prove, that the American natives
<lb/>were the descendants of the ten tribes. This opinion
<lb/>has been adopted by some <rs type="properAdjective">christian</rs> writers, particularly
<lb/>by <persName>James Adair</persName>, Esq. a trader with the <name>Indians</name>, and resi­
<lb/>dent in the country for forty years. He was a most care­
<lb/>ful observer of their whole economy, both publick and
<lb/>private, and had the best opportunity of knowing it, with­
<lb/>out much danger of deception. In a work entitled <title rend="pre(“)post(”)">The
		      <lb/>History of the <name><rs type="properAdjective">American</rs> Indians</name>,</title> he concludes his ob­
<lb/>servations on their origin and descent as follows: <quote>From
<lb/>the most exact observations I could make in the long
<lb/>time I traded among the <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> <name>Americans</name>, I was forced
<lb/>to believe them lineally descended from the <name>Israelites</name>,
<lb/>either while they were a maritime power, or soon after
<lb/>the general captivity; the last, however, is the most
<lb/>probable. Had the nine tribes and a half of <name>Israel</name>, which
<lb/>were carried off by <persName>Shalmaneser</persName>, king of <placeName>Assyria</placeName>, and
<lb/>settled in <placeName>Media</placeName>, continued there long, it is very proba­
<lb/>ble, by intermarrying with the natives, and from their
<lb/>natural fickleness and proneness to idolatry and the force
<lb/>of example, that they would have adopted and bowed
<lb/>before the gods of the <name>Medes</name> and <name>Assyrians</name>, and have

<lb/>carried them along with them; but there is not a trace
<lb/>of this idolatry among the <name>Indians</name>.</quote> Hence he argues,
<lb/>that the ten tribes, who were the forefathers of the <name>Amer­
<lb/>icans</name>, soon advanced eastward from <placeName>Assyria</placeName>, and reached
<lb/>their settlements in the new continent before the destruc­
<lb/>tion of the first temple.<anchor xml:id="a1167" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n1167"/></p>
            <p>In order to prove that the <name>American Indians</name> are de­
<lb/>scended from the ten tribes, <persName>Mr. Adair</persName> adduces various
<lb/>arguments; a sketch of his mode of reasoning is as fol­
<lb/>lows:</p>
            <p>1st. All the <name>Israelites</name> were divided into tribes, and
<lb/>had chiefs over them, so the <name>Indians</name> divide themselves;
<lb/>each tribe forms a little community within the nation.
<lb/>As the nation hath its particular symbol, so each tribe hath
<lb/>the badge from which it is denominated. The sachem of
<lb/>each tribe is a necessary party in conveyances and trea­
<lb/>ties, to which he affixes the mark of his tribe. If we go
<lb/>from nation to nation among them, we shall not find one,
<lb/>who doth not lineally distinguish himself by his respec­
<lb/>tive family. The genealogical names, which they as­
<lb/>sume, are derived either from the names of those animals
<lb/>whereof the cherubim are said in revelation to be com­
<lb/>pounded, or from such creatures as are most similar to
<lb/>them. The <name>Indians</name>, however, bear no religious respect
<lb/>to the animals from whence they derive their name; on
<lb/>the contrary, they kill them when opportunity serves.
<lb/>When we consider that these savages have been above
<lb/>twenty centuries without the use of letters to carry down
<lb/>their traditions, it cannot reasonably be expected, that
<lb/>they should still retain the identical names of their pri­
<lb/>mogenial tribes: their principal customs corresponding
<lb/>with those of the <name>Israelites</name> sufficiently clears the subject.

    <pb xml:id="p2335" n="335"/>
    <milestone unit="sig" n="Dd05r"/>
    <mw type="pageNum">335</mw>

<lb/>Besides, as hath been hinted, they call some of their
<lb/>tribes by the names of the cherubinical figures that were
<lb/>carried on the four principal standards of <name>Israel</name>.</p>
            <p>2nd. By a strict permanent divine precept, the He­
<lb/>brew nation were ordered to worship at <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, <persName>Je­
<lb/>hovah</persName>, the true and living God, who, by the <name>Indians</name>, is
<lb/>styled <persName>Yohewah</persName>. The ancient heathens, it is well known,
<lb/>worshipped a plurality of gods, as various as the countries
<lb/>they inhabited; and as numerous with some as the days
<lb/>of the year. But the Indian <name>Americans</name> pay their re­
<lb/>ligious devoir to the <quote>great beneficent, supreme, holy
<lb/>spirit of fire,</quote> who resides, (as they think) above the
<lb/>clouds, and on earth also with unpolluted people. He is
<lb/>with them the sole author of all animated and vegetable
<lb/>nature. They do not pay the least perceivable worship
<lb/>to any image, or to dead persons, neither to the celestial
<lb/>luminaries, nor evil spirits, nor any created being what­
<lb/>soever.<anchor xml:id="a1168" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n1168"/></p>
            <p>3d. Agreeably to the theocracy, or divine government
<lb/>of <name>Israel</name>, the <name>Indians</name> think the Deity to be the imme­
<lb/>diate head of their state. All the nations of <name>Indians</name> are
<lb/>exceedingly intoxicated with religious pride, and have
<lb/>an inexpressible contempt of the white people. They used
<lb/>to call us, in their war orations, the accursed people. But
<lb/>they flatter themselves with the name of the beloved
<lb/>people, because their supposed ancestors, as they affirm,
<lb/>were under the immediate government of the Deity, who
<lb/>was present with them in a very peculiar manner, and di­
<lb/>rected them by prophets, while the rest of the world were
<lb/>aliens and outlaws to the covenant. When the old <name>Arc­
<lb/>himagus</name>, or any one of their <name>Magi</name>, is persuading the
<lb/>people at their religious solemnities to a strict observance

    <pb xml:id="p2336" n="336"/>
    <milestone unit="sig" n="Dd05v"/>
    <mw type="pageNum">336</mw>

<lb/>of the old beloved, or divine speech, he always calls them
<lb/>the beloved or holy people, agreeably to the <rs type="properAdjective">Hebrew</rs>
<lb/>epithet <term>Ammi</term>, (<gloss>my people</gloss>) during the theocracy of <name>Is­
<lb/>rael</name>. He urges them with great energy to imitate their
<lb/>virtuous ancestors, and flourishes upon their beloved
<lb/>land, which flowed with milk and honey. It is their
<lb/>opinion of the theocracy, or that God chose them out of
<lb/>all the rest of mankind, as his peculiar people, which
<lb/>alike animates both the <name>White Jew</name> and the <name>Red Amer­
<lb/>ican</name> with that steady hatred against all the world ex­
<lb/>cept themselves, and renders them hated or despised by
<lb/>all.</p>
            <p>4th. The Indian language and dialects appear to have
<lb/>the very idiom and genius of the <name>Hebrew</name>. Their words
<lb/>and sentences are expressive, concise, emphatical, son­
<lb/>orous, and bold; and often both in letters and signification
<lb/>are synonimous with the <rs type="properAdjective">Hebrew</rs> language.<anchor xml:id="a1169" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n1169"/></p>
            <p>5th. They count time after the manner of the <name>He­
<lb/>brews</name>. They divide the year into spring, summer, au­
<lb/>tumn, or the falling of the leaf, and winter. They num­
<lb/>ber their years from any of these four periods, for they
<lb/>have no name for a year; and they subdivide these, and
<lb/>count the year by lunar months, like the <name>Israelites</name>, who
<lb/>reckoned by moons. The number and regular periods of
<lb/>the Indian religious feasts is a good historical proof that
<lb/>they counted time by and observed a weekly <name>sabbath</name>
<lb/>long after their arrival on the American continent. They
<lb/>began their year at the first appearance of the first new
<lb/>moon of the vernal equinox, according to the ecclesias­
<lb/>tical year of <persName>Moses</persName>.</p>
            <p>6th. In conformity to and after the manner of the
<lb/><name>Jews</name>, the <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> <name>Americans</name> have their prophets, high

    <pb xml:id="p2337" n="337"/>
    <milestone unit="sig" n="Dd06r"/>
    <mw type="pageNum">337</mw>

<lb/>priests, and others of a religious order. As the <name>Jews</name> had
<lb/>a sanctum sanctorum, so have all the Indian nations.
<lb/>There they deposit their consecrated vessels, none of
<lb/>the laity daring to approach this sacred place; the
<lb/>Indian tradition says, that their ancestors were possessed
<lb/>of an extraordinary divine spirit, by which they foretold
<lb/>things future, and controuled the common course of na­
<lb/>ture, and this they transmitted to their offspring, provided
<lb/>they obeyed the sacred laws annexed to it. Their pon­
<lb/>tifical office descends by inheritance to their children.
<lb/><persName>Mr. Adair</persName> also traces a resemblance between the dress of
<lb/>the Indian <name>Archimagus</name>,when he officiates in making the
<lb/>supossed holy fire for the yearly atonement for sin, and
<lb/>that of the <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> high priest.<anchor xml:id="a1170" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n1170"/></p>
            <p>7th. The ceremonies of the <name>Indians</name> in their religious
<lb/>worship are more after the <rs type="properAdjective">Mosaic</rs> institution than of Pa­
<lb/>gan imitation, which could not be if the majority of the
<lb/>old nation were of heathenish descent. They are utter
<lb/>strangers to all the gestures practised by <name>Pagans</name> in their
		    <lb/>religious rites. According to <persName>Mr. Adair</persName>, the <name>American
<lb/>Indians</name> have, like the <name>Hebrews</name>, a sacred ark, in which
<lb/>are kept various holy vessels. <quote>It is,</quote> says he, <quote>worthy
<lb/>of notice that they never place the ark on the ground,
<lb/>nor sit on the bare earth while they are carrying it
<lb/>against the enemy. On hilly ground where stones are
<lb/>plenty they place it on them; but in level land upon
<lb/>short logs, always resting themselves on the same mate­
<lb/>rials. They have also as strong a faith of the power and
<lb/>holiness of their ark, as ever the <name>Israelites</name> retained of
<lb/>theirs. The Indian ark is deemed so sacred and dan­
<lb/>gerous to touch, either by their own sanctified warriors,
<lb/>or the spoiling enemy, that neither of them dare meddle
<lb/>with it on any account. It is not to be handled by any,

    <pb xml:id="p2338" n="338"/>
    <milestone unit="sig" n="Dd06v"/>
    <mw type="pageNum">338</mw>

<lb/>except the chieftain and his waiter, under penalty of in­
<lb/>curring great evil; nor would the most inveterate enemy
<lb/>dare to touch it. The leader virtually acts the part of a
<lb/>priest of war, pro tempore, in imitation of the <name>Israelites</name>
<lb/>fighting under the divine military banner.<anchor xml:id="a1171" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n1171"/></quote></p>
            <p>8th. The <name>Israelites</name> had cities of refuge for those who
<lb/>killed a person unawares. In like manner each of the
<lb/>Indian nations have either a house or town of refuge,
<lb/>which is a sure asylum to protect a man slayer or the
<lb/>unfortunate captive if they once enter into it. In every
<lb/>Indian nation there are several peaceable towns, called
<lb/><name>old beloved</name>, <name>ancient holy</name>, and <name>white towns</name>, which appear
<lb/>to have been formerly towns of refuge.</p>
            <p>9th. <persName>Mr. Adair</persName> proceeds to point out the resemblance
<lb/>between the festivals, fasts and religious rites of the <name>He­
		      <lb/>brews</name>, and those of the <name>American Indians</name>. He observes,
<lb/>that before the latter go to war, they have many prepa­
<lb/><choice><sic/><corr>ra</corr></choice>tory sacrifices of purification and fasting. He points out
<lb/>the similarity in their daily sacrifice; their ablutions and
<lb/>anointings; their abstinence from unclean things; their
<lb/>marriages, divorces, and punishment for adultery; their
<lb/>several punishments; their burial of the dead; their
<lb/>mourning for the deceased and various other particu­
<lb/>lars. He then proceeds to adduce his last argument for
<lb/>the origin of the Indian <name>Americans</name>, from their own tradi­
<lb/>tions, from the accounts of our English authors, and from
<lb/>the testimonies which the <rs type="properAdjective">Spanish</rs> writers have given con­
<lb/>cerning the primitive inhabitants of <placeName>Peru</placeName> and <placeName>Mexico</placeName>.</p>
