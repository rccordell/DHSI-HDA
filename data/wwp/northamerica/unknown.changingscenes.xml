              <p>It was at such a moment, that I was just
	    <lb/>seated and gazing on the clouded hemisphere,
	    <lb/>when I was suddenly interrupted by a loud
	    <lb/>rap at the hall door. A disconsolate female
	    <lb/>presented herself, whose countenance indicat­
	    <lb/>ed thought, humility and sincerity of man­
	    <lb/>ner; my mind at this moment seemed, hap­
	    <lb/>pily, in somewhat of a sympathetic mood,
	    <lb/>and I received the stranger with a kind and
	    <lb/>hearty welcome. <said>What unexpected event,

	      <lb/>ness; or, mayhap, a callous obdurate heart,
	      <lb/>is the pitiable incentive. Speak, lovely stran­
	      <lb/>ger, and let the tear of sympathy bedew this
	      <lb/>cheek. It is not vain curiosity that prompts
	      <lb/>me to commiserate; it is a more heightened
	      <lb/>feeling—'tis the overflowing of a feeling
	      <lb/>heart. My mind presages that poverty, grief,
	      <lb/>or disappointment, conducted you here.</said></p>

	      <lb/>life, I have often seen a face of pleasure,
	      <lb/>with a heart of pain: the sole object of my
	      <lb/>travelling, is fully to obtain what I fear that
	      <lb/>I never can posibly attain; it is a perfect
	      <lb/>knowledge of the human heart. I have
	      <lb/>ever, from my infancy, wished to be great;
	      <lb/>and my father observed in my youthful days
	      <lb/>that a description o<choice><sic>␣</sic><corr>f</corr></choice> courts and grandeur
	      <lb/>gave me uncommon delight. I always read
	      <lb/>with an audable voice, and with elevated
	      <lb/>pleasure, whenever such scenes were present­
	      <lb/>ed to my raptured imagination. My family
	      <lb/>are decended from the Milesian race; pride
	      <lb/>and ambition prompted me to seek an asylum
	      <lb/>in <placeName>America</placeName>, where talents and industrious
	      <lb/>habits always succeed in obtaining a compe­
	      <lb/>tency, if not actual wealth. Encouraged by
	      <lb/>the advices of my friends, I hastened to this
	      <lb/>hospitable shore, in pursuit of wealth. I had
	      <lb/>a taste for music; and on my passage I often
	      <lb/>indulged myself, and extremely gratified those
	      <lb/>around me. The captain of the ship seemed
	      <lb/>particularly delighted, although his manners,
	      <lb/>which I shall take the liberty to describe,
	      <lb/>were peculiarly uncouth, and nautical. His
	      <lb/>name was <persName>Collins</persName>; and I soon observed that
	      <lb/>he was a good man, active and intelligent, but

	      <lb/>no judge of music. He was born at <placeName>Sau­

<lb/>I, <said>there are two sharps for one flat in their
<lb/>music.</said> <said>I wonder,</said> replied the captain,
	      <lb/><said>how long it would take to learn the gamut?
		<lb/>for then, I take it, that persons may improve
		<lb/>themselves. I often tried when I was a boy,

                <said xml:id="afflicted3" rend="post()" prev="#afflicted2">We had a boisterous passage, with only
	      <lb/>three female passengers. The ship was
	      <lb/>called the <name>Belerophon</name>. One of the ladies
	      <lb/>was a <persName>Miss Sipthorn</persName>, of <placeName>Clontarf</placeName>, the other

	    <lb/>the many Changing Scenes I had witnessed
	    <lb/>in others. I readily acquiesced, and began as
	    <lb/>follows:</p>
              <p>I am descended from a respectable family
	    <lb/>in <placeName>Antwerp</placeName>, where economy and industry
	    <lb/>were indispensable, to secure the affections of
	    <lb/>my parents. In early life I was practised in
	    <lb/>the following rules, viz.—First, to adorn my
	    <lb/>person on <name>Sunday</name>, and grace the middle aisle
	    <lb/>of the church; to be very attentive to church
	    <lb/>discipline, and behave with religious deco­

	    <lb/>rum; to pay strict attention to the sermon,
	    <lb/>though I did not altogether understand it; to
	    <lb/>bring home the text to my parents, in order
	    <lb/>to show that I had been attentive; to gaze on
	    <lb/>the congregation slightly, and with hauteur
	    <lb/>and consequence, and, if possible, to fix my
	    <lb/>eyes on one who, perhaps, was seeking mine.
	    <lb/>In this happy state of things, how was my
	    <lb/>tender heart taken by the appearance of <persName>John
	    <lb/>Cornelius Covenhoven</persName>, a tall, majestic youth
	    <lb/>of florid countenance; he caught my admir­
	    <lb/>ing eye, and soon, very soon, he approached
	    <lb/>my father's house, and, as it is the custom
	    <lb/>there, tenderly asked me for my company.
	    <lb/>Having a little vein of humour, in which I
	    <lb/>felt willing to indulge, I replied: <said>I shall
	      <lb/>not withdraw from your presence till your
	      <lb/>conversation becomes painful.</said></p>
              <p>My father had unhappily at that time a
	    <lb/>lawsuit depending, and was frequently visit­
	    <lb/>ed by that class of people whose business it
	    <lb/>is to make crooked things appear straight.
	    <lb/>Among the number was <persName>Counsellor Black­
	    <lb/>bean</persName>, a man of great appearance, but who had
	    <lb/>the sly look of a reynard. He was of distin­
	    <lb/>guished talents, but of no probity or honour;
	    <pb n="1011"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="1(6)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">11</mw>
	    <lb/>in fact, he had nothing to recommend him
	    <lb/>but the knowledge of the law, glossing the
	    <lb/>new constitution.</p>
              <p>It was <name>Whitsunday</name> when the Counsellor
	    <lb/>met <persName>Mr. Covenhoven</persName> at my father's house,
	    <lb/>where there were many different characters
	    <lb/>assembled. I viewed them all with a lynx eye,
	    <lb/>and contemplated their varied faces. <persName>John
	    <lb/>C.'s</persName> was sincerity and truth. In all he said,
	    <lb/><persName>Counsellor Blackbean</persName> was all evasion, de­
	    <lb/>ceit, and hypocrisy.</p>
              <p>The conversation turned on a variety of
	    <lb/>subjects, in which each of the company took
	    <lb/>a part. <persName>John C.</persName> talked of a large turnip rai­
	    <lb/>sed on <placeName>Long-Island</placeName> near where the old tulip
	    <lb/>tree stood. <choice><sic>i</sic><corr>I</corr></choice>f the <orgName>Horticultural Society</orgName> had
	    <lb/>it, he would get a silver pitcher for it.</p>
              <p><said>I should endeavour with all my ingenui­
	      <lb/>ty,</said> said <persName>Blackbean</persName>, <said>to enter in a caveat,
	      <lb/>and prevent your getting the premium, by
	      <lb/>endeavouring to prove it a radish, merely to
	      <lb/>gratify my own ambition, and to convince the
	      <lb/>world that we only live for opposition.</said></p>

              <p>My mother then entered the room, and the
	    <lb/>conversation turned on the state of the wea­
	    <lb/>ther; she remarked, that by the almanac there
	    <lb/>would be an eclipse on the <date when="--05-31">last of <name>May</name></date>, in
	    <lb/>the latitude of <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>. My father observed,
	    <lb/>that he thought from his feelings, which he
	    <lb/>deemed better than an almanac, that it would
	    <lb/>very soon rain; and the conversation then, as
	    <lb/>a natural consequence, turned on horticultural
	    <lb/>pursuits. My mother was truly one of the
	    <lb/>tender sex, gentle and kind in her demeanour,
	    <lb/>persuasive in her manner, and one who ho­
	    <lb/>noured her husband as <persName>Sarah</persName> did her Lord, by
	    <lb/>a cheerful and ready obedience to his com­
	    <lb/>mands. She was of the <name>Drelincourt</name> family.
	    <lb/>My father was born in <placeName>Albermale county</placeName>,
	    <lb/><placeName>Virginia</placeName>; he was a justice of the quorum, and
	    <lb/>very unlike many of our present judicial offi­
	    <lb/>cers, was much more desirous to make peace
	    <lb/>between enemies, than to exasperate or des­
	    <lb/>troy the unity of friends. I have two sisters,
	    <lb/>women of fashion, and who have ventured
	    <lb/>into high life. <persName>Artemisia</persName> is tall and slender,
	    <lb/>elegantly formed to please. <persName>Arrabella</persName> is pas­
	    <lb/>sionate, but possesses a good heart; her time
	    <lb/>is chiefly devoted to music, dancing, and the

	    <lb/>prosperity and riches, honours and enjoyments
	    <lb/>are eagerly wished for by the present genera­

	    <lb/>with their intelligent niece, <persName>Miss Rosemary</persName>,
	    <lb/>cousin to <persName>Miss Serena Mayberry</persName>, who is now
	    <lb/>on a visit to <placeName>Albany</placeName>, the metropolis of this
	    <lb/>state, where the learned and eloquent all as­
	    <lb/>semble to display their wisdom; and once a
	    <lb/>year petition for all their approaching wants.</p>
              <p>Immediately on their arrival they had every
	    <lb/>respect paid to them that strangers of distinc­
	    <lb/>tion are entitled to; not ringing of bells and
	    <lb/>firing of great guns, that is intended for such
	    <lb/>only who distinguished themselves in our
	    <lb/>late wars, which are now happily subsided.
	    <lb/><persName>Miss Rosemary</persName> was immediately applied to by
	    <lb/>some missionaries, to accompany them to
	    <lb/><placeName>Otaheite</placeName>, to instruct and civalize the natives,
	    <lb/>who are in rather a barbarous state. She
	    <lb/>condescendingly replied that such a task would
	    <lb/>afford her an inward satisfaction, and she
	    <lb/>should immediately consult those who had
	    <lb/>her welfare at heart in this state of her mind.
	    <lb/>Many of her friends called on her; she never
	    <lb/>consulted any but <persName>lord</persName> and <persName>lady Norberry</persName>,
	    <lb/>who readily acquiesed in such a laudable un­

	    <lb/>the humourous <persName>doctor Darcy</persName>, and he was
	    <lb/>continually teazing her. One day he was
	    <lb/>accosted by his friend, who said, <said>it is a fine
	      <lb/>day, Doctor.</said> <said>Ah,</said> he replied, <said>very fine
	      <lb/>to make tansy and balsam grow; but foggy
	      <lb/>mornings and easterly winds, with redundant
	      <lb/>rains, are my benefits</said> A dense atmosphere
	    <lb/>always brings on tremors, agues, and all other
	    <lb/>inviting occasions to send for the doctor, who,
	    <lb/>at the first visit, if he cannot exactly discrim­
	    <lb/>inate what disorder his patient is attacked
	    <lb/>with, (for there is a great similarity in diseases)
	    <lb/>he must sit and appear, after the ceremony of
	    <lb/>feeling the pulse is over, quite mute. Silence
	    <lb/>in a physician is always a mark of great
	    <lb/>wisdom and skill. <persName>Lord</persName> and <persName>lady Norberry</persName>
	    <lb/>are retired characters, never mix in the gay
	    <lb/>world. <persName>Lord L.</persName> one day addressed himself
	    <lb/>to <persName>lady L.</persName> in the following style: <said>What is
	      <lb/>your opinion of the present times, my dear, for

	      <lb/>contented themselves with admiring dresses
	      <lb/>made for other people to wear, now seek plea­
	      <lb/>sure in more exalted pursuits; such as instruct­
	      <lb/>ing those that know less that themselves; for
	      <lb/>there are, you know, none quite so ignorant
	      <lb/>but can teach a little, and so in the end ag­
	      <lb/>grandize themselves; that is the great self-
	      <lb/>sufficiency which many of the present day evi­
	      <lb/>dently discover.</said> <said>I thank you, my dear,
	      <lb/>for your opinion and information; but, I as­
	      <lb/>sure you, I feel unhappy at the idea of our
	      <lb/>niece leaving us; what possible advantage
	      <lb/>will it be to herself? You certainly think that

	    <lb/>you when you descend from a jaunting car,
	    <lb/>or any handsome carriage, particularly in the
	    <lb/><placeName>New England states</placeName>; where they are very
	    <lb/>ambitious for knowledge, most particularly
	    <lb/>the females; the men being for the most part
	    <lb/>always planning, which is sometimes better
	    <lb/>than working</p>
              <p><persName>Squire Nimble</persName> had two daughters, both in­
	    <lb/>telligent girls; they could spin and talk at the
	    <lb/>same time, most cheerfully; especially the
	    <lb/>youngest, named <persName>Sarah</persName>, in memory of her
	    <lb/>grandmother, who lived to the age of one
	    <lb/>hundred.</p>
              <p>I addressed the oldest, who was not quite
	    <lb/>so affable, and inquired how the young ladies
	    <lb/>employed their time in the country; she
	    <lb/>quickly replied, two-thirds of their time was
	    <lb/>spent in obtaining intelligence of the concerns
	    <lb/>of their neighbours—their economy, their
	    <lb/>pusillanimity, their religion and industry, and
	    <lb/>every other occurrence that took place. I
	    <lb/>then requested her to give me a short de­

	    <lb/>scription of their marriage ceremonies and
	    <lb/>christenings, as we intended to spend a day
	    <lb/>or two at this house of agreeable entertain­
	    <lb/>ment, before we went to <placeName>Poughkeepsie</placeName>,
	    <lb/>for ours was only intended as a jaunt of plea­
	    <lb/>sure. My nephew, a youth of twenty years
	    <lb/>of age, was of our party, who never takes
	    <lb/>any delight in presence of the ladies; so
	    <lb/>he amused himself by seeing the horses fed,
	    <lb/>and keeping the fowls from eating their
	    <lb/>oats, that they may be enabled to proceed
	    <lb/>on their journey. He held it a true maxim,
	    <lb/>that when you alight at an inn, you should
	    <lb/>see that your horses are taken good care of,
	    <lb/>and not depend on a vassal, who always
	    <lb/>neglects them.</p>
              <p>The front of <persName>Squire Nimble's</persName> house was
	    <lb/>nearly covered with dried pumpkins and ap­
	    <lb/>ples. His eldest daughter sauntered with
	    <lb/>me, by way of amusement, first to the hog-
	    <lb/>sty, and then to the cucumber plot, to look
	    <lb/>for melons; for indeed she was a good
	    <lb/>sort of a girl, tried to amuse me while her
	    <lb/>mother, as I supposed, was preparing the
	    <lb/>chickens for dinner, as I heard a great noise

	    <lb/>and fluttering in the coop, which I endea­
	    <lb/>voured to shut my ears against, but could
	    <lb/>not entirely. I began singing <title rend="pre(“)post(”)">Welcome <persName>La
	      <lb/>Fayette</persName></title>—she begged me to write it for her.
	    <lb/>She said she would send to the store for pa­
	    <lb/>per; I told her we had plenty, and would
	    <lb/>give it to her.</p>
              <p>I then requested she would relate the cus­
	    <lb/>toms of the place. She said it would be im­
	    <lb/>possible, as every family varied in their pur­
	    <lb/>suits; some rose early, some likewise were
	    <lb/>so avaricious, that they worked both day and
	    <lb/>night; for farming required great, very great
	    <lb/>industry; and then you would know that you
	    <lb/>would obtain cash. She was fearful, she
	    <lb/>said, that the grand canal so much talked of
	    <lb/>formerly, and now, she heard, so much used,
	    <lb/>would ruin all the farmers near <placeName>New-York</placeName>;
	    <lb/>as <term>truck</term> (that is, <gloss>produce</gloss>) had been sold so
	    <lb/>cheap that it would not pay for raising it;
	    <lb/>and, indeed, their neighbour <persName>Spriggins</persName> had
	    <lb/>reported that it was current in <placeName>New-York</placeName>,
	    <lb/>that the next trippers in the canal boats
	    <lb/>meant, by way of speculation, to give their

                <said>So I told father—let

              <p>In the height of our conversation, the old
	    <lb/>gentleman (by name <persName>Nimble</persName>) announced din­
	    <lb/>ner; my nephew was called from the pigeon
	    <lb/>house, and <persName>miss Frances Abercrombie</persName> from
	    <lb/>the garden, where she was collecting flower
	    <lb/>seeds, to an excellent dinner prepared by
	    <lb/><persName>Mrs. Nimble</persName>, who, I assure you, was a
	    <lb/>dignified lady, for the keeper of a hotel, and
	    <lb/>so polite withal, that it was not quite so
	    <lb/>agreeable at the time that our appetites were
	    <lb/>so keen. She dissected the poultry with
	    <lb/>great exactness, while her husband sliced the
	    <lb/>ham very thin, and looked up to her for ap­
	    <lb/>probation—<said>Ladies, what will you be pleas­
	      <lb/>ed to be helped to? These chickens always
	      <lb/>roosted in our little hen house, and I fed
	      <lb/>them daily; these are of the top-knot breed
	      <lb/>and very fat.</said> I confess I was not much
	    <lb/>pleased, though the scripture says <said>kill and
	      <lb/>eat.</said> I could not taste my chicken, for she
	    <lb/>had too ably expatiated on the breed. I felt
	    <lb/>disagreeable; begged to be helped to ham
	    <lb/>as, coming from <placeName>New-York</placeName>, fresh provisions
	    <lb/>were no novelty. Not eat chickens!—she
	    <lb/>was surprised. My nephew ate voraciously

	    <lb/>over we should be well charged, and so spared
	    <lb/>not his taste of all the good things that were
	    <lb/>offered; and the time passed on quite agreea­
	    <lb/>bly. <said>Ladies,</said> said the landlord, <said rend="pre()">you have
	      <lb/>had great doings in <placeName>York</placeName>. I hear the great
	      <lb/><persName>Fayette</persName> is come; were you to see him?</said>
	    <lb/><said>By all means; every inhabitant paid due
	      <lb/>homage to him. <name>Jew</name> and <name>Christian</name>, <name>catho­
		<lb/>lic</name> and <name>protestant</name>, all united to worship him.</said>
	    <lb/><said>The latter days are not far off,</said> said the
	    <lb/>old man, <said>for we read in <bibl><regMe>Zechariah</regMe></bibl>, (I do
	      <lb/>not remember the chapter,) that before the
	      <lb/>great and terrible day of the Lord come, all
	      <lb/>people shall be united—<name>Jews</name>, <name>Turks</name>, and
	      <lb/><name>Christians</name>, in one cause, and that in the
	      <lb/>cause of truth; and as he has fought for us,
	      <lb/>that is truth, and no one dare contradict it. I
	      <lb/>commend the people of <placeName>New-York</placeName>, who seem
	      <lb/>to exceed all the states in magnificence and 
	      <lb/>grandeur.</said></p>
              <p>The conversation turned on a variety of
	    <lb/>subjects. <persName>Sarah</persName>, the youngest daughter, is
	    <lb/>very conversant; for it is to be observed, that

	    <lb/>greatest recommendation to a young lady.—
	    <lb/>Not so the present day: they now talk of
	    <lb/><name>Redgauntlets</name>, Spies, Pilots and Pirates, and
	    <lb/>a whole train of excellent writings not to be
	    <lb/>surpassed in these days—such is female in­
	    <lb/>quisitiveness.</p>
              <p>There was a writer in <placeName>New-Jersey</placeName> in for­
	    <lb/>mer days, who signed his name <persName>Hortensius</persName>;
	    <lb/>he particularly addressed his fair countrywo­
	    <lb/>men as follows:</p>
              <p><quote>To your homespun, my fair daughters;
	      <lb/>I advise you, for your own peace and quiet.</quote><lb/>To your homespun—meaning their ancient
	    <lb/>manners and customs, as being most conge­
	    <lb/>nial to happiness.</p>
              <p>After dinner the company dispersed to their
	    <lb/>different occupations; our company to their
	    <lb/>pleasure. <persName>Sarah</persName> staid by us, at my request,
	    <lb/>and was very intelligible. The old lady then
	    <lb/>came to us. I asked the age of her oldest
	    <lb/>daughter. She told me, she was born in

	      <lb/>with honourable and profitable situations, as
	      <lb/>entirely to forget they ever were born; for

	      <lb/>they must not look back, for fear of turning
	      <lb/>to salt—or dirt. My sister lived to a good

	      <lb/>of <placeName>New-York</placeName>, their descent, cleanly appear­

	    <lb/>with old <persName>Mrs. Nimble's</persName> recital of past events,

	    <lb/>most said black and white, no distinction—a
	    <lb/>fat goose is a fat goose, and he that can pur­

	    <lb/>I told them we would just take them to <persName>Joe

	    <lb/>is above German pride, and that is represent­
	    <lb/>ed to exceed all others—for certainly they

	    <lb/>was a fine pleasant morning when we left our

	    <lb/>in their bills as my nephew <persName>Ge<choice><sic/><corr>o</corr></choice>rge Washing­

	    <lb/>were no very lively occurrences took place;

	    <lb/>in a tavern, as he called it; came for us, and
	    <lb/>received us with every mark of attention;
	    <lb/>kindly inquired after the banker in <placeName>New-York</placeName>
	    <lb/>that had introduced us, and such trivial con­
	    <lb/>versation as generally takes place at the first
	    <lb/>interview of the rich and great.</p>
              <p><said>Have you dined?</said> We, in order to save

              <p><persName>Judge Prodigal's</persName> lady was about fifty years

	    <lb/>facetious for one of her time of life, and de­
	    <lb/>lighted in tales of humour. <said>Now, ladies,</said>
	    <lb/>said she, <said>you must throw aside all ceremony
	      <lb/>in my house, and enjoy yourselves as if at

              <p>The village rang at the arrival of such

	    <lb/>ing car stood the strictest scrutiny. They
	    <lb/>were very inquisitive to know if we were the
	    <lb/>owners, which I assure you we did not con­
	    <lb/>ceal. The servants gazed, the neighbours
	    <lb/>made slight excuses for calling, and I can be
	    <lb/>free to say, we were much admired.</p>

              <p><persName>Miss Abercrombie</persName> was handsomely dressed
	    <lb/>in a riding habit of the colour of the croco­
	    <lb/>dile, changeable; her hat turned up in front,
	    <lb/>with two waving black feathers; she had a
	    <lb/>handsome hand, with several glittering rings
	    <lb/>on her fingers, which she variously displayed
	    <lb/>by touching the piano—for they had an ex­
	    <lb/>cellent one.</p>
              <p>A young lady about sixteen years of age
	    <lb/>was then introduced—tall of stature, with fair
	    <lb/>hair and pale visage, and rather reserved in
	    <lb/>her manners, quite unlike her mother; seem­
	    <lb/>ed as if all her movements were planned,
	    <lb/>and all her observations studied; she tried to
	    <lb/>be agreeable, but that was impossible, for her
	    <lb/>formal manners had become habitual, and she
	    <lb/>could not surmount them. My nephew
	    <lb/>gazed at her, as at a comet, with pleasure
	    <lb/>and astonishment. She shone in his eyes
	    <lb/>with that brightness that illumined his soul
	    <lb/>beyond all he had ever seen before. Her
	    <lb/>mother, with her accustomed frankness, apo­
	    <lb/>logized for <persName>Emily's</persName> taciturnity; saying at
	    <lb/><placeName>Bethlehem</placeName>, where she had been educated, the
	    <lb/>young ladies were all serio<choice><sic><g ref="#invertedu"/></sic><corr>u</corr></choice>s. <said>O mamma!

	      <lb/>you always make me the subject of your iro­
	      <lb/>ny; certainly I have not that flow of words
	      <lb/>which I shall have when more acquainted
	      <lb/>with the world: and I have been taught that
	      <lb/>it is better not to speak, than to do it ungrace­
	      <lb/>fully. I hope my studious manner will give
	      <lb/>no offence to my dear parents; and at present
	      <lb/>it seems I have no other desire than to please
	      <lb/>them.</said> <said>Pray Miss,</said> interrupted <persName>Miss

              <p><said>Certainly I did, or I should not have
	      <lb/>remained there.</said> Tea being announced, the
	    <lb/>ladies and gentlemen entered the drawing-
	    <lb/>room, which appeared as though it had not
	    <lb/>been opened for some time. There were
	    <lb/>sumptuous things in great profusion, particu­
	    <lb/>larly all kinds of preserves; the manner in
	    <lb/>which they were preserved, gave the old lady
	    <lb/>great pleasure to relate.</p>
              <p>After tea the party all took a walk to the
	    <lb/>river; <persName>George Washington Claibourn</persName> tak­

	    <lb/>tleman.</p>
              <p>Every brook and tree was described to us
	    <lb/>by the aged pair; every plant and shrub, their
	    <lb/>usefulness and virtues were pointed out; and
	    <lb/>I can truly say the walk was both pleasant
	    <lb/>and edifying, for nothing pleased <persName>Mrs. Prodi­
	    <lb/>gal</persName> more than diffusing her knowledge to
	    <lb/>benefit the human race. Her husband though
	    <lb/>a good man, was secret and mysterious in all
	    <lb/>his ways, for it may be truly said they were
	    <lb/>past finding out.</p>
              <p>The neighbours all assembled in the eve­
	    <lb/>ning; some no doubt out of curiosity, some to
	    <lb/>make remarks, and others to take patterns of
	    <lb/>the dresses of the ladies. The conversation
	    <lb/>was varied and entertaining, the ladies sung;

	      <lb/>coats and thread-bare waistcoasts worn, as
	      <lb/>an apology for economy, to bring all on

	      <lb/>national road from <placeName>Washington city</placeName> to <placeName>Ala­
	      <lb/>bama</placeName>, is ominous that the next president
	      <lb/>will be chosen from the magnificent city
	      <lb/>of <placeName>New-York</placeName>, to the extreme mortification
	      <lb/>of the large, mountainous, well watered, and
	      <lb/>beautiful state of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, whose superb
	      <lb/>natural bridge has been so exquisitely de­
	      <lb/>scribed by a great scientific character, as

	    <lb/>of the family of expectants, whose roving
	    <lb/>imaginations while they sleep, always por­
	    <lb/>tray scenes of gayety, and shadows of
	    <lb/>nothing when awake.—In short, what is life
	    <lb/>but a dream?—the busied and insignificant
	    <lb/>never awake.</p>
              <p>The young ladies took a ride with my ne­
	    <lb/>phew, to the <placeName>Ballston springs</placeName>; and they were
	    <lb/>much entertained with the company. Per­

	    <lb/>for their health: various other motives induce
	    <lb/>them—lovers meet their adorables; lawyers
	    <lb/>meet their clients face to face; speculators
	    <lb/>their <name>Tristram Shandys</name> and <name>Peregrine Pic­

	    <lb/>pleasure, if possible to be found. The sons

	    <lb/>tled, they all fly to their respective homes, per­
	    <lb/>fectly cured of idleness and folly.</p>
              <p>Returning across the <placeName>Hudson</placeName>, my nephew
	    <lb/>saw the time fast approaching that he must
	    <lb/>leave <persName>Miss Emily</persName>, never, perhaps, again to
	    <lb/>see her. He revolved in his mind what
	    <lb/>manner of behaviour he should adopt to
	    <lb/>convince her of his attachment;—she is too
	    <lb/>sensible to believe every idol tale that may
	    <lb/>be told her, and has too penetrating an eye
	    <lb/>not to discover real affection.</p>
              <p><said>The eyes,</said> says <persName>Seneca</persName>, <said>are the win­
	      <lb/>dows of the soul;</said> and I have no doubt in my
	    <lb/>mind of the truth of it. Various were the
	    <lb/>sensations that perplexed the lovers. It was
	    <lb/>certainly a first and a reciprocal attachment,
	    <lb/>and not easily overcome by absence; no, that
	    <lb/>would only increase it. He advanced to­
	    <lb/>wards her, and in a pensive manner thus ad­
	    <lb/>dressed her:</p>
              <p><said>Will you, my charming fair, be so indul­
	      <lb/>gent as to hear my painful tale? Many, I am

	      <lb/>endure. I am young, and surely nothing can
	      <lb/>distress the mind more than hope delayed.
	      <lb/>Reason prompts me freely to speak to the ar­
	      <lb/>biter of my fate. But, alas! how can I? my
	      <lb/>tongue falters, and I shall illy grace my cause
	      <lb/>in speaking for myself.</said> She replied, <said>This
	      <lb/>is the grand prerogative of your sex: you
	      <lb/>can speak; but woman oft pines and sickens;
	      <lb/>she dares scarcely even think; she whispers
	      <lb/>to the wind, and vainly strives to subdue the
	      <lb/>feelings of nature; she flies to amusements,
	      <lb/>company, and all inviting occasions to make
	      <lb/>her forget herself; but time alone can re­
	      <lb/>lieve her: while man, roving from sweet to
	      <lb/>sweet, feels not the sting.</said></p>
              <p>The day at length arrived, when we were
	    <lb/>to return to <placeName>New-York</placeName>; the confusion was
	    <lb/>evident on seeing the young people take
	    <lb/>leave of each other. My nephew took a lock
	    <lb/>of <persName>Emily's</persName> auburn hair, as a memento of his
	    <lb/>attachment. We hastened on our journey;
	    <lb/>did not stop at <placeName>Croton</placeName> on our return, as my
	    <lb/>friends were opposed to it from motives I be­
	    <lb/>fore remarked.</p>

              <p>How satisfied the mind appears on return­

	    <lb/>every thought tends to cheer you; I was call­
	    <lb/>ed to the door by a rap; a man of dejected
	    <lb/>appearance delivered me a note from <persName>Miss

	    <lb/>stated, that in eight or ten days she and her
	    <lb/>sister intended to pay us a visit.</p>
              <p>Thunderstruck, my nephew <persName>George Wash­
	    <lb/>ington Clairborn</persName> and <persName>Miss Frances Abercrom­
	    <lb/>bie</persName>, were not pleased at the sight of this note.
	    <lb/><said>How embarrassed, my dear aunt, shall we

	      <lb/>from <placeName>Poughkeepsie</placeName> will not be here at the
	      <lb/>same time.</said></p>
              <p>
                <said>My dear young friends, we must endea­
	      <lb/>vour to make life easy. God made us all. We

	    <lb/>never forget the smallest occurrences that
	    <lb/>took place. A fortunate event took place in

                <said>The greatest possible; the first

              <p>The <persName>Miss Nimbles</persName> having paid a social
	    <lb/>visit, and endeavoured to make it as agreeable
	    <lb/>as possible, I regretted I had not an oppor­
	    <lb/>tunity of introducing them to such characters
	    <lb/>as would be agreeable to their ideas; there
	    <lb/>being none in my circle of acquaintances; this
	    <lb/>was extremely unpleasant; I assured them I

	    <lb/>ed their country acquaintances.</p>
              <p>We condescended to see them safe in the

	    <lb/>with the sight of many great characters of the

	    <lb/>with the ladies of <placeName>New-York</placeName>, than trying to
	    <lb/>conquer the colonies. They often amused

	    <lb/>pitious, many, very many, would never have
	    <lb/>left this fine country. Their steady habits would
	    <lb/>always have secured them a competency, and
	    <lb/>by a moderate share of industry, would have
	    <lb/>acquired wealth. The females are very sub­
	    <lb/>missive to the advice of their husbands, and
	    <lb/>pay them every due respect, as lords of the
	    <lb/>creation.</p>
              <p>A jaunt was then proposed by my nephew,
	    <lb/>which was agreed to by the ladies to visit the
	    <lb/><name>Linnæan garden</name>, at <placeName>Flushing</placeName>, accompanied
	    <lb/>by an acquaintance of ours, <persName>Colonel Fitz­
	    <lb/>empty</persName> and <persName>Major Flash</persName>, formerly belonging
	    <lb/>to the <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> line, both gentlemen of
	    <lb/>figure and fashion. <persName>Miss Matilda Ann
	    <lb/>Van Schoten</persName> and <persName>Arabella Somerfield</persName> were
	    <lb/>also of the party.</p>
              <p>Joy sparkled in the countenances of the
	    <lb/>young people. They expressed a wish to
	    <lb/>visit some of the old <name>Knickerbocker</name> families.
	    <lb/>I promised them that on a future day, when
	    <lb/>I should be at leisure, I would show them
	    <lb/>some of <persName>Miss Claibourn's</persName> remarks, and her

	    <lb/>humorous descriptions would no doubt please
	    <lb/>them.</p>
              <p><persName>Colonel Fitzempty</persName> was all hilarity and
	    <lb/>good humour; particularly attentive to <persName>Miss
	    <lb/>Frances</persName>; who, as I have before remarked,
	    <lb/>possessed all those engaging accomplishments
	    <lb/>that were desirable in a young lady, and a
	    <lb/>goodness of heart beyond her sex.</p>
              <p>My nephew let no opportunity escape, that
	    <lb/>offered, to convince <persName>Miss Emily Prodigal</persName> that
	    <lb/>his passion was sincere; and her counte­

	    <lb/>rose in her mind were visible in her face: of
	    <lb/>course, her lover could never flatter himself
	    <lb/>that he was agreeable to her. Her words
	    <lb/>must fix his destiny, for indeed she was very
	    <lb/>choice of them.</p>
              <p>Poor fello! he had a hard card to play:
	    <lb/>hearts were trumps—he had difficulty to gain
	    <lb/>the odd trick; or, more plainly speaking,

              <p>The party now amused themselves in the

	    <lb/>home. Like our first parents, they were not

              <p>On our arrival in <placeName>New-York</placeName>, the guns

	    <lb/>were pleased, and all great personages had an

              <p>I had promised the young ladies, that I
	    <lb/>would slightly mention a few observations
	    <lb/>that I had made on the amiable young lady,
	    <lb/>that would in a future page amuse my fair
	    <lb/>readers, whose interesting narrative will,

	    <lb/>life, and never appear happy.</p>
              <p>How cheerful should young ladies always
	    <lb/>appear!—they are the loveliest gift of the Su­
	    <lb/>preme Being; they should honour Him,
	    <lb/>and by all engaging, endearing means, soften
	    <lb/>their manners, so as at all times to delight
	    <lb/>the other sex, who appear always, many of
	    <lb/>them, as though the world which is round
	    <lb/>was on their backs, having such a load of
	    <lb/>cares, and so many circuitous windings in
	    <lb/>their business, that often entangle them so as
	    <lb/>not easily to be extricated by usual means.</p>
              <p>While amusing my friends at supper, an

	    <lb/>try was asked in; he apologised for his late
	    <lb/>visit, saying the steam-boat had just arrived,
	    <lb/>mentioning he had a letter for the lady of the
	    <lb/>house, from <placeName>Pequest</placeName>. The sound was melodi­
	    <lb/>ous to my ears, being the place where most
	    <lb/>of my relations reside, and where in my
	    <lb/>infancy I was taught, that as our first beha­
	    <lb/>viour is, so our characters will be stamped.</p>
              <p>When pride is too visible in our appear­
	    <lb/>ance by haughty, austere looks, we never
	    <lb/>will be agreeable in society, but shunned, as
	    <lb/>approaching contagion. In my childhood I
	    <lb/>was taught to venerate age, to love those of
	    <lb/>my own years, and freely afford all the satis­
	    <lb/>faction to the mind of my friends, as would
	    <lb/>again induce them to see me. My gayety of
	    <lb/>heart was always evident, when I could meet
	    <lb/>such as were suitable, who were animating;
	    <lb/>but who did not, as is the prevailing custom,
	    <lb/>ask too many questions: some questions it is
	    <lb/>not always agreeable to answer.</p>
              <p>I assure you, my dear friends, I have met
	    <lb/>with many worthy people, that I could com­
	    <lb/>pare to nothing but a teacher hearing the

	      <lb/>you?</said> <said>Not quite fifty, Sir.</said> <said>That
	      <lb/>being the death's-door of the ladies, surely
	      <lb/>you look charming.</said> That is a sufficient
	    <lb/>apology, they think, for their flattery; and
	    <lb/>quickly reply,—<said>Bless me! you do not look
	      <lb/>more than forty.</said> Then vanity steps forward
	    <lb/>and erects her beak; instantly all the gayety
	    <lb/>of youth is assumed, singing, dancing, joking,
	    <lb/>and every thing becoming youth. The
	    <lb/>age of fifty is thrown aside by empty compli­
	    <lb/>ments.</p>
              <p>The old gentleman that arrived in the
	    <lb/>steam-boat handed me a letter; it had a hu­

	    <lb/>and directed—<said><persName>Mrs. C.B.</persName>, widow, of <placeName>New-
	      <lb/>York</placeName>. These with care and speed.</said> I in­

	    <lb/>tion of his wife, that had a great opinion of
	    <lb/>her knowledge, and a great friendship for
	    <lb/>me, which was of a nature never to be for­
	    <lb/>gotten. Our situations in life were very dif­
	    <lb/>ferent; but these good people never disqui­
	    <lb/>eted themselves about that; they openly
	    <lb/>indulged in the full flow of goodness, which

	    <lb/>was alive in their bosoms, and which, I have
	    <lb/>every reason to suppose will continue until
	    <lb/>the lamp of life is extinguished. How grieved
	    <lb/>I felt, at their remembrance of me; for I had
	    <lb/>not in years seen them;—every pleasing
	    <lb/>theme, every delightful sensation that had
	    <lb/>been felt by me when I was young, arose in
	    <lb/>my bosom. Who can say, that true and
	    <lb/>sincere friendship will wear from the mind?
	    <lb/>Here is a complete contradiction of it—no
	    <lb/>interest prompted them to write, no pride to
	    <lb/>show their education, and no motive but sin­
	    <lb/>cerity and friendship.</p>
              <p>What an inestimable gift it is to know how
	    <lb/>to prize a friend! Many, ah, too many, pass
	    <lb/>through this vale of life without knowing
	    <lb/>friendship—no kind feelings for any of the
	    <lb/>human race—they love only themselves.—
	    <lb/>When fortune smiles, as she often does,
	    <lb/>on these selfish characters, they feel them­
	    <lb/>selves independent of the world, and care not
	    <lb/>for it.</p>

              <p><persName>Squire Simpson</persName>, a fine robust looking man,
	    <lb/>about forty years of age, rather corpulent, and
	    <lb/>active in agricultural pursuits, invited his wil­
	    <lb/>ling neighbours to an entertainment in his
	    <lb/>house. His wife, who was born at <placeName>Hackets­
	    <lb/>town</placeName>, near <placeName>Schooley's mountain</placeName>, was of re­
	    <lb/>spectable parentage. Her father being a me­

	    <lb/>daughter <persName>Joanna Percy</persName>, was always dutiful
	    <lb/>to his commands in every respect, which was
	    <lb/>a great solace to him in his declining years.
	    <lb/>At her marriage with <persName>Squire Simpson</persName>, the sur­
	    <lb/>rounding neighbours were all invited to the
	    <lb/>nuptials, particularly <persName>Thomas Sawdust</persName> their
	    <lb/>landlord, who kindly lent them his bald filly
	    <lb/>to bring their relatives to the wedding, it be­
	    <lb/>ing some distance over the mountain where
	    <lb/>their friends resided.</p>

              <p>On this jocund occasion all apparently, old
	    <lb/>and young, seemed pleased.  The Squire
	    <lb/>was dressed in a fine broadcloth coat, manu­

              <p>It was of a beautiful snail colour; his

	    <lb/>there was a peculiar turn to every thing—al­

	    <lb/>slender waist; her slippers were weaselskins,
	    <lb/>beautifully embroidered, and shaped like
	    <lb/>sandals.</p>
              <p>The reverend divine, her father, was pen­
	    <lb/>sive, notwithstanding the hilarity of the com­

	    <lb/>daughter of <persName>Counsellor Bowlsby</persName>, or <placeName>Derby­
	    <lb/>shire</placeName>, <placeName>England</placeName>, was also a guest. Her father
	    <lb/>emigrated to this country some years ago to
	    <lb/>acquire wealth, leaving all his family, who
	    <lb/>were in the haberdashery line, to remain in
	    <lb/>the same state and condition that they had
	    <lb/>been in since <persName>George the Third's</persName> reign—and
	    <lb/>no prospect of aggrandizing themselves.—
	    <lb/><persName>Queen Caroline's</persName> disappointments and vexa­
	    <lb/>tions, and the troubles she met, were a con­

	    <lb/>would have pleaded more powerfully. The
	    <lb/>Counsellor was a distant relation of the late
	    <lb/><persName>Curran</persName>, and a correspondent of the great

              <p>The <date>twenty-fifth of <name>November</name></date> at last
	    <lb/>came; it was a smoky day, and what is
	    <lb/>termed an Indian summer. All the parties
	    <lb/>assembled, and the whole group made a very
	    <lb/>splendid appearance, each endeavouring to
	    <lb/>outshine their neighbour. At length the
	    <lb/>solemn moment arrived; and the gentle
	    <lb/>'Squire led his lovely fair to the altar of <persName>Hy­

	    <lb/>mony was performing; and all the avenues
	    <lb/>to the house were filled to witness the cere­
	    <lb/>mony. When finished, one of the guests
	    <lb/>hastened and snatched the first kiss, which
	    <lb/>quite discomfited him, and he felt quite con­
	    <lb/>fused. This passed over, and supper was
	    <lb/>announced; after which was a dancing scene.
	    <lb/>Old <persName>Tony</persName> (the fiddler) was engaged, and

	    <lb/>and those who fatigue themselves most are

              <p><persName>Miss Mayberry</persName>, a neat young lady from

	    <lb/>florid countenance and clear black eyes, a
	    <lb/>real topaz necklace around her neck, was
	    <lb/>also of the company. She attracted much
	    <lb/>notice at this splendid wedding; and, what
	    <lb/>added to her charms, she was perfectly silent
	    <lb/>—seemed formed for admiration. A lieute­
	    <lb/>nant of marines, who had been at the <placeName>Brazils</placeName>,
	    <lb/>and travelled greatly, was at the <name>Mountain
	      <lb/>Springs</name> for his health. His person was quite
	    <lb/>outlandish—so he excited some remarks and
	    <lb/>mirth among the company at the mountain,
	    <lb/>who, to do them justice, considered them­
	    <lb/>selves the tops of the country, and made
	    <lb/>shrewd remarks on this outlandish dandy.</p>
              <p>The ladies said he <said>looked like a toad un­

	      <lb/>or four gentlemen travelling through the

	      <lb/>she would give him a short history of her

	    <lb/>were many captivating females of nice dis­

              <p>I again returned to my happy home in

	    <lb/>family, who are all inquisitiveness: when I re­
	    <lb/>turn I am compelled to promise them some
	    <lb/>fairy tales. I told them it would not be long
	    <lb/>before I would open my scrutoire, to let them

              <p>To engage the attention of my family, I
	    <lb/>related a melancholy tale, that happened
	    <lb/>while I was travelling through <placeName>Thakiat</placeName> up

	    <lb/>the public road. Quickly appeared a young
	    <lb/>man in custody; the sheriff allowed him to
	    <lb/>walk alone. When he first approached me he
	    <lb/>looked pale. I thought he was a robber; but
	    <lb/>the crime he had committed was a breach of
	    <lb/>honour: he was engaged to marry a young
	    <lb/>girl, and had deceived her. Her father was in
	    <lb/>company, but remained inexorable in his so­
	    <lb/>licitations. <said>Say, rash youth! what recom­
	      <lb/>pense will you make for deceiving my belov­
	      <lb/>ed daughter, who pines from morning to eve
	      <lb/>on account of your false promises to her?</said></p>
              <p><said>Good old man,</said> the youth replied, <said>I
	      <lb/>cannot love your daughter—why should I
	      <lb/>longer deceive her? Her temper seems over­
	      <lb/>bearing. At our first acquaintance she ap­
	      <lb/>peared angelic, and I looked upon her as my
	      <lb/>second self—one in whom was centered all
	      <lb/>that could make life agreeable; but on our
	      <lb/>farther acquaintance I think she lost that
	      <lb/>heavenly appearance which I at first formed
	      <lb/>of her: and why, good sir, while my mind
	      <lb/>forebodes that we cannot live happy—why, I
	      <lb/>say, provoke God's anger, by calling him to
	      <lb/>witness, that we will spend our days together

	      <lb/>in constancy, when I am certain we cannot?
	      <lb/>I repeat, I cannot, my aged friend, be happy
	      <lb/>with your too much indulged daughter; so
	      <lb/>do as you please with me—scoff at me, insult
	      <lb/>me, imprison me, or whatever else you intend,
	      <lb/>but I cannot marry your daughter.</said></p>
              <p><persName>Simon Plenty</persName>, the father of the young girl,
	    <lb/>was a miller, and the young man was a
	    <lb/>wheelwright; his name was <persName>Aaron Brown</persName><lb/>from <placeName>Saugerchies</placeName>. The old man upbraided
	    <lb/>him, and hoped he would want the sweepings
	    <lb/>of his mill before he died, for bread to nourish
	    <lb/>his proud haughty body, while his daughter
	    <lb/>would be feasting out of the tenth of every

	      <lb/>man is fallible, and misery may await him.</said></p>
              <p>The young man sat silent at the severe up­
	    <lb/>braidings of <persName>Simon Plenty</persName>, the miller: he
	    <lb/>thus addressed him:</p>

	      <lb/>ceeds more from pride, than affection: would

	      <lb/>my mind abhors the deed? No, no! I
	      <lb/>never will deceive the sex; for as soon as I

	    <lb/>when reason assumes her empire, then re­

	    <lb/>and damps the genial current of the soul.</p>
              <p>I promised to my readers, that I would un­
	    <lb/>fold to them many letters I had in my posses­
	    <lb/>sion from <placeName>Zanesville</placeName>, <placeName>Ohio</placeName>, with a humorous
	    <lb/>account of some ancient families, whose yea
	    <lb/>was yea, and nay, nay, and who formerly flour­
	    <lb/>ished in this great city of <placeName>New-York</placeName>, which
	    <lb/>was then called <placeName>New-Amsterdam</placeName>.</p>
              <p>The writer, a young lady, has very ingeni­
	    <lb/>ously sought out the truth as near as possible,

	    <milestone unit="sig" n="9(2)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">100</mw>
	    <lb/>but hopes that any incorrectness will be pass­
	    <lb/>ed over, as her epistles were not intended for
	    <lb/>the press. Her friends insisted on her deli­
	    <lb/>vering her remarks as quick as possible. If
	    <lb/>not amusing to all inquisitive readers, the
	    <lb/>happy few will perhaps find entertainment,
	    <lb/>which is all that can be expected.</p>
              <p>Many read voluminous books, merely to say
	    <lb/>that they have read them, when they are neither
	    <lb/>amused nor instructed.</p>
              <p>I sincerely hope the following narrative
	    <lb/>will so far please as to engage every lady in
	    <lb/><placeName>America</placeName> to follow the example of <persName>Miss Jose­
	    <lb/>phine Clairbourn</persName>, whose descriptive powers
	    <lb/>can only be known by those who attentively
	    <lb/>peruse them. I shall now remind my read­
	    <lb/>ers of some passing events; the scenes of the
	    <lb/><placeName>Pehatconk</placeName>, that I have passed over, still re­
	    <lb/>volve in my mind.</p>
              <p><persName>Laura Ann Bevers</persName>, one of nature's rarest
	    <lb/>gifts, pleasantly passed her hours with her
	    <lb/>father while he was preparing medicines for
	    <lb/><hi rend="case(mixed)sup()">t</hi>he wretched and infirm. She was formed for
	    <pb n="1101"/><milestone unit="sig" n="9(3)r"/><mw type="pageNum">101</mw><lb/>all good purposes, and was frequently applied
	    <lb/>to for some of the secrets of her father's pro­
	    <lb/>fession. Her good nature could not refuse
	    <lb/>her inquisitive neighbours: <said>Go,</said> said she,
	    <lb/><said>and search the woods, and endeavour to
	      <lb/>discover the virtues of the plants, but never
	      <lb/>expect I will ruin my father by revealing his
	      <lb/>secrets. I will inform you all I have disco­
	      <lb/>vered, since that is my own knowledge, self-
	      <lb/>acquired, for imparting which I cannot be
	      <lb/>answerable. Apply your minds to search and
	      <lb/>seek; for without application you can never
	      <lb/>obtain knowledge.</said></p>
              <p>Many persons never know their own minds,
	    <lb/>and always inquire of some friend for advice;
	    <lb/>who, though guiltless, often lead them astray.</p>
              <p><persName>Miss Laura Ann</persName> bent her mind on infor­
	    <lb/>mation; and being of retired habits, had every
	    <lb/>opportunity of improving herself. I frequent­
	    <lb/>ly visited her when returning from <persName>Mrs. Dex­
	    <lb/>ter's</persName>, who will, in a future page, engage some
	    <lb/>attention, being aunt to <persName>Josephine</persName>, and sister

              <p>I just received a long letter from <placeName>Pough­
	    <lb/>keepsie</placeName>, from <persName>Miss Prodigal</persName>, in her neat style;
	    <lb/>every word was emphatic; it took me one
	    <lb/>hour before I could comprehend her real
	    <lb/>meaning. I find she has so far overcome
	    <lb/>prudery as to visit me. She certainly knows
	    <lb/><persName>George</persName>, my nephew, lives with me, and she
	    <lb/>also knows his attachment to her. Her com­
	    <lb/>ing in the steam-boat next week I think is a
	    <lb/>prelude to a wedding in the family. If her
	    <lb/>mind had not been made up for that event,
	    <lb/>she would not have come; and <persName>George</persName> has
	    <lb/>been so silent some time, and never mentioned
	    <lb/>he<choice><sic> r</sic><corr>r␣</corr></choice>name, I think it looks suspicious.</p>
              <p>It is woman that seduces all mankind. By
	    <lb/>her we are first taught what it is to love. I
	    <lb/>resolved to keep a secret, and not name to
	    <lb/>him when he comes to dinner the letter I have
	    <lb/>received, and see who will speak first. He
	    <lb/>certainly corresponds with her, and must
	    <lb/>have letters also.</p>
              <p>At dinner hour he came in quite silent—
	    <lb/>asked if any person had called for him.</p>

              <p><said>Male or female?</said> I asked. <said>Oh, I never
	      <lb/>have ladies call on me!—you are quite satiri­
	      <lb/>cal, aunt!</said> <persName>Doctor Narcotic</persName> dined with us;
	    <lb/>he was just describing the right and left ven­
	    <lb/>tricle of the heart—asked me if I had ever
	    <lb/>seen the heart of a human being preserved?
	    <lb/><said>God bless me, no!</said> said I. <said>That mine
	      <lb/>has often ached, is true, and yet I never had
	      <lb/>a wish to see one. Do you think, doctor,
	      <lb/>that a love-sick lady or gentleman would
	      <lb/>find any relief from seeing a wounded heart?</said>
	    <lb/><said>No, madam; but they might find relief
	      <lb/>from each other; that is, by pouring in each
	      <lb/>other's bosoms tender expressions.</said> <said>You
	      <lb/>are the first physician I ever knew that could
	      <lb/>prescribe a remedy for the heart-ache; you
	      <lb/>surpass the great Italian doctor, <persName>Orsi Cure-
	      <lb/>all</persName>, who advertised remedies for all diseases.
	      <lb/>Your fortune will now be made; as soon as
	      <lb/>the young people see you, they will give you
	      <lb/>all you ask, if you can relieve them.</said></p>
              <p>My nephew then spoke, after attending
	    <lb/>patiently: <said>I think the practice of physic a
	      <lb/>very desirable employment, and had I suffi­
	      <lb/>cient funds to support me, I would immedi­
	      <pb n="1104"/>

	      <lb/>ately commence the study; for what can
	      <lb/>afford the mind greater satisfaction than ad­
	      <lb/>ministering to the sons and daughters of afflic­
	      <lb/>tion potent medicines that will heal them?
	      <lb/>What is life without health? Only a vapour,
	      <lb/>and riches and honours are no satisfaction
	      <lb/>without it. I am very desirous to relieve the
	      <lb/>wretched; it ever gives me satisfaction;
	      <lb/>doubly so will it be when success accompa­
	      <lb/>nies my prescriptions.</said></p>
              <said>
                <p>Ah, my dear nephew, do you think that
	      <lb/>studying physic will afford you pleasure? If
	      <lb/>so, my purse is at your service. Step, then,
	      <lb/>boldly forward; study <persName>Hippocrates</persName>, <persName>Syden­
	      <lb/>ham</persName> and <persName>Cullen</persName>, and may you be as skilful as
	      <lb/>the late ever-to-be-respected venerable <persName>Bard</persName>,
	      <lb/>who was the greatest physician in the city of
	      <lb/><placeName>New-York</placeName>. Even when the former inhabit­
	      <lb/>ants would not swallow a pill, or take an
	      <lb/>emetic, he by cheering smiles made them
	      <lb/>easy and willing. He would say to them,
	      <lb/><said>arise from your beds of down, and walk,</said>
	      <lb/>(for there were none of <persName>Jackson's</persName> pure hair
	      <lb/>mattresses in those days). And then he would
	      <lb/>say to them, <said rend="post()">if I cannot pour down your

              </said>
              <p>Loud rang the bell; a message from the
	    <lb/>steam-boat. <persName>Miss Prodigal</persName>, in company with
	    <lb/>a relation, had just arrived. My nephew
	    <lb/>soon forgot his studies, and hastened to the
	    <lb/>wharf to receive them, and in a few moments
	    <lb/>we were all happy. The doctor soon left us,
	    <lb/>as he would not intrude, and his business at
	    <lb/>the hospital called his attention. <persName>Miss Emily
	    <lb/>Prodigal</persName> looked charming. The young lady,
	    <lb/>her cousin, who was with her, came to be
	    <lb/>improved in the fine arts, such as dancing,
	    <lb/>music, drawing, &amp;c.  The <title rend="pre()post()">Cataract of the
            <lb/><placeName>Ganges</placeName></title>, a new performance, was advertised
	    <lb/>for this evening's amusement, and the young
	    <lb/>ladies, not being quite prepared, and too
	    <lb/>much fatigued, did not go. To-morrow there
	    <lb/>is to be a concert for the benefit of <persName>Mr.
	    <lb/>Keane</persName>, when he is to sing a new song, called
	    <lb/>the <title rend="pre()post()">Enchanting <placeName>Pequest</placeName></title>; and as I have many
	    <lb/>cares on my mind, and many duties to fulfil,
	    <lb/>I requested the young company to excuse me.
	    <lb/>After their absence, I retired to my chamber
	    <lb/>and wrote to a number of my friends, and a

	    <mw type="pageNum">106</mw>
	    <lb/>long epistle to <persName>Mr. Dexter</persName> with kind inquiries
	    <lb/>about his daughter, whether he did intend
	    <lb/>sending her to <placeName>New-York</placeName> to improve in
	    <lb/>dancing and other accomplishments. I also
	    <lb/>wrote to all my friends in <placeName>Ohio</placeName>, acquaint­
	    <lb/>ing them with the particular occurrences that
	    <lb/>took place in our city, and sent them some
	    <lb/>new publications, such as the <title rend="pre()post()">Redgauntlet</title>,
	    <lb/>which I have had no time to peruse, and the
	    <lb/><title rend="pre()post()">Tales of a Traveller</title>, much spoken of. I
	    <lb/>could not procure <title rend="pre()post()"><persName>Lionel Lincoln</persName></title>, or the
	    <lb/><title rend="pre()post()">Leaguer of <placeName>Boston</placeName></title>, to send in time to amuse
	    <lb/>them. <persName>Carolina Sophia Dexter</persName> soon wrote
	    <lb/>a very entertaining letter after my inviting
	    <lb/>her to <placeName>New York</placeName>, with a promise shortly to
	    <lb/>see me, if her father and mother could be pre­
	    <lb/>vailed upon to let her come; they were so
	    <lb/>busily engaged at present in agricultural pur­
	    <lb/>suits, she could not be spared. Her mother
	    <lb/>was so often called on for advice in all diffi­
	    <lb/>culties of the neighbours in matrimonial cases,
	    <lb/>she could not at present think of speaking to
	    <lb/>her.</p>

	      <lb/>comfort the afflicted: my father's house is
	      <lb/>the resort of all the missionaries, and I often
	      <lb/>listen with particular attention, when they
	      <lb/>explain the scripture; for I am ashamed I do
	      <lb/>not understand what is so essential to my fu­
	      <lb/>ture happiness. Young people are apt to
	      <lb/>ridicule religion; for my part I feel comfort
	      <lb/>when I hear a good sermon, I make no boast
	      <lb/>of my profession, but invariably feel that there
	      <lb/>is a necessity for reformation, but cannot tell
	      <lb/>how to begin.</said> <persName>Carolina Sophia</persName> must I think
	    <lb/>be good company, as her mother being so
	    <lb/>well informed, would never suffer her daugh­
	    <lb/>ter to remain in ignorance; I shall now pre­
	    <lb/>pare my mind to see her. <persName>Miss Frances</persName> is at
	    <lb/>present at <placeName>Catskill</placeName>, visiting the academy,
	    <lb/>where young ladies are taught the languages.
	    <lb/>Pray, why not? We read of a <persName>Miss Schoraza</persName>
	    <lb/>in <placeName>Germany</placeName>, a very learned young lady; and
	    <lb/>if a society could be formed to encourage fe­
	    <lb/>males to acquire the languages, and allow
	    <lb/>premiums, no doubt the attempt would be
	    <lb/>successful; then, in a future day, many shin­
	    <lb/>ing females might appear to grace our halls
	    <lb/>in <placeName>America</placeName>, and snatch the laurels that are

	      <lb/>and said he was recommended to me! It is
	      <lb/>astonishing the people suppose me to be rich.
	      <lb/>I am fond of company, it is true; but many
	      <lb/>resort to my house because they think me
	      <lb/>wealthy, which gives me daily opportunities
	      <lb/>to impose on the world. My hand has been
	      <lb/>solicited very often, and my nephew would
	      <lb/>wish me to change my situation; but I never
	      <lb/>will. I live now to amuse my friends, for
	      <lb/>that affords me particular pleasure. I told
	      <lb/>him that I was sorry to inform him that de­
	      <lb/>ferred stock did not remain in my possession
	      <lb/>long, and that every leisure hour of my life
	      <lb/>is spent in endeavouring to assist others in in­
	      <lb/>creasing their stock.</said></p>
              <p><said>I beg your pardon madam,</said> said he, <said>for
	      <lb/>the intrusion.</said> <said>No offence, I assure you, sir.</said>
	    <lb/>So he marched off much disappointed and cha­
	    <lb/>grined: I know he feigned this excuse to see
	    <lb/>you. <said rend="pre()">And now, my dear girls, let me entreat

	      <lb/>not come to <placeName>New-York</placeName> to make conquests:
	      <lb/>we came to make you a social visit, without
	      <lb/>any personal motive.</said></p>
              <p>The young ladies then took a jaunt on
	    <lb/><placeName>Long-Island</placeName>, as far as <placeName>Satawket</placeName>, leaving me
	    <lb/>to my own reflections.</p>
              <p>I was called on by a gentleman of my ac­
	    <lb/>quaintance, who asked my opinion, what in­
	    <lb/>duced so many foreigners to come to our
	    <lb/>shores. I told him I once met in company a
	    <lb/><name>Yankee</name>, of the name of <persName>Jonathan Slyfox</persName>; he
	    <lb/>remarked, in his peculiar manner of speaking,
	    <lb/><said>I guess as how the folks in foreign parts
	      <lb/><mcr>thinks</mcr> how we cannot see farther than our
	      <lb/>nose, and <mcr>law for me</mcr>, that is the reason they
	      <lb/>came to <mcr>larn</mcr> to <mcr>catch weasels asleep</mcr>, but they
	      <lb/>had better keep a good look out for breakers,
	      <lb/>for we can catch rogues napping.</said></p>
              <p>This was a Yankee captain from <placeName>Ston­
	    <lb/>ington</placeName>, who brought wooden ware and pas­
	    <lb/>sengers to the city. He was civil to a high
	    <lb/>degree. His female passengers, were not

	    <lb/>very stupid or lazy. Among the passengers
	    <lb/>were two ladies of distinction, who had been
	    <lb/>living at <placeName>Satawket</placeName>, and were so well bred
	    <lb/>that they could not help themselves to a glass
	    <lb/>of water, or any earthly thing.</p>
              <p>The captain said to the ladies, <said>what will
	      <lb/>you do when you arrive in <placeName>New-York</placeName>? ser­
	      <lb/>vants are so impertinent, that the best people
	      <lb/>wait on themselves; and they now appear
	      <lb/>in handsome dresses and parade through all
	      <lb/>the little narrow streets.</said></p>
              <p>These ladies were originally from <placeName>St.
	    <lb/>Lucia</placeName>, and were accustomed to much atten­
	    <lb/>dance. They seemed petrified when the
	    <lb/>captain told them that in <placeName>New-York</placeName>, the ser­
	    <lb/>vants all try to outshine their mistresses. <said>I
	      <lb/>suppose,</said> said one of them, <said>we must sub­

		    <lb/>day, and after that go to meeting. She has
		    <lb/>more home-made cloths than all the women in
		    <lb/>her neighbourhood. She is rather masculine,
		    <lb/>and prides herself on her industry. The nup­
		    <lb/>tials were conducted in a splendid manner.
		    <lb/>After the ceremony was performed they at­

		    <lb/>endive and thyme.</p>
                      <p><persName>Deacon Rusty</persName> was a very hospitable man;

		    <lb/>and kept the best house in the valley; and
		    <lb/>when mounted on his favourite Eclipse, he
		    <lb/>thought himself as great as <persName>Lord Wellington</persName>.
		    <lb/>At his <mcr>house warming</mcr> all his friends paid him
		    <lb/>a visit, to welcome <persName>Mrs. Rusty</persName>. A sumptu­
		    <lb/>ous dinner was prepared, which consisted of
		    <lb/>the following dainties: At the head of the
		    <lb/>table a large pot-pie, with short crust; oppo­
		    <lb/>site a fine ham with sausages; then pumpkin
		    <lb/>pies, rice puddings, and a variety of vegeta­
		    <lb/>bles, custards, and nicknacks.</p>
                      <p>The hilarity of the company was evident,
		    <lb/>which gave great satisfaction to the lovers.
		    <lb/>The ceremony of the nuptials, and the enter­
		    <lb/>tainment being over, all parties retired to their
		    <lb/>respective homes, and the happy pair entered
		    <lb/>on the several duties each had to fulfil. The
		    <lb/>new painting of the house, which was a
		    <lb/>smoky brown, was the first occurrence that
		    <lb/>took place. The deacon thought that a yel­

		    <lb/>any other colour, and keep the crows from
		    <lb/>alighting on the top of the house. <persName>Mrs. Rusty</persName>
		    <lb/>agreed with him in opinion, though she ob­
		    <lb/>served that her father's house was never
		    <lb/>finished; it was the custom to frame large
		    <lb/>buildings, which emptied their coffers, so that
		    <lb/>they could never finish the inside, and they
		    <lb/>continued so from generation to generation.
		    <lb/>As to painting, that was totally out of use,
		    <lb/>only the meeting-house steeple, which was
		    <lb/>always very high, with a gilded weathercock,
		    <lb/>and was painted handsomely.</p>
                      <p>The next consultation was, who should
		    <lb/>choose a handsome picture to ornament the
		    <lb/>best room. <persName>Mrs. Rusty</persName> quickly replied, as
		    <lb/>the fine arts ought to be encouraged in this
		    <lb/>rich country, she would propose that the dea­
		    <lb/>con should sit for his venerable likeness, and
		    <lb/>engage <persName>Mr. Browere</persName> to take it. He was
		    <lb/>averse to her proposal, and replied, <said>I should
		      <lb/>be better pleased to have <persName>General Jackson</persName>,
		      <lb/>the <name>Hero of <placeName>New-Orleans</placeName></name>, in my best

	      <lb/>It is a folly to spend so much time in nonsense,
	      <lb/>for my corn is suffering for the want of hoe­
	      <lb/>ing, and my spouse is never pleased when I

	      <lb/>pot of beer she finds fault; and I think it is al­
	      <lb/>ways best to please the women—then all is
	      <lb/>well. My father always gave me that lesson.
	      <lb/>To be sure, <persName>Sorche Polhemus</persName>, that is my

	      <lb/>She never speaks before she thinks, never

	      <lb/>but only when the old gray goose has plenty
	      <lb/>of goslings: so I think we are a very happy

              <p><persName>Claus Van Leven</persName> was the best farmer at

	    <lb/>rior to that of her neighbours. Her mind
	    <lb/>was always bent on having a scholar, and no

	    <lb/>feelings for the sex as she thought she was
	    <lb/>entitled to: she was fond of dress. Her fine
	    <lb/>flaxen hair was enriched with a wreath of
	    <lb/>jessamine, and in her lovely bosom she
	    <lb/>always placed some fragrant flowers, such as
	    <lb/>the snowdrop, the polyanthus, the daisy, or
	    <lb/>whatever was in season.</p>
              <p>She seemed formed to please: her light

              <p>Next in order was <persName>Derick Hovencamp</persName>, a
	    <lb/>superannuated old gentleman, whose dress
	    <lb/>was indicative of his mind. The colour of his
	    <lb/>coat was like that the kings of old wore, royal
	    <lb/>purple, but no gold on them, nor very fine
	    <lb/>linen under them; his hat was of the shape
	    <lb/>of <persName>Oliver Cromwell's</persName>; a very long waistcoat
	    <lb/>of black tabby, and square toed shoes. He
	    <lb/>smoked tobacco, which, to keep it moist, he
	    <lb/>put in a pouch made out of the bladder of a
	    <lb/>large hog, of the Holland breed, imported into

	      <lb/>to encourage our neighbour to lead a virtuous
	      <lb/>life, and recommend to those who have con­

	      <lb/>following manner: The first, to glorify the
	      <lb/>Supreme Being; the second, commendable
	      <lb/>industry, to enable us to acquire a competen­
	      <lb/>cy to live above contempt, and to enable us
	      <lb/>to smooth the rugged paths of others; thirdly,
	      <lb/>to exert ourselves to gain wisdom, to assist in
	      <lb/>the government of the country. Shun all
	      <lb/>public meetings under any pretence whatever,
	      <lb/>that invites man to remove his neighbour's
	      <lb/>land-mark; for look into the human heart,
	      <lb/>and there you will find that self predominates.
	      <lb/>Envy, pride and self-conceit flow in our bo­

	      <lb/>meek, mild and unoffending persons, our ex­
	      <lb/>ulting hearts burst in invectives against them.

	      <lb/>tary and alone, his feeble partner is gathering
	      <lb/>some little fragments to prepare a morself to
	      <lb/>alleviate his keen appetite.</said> It is by the light
	    <lb/>of that splendid orb, that the tender partner
	    <lb/>of many a weary traveller is enabled to pick
	    <lb/>the outer bark of an aged oak that has stood
	    <lb/>the shock of perhaps a hundred equinoctial
	    <lb/>gales, which, and the barking and fawning of

	    <lb/>For, believe me, you will seldom see a man
	    <lb/>of great endowments, and easy circumstances,

              <p>I must again remind my readers, that
	    <lb/><persName>Theodore Dorcy</persName>, formerly a druggist in the
	    <lb/>city, whose shop at evening made a brilliant
	    <lb/>appearance at the corner of the <placeName>Old Coenties
	    <lb/>Slip</placeName> in this city; where it was lighted with
	    <lb/>gas, and the coloured waters in the glass ap­
	    <lb/>peared very valuable to the owner. The
	    <lb/>profits being not sufficient, though the pestle
	    <lb/>and mortar was in continual use.</p>
              <p>He determined to remove to the country
	    <lb/>and prepare wild plants, as he knew their
	    <lb/>virtues. Previous to his departure, he hav­
	    <lb/>ing consulted a friend the most proper
	    <lb/>place to remove to, he advised him to settle
	    <lb/>near the <placeName>Maskenekonk</placeName>, <placeName>Sussex County</placeName>, <placeName>New-
	    <lb/>Jersey</placeName>. He had in view a place that would
	    <lb/>suit him, with a little alteration, and he im­
	    <lb/>mediately moved, as it was then quarter day,
	    <lb/>so there would be exact six months for a new
	    <lb/>tenant. At his entering his new house, it
	    <lb/>was necessary to have some alterations; he
	    <lb/>sent for <persName>Builder Booby</persName>, their neighbour, who
	    <lb/>advised to take down the gable end, and at

	    <lb/>leave to mention that they were very regular
	    <lb/>in their hours of working in the country; all
	    <lb/>was sure to let the hammer fall when the
	    <lb/>clock was striking twelve.</p>
              <p><persName>Theodore Dorcy</persName> said to <persName>Builder Booby</persName>,

	    <lb/>Noble</persName>, whose dress was very singular, as he
	    <lb/>frequently amused himself for hours at the
	    <lb/>glass, to gratify himself, and render his per­
	    <lb/>son agreeable. It is unnecessary to mention
	    <lb/>the colour of his coat; that not being mate­
	    <lb/>rial to form a beau. The waistcoat and hat
	    <lb/>are powerful look-ats.</p>
              <p>His waistcoat was handsomely embroider­
	    <lb/>ed by his sister, who got the premium for it,
	    <lb/>at the last fair at the arsenal near <placeName>New-York</placeName>.
	    <lb/>It being a new unthought of material, entire­
	    <lb/>ly American manufacture; no less than the
	    <lb/>hairs out of the old family horse's long tail,
	    <lb/>of a beautiful sorrel colour, extracted by the
	    <lb/>young lady's own hands.</p>
              <p><persName>Constantine Noble</persName> was born in <placeName>Acomack</placeName>,
	    <lb/><placeName>Virginia</placeName>, and had been in all the academies in
	    <lb/>that state; his father being so engaged in rais­
	    <lb/>ing fine horses, he had not time to superin­
	    <lb/>tend his children; that task devolved on his
	    <lb/>wife, and she likewise had other domestic
	    <lb/>pursuits. So they all had their wills and
	    <lb/>whims, and were governed by them; and
	    <lb/>it is too true,

              <p>The doctor's father was a very hospitable

	    <lb/>pose I have in view will be accomplished—
	    <lb/>Nothing that is intended for instruction ought
	    <lb/>to be ridiculed; for every human being has
	    <lb/>some good ideas, and some good traits in his

              <p>My nephew's life, and the character of his
	    <lb/>family, which is at present unknown to him­
	    <lb/>self, will in a future page, as soon as my

	    <lb/>passing events; and one of which is the story
	    <lb/>of <persName>Baron Tilas</persName>, and his adventures and sin­
	    <lb/>gular method to obtain a wife; the many dif­
	    <lb/>ficulties he surmounted, and his being at last
	    <lb/>happy in the enjoyment of one of Heaven's
	    <lb/>best gifts. But previous to giving the histo­
	    <lb/>ry of his life, I will give an account of an ex­
	    <lb/>cursion to <placeName>Haverstraw</placeName>:</p>
              <p><persName>Joel Fairfax</persName> was born in <placeName>Haverstraw</placeName>, and
	    <lb/>was son of a collier, who had by his blowing
	    <pb n="1139"/>

	    <mw type="pageNum">139</mw>
	    <lb/>rocks, splitting wood, and squatting on other
	    <lb/>people's lands, made himself quite respecta­
	    <lb/>ble; so much as to be chosen Parish Clerk
	    <lb/>and kept all the country in tune; so that
	    <lb/>Old Hundred was sweetly revived, and the
	    <lb/>spirit of religion and piety prevailed.</p>
              <p><persName>Mrs. Patience Foster</persName>, a leading musical
	    <lb/>character, struck his attention, by her melo­
	    <lb/>dious voice. She was a gay widow of a
	    <lb/>late member of assembly, who expired very
	    <lb/>suddenly at <placeName>Albany</placeName>, defending the question
	    <lb/>respecting the <orgName>Chemical Bank</orgName>, which has
	    <lb/>lately excited much commotion, and inflamed
	    <lb/>the minds of many distinguished characters.</p>
              <p>One day as the widow was extending her
	    <lb/>voice to the last note, he stopped them all in
	    <lb/>the middle of the tune, and cried out <said>that is
	      <lb/>uncommon metre!</said>—perhaps to draw the at­
	    <lb/>tention of the ladies was his motive. He
	    <lb/>then began beating time with his broad flat
	    <lb/>hand in the following manner: Fa, mi, fa, sol.
	    <lb/>The females paid great attention and were
	    <lb/>in raptures; their tinkling pipes struck up,
	    <lg type="poem" subtype="indeterminate"><l>Who is ashamed to sing to-day,</l><l>Not one cent we claim for pay;</l><pb n="1140"/><milestone unit="sig" n="12(4)v"/><mw type="pageNum">140</mw><l>While <name>Europeans</name> guineas win,</l><l>If they just attempt to sing.</l><l>Thither, thither we'll away—</l><l>All are made of the same clay.</l></lg></p>
              <p>After meeting, <persName>Joel</persName> overtook some of the
	    <lb/>lovely lasses, and having singled out the best
	    <lb/>performer, he waited on her home. On en­
	    <lb/>tering the house, she immediately took off
	    <lb/>her best clothes, tucked up those that she
	    <lb/>thought would be injured by cooking; and
	    <lb/>then she was quite at home. <persName>Joel</persName> sat still,
	    <lb/>like Patience on a monument smiling—not at
	    <lb/>grief—but, at the hopes of a good dinner. The
	    <lb/>pot roared, the family appeared quite reserved,
	    <lb/>and <persName>Joel</persName> was not asked to dinner; but it was
	    <lb/>not for the want of hospitality that they did
	    <lb/>not invite him—it was pride, for they were
	    <lb/>ashamed of their hodge-podge; so he at last
	    <lb/>rose to leave them.  <said>What's the hurry
	      <lb/>neighbour?</said>—and when they saw that he
	    <lb/>was going away they began to be very soli­
	    <lb/>citous. <said>They will,</said> he replied, <said>be wait­
	      <lb/>ing dinner for me at home, just as you are
	      <lb/>now waiting,</said> and left them, much chagrined.
	    <lb/>The next week <persName>Joel</persName> called again; when they
	    <lb/>were better prepared and more friendly. After

	    <lb/>several interviews he found he was not disa­
	    <lb/>greeable. In the course of a few weeks <persName>Mrs.
	    <lb/>Dorcus Green</persName> made herself very agreeable;
	    <lb/>and the good clerk, after modulating his
	    <lb/>voice, began one evening to touch the strings
	    <lb/>of her heart, to find if they would accord
	    <lb/>with his own, as all grating sounds were very
	    <lb/>offensive to him, he having so good an ear for
	    <lb/>music. He requested her to soften her voice,
	    <lb/>so as to soothe him, and vibrate with his own
	    <lb/>pipes. After an absence of some days he
	    <lb/>met her in the sloop <name>Gay Delight</name>, going to
	    <lb/><placeName>New-York</placeName> with brooms and wooden ware,
	    <lb/>when he softly approached her, and spoke in
	    <lb/>the following manner:</p>
              <p>
                <said>Could you be content, fair <persName>Dorcus</persName>, in this
	      <lb/>gay city, now first in the union? Could
	      <lb/>you, I again repeat it, with your lover at your
	      <lb/>side, partake of all the inviting pleasures that
	      <lb/>appear to you?—bless by your smiles the man
	      <lb/>that adores you, and freely accept his offered
	      <lb/>hand?</said>
              </p>
              <p>She hesitated, and then spoke in a low
	    <lb/>voice:</p>

              <p>
                <said>Sir, the happiness you promise me by
	      <lb/>the offer of your hand and heart seems to sur­
	      <lb/>prise me, as I feel fully sensible I merit not
	      <lb/>such an offer. I fear I cannot conduct my­
	      <lb/>self in the manner entirely to please you.
	      <lb/>Having always been governed by my own
	      <lb/>will, I cannot say how I will submit to the
	      <lb/>direction of another; but if you will risk the
	      <lb/>instability of my temper, and prepare your­
	      <lb/>self for the whims and caprices that actuate
	      <lb/>me in common with so many females of the
	      <lb/>present day, I will endeavour to make you
	      <lb/>happy. I will rise at early morn and cheer
	      <lb/>your roving fancy with some pleasing themes;
	      <lb/>relate the pleasant hours of my past life, and
	      <lb/>repeat the many observations I have made on
	      <lb/>the characters of others; and at the sitting
	      <lb/>sun, I will, in dulcet strains, lull you to re­
	      <lb/>pose; and when again I ope my eyes, I will
	      <lb/>reveal what in fancy's dreams delight me,
	      <lb/>and you shall listen to the fairy tales.</said>
              </p>
              <p>He agreed to all her wishes, and they were
	    <lb/>cheerfully united, never to be separated until
	    <lb/>death close the scene.</p>

              <p>The happy pair retired to the mountain,
	    <lb/>being preferrable to them. <persName>Joel</persName>, in a reverie,
	    <lb/>exclaimed, <said>there are now many links added
	      <lb/>to the chain of our union; if we but keep
	      <lb/>them bright, and not suffer, by our supine­
	      <lb/>ness, the smallest link to rust, then let the

	      <lb/><name>Jew</name>, see the pleasure the American people
	      <lb/>take in brightening the union, and benefiting
	      <lb/>each other.</said></p>
              <p>In the midst of his soliloquy the rain in tor­
	    <lb/>rents began to pour; his cares of life seemed
	    <lb/>then to vanish; the roof of the cottage he re­
	    <lb/>sided in, after the deluge, showed its mossy
	    <lb/>covering. In their garden the lilies raised
	    <lb/>their drooping heads, and appeared to erect
	    <lb/>themselves; the sun-flower at this season ap­
	    <lb/>peared in majesty and grandeur; the daisy
	    <lb/>seemed not to escape their notice; the ivy
	    <lb/>clung to their cottage, and the snow-drop was
	    <lb/>their admiration.</p>

              <p>A friend of <persName>Joel Fairfax's</persName>, from <placeName>Haver­

	    <lb/>and yet seemed to do nothing but parading
	    <lb/>the streets; some with spectacles on their

	    <lb/>introduced to a variety of ladies at a tea party

	    <lb/><said>How shall I be happy?</said> he exclaimed;
	    <lb/><said rend="bestow((pre(“)post(”))(said))post()">the wish of my heart is to be united

              <p>I shall now relate a scene near the beauti­
	    <lb/>ful <placeName>Pequest</placeName>, the most rural spot I have ob­

	    <lb/>her banners and invites all distressed persons
	    <lb/>from other climes to enjoy our tranquillity.</p>
              <p>On crossing the <placeName>Delaware</placeName> I perceived a

	    <lb/>until I observed a handsome youth much de­

	    <milestone unit="sig" n="13(4)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">152</mw>
	    <lb/><said>Ah!</said> replied a venerable old gentleman,
	    <lb/><said>that youth has robbed me of all my earthly
	      <lb/>comforts: he has sought to obtain the affec­
	      <lb/>tion of my dear daughter, and by stratagem
	      <lb/>gained, and now he is in custody: for
	      <lb/>when a female is dishonoured, all the French
	      <lb/>assignats, Spanish rials, and English gui­
	      <lb/>neas, cannot make any compensation: the fa­
	      <lb/>tal deed is irrevocable; and nothing can be
	      <lb/>done, but sigh, and exclaim, ah sad am I!</said></p>
              <p>I endeavoured to comfort the old gentleman.
	    <lb/>He would not hear me, and in the bitterness
	    <lb/>of his heart, he uttered these words: <said>Frail
	      <lb/>youth, may gnats take hold of and torment
	      <lb/>you, and mosquitoes buz round your nightly
	      <lb/>pillow, and caterpillars crawl in your bosom,
	      <lb/>until you repent, and fall on your knees to

	      <lb/>pardon, and seal by a pledge, with a promise
	      <lb/>never to part from her, and to crown her lat­
	      <lb/>ter years, if she should live, and this be for­
	      <lb/>gotten,— with love, respect and good treatment,
	      <lb/>and so render life agreeable.</said></p>
              <p>The youth advanced in humble submission,

	    <milestone unit="sig" n="13(5)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">153</mw>
	    <lb/>prostrated himself to <persName>Ophelia</persName>, and said, <said>Oh,
	      <lb/>injured, beloved woman! what have I not
	      <lb/>suffered since last I saw you? Remorse,
	      <lb/>shame, dishonour, all rush on my feelings
	      <lb/>and harass my soul. Worlds would I re­
	      <lb/>sign to merit your forgiv<choice><sic/><corr>e</corr></choice>ness. Oh, do not be
	      <lb/>so obdurate, but soften my decree by a speedy
	      <lb/>answer. I will defend your person, and your
	      <lb/>honour that I have sullied, with my life. I
	      <lb/>will, if you request it, make restitution by my
	      <lb/>death, and will take a potent anodyne that
	      <lb/>shall free the world from a monster, and be
	      <lb/>an example to all deceivers.</said></p>
              <p>In the phrenzy of his mind he declared life
	    <lb/>was a burden, and insisted she would either
	    <lb/>forgive or aid him to leave it.</p>
              <p>After mature reflection she raised his free­
	    <lb/>ble voice, and emphatically expressed these
	    <lb/>words: <said>Rise, lordly man—rise from the
	      <lb/>fallen state in which, from the beginning of
	      <lb/>the world, you have been by the allure­
	      <lb/>ments of female beauty—rise, and by firmly

                    <p>I crossed over in the teamboat to <placeName>Hoboken</placeName>,
		    <lb/>and from thence to <placeName>Weehawk</placeName>, a distance of
		    <lb/>about five miles. I then entered the habita­
		    <lb/>tion of <persName>colonel Fitzroy</persName>, a fine hospitable man
		    <lb/>surrounded by his lovely family, living in
		    <lb/>dignified retirement: his daughters were ri­
		    <lb/>ding for their health, on horseback, accompa­
		    <lb/>nied by an adventurer.</p>
                    <p>To describe the figure and dress of <persName>baron
		    <lb/>Tilas</persName> would require some skill. In his man­
		    <lb/>ners he was frank and social, in his dress
		    <lb/>neat and genteel, but rather expensive for a
		    <lb/>man of small fortune; his conversation was a
		    <lb/>mixed jargon of <name>French</name> and <name>German</name>, and in
		    <lb/>order to be understood, and make himself
		    <lb/>agreeable, he would converse in <name>English</name>.
		    <lb/>There was a peculiar manner in this stranger,
		    <lb/>and by a happy disposition he engaged the
		    <pb n="1155"/>

		    <mw type="pageNum">155</mw>
		    <lb/>attention of the whole family, particularly
		    <lb/><persName>Miss Eleanora</persName>, who was the first to intro­
		    <lb/>duce him to her father's family. The man­
		    <lb/>ner of their becoming acquainted was some­
		    <lb/>thing singular, of which I shall now inform
		    <lb/>you.</p>
                    <p><persName>Baron Tilas</persName>, having expended nearly all
		    <lb/>the cash he brought with him from <placeName>Germany</placeName>,
		    <lb/>in plotting and contriving plans to get a rich
		    <lb/>wife, by making expensive parties; and not
		    <lb/>having the pleasing manner that is requisite
		    <lb/>to captivate the American ladies, all his plans
		    <lb/>failed. He next purchased a ticket in the
		    <lb/>lottery, and was waiting for the result of his for­
		    <lb/>tune; but it remained in the wheel, till his
		    <lb/>patience was exhausted: every revolving sun
		    <lb/>gladdened his heart with the expectation that
		    <lb/>that would be the lucky day. At length one
		    <lb/>of his particular friends told him not to trou­
		    <lb/>ble himself so much; good luck always comes
		    <lb/>unexpectedly. A thought occurred to his
		    <lb/>mind, that he would retire into the country,
		    <lb/>to recruit his spirits; and hearing board was
		    <lb/>cheap in the <placeName>Jerseys</placeName>, he went there. It was
		    <lb/>the season when people were alarmed about

		    <lb/>the yellow fever in <placeName>New-York</placeName>; so his excur­
		    <lb/>sion carried an appearance that he was very
		    <lb/>fearful of it. As he was fishing one day near
		    <lb/>the house of <persName>colonel Fitzroy</persName>, by a beautiful
		    <lb/>brook, and his mind quite absorbed in reflec­
		    <lb/>tion to think what in a short time was to be­
		    <lb/>come of him, if his ticket should be blank.
		    <lb/>On turning his eyes quickly round, he saw
		    <lb/>passing by the brook a sweet lovely girl; he
		    <lb/>started, and approached her with this saluta­
		    <lb/>tion: <said>May I hope, Miss, that my presence
		      <lb/>in this retired spot may be no interruption to
		      <lb/>your happiness?</said> <said>Oh, not at all sir,</said> she re­
		    <lb/>plied, <said>this road is free for any of the human
		      <lb/>species, after paying the toll, which no doubt
		      <lb/>you have done, or you would not be here.
		      <lb/>Are you a stranger in this neighbourhood?</said>
		    <lb/><said>Perfectly so, Miss; I came here fearful of the
		      <lb/>prevailing epidemic, to spend a few weeks.
		      <lb/>I board in a very kind family, who took me
		      <lb/>as they said for company, since they are in­
		      <lb/>dependent people. The old gentleman is a
		      <lb/>squire, but I cannot recollect his name.</said> <said>Oh,
		      <lb/>perhaps it is <persName>squire Hageman</persName> you board with.
		      <lb/>His wife is a tall gawky woman; speaks very

		      <lb/>ever I ask for, is at my service, and I agreed
		      <lb/>to pay two dollars a week, but it must be in
		      <lb/>silver; for she says she will never take paper
		      <lb/>money again, as her father, in the revolution­
		      <lb/>ary war, lost all his estate by taking conti­
		      <lb/>nental money, which so depreciated at last
		      <lb/>that it was one hundred dollars for one, and
		      <lb/>the <orgName>congress</orgName> never made it good. But they
		      <lb/>have allowed pensions to all the old revolu­
		      <lb/>tionary soldiers.</said> <said>My father,</said> said <persName>Mrs.
		    <lb/>Hageman</persName>, <said>always did duty in the militia,
		      <lb/>and his military coat and sash are in the
		      <lb/>family to this day, and hung up in my best
		      <lb/>room. My husband the squire often argues
		      <lb/>with me, and says, he thinks he was disaffect­
		      <lb/>ed, though he was in the militia; but how
		      <lb/>could he be disaffected? for when <persName>Burgoyne</persName>
		      <lb/>was taken by <persName>Gates</persName>, he seemed much pleas­
		      <lb/>ed; but when <persName>Andre</persName>, the spy, was taken he
		      <lb/>looked grave, and all the country feelingly
		      <lb/>expressed their sorrow at his sad fate. It
		      <lb/>happened just at the time that I was confined
		      <lb/>with my first son, <persName>Jehoikam</persName>, who is now no
		      <lb/>more; he was the finest youth in <placeName>Weehawk</placeName>.

		      <lb/>I have only one child left, and that, I am sor­

		    <lb/>scripture, the destruction of <placeName>Ninevah</placeName>, that
		    <lb/>great city, where scarcely a righteous man

		    <lb/>Fulham</persName> was much pleased with our rural
		    <lb/>situation. We took a pleasant excursion to
		    <lb/>the <placeName>English Neighbourhood</placeName> with my daugh­
		    <lb/>ter <persName>Eleanora</persName>. The Baron thought the people
		    <lb/>in this place resemble those where he was
		    <lb/>born, and formed the resolution that he would
		    <lb/>settle in that place, provided his ticket was a
		    <lb/>prize; if a blank, he would, as he had a good
		    <lb/>education, teach the languages, that being
		    <lb/>lucrative in the present day. <persName>Colonel Fitz­
		    <lb/>roy</persName> did not accompany his lady and daughter
		    <lb/>in their excursion with the Baron; the di­
		    <lb/>vine had some family cares on his mind;
		    <lb/>besides, their carriage could not conveni­
		    <lb/>ently accommodate more than four persons.
		    <lb/>The driver appeared in style, as they had two
		    <lb/>handsome poneys of a dark chestnut colour;
		    <lb/>the carriage was Prussian blue, which the
		    <lb/><name>Germans</name> are fond of. The doctor sung the

                    <p><persName>Miss Eleanora</persName> was much pleased with the

		    <lb/>composed by <persName>M‘Dicks</persName>, the great musician.
		    <lb/>The baron and the priest had never heard it;
		    <lb/>the words, they allowed, were sublime; and
		    <lb/><persName>Miss Fitzroy</persName>, unlike ladies in general, pro­

		    <lb/>On his return he glided through all the back

		    <lb/>and long sided, long visaged trading folks
		    <lb/>from the eastern states, with rolls of leather
		    <lb/>under their arms instead of parchment. The

                    <p>Thence arises all that necessity of argu­

                    <p><persName>Baron Tilas</persName> quickly applied at the lucky
		    <lb/>lottery office opposite the <name>City hotel</name> to know

		    <lb/>he replied, <said>I have none, current or uncur­

		    <lb/>of the number, and cheerfully informed him
		    <lb/>his ticket was a prize of one thousand dollars.
		    <lb/>He was frantic with joy. <said>How unworthy
		      <lb/>am I,</said> exclaimed he, <said>of such good fortune!
		      <lb/>I left my father poor and miserable, when
		      <lb/>I had health and strength to support him,
		      <lb/>industriously engaged in painting toys—a
		      <lb/>very unprofitable business, which scarcely
		      <lb/>afforded him an existence. My mother,
		      <lb/>always tacit, scarcely uttered a word at my
		      <lb/>departure, but looked at my face till my heart
		      <lb/>was like to break. All these scenes presented
		      <lb/>to my mind a gloomy hope of happiness with
		      <lb/>this addition to my fortune.</said></p>
                    <p>O wealth, thou soother of almost all the ills
		    <lb/>of life! the want of thee makes the tottering
		    <lb/>limbs of age more feeble, and fills the large
		    <lb/>edifices of our populous cities with inmates,
		    <lb/>who weep fountains of unavailing tears, un­
		    <lb/>heard by the rich and great, who are sporting
		    <lb/>and basking in luxury. They never think
		    <lb/>what the hand of time will effect.</p>
                    <p>It was now approaching spring; the fea­

		    <lb/>bright Sol approached with his warm beams.
		    <lb/>The impatient Baron hastened to the <placeName>English
		    <lb/>Neighbourhood</placeName>, with heart elate, to purchase
		    <lb/>a neat cottage, and by industry to cultivate a
		    <lb/>small spot of ground, by raising two crops in
		    <lb/>one year.</p>
                    <p><persName>Arnoldus Van Berkle</persName> had a small farm to
		    <lb/>dispose of; his price was three hundred
		    <lb/>pounds—half cash, half bond and mortgage,
		    <lb/>five per cent. interest, payable half yearly.
		    <lb/>Many interviews took place before the bar­
		    <lb/>gain was made, as he had to consult <persName>Anarau­
		    <lb/>tia</persName>, his wife, and also please all the rest of
		    <lb/>her relations, among whom was his faithful
		    <lb/>slave, <persName>Cuffy</persName>, who always advised his master
		    <lb/>in important affairs. <persName>Cuffy</persName> was totally averse
		    <lb/>to his disposing of any of his landed estate—
		    <lb/>it was better to keep it, as perhaps at a future
		    <lb/>day it might be purchased at a great price of
		    <lb/>a new potter's field. <said>No, no, <persName>Cuffy</persName>,</said> said
		    <lb/><persName>Van Berkle</persName>, <said>if I can persuade my wife to
		      <lb/>sign off her right of dower, I must and will
		      <lb/>sell it. At the last election for president I
		      <lb/>wanted to appear great, so I made some bets
		      <pb n="1166"/>
		      <milestone unit="sig" n="14(5)v"/>
		      <mw type="pageNum">166</mw>
		      <lb/>that <persName>Clinton</persName> would be president; but I
		      <lb/>hear the great <persName>Adams</persName> is elected, which is
		      <lb/>equally pleasing to me, for now the eastern
		      <lb/>people are all united. However, I must pay
		      <lb/>my bet.</said></p>
                    <p>In the height of the conversation between
		    <lb/><persName>Arnoldus</persName> and <persName>Cuffy</persName>, his wife, <persName>Anarautia</persName>,
		    <lb/>entered the caumer, as the best bedroom is
		    <lb/>always called by the <name>Dutch</name>—meaning the
		    <lb/>spare room. She turned up her meek blue
		    <lb/>eyes, took off her spectacles, and inquired of
		    <lb/>him, <said>What is your will, my husband?</said>
		    <lb/><said>My will is, and you have promised to obey,
		      <lb/>that you will sign off your right of dower of
		      <lb/>my little farm over the bridge, as I can get a
		      <lb/>good price for it; the fences are old, the barn
		      <lb/>must be repaired, the hog-sty is too small,
		      <lb/>and the orchard is all summer pippins—they
		      <lb/>will not keep, unless I get the great Prince to
		      <lb/>inoculate them.</said> <said>Oh, forever!</said> she ex­
		    <lb/>claimed; <said>what! sell the place my father left
		      <lb/>me? you will never have any luck; it is true
		      <lb/>we have been married seven years, and had
		      <lb/>no children; there is no knowing since the

		      <mw type="pageNum">167</mw>
		      <lb/>changes it will make in men and laws.
		      <lb/>However, if I must, I must; I only require
		      <lb/>what great people in general want, a set of
		      <lb/>silver with the initials of my own name, to be
		      <lb/>handed down to my collateral posterity.</said></p>
                    <p>Matters being thus arranged, the bargain
		    <lb/>was concluded, and the silver admitted.
		    <lb/><persName>Counsellor Drawback</persName> wrote the deed, and
		    <lb/>other necessary papers, when <persName>Baron Tilas</persName>
		    <lb/>took possession, having enough left to begin
		    <lb/>farming. After lighting fire, he looked round,
		    <lb/>and found himself alone; he began to reflect
		    <lb/>that it was not good, and like our first parent,
		    <lb/>he fell asleep; but he found when he awoke,
		    <lb/>no rib he had lost, nor no woman had he
		    <lb/>found; he immediately determined in his
		    <lb/>mind, let the consequences be as they would;
		    <lb/>and as the stage passed the door of his new
		    <lb/>residence every day, he would take a seat.
		    <lb/>He was agreeably surprised at meeting his
		    <lb/>friend, the <persName>Rev. M. Fulham</persName>. He informed
		    <lb/>him of the purchase he had made, and his
		    <lb/>intention of now visiting the <name>Fitzroy</name> family.
		    <lb/>There were a variety of characters in the
		    <lb/>stage, particularly the rich respectable taylor
		    <pb n="1168"/>

		    <lb/>and his family that made such a noise, and
		    <lb/>excited so much inquisitiveness, at the Greek
		    <lb/>ball, whom I have heretofore mentioned; he
		    <lb/>had taken a flight into the country to forget
		    <lb/>the disagreeable sensation that disturb their
		    <lb/>mind at being so particularized. <persName>Mrs. Snip</persName>
		    <lb/>was a little graceful person, flippant in speech
		    <lb/>and romantic in dress, being the daughter of
		    <lb/>a pawnbroker, a class of persons generally
		    <lb/>admitted in large cities.</p>
                    <p>The stage driver was a humourous classi­
		    <lb/>cal scholar, who had just taken that employ­
		    <lb/>ment to relax his mind from hard study in
		    <lb/>one of the public schools in the city, where
		    <lb/>he was usher. He was so fond of letting the
		    <lb/>passengers know that he was a learned man
		    <lb/>he could hardly restrain himself. He would
		    <lb/>say to the horses <foreign xml:lang="la">magna fui</foreign>: the people look­
		    <lb/>ed round in consternation, and thought he
		    <lb/>was deranged; then he would cry out <distinct>que,
		     <lb/>que</distinct>, instead of <mcr>whoa, whoa</mcr>, which excited
		    <lb/>much laughter. Among the passengers, was an
		    <lb/>English girl lately from <placeName>Salsbury</placeName>, with broad
		    <lb/>shoulders and hollow stomach, full of health
		    <lb/>and spirits. She remarked on passing through
		    <pb n="1169"/>
		    <milestone unit="sig" n="15(1)r"/>
		    <mw type="pageNum">169</mw>
		    <lb/>the country, in the <placeName>English neighbourhood</placeName>,
		    <lb/>that they had a little appearance of the villa­
		    <lb/>ges near <placeName>London</placeName>, where decency and neat­
		    <lb/>ness prevailed. She said she thought <placeName>America</placeName>
		    <lb/>a fine country, though the <distinct>ouses</distinct> were not so
		    <lb/><distinct>andsome</distinct> as at <distinct>ome</distinct>; she, for her part, must
		    <lb/>say, that since she came here she had plenty
		    <lb/>of work, and should never again darken her
		    <lb/>parent's doors, as she could live without
		    <lb/>them.</p>
                    <p>The <persName>Rev. Mr. Fulham</persName>, observed, he who
		    <lb/>hated his father or his mother, as is expressed
		    <lb/>in holy writ, the ravens should pluck out his
		    <lb/>eyes and the young eagles eat them. After that
		    <lb/>speech a profound silence prevailed; then the
		    <lb/>turnpike gate flew open and the driver payed
		    <lb/>the toll. There is a certain highwayman
		    <lb/>look in all these turnpike men, when they
		    <lb/>demand money of you, that is terrifying, and
		    <lb/>contrary to my ideas of a free country; for
		    <lb/>why should a person be way-laid for a trifle,
		    <lb/>just to gratify a few nabobs, who choose to
		    <lb/>stop the road, and make some alterations, to
		    <lb/>bank up a little money? For this, every

		    <lb/>be detained, which is shameful. In this free

		    <lb/>Many an unhappy parent cannot, in the hour

		    <lb/>es. Let us then recommend the people at
		    <lb/>large to lay waste these annoyances, which
		    <lb/>distress the weary traveller.</p>
                    <p>In a short time we arrived at <placeName>Weehawk</placeName>, and
		    <lb/>my friend <persName>Fulham</persName> and myself entered the lane
		    <lb/>in front of <persName>Col. Fitzroy's</persName> house to gather a
		    <lb/>little sprig to present to <persName>Miss Eleanora</persName>. On
		    <lb/>entering the hall a perfect silence reigned—
		    <lb/><persName>Mrs. Fitzroy</persName> was exceedingly ill. We met
		    <lb/><persName>Doctor Foresight</persName>, who informed us her case
		    <lb/>was rather singular (<foreign xml:lang="la">esub sultus tendenum</foreign>.)
		    <lb/><said>Not dangerous, I hope, Sir.</said> <said>By no
		      <lb/>means: a gentle cathartic, and after that a
		      <lb/>mild sudorific, will be essentially necessary;
		      <lb/>and then a copious bleeding, and kept per­
		      <lb/>fectly quiet, will, I hope, effect a cure.</said> The
		    <lb/>nurse ran hastily after the doctor as he was
		    <lb/>going, for she had not altogether understood
		    <lb/>his prescriptions, not being well read. He
		    <lb/>kindly told her what was first to be taken<supplied reason="flawed-reproduction">,</supplied>
		    <pb n="1171"/>
		    <milestone unit="sig" n="15(2)r"/>
		    <mw type="pageNum">171</mw>
		    <lb/>then charged her to mind their effects, and
		    <lb/>be particular in relating them to him at his
		    <lb/>next visit. The doctor being satisfied that
		    <lb/><persName>Nurse Doser</persName> would be attentive, absented
		    <lb/>himself, and the Parson and the Baron entered
		    <lb/>the parlour. <persName>Eleanora</persName> seemed somewhat
		    <lb/>confused; a palpitation of the heart seized
		    <lb/>her: she, however, was careful, like her sex
		    <lb/>in general, to disguise her feelings. But rest
		    <lb/>assured, my inquisitive reader, that true love,
		    <lb/>sincere esteem, heightened by a little absence,
		    <lb/>the glowing cheek, the gentle smile, and the
		    <lb/>beams in the countenance, show too true, the
		    <lb/>work is begun; and whatever methods are
		    <lb/>taken to smother the flame, it burns the
		    <lb/>brighter the more you try to subdue it. After
		    <lb/>a few compliments and inquiries the conver­
		    <lb/>sation took a turn towards the <placeName>English Neigh­
		    <lb/>bourhood</placeName>, where the Baron first felt that
		    <lb/>indescribable emotion, which he who never
		    <lb/>felt was never happy, and informed them
		    <lb/>that he had purchased the cottage and farm
		    <lb/>of <persName>Arnoldus Van Berkle</persName> and <persName>Anarautia</persName> his
		    <lb/>wife, and intended to reside there—had al­
		    <lb/>ready made fire and taken possession. The
		    <lb/>young ladies looked confused. Tea was an­

		    <mw type="pageNum">172</mw>
		    <lb/>nounced in the adjoining room, and the eve­
		    <lb/>ning passed off agreeably.—Nothing remark­
		    <lb/>able, except a few tender speeches, when the
		    <lb/>lover had an opportunity. At ten o'clock we
		    <lb/>left the family, hoping at their next interview
		    <lb/><persName>Mrs. Fitzroy</persName> would be better. The Parson
		    <lb/>and the Baron staid at the first inn they could
		    <lb/>meet. They were invited to stay all night at
		    <lb/><persName>Col. Fitzroy's</persName>, which they declined. After
		    <lb/>being some time at the inn his friend spoke
		    <lb/>to him in the following manner:—<said>What
		      <lb/>induced you to purchase a farm? Have you
		      <lb/>any knowledge of agriculture, or the changing
		      <lb/>seasons in this country? The manners of
		      <lb/>the people of <placeName>America</placeName> are different from
		      <lb/>those of <placeName>Carlstadt</placeName> on the <placeName>Rhine</placeName>: civility and
		      <lb/>discretion, prudence and economy, character­
		      <lb/>ize the manners of your country, while ambi­
		      <lb/>tion, pride and self-sufficiency, too much
		      <lb/>prevail in many other nations.</said> <said>My dear
		      <lb/>friend,</said> replied the Baron, <said>having formed
		      <lb/>an attachment to <persName>Miss Eleanora Fitzroy</persName>, and
		      <lb/>never having made it known to her, I beg
		      <lb/>your silence until you know the event; for I
		      <lb/>am determined to acquaint her at our next
		      <lb/>interview with my sincere and unalterable
		      <pb n="1173"/>
		      <milestone unit="sig" n="15(3)r"/>
		      <mw type="pageNum">173</mw>
		      <lb/>attachment to her. I have got some respect­
		      <lb/>able names to my character in <placeName>New-York</placeName>,
		      <lb/>and in order to make things satisfactory, and
		      <lb/>that she might expect a home, I purchased a
		      <lb/>small farm, thinking by uncommon industry
		      <lb/>I might support her. She appears one of
		      <lb/>those lovely fair ones that require but little,
		      <lb/>having been used to a retired life. It would
		      <lb/>have been far different had I placed my
		      <lb/>affections on a modern toast—to such a one
		      <lb/>nothing is thought of but riding tandem and
		      <lb/>dancing, attendance at balls, plays, &amp;c., and
		      <lb/>all kinds of expensive amusements, which is
		      <lb/>contrary to my ideas of comfort.</said> The
		    <lb/>friends now retired to rest. The day follow­
		    <lb/>ing the Doctor called on his patient, <persName>Mrs.
		    <lb/>Fitzroy</persName>, and had the satisfaction to find her
		    <lb/>much better, and had fair hopes of her speedy
		    <lb/>recovery. The <persName>Rev. Mr. Fulham</persName> and the
		    <lb/>Baron became inseparable friends. Attach­
		    <lb/>ments of this kind are frequent, when a little
		    <lb/>secrecy is expected. Men or women cannot
		    <lb/>rest when love seizes the heart, until they
		    <lb/>confide the secret to their friend.</p>

		    <lb/>Fitzroy's</persName> was <persName>Miss Laura Askin</persName>; she was
		    <lb/>from <placeName>Philimore-place</placeName>, <placeName>Islington</placeName>, near
<placeName>London</placeName>;
		    <lb/>her manners were easy and unaffected; her
		    <lb/>features regular and beautiful, and her dark
		    <lb/>and raven locks were glossy as the breast of
		    <lb/>a blackbird; true wisdom flowed from her
		    <lb/>lips, and she was the admiration of the sons
		    <lb/>of <placeName>Columbia</placeName>. The <name>Misses Fitzroys</name> were not
		    <lb/>quite so handsome, but their conversation
		    <lb/>was enlivening.</p>
                    <p>But to return to the small farm in the
		    <lb/><placeName>English neighbourhood</placeName>, which the Baron
		    <lb/>had named after a place in <placeName>Germany</placeName> near
		    <lb/><placeName>Oldenberg</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>The Baron, having now finished his cot­
		    <lb/>tage in a neat style, and whitened the fences,
		    <lb/>which is always the first thing a gentleman
		    <lb/>farmer attends to, hastened to <placeName>New-York</placeName> to
		    <lb/>inquire for letters from his parents, the receipt
		    <lb/>of which gave him great satisfaction, as they
		    <lb/>informed him that a maiden aunt had be­
		    <lb/>queathed him a handsome legacy, on condi­
		    <lb/>tion that he married within five years after
		    <lb/>her death, for she supposed that he would

		    <lb/>then take care of it. If he was not married
		    <lb/>in that time, it was to be given to a charita­
		    <lb/>ble institution, as she never wished what she
		    <lb/>left to be wasted. He hastened back from
		    <lb/><placeName>New-York</placeName> to his favourite spot, and prepared
		    <lb/>his mind for an interview with his lovely fair.
		    <lb/>At his first approach he had the pleasure to
		    <lb/>find <persName>Mrs. Fitzroy</persName> perfectly recovered from
		    <lb/>her late indisposition, and all the good family
		    <lb/>in good health and spirits. Fortunately,
		    <lb/><persName>Miss Eleanora</persName> was alone at his entrance in
		    <lb/>the parlour. He approached her with looks
		    <lb/>of cordial love, and hanging over her ena­
		    <lb/>moured, began the following pathetic story:</p>
                    <p>
                      <said>How shall I address you in language that
		      <lb/>in common conversation I am at a loss to
		      <lb/>express my meaning. On the summit of
		      <lb/>happiness or misery, I have no words in any
		      <lb/>language to express the high esteem I have
		      <lb/>for you. Had I the eloquence of an <persName>Emmet</persName>,
		      <lb/>the mind of a <persName>Brougham</persName>, or the wisdom of
		      <lb/>a <persName>Socrates</persName>, I might hope a favourable hear­
		      <lb/>ing. Mine is an uncommon attachment.—
		      <lb/>Think, then, lovely charmer, and smile on
		      <lb/>your pursuer.</said>

                    <p><said>I have, my dear sir,</said> she replied, <said>no
		      <lb/>pleasure in trifling with a sincere heart: I
		      <lb/>only want time to inquire after necessary
		      <lb/>things to make life agreeable, and to know
		      <lb/>how we are to live. My father's finances
		      <lb/>are only sufficient for immediate wants; he
		      <lb/>has nothing to spare for others.</said> <said>Rest
		      <lb/>happy, my dear <persName>Eleanora</persName>; I have purchased
		      <lb/>a comfortable abode, and a legacy having
		      <lb/>been left me by a maiden aunt, enables me
		      <lb/>to assure you I can support you in a genteel
		      <lb/>manner. What pleasure can you take in
		      <lb/>procrastinating our happiness? I have made
		      <lb/>your parents acquainted with my character
		      <lb/>and family, and they leave it to your discre­
		      <lb/>tion to make choice of a partner for life. Your
		      <lb/>own mind must be your director: all I wish
		      <lb/>is a speedy answer. I shall leave you to
		      <lb/>your own reflections; and in the course of
		      <lb/>ten days may I hope that the impression I
		      <lb/>have made on your mind will be favourable,
		      <lb/>and that with welcome looks and kind recep­
		      <lb/>tion I may be allowed to salute you and call
		      <lb/>you mine for ever? Then will I triumphantly
		      <lb/>bless my better stars, fall at your feet, and, as
		      <lb/>a humble suppliant, hope for forgiveness if I
		      <lb/>have offended.</said></p>

                    <p>The Baron bowed respectfully, and retired
		    <lb/>to take leave of the family, who kindly asked
		    <lb/>him to stay that night; but which he modest­
		    <lb/>ly refused, though of all earthly pleasures he
		    <lb/>would most cheerfully have accepted.</p>
                    <p>At the return of his <persName>Eleanora</persName> how did his
		    <lb/>glad heart glow with ardour! His countenance
		    <lb/>as the drooping lily withered; but by the
		    <lb/>warmth of the sun of affection it expanded
		    <lb/>and appeared in its pristine vigour. <said>How
		      <lb/>sublime the joy when hope dawns on our
		      <lb/>soul,</said> he exclaimed; <said>I shall now hasten to
		      <lb/>await my doom.</said> And at the first interview
		    <lb/>after his return to <placeName>Weehawken</placeName> he immediately
		    <lb/>requested to know his doom. She was very
		    <lb/>explicit, and said she delighted not in tor­
		    <lb/>menting those that preferred her to the rest of
		    <lb/>her sex, and now acknowledged that her
		    <lb/>every wish was centered in his happiness,
		    <lb/>and ere many revolving suns he should be
		    <lb/>blessed with her hand and heart. He then
		    <lb/>took her hand and promised her that every
		    <lb/>future action of his life should be directed by
		    <lb/>her, and as his leading star, he would follow
		    <lb/>her in all the intricate mazes of life. Should

		    <lb/>clouds overcast the morn, he would penetrate
		    <lb/>through their gloom. After a variety of
		    <lb/>conversation, the ladies all entered the room.
		    <lb/><persName>Miss Erskine</persName> looked as if she should like to
		    <lb/>know our last conversation, she being a young
		    <lb/>lady of penetration, I quickly replied to her
		    <lb/>that I was the happiest man in existence.
		    <lb/>She took the hint and smiled. <persName>Mrs. Fitzroy</persName>
		    <lb/>entered the drawing room; I made a humble
		    <lb/>bow, and in the feelings I was impressed with
		    <lb/>begged her concurrence in my favour as
		    <lb/>speedily as possible. Her husband was gone
		    <lb/>to solicit aid for the <name>Greeks</name>. It depends
		    <lb/>greatly on the state of our minds at the time
		    <lb/>that we are wishing to aid the wretched,
		    <lb/>whether we shall be successful or not. But
		    <lb/>we may ask in vain; the all-seeing eye looks
		    <lb/>at the well meaning of the giver: He know­
		    <lb/>eth our hearts, and will smile upon us ac­
		    <lb/>cording to our sincerity. <persName>Baron Tilas</persName> entered
		    <lb/>and made his respects to <persName>Mr. Fitzroy</persName>, and
		    <lb/>likewise requested his approbation; he, with­
		    <lb/>out pausing a moment, gave his consent, and
		    <lb/>the twenty-fifth of the next month was to be
		    <lb/>the nuptial day.</p>

	    <lb/>In this unsettled state of my mind, I saw a

	    <lb/>The fashion of his coat was not like <name>Paddy's</name>,

              <p>The curtain now drops, and agreeable sen­

              <p>The theatre now closed, and I retired to
	    <lb/>rest. Early the next day I began to reflect
	    <lb/>on what I heard of the aborigines of this
	    <lb/>country, who thought they were kept in a state
	    <lb/>of vassalage and ignorance; but since mission­
	    <lb/>aries have been sent among them they have
	    <lb/>become quite reasonable people.</p>
              <p>How different are the sex in civilized life!
	    <lb/>The first of every good thing is presented to

              <p>The ancient <name>Spartans</name> were a people whose

              <p>There is now established for you an ex­

	    <lb/>extended arms and eloquence profound, teach
	    <lb/>the people to be wise and good.</p>
              <p>I shall now, my patient reader, leave this
	    <lb/>piece to your attention, in the foregoing chap­
	    <lb/>ter, and remind you of the promises I made
	    <lb/>in the beginning of this book, to relate some
	    <lb/>adventure not yet known. I shall now pro­
	    <lb/>ceed to the beauties of the <placeName>Pequest</placeName>, and anx­
	    <lb/>iously inquire what has taken place worthy
	    <lb/>of remark since my infant days. I confess,
	    <lb/>to my surprise and astonishment, the country
	    <lb/>is all fertilized, and male and female as much
	    <lb/>altered in manner and appearance as is possi­
	    <lb/>ble to conjecture. My former friends and
	    <lb/>intimates have risen from almost a state of
	    <lb/>vassalage to wealth and comfort; many are in
	    <lb/>the silent tomb; others have erected stately
	    <lb/>fabricks, and filled them with growing evil;
	    <lb/>perhaps children I mean.</p>
              <p><persName>Colonel Dexter</persName> is the most officiating cha­
	    <lb/>racter in the place; he is adviser and protec­
	    <lb/>tor of all unfortunate characters; he is presi­
	    <lb/>dent of the bank, deacon in the church, as­
	    <pb n="1190"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="16(5)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">190</mw>
	    <lb/>sessor of taxes, road-master, and overseer of
	    <lb/>the poor, all at one time. It appears he is
	    <lb/>loaded with troubles and honours; never a
	    <lb/>day passes but he is solicited to a party, or
	    <lb/>called on for advice; and if he does not attend
	    <lb/>they wait his pleasure, but never dispense
	    <lb/>with his company.</p>
              <p><persName>Mrs. Dexter</persName> is a sister to <persName>governor Clay­
	    <lb/>bourne</persName>, and is rather of a haughty appearance,
	    <lb/>which does not comport with the manners,
	    <lb/>nor suit the people of <placeName>Pequest</placeName>, who are very
	    <lb/>religious, being almost all <name>methodists</name>, and
	    <lb/>have a large barn instead of a church that
	    <lb/>they assemble in, and are well satisfied that
	    <lb/>God is in the midst of them to bless them.</p>
              <p><persName>Colonel Dexter</persName> and his lady sometimes at­
	    <lb/>tend divine service, which gives great plea­
	    <lb/>sure to the people. A serious affray was like
	    <lb/>to take place about three months ago; <persName>Uriah
	    <lb/>Bonum</persName>, not <persName>Uriah the Hittite</persName>, ran off with
	    <lb/><persName>Judith Cummins</persName>, to the state of <placeName>Pennsylva­
	    <lb/>nia</placeName>, and insisted she should give him her hand.
	    <lb/>She was an orphan, who had been educated
	    <lb/>under the auspices of a good family. The
	    <pb n="1191"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="16(6)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">191</mw>
	    <lb/>whole country was agitated at this treatment
	    <lb/>of her. <persName>Judith</persName> was rescued by <persName>Sandy M‘­
	    <lb/>Farland</persName>, who offered to fight him, which he
	    <lb/>declined. <persName>Judith</persName> was rescued and safely con­
	    <lb/>veyed to the <placeName>Pequest</placeName>; <persName>Uriah</persName> retreated to <placeName>Ala­
	    <lb/>bama</placeName> with an ambition that fills the minds
	    <lb/>of many characters of the present day, that
	    <lb/>is, wished to offer himself as a candidate for
	    <lb/>any vacant office. A small school is now
	    <lb/>preparing for <persName>Judith</persName>, under the patronage of
	    <lb/><persName>Mrs. Dexter</persName>; she being a highly accomplish­
	    <lb/>ed lady, is willing to give her a few necessa­
	    <lb/>ry lessons, as a recommendation from her will
	    <lb/>be sufficient to satisfy the people that she is
	    <lb/>competent for the undertaking. She has on­
	    <lb/>ly one daughter, who is in the sixteenth year
	    <lb/>of her age, named <persName>Carolina Sophia</persName>. She is
	    <lb/>in stature tall, in manners mild, and a coun­
	    <lb/>tenance indicative of good sense; she is the
	    <lb/>adoration of her parents, and possesses the
	    <lb/>good will of her neighbours. It is contem­
	    <lb/>plated by her parents to send her to <placeName>New-
	    <lb/>York</placeName> to acquire dignified manners, and ob­
	    <lb/>tain lessons in the fine arts, such as music,
	    <lb/>dancing, drawing, &amp;c. &amp;c.; all other instruc­
	    <lb/>tion such as geography, stenography, philos­

	    <lb/>phy, and many other accomplishments, she
	    <lb/>was possessed of. No expense had been
	    <lb/>spared by her parents, being determined their
	    <lb/>ancient family should not moulder or decay
	    <lb/>for the want of intelligent persons to support
	    <lb/>it.</p>
              <p>Visible traits of former greatness were to
	    <lb/>be observed in their manner and address;
	    <lb/>their minds still retained a certain indescriba­
	    <lb/>ble emotion at the appearance of the better
	    <lb/>order of beings, such as distinguish them­
	    <lb/>selves in charitable pursuits.</p>
              <p><persName>Miss Judith</persName> began her engagement at the
	    <lb/><placeName>Pequest</placeName> in <placeName>New-Jersey</placeName>, which I shall now
	    <lb/>describe. The country around is inhabited
	    <lb/>by peaceable, industrious farmers; it is about
	    <lb/>eighty miles from <placeName>New-York</placeName>—the richest
	    <lb/>man is <persName>Conrad Haunce</persName>, a <name>German</name>, from the
	    <lb/>borders of the <placeName>Manheim</placeName>, whose peculiar man­
	    <lb/>ners I must describe. He never consents to
	    <lb/>his partner's leaving home, as he says it spoils
	    <lb/>the woman, and sets a bad example to his
	    <lb/>daughters. He always maintains a stubborn
	    <lb/>silence to his family; and a rigid economy is
	    <pb n="1193"/>

	    <lb/>observed. His wrinkled forehead keeps them
	    <lb/>all in awe of him, and the only influence they
	    <lb/>can obtain is when they are sick; for he is so
	    <lb/>avaricious he does not like to part with any
	    <lb/>thing, not even his family. His Frowe is
	    <lb/>very sulky when a friend calls and finds her
	    <lb/>doing nothing, and in that state of mind she
	    <lb/>is sure to bind up her head with a large cloth,
	    <lb/>and tie up her mouth as though she had the
	    <lb/>tooth-ache.</p>
              <p>Her husband then accosted her—<said>Frowe,
	      <lb/>have you nothing to give our friend to eat
	      <lb/>after travelling all the way from <placeName>Tawny­
	      <lb/>town</placeName> to see us?</said> Then she stamped on the
	    <lb/>floor, the heels of her shoes having many
	    <lb/>nails drove in them to make them strong;
	    <lb/>she ran down into the cellar, fetched up a
	    <lb/>side of bacon, and began slicing it; then the
	    <lb/>daughter flew up to the barn, and knocked
	    <lb/>the head off a pair of old roosters, while the
	    <lb/>old man gathered some eggs from under an
	    <lb/>old hen. They were all in motion to enter­
	    <lb/>tain their friend from <placeName>Tawnytown</placeName>, who be­
	    <lb/>gan to be very pleasant and talkative, as he
	    <lb/>saw them all so busy preparing dinner; and,

	    <lb/>in order to entertain them with something
	    <lb/>new, he inquired, <said>Have you heard our
	      <lb/><persName>Squire Baltus Zeek</persName> has buried his fourth
	      <lb/>wife, and she has left him the care of ten
	      <lb/>children, all under twenty years of age? Poor
	      <lb/>old gentleman, I pity him; he is upwards of
	      <lb/>seventy years of age; my Heeragodt! what
	      <lb/>a sorrowful thing it is that these women die
	      <lb/>so fast. I think she worked too much—and
	      <lb/>he cannot now get another—he is too old.</said>
	    <lb/><said>Well,</said> exclaimed <persName>Haunce</persName>, <said>I think I have
	      <lb/>great luck; I still keep my old wife—she
	      <lb/>was one of the Hessian women taken at
	      <lb/><placeName>Trenton</placeName>, where <persName>Washington</persName> surrounded them
	      <lb/>all more than forty years ago. You have
	      <lb/>certainly heard when there were so many
	      <lb/><name>Hessians</name> taken by him. For all she has the
	      <lb/>head-ache and tooth-ache at every turn, I
	      <lb/>don't notice it; that is the best way; for if a
	      <lb/>man is alarmed every time his wife complains,
	      <lb/>she will die directly, only to please him.
	      <lb/>Poor <persName>Baltus Zeek</persName>! what trouble he has met
	      <lb/>—crying and mourning his whole life; it
	      <lb/>would be better he had never been born.
	      <lb/>How hard is the lot of man, if he studies all
	      <lb/>his life to please a peevish woman; and if for

	      <lb/>a moment he neglects her, she immediately
	      <lb/>dies of hypochondria. Then the doctors de­
	      <lb/>clare, for they know not her disease, it was
	      <lb/>a hasty consumption. It is the best way, I
	      <lb/>think, <persName>Boltus</persName>, not to look at the women at
	      <lb/>all, and then you can't know whether they
	      <lb/>are pleased or not; that is my way: I plod
	      <lb/>on, and never feel merry or sad—always the
	      <lb/>same; a cloudy or a rainy day is all the
	      <lb/>same to <persName>Conrad Haunce</persName>: children crying,
	      <lb/>dogs barking, women scolding, or cats mew­
	      <lb/>ing, never disturb me. There is <persName>Captain
	      <lb/>Halsey</persName> of our militia, my next neighbour—he
	      <lb/>is from <placeName>Hempstead</placeName>, <placeName>Long-Island</placeName>. To be
	      <lb/>sure, I have nothing against him; he is so
	      <lb/>polite to every one, and so changeable, that
	      <lb/>he never, I am told, keeps his mind for two
	      <lb/>hours. If he promises to see the collector
	      <lb/>and inquire how much taxes you owe, or
	      <lb/>when you are to do your part of the road,
	      <lb/>or prepare for the election, he surely forgets
	      <lb/>it; and when he meets you he will ask your
	      <lb/>pardon, and say he had so many engagements
	      <lb/>he forgot it, when perhaps he had nothing to
	      <lb/>do. His wife can never please him. He is
	      <lb/>so whimsical, and so fond of company, that

	      <mw type="pageNum">196</mw>
	      <lb/>he can never rest at home; he must be med­
	      <lb/>dling with other people's business. I never
	      <lb/>go to see him, because he does not suit
	      <lb/>my turn: he often asked me; but whether
	      <lb/>he means it or not I cannot say. Now I
	      <lb/>would advise you, <persName>Boltus</persName>, my dear friend from
	      <lb/><placeName>Tawnytown</placeName>, not to be in a hurry to get
	      <lb/>married, for it is hard to please the women,
	      <lb/>if you take any notice of them.</said></p>
              <p><persName>Mrs. Haunce</persName>, with her hard step, owing to
	    <lb/>her shoes as I before observed, entered the
	    <lb/>room, and with a fine white table cloth of
	    <lb/>her own manufacture in neat folds, laid the
	    <lb/>cloth, and in the twinkling of an eye the
	    <lb/>bacon and roosters were spread on the table,
	    <lb/>and a handsome print of butter and eggs.</p>
              <p>All the family sat down to the table quite
	    <lb/>mute. The old gentleman took off his an­
	    <lb/>cient hat and placed it before his face, and
	    <lb/>made a long prayer; and when finished spoke
	    <lb/>in a feeble voice, <said>We have nothing better—
	      <lb/>help yourself;</said> and in silence they all ate
	    <lb/>lustily, making no remarks by saying, this

	    <lb/>have; this does not taste like Irish butter,
	    <lb/>and so on—not satisfied, and always making
	    <lb/>comparisons with distant things; which in
	    <lb/>fashionable high life cause warm disputes to
	    <lb/>arise at table concerning the goodness of
	    <lb/>what they are eating.—This is particularly

              <p>I now leave <persName>Conrad Haunce</persName> and his friend

	    <lb/>on public days she was always one of the
	    <lb/>Graces, or carried the Grecian wreath.</p>
              <p>As she had the advantage of a good figure,
	    <lb/>in a short time <persName>Miss Carolina</persName> was distinguish­
	    <lb/>ed from the other ladies by <persName>Descartes</persName>, and
	    <lb/>she quickly discovered that he always made
	    <lb/>her the lowest bow when dancing a cotillion;
	    <lb/>and she in return held her head the highest.
	    <lb/>His attention did not escape notice. One
	    <lb/>day, as he was parading through <placeName>Broadway</placeName>
	    <lb/>opposite the <name>City Hotel</name>, dressed in lilac satin,
	    <lb/>she cast her eyes up, and saw <persName>Descartes</persName> in

	    <lb/>who had been running the boundaries, ac­

	    <lb/>the footsteps of a person fast approaching—
	    <lb/><said>What haste you appear in, <persName>Miss Carolina</persName>.
	      <lb/>I should suppose,</said> said he, <said>if you were

	      <lb/>has never made known to her his high family

	      <lb/>him fifty thousand francs. His passion he
	      <lb/>has revealed to her, and she is at a stand un­
	      <lb/>til she knows who he is. A friend of his
	      <lb/>arrived at <name>Washington Hall</name> last week in the

	      <lb/>ing tea, and heard the conversation. I step­

	      <lb/>to his entire satisfaction. He exulted with

                <said>My dear <persName>Miss Judith</persName>, there are so many

	      <lb/>are sought after by the <name>Europeans</name> as soon as

	      <milestone unit="sig" n="17(5)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum">202</mw>
	      <lb/>they arrive: the first inquiry is where resides
	      <lb/>the wealthiest young lady, or where shall I
	      <lb/>meet the greatest beauty. Immediately plans
	      <lb/>are laid, schem<choice><sic/><corr>e</corr></choice>s projected, arts tried, parties
	      <lb/>made up, and, in truth, nothing left undone
	      <lb/>to introduce the young people to each other:
	      <lb/>and then <persName>hymen</persName> implored to grant his aid:
	      <lb/>all friends, old and young, give their opinion.
	      <lb/>If the gentleman can bow respectfully, talk
	      <lb/>knowingly, or sing enchantingly, the business
	      <lb/>is half done. As soon as he is introduced, a
	      <lb/>plan is immediately set on foot to form a par­
	      <lb/>ty, and giving an opportunity to surrounding
	      <lb/>friends to inspect those outlandish gentry, who
	      <lb/>are as docile as lambs, and innocent as doves.</said>

	      <lb/>their presence as hyenas; and they will
	      <lb/>not be softened into pity by any of their
	      <lb/>friends. Such unfortunate youths, by wan­
	      <lb/>dering in other climes, perhaps may be so
	      <lb/>fortunate as to alight at some abode, and in a
	      <lb/>moment receive comfort. They snatch the

	    <lb/><persName>Miss Carolina</persName> boarded. She had just enter­
	    <lb/>ed the front door, when the servant handed

	    <lb/>was young, was seized with unusual sensa­
	    <lb/>tions, and the tremble of her hand caused her
	    <lb/>to drop it, unheeded, on the floor. On enter­
	    <lb/>ing the drawing room of her guardian, (guar­
	    <lb/>dians are ever great observers,) he inquired

	    <lb/>servant, <persName>Nimrod</persName>, ran into the parlour, and
	    <lb/>told his master, as he could not read, that he
	    <lb/>found a letter at the hall door, and supposed it
	    <lb/>was for him. He cautiously glanced a look
	    <lb/>at it, and saw by the superscription it was di­
	    <lb/>rected to his ward. He handed it to her, at
	    <lb/>the same time was inquisitive to know the
	    <lb/>contents.</p>
              <p><persName>Miss Carolina</persName> was a generous girl, and had
	    <lb/>no deception in her nature; she immediately,
	    <lb/>as soon as she had perused it, gave it to her

	    <lb/>that all things were true.</p>
              <p>The next morning <persName>Miss Carolina</persName>, (as was
	    <lb/>her custom,) like other belles, paraded through

	    <lb/>not seen her in some days. He made a reve­

	    <lb/>shell with a pair of gloves in it; then took
	    <lb/>a turn with two books in her hand round
	    <lb/>through <placeName>Pearl-street</placeName>. A thought here enter­
	    <lb/>ed her mind—she should like to have her for­
	    <lb/>tune told; and having been reminded by an
	    <lb/>acquaintance, that one resided in <placeName>Eldridge-
	    <lb/>street</placeName>, she hurried there. On entering, a
	    <lb/>haggard-looking female asked her, <said rend="pre()post()">what is
	      <lb/>your name, and what is your will?</said> and be­
	    <lb/>gan telling her, <said>you are very uneasy about

	    <lb/>pected in the steam-boat at <placeName>Courtland-street</placeName>
	    <lb/>wharf, from <placeName>Pequest</placeName>. It is unnecessary to
	    <lb/>describe how cheerful he appeared at the

	    <lb/>family and connections; it was to him a
	    <lb/>source of consolation, as he knew the gran­
	    <lb/>deur of his family as soon as he met her. He
	    <lb/>was transported, and taking her hand in ex­

              <p>The family were all requested in the back

              <p>The clock struck six: <persName>Miss Dexter</persName> had

	    <lb/>ing room, elegantly dressed in a pale blue
	    <lb/>circassian dress, trimmed with white sarsnet,
	    <lb/>which was very becoming, as she was of a
	    <lb/>fair complexion, a small piece of myrtle in
	    <lb/>her bosom, and a necklace of real amber.
	    <lb/>The time passed slowly from six to seven;
	    <lb/>but no appearance of her swain. She was
	    <lb/>impatient on two accounts; first, for the ap­

	    <lb/>what reception he had met with. She was

              </p>
              <p>After a few compliments, the conversation
	    <lb/>turned on the seat of her father; he then in­
	    <lb/>formed her of the manner in which he was
	    <lb/>received, and said he brought no answer to
	    <lb/>her letter, as it required a little time to reflect
	    <lb/>on it. By the next mail doubtless, he thought,
	    <lb/>she would receive one. He then assured her
	    <lb/>his affection was unalterable; nothing on
	    <lb/>earth could shake it. She bowed her head,
	    <lb/>and he took leave of her with a request that
	    <lb/>she would so far gratify him as to go to the
	    <lb/>theatre, as a new play was to be performed,
	    <lb/>called <title rend="pre()post()"><persName>Tom</persName> and <persName>Jerry</persName></title>. The next evening he

	    <lb/>with resplendid lustre, and it was visible in
	    <lb/>her countenance that she was delighted. <persName>Miss
	    <lb/>Carolina's</persName> dress was quite romantic: a royal
	    <lb/>purple Grecian costume, trimmed with white
	    <lb/>sattin, and a beautiful ruby necklace round
	    <lb/>her snowy neck. These splendid belles drew
	    <lb/>much attention, as the house was not much
	    <lb/>thronged.</p>
              <p>The curtain rose, and two fair damsels pre­

	    <lb/>representing the Grecian women imitating
	    <lb/>the Spartan ladies, in cheering the soldiers,
	    <lb/>and bringing them provisions, then applaud­
	    <lb/>ing their courage, which had a powerful effect
	    <lb/>on the army, and excited them to deeds of
	    <lb/>valour.</p>
              <p>The house echoed with applauses; the
	    <lb/>scenery was superb; the language of <persName>Cleopa­
	    <lb/>tra</persName> was strikingly impressive; and a few
	    <lb/>words that I recollected were spoke in an

	    <lb/>with her neighbours, wasted nothing, and on

	    <lb/>and friends dressed in her best attire, and
	    <lb/>treated them very hospitably. They then
	    <lb/>all congratulated her on the happy new-year.
	    <lb/>In this regular manner she lived to a good
	    <lb/>old age—she died very suddenly, and was
	    <lb/>never afterwards thought of; and so died in

	    <lb/>Her funeral was the largest ever known in
	    <lb/><placeName>Communipaw</placeName>. The clergy of all denomina­

	    <lb/>to regale the ladies, who sometimes are more

	    <lb/>pleased with them than with the entertain­
	    <lb/>ment. The comedy was an excellent one,
	    <lb/>dramatized from <title rend="pre()post()">the Spy</title>, which portrayed
	    <lb/>characters in an excellent strain.</p>
              <p>The ladies were wishing to return home.
	    <lb/>The gentlemen handed them into the car­
	    <lb/>riage, and after taking leave for that evening,
	    <lb/>as the ladies staid in one house, they returned
	    <lb/>to the theatre to see the afterpiece, and <persName>Lio­
	    <lb/>nel</persName> then related to his friend the serious at­
	    <lb/>tachment he had for <persName>Miss Caroline</persName>. He had
	    <lb/>penetration enough to discover it before he
	    <lb/>made him his confidant. They took leave of
	    <lb/>each other in the most friendly manner, en­
	    <lb/>gaging to meet again the next day, to call
	    <lb/>and see the ladies. <persName>Mr. Billings</persName> was sorry
	    <lb/>to mention he had a little business at the sur­
	    <lb/>rogate's respecting his aunt's will, which
	    <lb/>would detain him until twelve o'clock, and
	    <lb/>then would do himself the pleasure to wait
	    <lb/>upon him at his lodgings.</p>
              <p>The young ladies sat up almost un­
	    <lb/>til day-light, telling each other how many
	    <lb/>lovers they had, and how they tried to
	    <pb n="1224"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="19(4)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">224</mw>
	    <lb/>torment them; what arts they used to gain
	    <lb/>the affections of men, and then always ap­
	    <lb/>peared quite surprised when they made a
	    <lb/>conquest. <persName>Miss Witherspoon</persName> was a finished
	    <lb/>coquette, having so much vivacity that all
	    <lb/>her designs seemed merely to pass a pleasant
	    <lb/>hour. Her quick wit made her please for a
	    <lb/>short time beyond expression, and a man was
	    <lb/>caught insensibly whenever she designed it;
	    <lb/>she would then torment him in a manner not
	    <lb/>to be described. Her lover, when most
	    <lb/>wretched, would try absence, and perhaps
	    <lb/>banish himself to <placeName>South America</placeName>, <placeName>Porto Rico</placeName>,
	    <lb/>or the <placeName>Illinois country</placeName>, under pretence of
	    <lb/>great business. She would then in his ab­
	    <lb/>sence repent of her cruelty, and confine her­
	    <lb/>self at home; dress, company, and amuse­
	    <lb/>ments were lost on her, until his return.</p>
              <p>After the ladies had taken a short nap,
	    <lb/>they awoke, which to <persName>Miss Dexter</persName> was great
	    <lb/>joy, as certainly on that day she should
	    <lb/>see her adorer, and perhaps receive a letter
	    <lb/>from her father. Under these impressions
	    <lb/>she dressed herself in her usual manner,
	    <lb/>which, as I before observed, was very tasty.

	    <mw type="pageNum">225</mw>
	    <lb/><persName>Miss Witherspoon's</persName> heart at this time was
	    <lb/>not particularly engaged, as her last lover
	    <lb/>was absent, as I mentioned, and had not writ­
	    <lb/>ten to her for fear it would not be agreeable;
	    <lb/>for at parting she had not given him sufficient
	    <lb/>encouragement. So she was partly free, only
	    <lb/>sometimes she would be angry at herself, and
	    <lb/>was determined at the next conquest she
	    <lb/>made not to trifle with the feelings of a sin­
	    <lb/>cere lover.</p>
              <p>After breakfast the young ladies took a
	    <lb/>walk to <placeName>Chatham street</placeName>, and purchased some
	    <lb/>paper, and from there to the library to get
	    <lb/>the last publication, which was <title rend="pre()post()"><persName>Lionel Lin­
	      <lb/>coln</persName></title>, or the <title rend="pre()post()">Leaguer of
<placeName>Boston</placeName></title>, as they had
	    <lb/>heard much in praise of it. They were anx­
	    <lb/>ious however to read it, and perhaps could
	    <lb/>not describe a single character—only repeat,
	    <lb/>it is a good thing—I have read it; ask them
	    <lb/>which is their favourite character, and they
	    <lb/>will immediately change the subject. Every
	    <lb/>young lady can relate something that took
	    <lb/>place at a ball, (that requires no thinking)
	    <lb/>who was the best dressed, and the handsom­
	    <lb/>est. I knew one of a gay temper, that could

	    <lb/>if she chose, repeat all the conversation of
	    <lb/>the company she had passed the evening
	    <lb/>with. After their morning walk, they seem­
	    <lb/>ed much pleased, for they had a bow,
	    <lb/>from dandy <persName>Lookout</persName>, at the corner of <placeName>Liber­
	    <lb/>ty-street</placeName>, who pretended to be much engaged
	    <lb/>in conversation with half a dozen gentlemen,
	    <lb/>who were only standing to view the ladies,
	    <lb/>either to make observations or bow to them:
	    <lb/>some are stupidly standing to recei<choice><sic>r</sic><corr>v</corr></choice>e the so­
	    <lb/>licitations of the busy merchant. There is a
	    <lb/>surprising ingenuity in the mind of man; for
	    <lb/>the more trouble he has in the <placeName>Wall-street</placeName>
	    <lb/>walks, the more quick is his invention and
	    <lb/>plans to extricate himself; though at the ex­
	    <lb/>pense of his anxiety, many an industrious
	    <lb/>mechanic heaps riches, and the avaricious
	    <lb/>car-man is made contented. The merchant
	    <lb/>then wipes the widow's tears by his philan­
	    <lb/>throp<choice><sic>h</sic><corr/></choice>y, though the anguish of his mind oft­
	    <lb/>times is insupportable.</p>
              <p>The clock in front of the mantle piece
	    <lb/>struck twelve; the ladies, with novels by
	    <lb/>their side, had a pattern of a new veil in
	    <lb/>their hand, which they were admiring;—just

	    <lb/>at that moment, <persName>Lionel</persName> and <persName>Billings</persName> from the
	    <lb/><placeName>Cahoos falls</placeName> entered. <said>I hope ladies you have
	      <lb/>taken no cold last evening at the theatre?</said>
	    <lb/><said rend="post()">Why, gentlemen,</said> very pertly replied <persName>Miss
	    <lb/>Witherspoon</persName>, <said>do you think we would ac­
	      <lb/>knowledge it if we had? No, no pleasure is so
	      <lb/>inviting—though alloyed with pain, we would
	      <lb/>suffer the one to be engaged in the other.</said>
	    <lb/><said>Well said, <persName>Miss Witherspoon</persName>, you are a
	      <lb/>merry girl, and I hope through life, you will
	      <lb/>never trouble other people with your com­
	      <lb/>plaints of sickness and pain. For my part I
	      <lb/>have sat in company two hours with an old
	      <lb/>lady, who thought she was entertaining me
	      <lb/>by relating her sufferings—such a tremour and
	      <lb/>sneezing at the nose, and such a want of ap­
	      <lb/>petite; <said rend="pre()post()">I can't exist long—I often tell my
		<lb/>family</said> (said the old lady) <said rend="pre()post()">that they will not

	    <lb/>visit, and <persName>Lionel</persName> said he should hasten to the
	    <lb/>post-office to receive a letter for <persName>Miss Caro­
	    <lb/>lina</persName>, and call in the evening at the boat, leav­
	    <lb/>ing them. <persName>Miss Witherspoon</persName> observed, that
	    <lb/><persName>Mr. Billings</persName> improved on acquaintance. I
	    <lb/>thought what a susceptible heart you have:

	      <lb/>lings</persName> appears, in my opinion, to possess a
	      <lb/>sound mind and temper, and not easily won;
	      <lb/>it would take at least six months acquaint­
	      <lb/>ance with him, before you could find out he
	      <lb/>loved you. So do not put yourself in trouble
	      <lb/>with your vivacity; for if you once lose your
	      <lb/>heart, and he find it, aye, I say, he may so
	      <lb/>keep it that you may not in a hurry get it
	      <lb/>again. Be cautious and quiet, and you may
	      <lb/>in time win him. His steady temper you
	      <lb/>cannot so easily subdue; and I shall be very
	      <lb/>wretched to see you in pain, when I cannot
	      <lb/>relieve you.</said></p>
              <p>In the evening <persName>Lionel</persName> came, as usual, with
	    <lb/>the agreeable news that he had a letter for
	    <lb/>her, and would not give it without a promise
	    <lb/>that they would take a little excursion to <placeName>Ja­
	    <lb/>maica</placeName> on <placeName>Long Island</placeName>, which they agreed to;
	    <lb/>and then <persName>Miss Dexter</persName> begged to be excused,
	    <lb/>and left the room, to read what she so anx­
	    <lb/>iously wished to know.</p>
              <p>After she left the room <persName>Lionel</persName> began to in­
	    <lb/>terrogate <persName>Miss Witherspoon</persName> what she thought
	    <lb/>of his young friend. She replied, <said>As yet I

	      <lb/>so as to give an opinion. I am surprised you
	      <lb/>are always so speedy in your answers and
	      <lb/>hasty in your opinion—I cannot but express
	      <lb/>my astonishment.</said> While in this pleasant
	    <lb/>conversation, <persName>Miss Dexter</persName> entered the room;
	    <lb/>joy was expressed in her countenance. She
	    <lb/>immediately ordered tea; the faithful <persName>Nimrod</persName>
	    <lb/>cheerfully obeyed her commands, and the
	    <lb/>evening passed off in great glee. <persName>Lionel</persName> in­
	    <lb/>quired of the health of the family. And <persName>Miss
	    <lb/>Dexter</persName> told him when an opportunity offered,
	    <lb/>(for she spoke in a low voice,) she would in­
	    <lb/>form him of the contents of the letter, which
	    <lb/>gave her pleasure on two accounts. After
	    <lb/>the usual ceremony of tea, &amp;c. &amp;c., the com­
	    <lb/>pany separated with the intention of meeting
	    <lb/>the next morning for their excursion.</p>
              <p>After <persName>Miss Carolina</persName> returned to her room,

              <p>The jaunt to <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> was certainly a de­
	    <lb/>lightful one. <persName>Billings</persName> was more reserved

	    <lb/><persName>Lionel</persName> was anxious to have the happy day
	    <lb/>appointed with <persName>Miss Caroline</persName>, and she, as
	    <lb/>we before observed, was not a prude, and
	    <lb/>consented in three weeks from that time.
	    <lb/><persName>Lionel</persName> sunk as it were into a lethargy, and
	    <lb/>spoke not one word. She consented at
	    <lb/>length, and he seized her trembling hand and

	      <lb/>ever alter my affection for you. The three
	      <lb/>approaching weeks I wish I could sleep, and

	      <lb/>rienced.</said></p>
              <p><persName>Miss Witherspoon</persName> returned to <placeName>New-Jersey</placeName>,
	    <lb/>and <persName>Miss Caroline</persName> remained one week to pre­
	    <lb/>pare her dresses and other necessaries for the
	    <lb/>family, as she had an order on her guardian
	    <lb/>to supply her. Accordingly, in eight days
	    <lb/>she took the stage, and arrived at her father's
	    <lb/>house in one day, and found the family all in
	    <lb/>a pleasant mood, and ready to officiate and
	    <lb/>assist her. The drawing room was new

	    <lb/>ny changing scenes took place that had not

	    <lb/>Dexter</persName> exerted herself to make all the do­
	    <lb/>mestics pleased; she presented each with
	    <lb/>a new dress, which always has a tendency
	    <lb/>to excite industry; and her cheerfulness
	    <lb/>ever had a tendency to make things go on
	    <lb/>agreeably in the family, and hastened the
	    <lb/>grand preparations. All the best things that
	    <lb/>the farm afforded were selected, and the rich
	    <lb/>neighbours invited. The carriage was new
	    <lb/>painted, and farmer <persName>Grumble</persName>, their overseer,
	    <lb/>offered his services to drive them, and crop the
	    <lb/>plough horses to make them appear as
	    <lb/>though they had been accustomed to be used
	    <lb/>in that way, though it is well known the car­
	    <lb/>riage had never been out of the barn since
	    <lb/><persName>Monroe</persName> was President of the <placeName>United States</placeName>.
	    <lb/><persName>Colonel Haislington</persName>, their opulent neighbour,

	    <lb/>for in the country every one knows his neigh­
	    <lb/>bour's business better than his own; and all
	    <lb/>take a particular pleasure in inquiring. The
	    <lb/>Colonel was a jocose vulgar man; had ac­
	    <lb/>quired his property by inheritance, and always
	    <lb/>made some silly speech whenever he called at

	      <lb/>La, sirs, there is no stopping young folks;
	      <lb/>by gracious! I was surprised, and glad too,
	      <lb/>when I heard it. Says I to myself, that is
	      <lb/>the great business. Better late than never.
	      <lb/>I wish in my heart and soul my <persName>Nabby</persName> could
	      <lb/>have the luck to get a good husband; I would
	      <lb/>give her the bald filly and the two old brin­
	      <lb/>dled cows without horns, which I lately
	      <lb/>bought at <name>Dixon's</name> vendue, sheriff's sale; I
	      <lb/>know I got a good bargain, let who will pay
	      <lb/>the piper.</said></p>
              <p><persName>Mrs. Dexter</persName> was a polite lady; and the
	    <lb/>presence of <persName>Colonel Haislington</persName> was always
	    <lb/>so disgusting, that whenever she saw him
	    <lb/>appear, in a moment she would feign herself
	    <lb/>very ill with an anxiety of the precordia,
	    <lb/>which so confused the Colonel that he had
	    <lb/>not a word to say; when he would immedi­
	    <lb/>ately step up to the barn and see the hogs,
	    <lb/>ask what they fed them with, as they were so
	    <lb/>fat it did his heart good to look at them.
	    <lb/>Farmer <persName>Grumble</persName>, the overseer, said, <said>Oh, it is
	      <lb/>the lap-eared breed, imported into this country

	      <lb/>must have one,</said> and quickly ran to the draw­
	    <lb/>ing room. <persName>Mrs. Dexter</persName>, not expecting his
	    <lb/>return from the barn, had assumed her usual
	    <lb/>health, and was busily engaged in rubbing
	    <lb/>the tumblers with whiting. <said>Mistress,</said>
	    <lb/>said he, (for he was an old <placeName>Yorkshire</placeName> man,
	    <lb/>and they call every woman they want a favour
	    <lb/>from by that submissive name,) <said>I want to
	      <lb/>buy one of your fine lap-eared pigs just for
	      <lb/>the breed; money is no object; I will give
	      <lb/>you whatever you ask.</said></p>
              <p><said>Upon my word, Colonel,</said> said <persName>Mrs.
	    <lb/>Dexter</persName>, <said>I know so little about the hogs or
	      <lb/>pigs my husband owns, that you are the first
	      <lb/>that has informed me of their valuable breed;
	      <lb/>and as I never take the privilege of conveying
	      <lb/>away my husband's property without fully
	      <lb/>consulting him, I must beg your excusing
	      <lb/>me at this time from taking that liberty.
	      <lb/>It is well known in this place that <persName>Colonel
	      <lb/>Dexter</persName> is a man of noble sentiments, but how
	      <lb/>far he can be prevailed upon to part with his
	      <lb/>fine breed of pigs I cannot inform you. I
	      <lb/>believe he prides himself on owning a hand­
	      <lb/>some dog, good horses, and fat cattle; but as

              <p>Suddenly a gentleman on horseback ap­
	    <lb/>proached the door. Neighbour <persName>Haislington</persName>
	    <lb/>bid farewell, to the great joy of the family.
	    <lb/>It was <persName>Mrs. Dexter's</persName> brother from the <placeName>Alaba­
	    <lb/>ma Territory</placeName>; he was governor there, and
	    <lb/>was on his way from <orgName>Congress</orgName>, who were

	    <lb/>constituents to petition for a new road to
	    <lb/><placeName>Warrington</placeName>, <placeName>Mississippi Territory</placeName>. His visit
	    <lb/>was very agreeable to all the family, as they
	    <lb/>had not seen him in ten years. He was a
	    <lb/>great land speculator, and had enriched him­
	    <lb/>self early in life by purchasing soldiers' cer­
	    <lb/>tificates at a small price. His name was
	    <lb/><persName>William Clairbourne</persName>; we shall presently speak
	    <lb/>more of him. A messenger was despatched
	    <lb/>for the Colonel, who was in <placeName>Easton</placeName>, <placeName>Penn­

	    <lb/><said>Good morrow, sir; you are welcome to
	      <lb/>my house; please to be seated.</said> After these
	    <lb/>usual compliments—<said>Can you, my dear,</said>
	    <lb/>said <persName>Mrs. Dexter</persName>, <said>discover by the physiog­
	      <lb/>nomy of this gentleman who he is, where he is
	      <lb/>from, and what he wants?</said> <said>Certainly I
	      <lb/>cannot; I have not half penetration to guess
	      <lb/>even his name, much less his business.</said> At
	    <lb/>length a loud laugh ensued, and <persName>Mrs. Dexter</persName>
	    <lb/>made known it was her brother <persName>George Wil­
	    <lb/>liam Clairbourne</persName>, whom she had not seen in
	    <lb/>some years, as he had resided on or near the
	    <lb/><placeName>Ohio</placeName> ever since, and by industry and good
	    <lb/>planning had amassed wealth, and by that
	    <lb/>means was now governor. <said>He is now on
	      <lb/>his way from <orgName>Congress</orgName>,</said> said she, <said>where
	      <lb/>he has been petitioning in behalf of his con­
	      <lb/>stituents for a new road; but <orgName>Congress</orgName> being
	      <lb/>so busily engaged in behalf of the <name>Greeks</name>,
	      <lb/>they were obliged to postpone all American
	      <lb/>concerns for a short time. In the mean time

	      <lb/>saw her last.</said> Words cannot express the
	    <lb/>feelings of the Colonel at the knowledge of
	    <lb/>his being his brother-in-law, he was so altered
	    <lb/>in his appearance. <said>Thrice welcome to our
	      <lb/>abode,</said> said he, <said>which will afford you
	      <lb/>comfort and ease while you are here, I hope;
	      <lb/>and what adds a double pleasure in seeing you
	      <lb/>at this time, is the expectation of our daugh­
	      <lb/>ter's marriage, which is to take place next
	      <lb/><name>Thursday</name>, that is the day appointed; hope
	      <lb/>that you will stay and partake of the plea­
	      <lb/>sures that we expect to enjoy.</said> <said>Surely,
	      <lb/>such an occasion would be sufficient excuse
	      <lb/>for almost any neglect of business. I will
	      <lb/>cheerfully stay, and will this moment write
	      <lb/>to my family, and give them the agreeable
	      <lb/>intelligence; but pray, who is the young gen­
	      <lb/>tleman that is to gain the prize?</said></p>
              <p>
                <said>He is the son of a French nobleman. In
	      <lb/>early life he offended his father, for which
	      <lb/>he banished him from his presence; he came
	      <lb/>to <placeName>America</placeName>, was compelled to teach dancing,
	      <lb/>and assumed another name; my daughter
	      <lb/>was under his instruction, and he became

	      <lb/>captivated with her, not knowing who she
	      <lb/>was, and she equally admired him, but did
	      <lb/>not indulge the passion, thinking it would be
	      <lb/>degrading to have a dancing master; so after
	      <lb/>some time they became known to each other,
	      <lb/>and with our consent have agreed to spend
	      <lb/>their days together. Next <name>Wednesday</name> I will
	      <lb/>introduce her to you.</said>
              </p>
              <p>Just in the height of the conversation
	    <lb/>neighbour <persName>Haislington</persName> called to know if he
	    <lb/>could have a pig. The Colonel gave him
	    <lb/>one, and he hastened home, carrying it in his
	    <lb/>arms, transported with the idea of his increas­
	    <lb/>ing wealth.</p>
              <p>Dinner was announced, of which the hap­
	    <lb/>py family partook; and hilarity and good
	    <lb/>cheer graced the feast. In the evening they
	    <lb/>were invited to sup at <persName>Colonel Haislington's</persName>;
	    <lb/><persName>Mrs. Dexter</persName> declined going, as she was
	    <lb/>always so surfeited with his conversation.
	    <lb/><persName>Miss Sophia</persName>, her father, and uncle, conde­
	    <lb/>scended to accept the invitation, and certainly,
	    <lb/>for plenty and kind welcome nothing could
	    <lb/>exceed.</p>

              <p>A large cheese of an enormous size was
	    <lb/>cut, and his cider tapped; his children were
	    <lb/>compelled to speak their best pieces; to do
	    <lb/>them justice, they were very well spoken—
	    <lb/>that was owing to the great exertions of the
	    <lb/>schoolmaster.</p>
              <p><said>My children shall be scholars—I don't
	      <lb/>mind what it costs; and as to <persName>Nabby</persName>, she
	      <lb/>has such an ear for music, I would give my
	      <lb/>whole cabbage patch if I could get a teacher
	      <lb/>for her. Do you think, gentlemen, she is
	      <lb/>too old to begin?</said> <said>Not at all, sir; you tell
	      <lb/>me she is seventeen; that is just the age of
	      <lb/>my <persName>Josephine</persName>,</said> said <persName>George William Clair­
	    <lb/>bourne</persName>, the uncle. <said>Do you think your daugh­
	      <lb/>ter has any taste for it? It appears to me it
	      <lb/>is only a trap to get a husband. There are
	      <lb/>many different characters in the world.</said>
	    <lb/><said>Friend <persName>Haislington</persName>,</said> replied <persName>Colonel Dex­
	    <lb/>ter</persName>, <said>if your daughter should excel in any
	      <lb/>particular branch of education, base charac­
	      <lb/>ters would slight them, whether they were
	      <lb/>improved or not. Do not let that intimidate
	      <lb/>you; for my daughter has made a conquest
	      <lb/>of a dancing master, which I hope will be for

	      <lb/>her benefit. Why should not your daughter,
	      <lb/>by the quick and graceful motions of her fin­
	      <lb/>gers, delight?—for men think they ought to
	      <lb/>be pleased, when they gain a partner for life.
	      <lb/>However, you must risk her fortune to future
	      <lb/>chances; for it matters not how they gain
	      <lb/>the ascendancy over men, whether by the
	      <lb/>tongue, the feet, or the fingers; all the merit
	      <lb/>is in securing the affections when time shall
	      <lb/>have furrowed their brows, and beauty be
	      <lb/>lost and forgotten.</said></p>
              <p>The evening was spent in the manner de­
	    <lb/>scribed—the young ladies amused themselves
	    <lb/>in needlework. <persName>Miss Nabby</persName> displayed a
	    <lb/>handsome piece of work in stars and squares,
	    <lb/>octagons and hexagons; her father was de­
	    <lb/>lighted, as he had not before seen it. He
	    <lb/>then observed, and looked amazed at her
	    <lb/>ingenuity; but observed, <said>I believe it is all
	      <lb/>my wife's planning</said>—every good husband
	    <lb/>wishes to give his wife praise. She was one
	    <lb/>of those females that heap up on chairs all
	    <lb/>their industry, not altogether pleasing, on ac­
	    <lb/>count of the expense of weaving it. I will

	    <lb/>riage of <persName>Lionel</persName> and <persName>Carolina Sophia</persName>, which
	    <lb/>is to be consummated in two days, this being
	    <lb/><name>Tuesday</name> evening. To begin first with the
	    <lb/>entertainment, which consisted of pigs, geese,
	    <lb/>turkeys and custards in great abundance; we
	    <lb/>all feasted, and praised every thing—made no
	    <lb/>odious comparisons, as is generally done by
	    <lb/><name>Europeans</name>. A <name>cockney</name> will say, there is
	    <lb/>nothing good in <placeName>America</placeName>, neither butter,
	    <lb/>cheese nor roast beef, fit to be tasted without
	    <lb/>a very keen appetite. However, they will
	    <lb/>still write for more of their friends in the
	    <lb/>third degree of consanguinity to visit this
	    <lb/>free country, where water falls rapidly, and
	    <lb/>no one arrests its progress.</p>
              <p>The company all bade a good evening to
	    <lb/>the family, with assurances of soon seeing
	    <lb/>them again. At their return <persName>Mrs. Dexter</persName>
	    <lb/>had retired to bed. The servant informed
	    <lb/>them that a gentleman had come from <placeName>New-
	    <lb/>York</placeName>, and sent to announce his arrival. <persName>Mrs.

	    <lb/>retired to their separate rooms, and in the
	    <lb/>arms of <name>Somnus</name> reposed, no doubt, until
	    <lb/>morning.</p>
              <p>It was a delightful morning. Aurora had
	    <lb/>opened her purple gates, and it was to be
	    <lb/>hoped that in a short time her paths would
	    <lb/>be strewed with roses, to the pair who had
	    <lb/>patiently waited for the day to appear, which
	    <lb/>should show to the world that patience
	    <lb/>and perseverance are the only paths to true
	    <lb/>felicity, and that the morning of life requires
	    <lb/>great skill to conduct to the eve thereof with
	    <lb/>tranquillity, and serenely to prepare for last­
	    <lb/>ing pleasures.</p>
              <p>Agreeably to the wishes of <persName>Mrs. Dexter</persName>,
	    <lb/><persName>Lionel</persName> entered the breakfast parlour; the
	    <lb/>family gave him a heartfelt welcome, and
	    <lb/>inquired the state of the roads, the entertain­
	    <lb/>ment he had met with, and what parti­
	    <lb/>cular news from <placeName>Europe</placeName>. <persName>Miss Caroline</persName>
	    <lb/>entered in her morning dress, in her usual
	    <lb/>placid manner. <said>I am sorry to acquaint
	      <lb/>you, Miss,</said> said he, <said>your friend <persName>Miss Wi­

	      <lb/>navy. She married him, to the extreme mor­
	      <lb/>tification of her family, and left poor <persName>Billings</persName>,
	      <lb/>who was dying for her.</said> <said>I always thought,</said>
	    <lb/>said <persName>Caroline</persName>, <said>she was too volatile to make
	      <lb/>any person happy: you have certainly heard
	      <lb/>me make the remark before; a drawing room
	      <lb/>was the place for her to exhibit all her pow­
	      <lb/>ers, which soon vanished, when serious re­
	      <lb/>flections arose in her mind. I hope <persName>Lieute­
	      <lb/>nant Nabob</persName> will overlook his ridiculous
	      <lb/>manner, and she bless him with many happy
	      <lb/>days.</said></p>
              <p>The family retired, and left the room;
	    <lb/>when Miss Caroline reflected on herself,
	    <lb/>fearing she should appear awkward when the
	    <lb/>ceremony was performing, as she had never
	    <lb/>seen two persons united in the holy state of
	    <lb/>matrimony. Her lover facetiously spoke to
	    <lb/>her, and said, <said>Be of good cheer, thy sacred
	      <lb/>promises, I hope, will be fervently fulfilled.</said></p>
              <p>It was now time for them to separate for a
	    <lb/>short period, and then to meet to part no
	    <lb/>more till death triumphs. The day was
	    <lb/>passed in assorting her dress and ornaments;

	    <milestone unit="sig" n="21(2)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum">244</mw>
	    <lb/>and on the morn of her nuptials she was
	    <lb/>dressed in satin with four rows of lace at the
	    <lb/>bottom, and twenty two stars emblematic of
	    <lb/>the number of states in the Union; on her
	    <lb/>head was a handsome Grecian wreath of
	    <lb/>flowers; on her bosom a beautiful necklace
	    <lb/>cut by a lapidary in <placeName>New-York</placeName> of American
	    <lb/>chrystal taken out of a ledge of rocks in
	    <lb/>the upper part of that state, which glistened
	    <lb/>almost like diamond, and would have been
	    <lb/>as valuable had they been placed on the beau­
	    <lb/>tiful neck of <persName>Maria Louisa</persName>.</p>
              <p>The following persons now made their ap­
	    <lb/>pearance on this festival day, and graced the
	    <lb/>drawing room: <persName>George William Claibourne</persName>,
	    <lb/>uncle to the bride, who was to give her away;
	    <lb/><persName>counsellor Drawback</persName> was to prepare the mar­
	    <lb/>riage articles, and the <persName>Rev. Peter Whitfield</persName>
	    <lb/>was to perform the ceremony; <persName>Miss Clarissa
	    <lb/>Oglethorp</persName>, was bridesmaid, and <persName>Billings</persName>, a
	    <lb/>disappointed attorney, was groomsman. The
	    <lb/>remainder of the company, was the family
	    <lb/>and a few neighbours; the drawing room was
	    <lb/>festooned with odoriferous flowers selected
	    <lb/>from the hot house. The time approached

	    <milestone unit="sig" n="21(3)r"/>

	    <lb/>fast for the solemnity. <persName>Lionel</persName> and his friend
	    <lb/><persName>Billings</persName> from <placeName>Cahoos Falls</placeName> entered lively and
	    <lb/>animated; the marriage of <persName>Miss Witherspoon</persName>,
	    <lb/>had not grieved him as much as was con­
	    <lb/>templated by his friends. <persName>Mrs. Dexter</persName> never
	    <lb/>appeared so charming, and the old gentleman
	    <lb/>in an ancient dress looked quite venerable.
	    <lb/><persName>George William Claibourne</persName> led his niece to
	    <lb/>her place, and the <persName>Rev. Divine</persName> seemed quite
	    <lb/>j<choice><sic>a</sic><corr>o</corr></choice>cose, and made several pleasant stories pass
	    <lb/>off agreeable to those who had not heard
	    <lb/>them before, and nearly all were strangers.
	    <lb/>Silence being observed, the company arose;
	    <lb/>the bride and groom appeared a little agitat­
	    <lb/>ed; and after all persons were placed agree­
	    <lb/>ably to ettiquette, the ceremony began and
	    <lb/>was soon finished, and concluded with a long
	    <lb/>prayer, when, as quick as lightning, they all
	    <lb/>saluted the fair bride, and she then suddenly
	    <lb/>vanished into the adjoining room. After this
	    <lb/>they were called to a splendid supper, which
	    <lb/>was prepared for the occasion, as has been
	    <lb/>before mentioned, and more pleasing sensa­
	    <lb/>tions were never witnessed. About three
	    <lb/>weeks after their marriage they returned to
	    <lb/><placeName>New-York</placeName>, and occupied a neat house. He

	    <lb/>lived on his income, and occasionally spoke
	    <lb/>at the forum, being a great orator. Their
	    <lb/>uncle returned to <orgName>congress</orgName> just in time to
	    <lb/>present his petition, which met a favourable
	    <lb/>reception, as every encouragement is given
	    <lb/>to settle the new lands owned by them; and
	    <lb/>good roads being the first consideration. Not
	    <lb/>unwilling to grant his petition, on his arrival
	    <lb/>at <placeName>Washington</placeName>, there were great arguments
	    <lb/>in the house by very eloquent men respecting
	    <lb/>affairs in <placeName>Europe</placeName>, and the learned had an op­
	    <lb/>portunity of distinguishing themselves. <persName>G.
	    <lb/>W. Claibourne</persName> was a man that pleased his con­
	    <lb/>stituents, not by his long speeches in the
	    <lb/>house but by his affability at home and the
	    <lb/>manner he received his neighbours. He had
	    <lb/>not studied <persName>Newton</persName> or <persName>Locke</persName>.—<title rend="pre()post()">The Pil­
	      <lb/>grim's Progress</title>, by <persName>Bunyan</persName>, was much

	    <lb/>he would never have been chosen ruler of the

	    <lb/>His wife, whose character I have not as yet
	    <lb/>made known to you, is a native of <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>,
	    <lb/>and has never been in any other state, though
	    <lb/>a woman of information and family, and con­
	    <lb/>ducts herself with propriety; and being free

	    <lb/>a daughter of <persName>Solomon Bracebridge</persName>, or <placeName>Cum­

	    <lb/>for casting metal, which supplies all the wes­

	      <lb/>child named after herself. But being fond of
	      <lb/>opposition, I insisted it should be <persName>Josephine</persName>;
	      <lb/>but I frequently grieve since that I did not

	      <lb/>father-in law was much pleased with our

	      <lb/>as from her infancy I always took pleasure
	      <lb/>in instructing her, and though now only fif­
	      <lb/>teen years of age, can converse on any sub­
	      <lb/>ject—agriculture, arts or commerce, belles-
	      <lb/>letters, drawing, and music—nothing has been
	      <lb/>omitted to make her engaging, and I sincere­

	      <lb/>on account of pecuniary affairs; his elegant
	      <lb/>family consists of three sons and two daugh­
	      <lb/>ters; the names of his daughters are <persName>Almira</persName>
	      <lb/>and <persName>Portia</persName>, both lively pleasant girls; but
	      <lb/>dress engages <persName>Almira's</persName> attention; she spends
	      <lb/>a great deal of her time in pointing ruf­
	      <lb/>fles and braiding her hair, which is of a
	      <lb/>chesnut colour; <persName>Portia</persName>, on the contrary, is
	      <lb/>rather the reverse—quite a slattern, attends
	      <lb/>entirely to the cultivation of flowers and
	      <lb/>shrubbery; can recite the names of all the
	      <lb/>plants and their several virtues, in the Ency­
	      <lb/>clopœdia; her knowledge is quite confined to
	      <lb/>the garden and the hot-house; take her from
	      <lb/>these, and she is chilled in a moment. <persName>Mr.

	      <lb/>indeed, it is true they pay strict attention to
	      <lb/>his admonition, and are very obedient. His

	      <lb/>sounds with their yelping. The young men
	      <lb/>are pleasing. <persName>Stephen</persName>, the eldest, seems to
	      <lb/>be the oracle; his father intends him for the

	      <lb/>what few relations will do, that if her heart
	      <lb/>was once fixed on a man, no power on earth
	      <lb/>would change her—she has such a regard for
	      <lb/>propriety, and the breath of calumny has

	    <lb/>situated on the bank of the <placeName>Ohio</placeName>, a long me­

	    <lb/>steam-boats. Very few accidents have lately
	    <lb/>occurred, as the river in a great measure is
	    <lb/>cleared from old trees. The great geographer,
	    <lb/><persName>Hutchins</persName>, was the first that surveyed it sixty
	    <lb/>years ago; and one of the first proprietors of
	    <lb/>the soil near the two <placeName>Miamies</placeName>, two beautiful
	    <lb/>rivers that emptied into the <placeName>Ohio</placeName>, was <persName>John
	    <lb/>Cleve Symmes</persName>, a judge from <placeName>Morris county</placeName>,
	    <lb/><placeName>New Jersey</placeName>, who obtained a great farm from
	    <lb/><orgName>congress</orgName>, of one million of acres, at three
	    <lb/>cents an acre. It is now thickly inhabited
	    <lb/>by men of sense and wealth, and will in a
	    <lb/>future day be the most valuable spot in <placeName>Amer­
	    <lb/>ica</placeName>. <persName>Judge Bridgefield's</persName> house was in the
	    <lb/>cottage style; trees in front—two wings and
	    <lb/>serpentine walks in his garden; handsome
	    <lb/>shrubbery round it, and a number of magno­
	    <lb/>lia trees, which perfumed the place as their
	    <lb/>flowers are of a peculiar fragrance. His do­
	    <lb/>mestics were few, and he had no children by
	    <lb/>either of his wives. A distant relation, an
	    <lb/>old woman about sixty, was his house keep­
	    <lb/>er. Her name was <persName>Nauche</persName>. We shall have
	    <lb/>occasion to speak of her in future: all I can
	    <lb/>say at present is, she was very ill tempered;

	    <lb/>and this alone was sufficient to make the

              <p>It was on <name>Easter Monday</name>, and all his do­
	    <lb/>mestics from home: he mentioned to his
	    <lb/>house keeper, that he should spend the day
	    <lb/>out; she was inquisitive to know the place.
	    <lb/>He would not satisfy her; and as he seldom
	    <lb/>left home, she was fearful he had some lady
	    <lb/>in view, for he had been preparing himself
	    <lb/>by having a number of shirts made and done
	    <lb/>up in the best manner, had his hair cut, and
	    <lb/>had a new suit of clothes made, all indicative

	      <lb/>is the worst of all jealousy. If you marry

	      <lb/>too many to tie that knot which is not so
	      <lb/>easily loosed, and spend their latter days in

              <p>The Judge paid no attention to her dia­

              <p>The family were called to dinner, and
	    <lb/><persName>Miss Priscilla</persName> was placed at the head of the
	    <lb/>table to give her an opportunity of carving
	    <lb/>and displaying her politeness; she dissected
	    <lb/>a pair of fine fat ducks while <persName>Mrs. Claibourne</persName>
	    <lb/>amused the company. The governor boast­
	    <lb/>ed that every thing on the table was of his
	    <lb/>own raising, except the salt. They then
	    <lb/>feasted, and <persName>Judge Bridgefield</persName> praised every

	    <lb/>is good in the country; but discontented per­
	    <lb/>sons find fault with every thing, it matters
	    <lb/>not; the winds all perplex them. After din­
	    <lb/>ner the family retired and left the single peo­
	    <lb/>ple to themselves. The Judge began: <said rend="post()">I
	      <lb/>think, Miss,</said> addressing himself to <persName>Miss
	      <lb/>Priscilla</persName>, <said>it appears singular you have never

	      <lb/>heart; a disposition like yours certainly would
	      <lb/>sooth the thorny paths of life, and make a

	      <lb/>your acquaintance, which is a short time,
	      <lb/>nothing has happened in your company to
	      <lb/>cause any uneasiness. As for my part I
	      <lb/>should be miserable indeed, and not worthy
	      <lb/>to breathe, if I could not so far govern my
	      <lb/>temper as to be agreeable in a drawing room
	      <lb/>where nothing is said to offend. The method
	      <lb/>to find out a lady's disposition is to see her in
	      <lb/>pain and poverty, not in cheerful company.</said>
	    <lb/><said>Excuse me for my sudden opinion, as you
	      <lb/>have, I assure you, gained such an ascendency
	      <lb/>over my destiny, that time I fear will not

              <p>I then suddenly took leave and insisted the
	    <lb/>family would be sociable, as he seemed de­
	    <lb/>termined to visit them as often as convenient.
	    <lb/>The governor accompanied him nearly to
	    <lb/>his own farm, and was inquisitive to know
	    <lb/>what impression he had made on her obdu­
	    <lb/>rate heart.</p>
              <p><said>My dear friend, I certainly never hinted

	      <lb/>condescend to accept my hand and heart, I
	      <lb/>did not wish to be too hasty, fearing she
	      <lb/>would doubt my sincerity. I have left her
	      <lb/>to her own free deliberation. If I am not
	      <lb/>mistaken she will be mine. I earnestly in­
	      <lb/>treat you not to rally her about me, and re­
	      <lb/>quest my dear <persName>Mrs. Claibourne</persName> to be quite
	      <lb/>indifferent on the subject, and then she will
	      <lb/>not suspect us. And now, worthy sir, I most
	      <lb/>humbly thank you for your kind attention
	      <lb/>and advice, in this most important affair of
	      <lb/>my life; and if I can add to your family com­

	      <lb/>path with fragrant flowers, and make the
	      <lb/>thorny road of life agreeable.</said> The friends
	    <lb/>parted, and retired to their downy pillow,
	    <lb/>awaiting joys not to be described by the pen
	    <lb/>of the most ready writer, and can only be

	    <lb/>in preparing for that event, she being a tasty
	    <lb/>lady. <said rend="post()">My dear, you know how much citi­
	      <lb/>zens look at dress; without it you are not
	      <lb/>noticed, even though you are the daughter of
	      <lb/>a governor. The citizens laugh when a
	      <lb/>country justice, though he may be a near re­
	      <lb/>lation, calls to see you, if his hair is long, or
	      <lb/>his boots not polished, or his hat too large—
	      <lb/>they sneer, and are ashamed to introduce him
	      <lb/>to their acquaintances, and so invite him at
	      <lb/>all unfashionable hours to come, and then
	      <lb/>they are sure to walk out with you when their
	      <lb/>genteel moneyless friends call on them, or
	      <lb/>leave a card; for to be always dressed you

                <p>After I had banished myself from <persName>Miss Ann
		<lb/>Beavers</persName>, I was wholly undetermined what
	      <lb/>route to take to cheer my spirits and banish
	      <lb/>her from my mind. One year seemed an
	      <lb/>age: how could I endure this absence? I then
	      <lb/>thought to myself, I will disguise my person,
	      <lb/>and place myself not far from the <placeName>Ohio</placeName>, and
	      <lb/>undertake to be a miller. I am acquainted
	      <lb/>with that business, my father having owned
	      <lb/>one on the <placeName>Brandywine</placeName>, in the late revolu­

	      tionary war, which was destroyed by the <name>Bri­
	      <lb/>tish</name>. Accordingly, I travelled twenty miles
	      <lb/>down the river, and settled at <placeName>Muskingum</placeName>,
	      <lb/>and engaged in the mill of <persName>John Zuniker</persName>.
	      <lb/>He was a good man; his character had been
	      <lb/>made known to me, and his wife was kind and
	      <lb/>good natured, and occasionally mended my
	      <lb/>clothes. I engaged myself for eleven months,
	      <lb/>at ten dollars a month, to tend the mill. I
	      <lb/>assumed the name of <persName>Bartes Zeek</persName>, and de­
	      <lb/>clared I was of a German family; so they
	      <lb/>concluded I must be honest. I was very
	      <lb/>quiet and reserved, for fear I should betray
	      <lb/>myself.</p>
                <p>The greatest difficulty I encountered was
	      <lb/>in answering to my pretended name; but I
	      <lb/>told them that, unfortunately, I was a little
	      <lb/>deaf, and by that means brought trouble on
	      <lb/>myself. To keep up the deception, I did not
	      <lb/>at first think of the difficulty I had to encoun­
	      <lb/>ter; for as my whole mind and character re­
	      <lb/>quired complete finesse, all my faculties to
	      <lb/>prevent being found out were soon exhausted.
	      <lb/>However, it had this tendency, it banished,
	      <lb/>in a great measure, my tender concern for

	      <lb/>my dear <persName>Ann</persName>, who, I would ofttimes flatter
	      <lb/>myself, must be mine, and the idea of her
	      <lb/>made all things pass along cheerfully. I slept
	      <lb/>very little, I ate less, not being accustomed to
	      <lb/>labour. It was a severe trial, but the good­
	      <lb/>ness of <persName>Zuniker</persName> and his wife made my life
	      <lb/>happy; and as they were very religious peo­
	      <lb/>ple, I was quite at ease, and entered in all
	      <lb/>their society; I was never suspected of be­
	      <lb/>ing an impostor. Indeed, my respected friends,
	      <lb/>I had no evil designs; all I wished was to ob­
	      <lb/>tain the pride of my heart; and as she had
	      <lb/>doomed me to one year's absence, I chose
	      <lb/>this method, that I might hear of her and
	      <lb/>learn how she spent her time. My changing
	      <lb/>my name had an evil appearance, for which
	      <lb/>I gave many an unavailing sigh; but I cer­
	      <lb/>tainly had no evil intention.</p>
                <p>Now, my dear friends, three months had
	      <lb/>elapsed since I had become a deceiver in the
	      <lb/>honest family, and it required all my attention
	      <lb/>to continue the same story. One day, as my
	      <lb/>situation became painful, I addressed <persName>Mr. Zu­
		<lb/>niker</persName>, and told him I had a relation down the
	      <lb/>river that I was anxious to see; and as I had

	      <lb/>been with him three months, and was per­
	      <lb/>fectly satisfied with his treatment, I should
	      <lb/>return again. <persName>Mrs. Zuniker</persName> also assented to
	      <lb/>my proposal, and particularly requested I
	      <lb/>would finish my agreement, as it was in
	      <lb/>writing. I then travelled down the river op­
	      <lb/>posite <placeName>Zainsville</placeName> to have an opportunity of
	      <lb/>hearing of <persName>Doctor Beavers'</persName> family, whose
	      <lb/>welfare was near my heart. On my route
	      <lb/>down the river in a large flat boat, I recog­
	      <lb/>nized an old acquaintance that I had not seen
	      <lb/>in many years; he was from <placeName>Vermont</placeName>; his
	      <lb/>father was in the possession of land to a vast
	      <lb/>extent that he only held by occupancy—his 
	      <lb/>name was <persName>M’Namara</persName>. He accosted me by
	      <lb/>my real name. I then made a confidant of
	      <lb/>him, as he was the friend and companion of
	      <lb/>my youth, which he assured me should be sa­
	      <lb/>cred—no torture should rend the secret from
	      <lb/>his bosom.</p>
                <p>In a few days I stopped at a cottage, suit­
	      <lb/>ing my dress and appearance. The old wo­
	      <lb/>man sat spinning; the old man was ill of a
	      <lb/>fever. This was about fourteen miles from
	      <lb/><persName>Doctor Beavers'</persName>. I mentioned to the old
	      <lb/>woman that I thought her husband was very
<pb n="2007"/>
<milestone n="1(4)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">7</mw>
	      <lb/>ill. She said she had no one to send for the
	      <lb/>Doctor. I told her my friend <persName>M’Namara</persName>
	      <lb/>would immediately go for him. I then en­
	      <lb/>joined him to make every <unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">necessary inquiry</unclear>
	      <lb/>about the young lady, and then <unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">I</unclear> should
	      <lb/>cheerfully return to <placeName>Muskingum</placeName>, and plea­
	      <lb/>santly attend the mill. According to my
	      <lb/>request, he crossed over for the Doctor, while
	      <lb/>I concealed myself until he had visited his pa­
	      <lb/>tient; for the old people did not know my
	      <lb/>name, and they never asked me. In a short
	      <lb/>time the Doctor arrived; he took the old
	      <lb/>man's arm, felt his trembling pulse, looked
	      <lb/>sad, and then told their friends that the brit­
	      <lb/>tle thread of life in him was nearly extinct,
	      <lb/>and they must, by all tender epithets, tell him
	      <lb/>that his weary pilgrimage was nearly finished,
	      <lb/>and that he must fervently pray to the Giver
	      <lb/>of all consolation to forgive him any sins that
	      <lb/>he might have committed, in mind, body
	      <lb/>or estate, so that he might sing hallelujahs
	      <lb/>to the Lamb that was slain, who for our
	      <lb/>transgressions freely gave up his life.</p>
                <p><persName>M’Namara</persName> was studiously trying to find

	      <lb/>intended staying six or eight months, and
	      <lb/>complete herself in some of her acquirements
	      <lb/>commenced at <placeName>Deits</placeName>. Her father had received

	      <lb/>composed, he now could work cheerful­
	      <lb/>ly. At times he would be chagrined, and
	      <lb/>say to himself, who knows what time may
	      <lb/>do? A lovely young girl, in the bloom of
	      <lb/>youth, just entering into life, certainly will
	      <lb/>have many admirers: will she think then of
	      <lb/>me? <said>Great God!</said> he would exclaim, <said>what

		<lb/>the winds that she was false to me. What
		<lb/>will it avail? Though I weep to myself in­

                <p>On the wings of pleasure, he sought every

	      <lb/>came o'er him, that she would appear at
	      <lb/>church, as is customary, on the following <name>Sun­
		<lb/>day</name>. He went, and after the sermon she
	      <lb/>met her lover at the door: he assured her
	      <lb/>that the next day he would call and see her.
	      <lb/>Knowing that <name>Sunday</name> is always a visiting
	      <lb/>day in the country, he would go the next,
	      <lb/>which he accordingly did, and then revealed

		<lb/>is not the age of reason; and I have many
		<lb/>fears in my mind that you will be disappoint­

		<lb/>faults, here is my hand—my heart you have
		<lb/>possessed, I cannot tell how long; and if I
		<lb/>embitter your days I ought to be abhorred.

                <p>
                  <said>Sir, you have a daughter whom monarchs

		<lb/>den application. My daughter has not ar­
		<lb/>rived at an age to discriminate real from pre­
		<lb/>tended affection, and sorry should I be if she
		<lb/>did not prove worthy your choice. Youth is
		<lb/>the season for joy and felicity, and age has
		<lb/>no comforts only in the prospect of their
		<lb/>progeny doing well.—Pray, sir, consider
		<lb/>and reflect, that our daughter is sufficient­

		<lb/>of her affection; I will throw no weight in
		<lb/>the scales against her. But take my advice,

	    <lb/>ly, and after many other subjects, they were
	    <lb/>anxious to know who would be the next
	    <lb/>president. They thought as <placeName>New-York</placeName> was
	    <lb/>the most flourishing state in the union, per­
	    <lb/>haps one might be selected. A gentleman soon
	    <lb/>entered their dinner parlour, from <placeName>Washing­

              <p>It was now a late hour; the gentlemen took

              <p>They all parted good friends; and the next
	    <lb/>day <persName>Miss Priscilla</persName> kept a look out for the
	    <lb/>Judge, thinking it most time for him to re­
	    <lb/>new his tender tale, which broke off so sud­
	    <lb/>denly when last they were together. The
	    <lb/>lawn was swept, the knocker cleaned, jum­

	    <lb/>house for his grand reception. <persName>Mrs. Clai­

	    <lb/><persName>Miss Evergreen</persName> her large paste ear-rings glit­
	    <lb/>tering like stars. The day being pleasant,
	    <lb/>they all took a walk in the lawn in front of
	    <lb/>the house, when towser began to bark, and
	    <lb/>the ladies saw approaching <persName>Judge Bridgefield</persName>,
	    <lb/>upon his large bay horse with a long tail al­
	    <lb/>most down to the ground, a fine sportsman's
	    <lb/>saddle, embroidered silver stirrups; in fact, he
	    <lb/>was gayly caparisoned.</p>

	      <lb/>be very interesting, as they criminate many
	      <lb/>not suspected.</said>

                <said>Oh, I think I will go also.</said>

	    <lb/>to any of my sex; but what a task it is to 
	    <lb/>please a man! I have witnessed so many
	    <lb/>conjugal broils, and more especially in old

	    <lb/>men—they are so peevish and obstinate, and
	    <lb/>so penurious in general, they will scarcely
	    <lb/>allow a pair of shoes to their wife, and many
	    <lb/>so extremely jealous you cannot leave them.
	    <lb/>What a state of perplexity I am in! 'Tis true,
	    <lb/>I have just sufficient to support me without
	    <lb/>being beholden to anyone; why then should
	    <lb/>I encumber myself with a husband? Per­
	    <lb/>haps his temper may be overbearing; and
	    <lb/>after we are united it will be too late to re­
	    <lb/>pent. I think I will call on <persName>Mrs. Claibourne</persName>
	      <lb/>and consult with her; she is my tried friend;
	      <lb/>we are connected also by the ties of blood;
	      <lb/>she will assuredly advise me for the best. I
	      <lb/>will hasten to her as I would to a mother,
	      <lb/>and will unbosom myself to her.</said> Just as she
	      <lb/>was in this reverie <persName>Mrs. Claibourne</persName> entered.</p>
              <p>
                <said>Why so melancholy, Coz?</said>
              </p>
              <p><said>I will just relate my feelings to you,</said><lb/>replied <persName>Miss Evergreen</persName>, <said>and the situation
	      <lb/>I am placed in. Our neighbour (you know
	      <lb/>who I mean) is to spend this evening with
	      <lb/>us; when last he was here (now do not tell
	      <lb/>your husband, for he knows nothing of the
<pb n="2019"/>

<mw type="pageNum">19</mw>
	      <lb/>business,) he declared himself my lover, and
	      <lb/>permitted me to reflect on it, and give him
	      <lb/>an answer. I never thought seriously of it
	      <lb/>until now; but as he is to be here this even­
	      <lb/>ing, I feel like a child that has not studied his
	      <lb/>lesson, and is to be called upon to rehearse it
	      <lb/>by his teacher, when alas! he knows it not.
	      <lb/>That is my situation, my friend; and what
	      <lb/>shall I say or do? Please to advise me, for
	      <lb/>I have always through life been guided by
	      <lb/>your good counsel; and now, in this impor­
	      <lb/>tant moment, leave me not to fate. You know
	      <lb/>my disposition better than I do myself—and
	      <lb/>what is to be done? Pray inform me, as it is
	      <lb/>now three o'clock, and short will be the time
	      <lb/>that I am to be arbitress of his destiny.</said></p>
              <p>
                <said>Well, my dear cousin, in such affairs how
	      <lb/>can you apply to me? Sure your own heart
	      <lb/>must be your prompter. If your neighbour
	      <lb/>has made any impression, my advice will not
	      <lb/>be taken. But, summing up your fortitude,
	      <lb/>ask yourself—do I love him who requires me
	      <lb/>to give my hand to him as a partner for life?
	      <lb/>For feeble woman wants a friend in her de­

              </p>
              <p>A loud rap at the door announced the

              <p><persName>Miss Priscilla</persName> entered the room in a careless

	    <lb/>gree of vivacity, not bordering on rudeness,
	    <lb/>and had a general knowledge of things which

	    <lb/>valued her own happiness, not to trifle with
	    <lb/>his, as time was too precious to let a moment
	    <lb/>pass unimproved. <said>Sir,</said> said she, <said>you
	      <lb/>have put me to a very severe trial, and I have
	      <lb/>not yet chosen counsel. I feel myself unable
	      <lb/>to speak; as the poet says,

              <p>
                <said>Let me, then, my fair tormentor, antici­
	      <lb/>pate your wishes—let me fold you to my bo­
	      <lb/>som, that pants as the fleeting deer while
	      <lb/>pursued in the chase. Excuse the compari­
	      <lb/>son, and let me depart triumphant and bless
	      <lb/>my better stars, and serenely hope you will
	      <lb/>be mine ere Sol again sinks to rest; let to­

              <p>She sunk in his arms, and gave him her
	    <lb/>hand in token of acquiescence, and he then
	    <lb/>exclaimed, <said>May time make us dearer to

              <p>So they took leave, and the next week
	    <lb/>was agreed upon for the celebration of their

              <p>They had an old family block, the oiling

                <p>In <placeName>New-York</placeName>, I am told, the first settlers

              <p>The day being pleasant, the Governor
	    <lb/>crossed the <placeName>Ohio</placeName>, and the sight of the hounds
	    <lb/>transported him; he hastened to the mansion
	    <lb/>of his friend, which was furnished with great
	    <lb/>taste. Some of the finest pictures of ancient
	    <lb/>and modern characters were hung in his
	    <lb/>drawing room. Among the number were
	    <persName>Saint Nicholas</persName>, the Dutch saint, and one of
	    <lb/>the great <persName>Van Tromp</persName>, the renowned Dutch
	    <lb/>admiral. The next was a representation of
	    <lb/><persName>General Washington</persName>, in the year <date when="1789">one thou­
	      <lb/>sand seven hundred and eighty-nine</date>, taking
	    <lb/>the oath of president in the old City Hall of
	    <lb/><placeName>New-York</placeName>, fronting <placeName>Wall-street</placeName>. The crowds
	    <lb/>of citizens that visited that metropolis were
	    <lb/>very numerous—a description of that import­
	    <lb/>ant event is not necessary. His figure was
	    <lb/>exalted; and his praise was echoed by
	    <lb/>thousands, similar to the present adoration
	    <lb/>paid to <persName>General La Fayette</persName>, our nation's
	    <lb/>guest. There were many more sublime
	    <lb/>things at that great event, which I shall not
	    <lb/>now describe—sufficient that the house was
	    <lb/>Gothic and grand.</p>
              <p><persName>Mrs. Prelude</persName>, whose character has been

	    <lb/>union with the Judge; and, if my readers
	    <lb/>have any recollection, it will be sufficient to
	    <lb/>know, that she has not lost any virtues she
	    <lb/>possessed, but in a great measure improved
	    <lb/>them since she has become a wife. It is a
	    <lb/>great encouragement to the rising generation
	    <lb/>that matrimony does not lessen the female
	    <lb/>character. On the contrary, if she meet her
	    <lb/>kindred soul, she improves as the smiling
	    <lb/>sprint by the refreshing showers.</p>
              <p>At length the gentlemen were all intro­
	    <lb/>duced to the Governor.</p>
              <p>This is the honourable <persName>Thaddeus Hodg­

	      <lb/>drained, the expense not regarding, to make
	      <lb/>it more healthy, for which he is continually
	      <lb/>imploring means to benefit the rising genera­
	      <lb/>tion; if it cannot now be accomplished, they
	      <lb/>will undoubtedly do it. He appears a gen­

	      <lb/>tleman <unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">of</unclear> domestic manners, and thinks a
	      <lb/>comfortable fireside preferable to foreign
	      <lb/>grandeur.</p>
              <p>The next is the honourable <persName>Cyrus Boun­

	      <lb/>penetrating character, always officious to
	      <lb/>drain his constituents for public institutions,
	      <lb/>such as jails, hospitals, and lunatic asylums.
	      <lb/>He seldom makes a motion in the house un­
	      <lb/>til he first obtains the opinion of his col­
	      <lb/>leagues, and then immediately his wishes are
	      <lb/>obtained as soon as applied for, having obtain­
	      <lb/>ed the yeas and nays before suggested. This
	      <lb/>saves much expense to the country, and like­
	      <lb/>wise shortens the session. After him I was
	      <lb/>introduced to the worthy <persName>Conrad Kriperstein</persName>.
	      <lb/>He was born in <placeName>Olmutz, Germany</placeName>, and is

	      <lb/>tain to perform all his promises, ever so tri­
	      <lb/>vial. The only time he ever spoke in <orgName>con­
		<lb/>gress</orgName> was when they wished to prohibit im­
	      <lb/>porting horses. He then felt warm; he loved
	      <lb/>these animals better than any of his family,

	      <lb/>why a man might not make money selling
	      <lb/>horses as well as any thing else, as that would

	      <lb/>For his part he fed his horses with the same
	      <lb/>grain he did his family, only a little difference

              <p>What a solace to the heart of man, at his

<mw type="pageNum">43</mw>
	    <lb/>reverend divine began some pertinent remarks
	    <lb/>to <persName>Miss Josephine</persName> and <persName>Miss Coriander</persName>, the
	    <lb/>two young ladies who, as I before observed,
	    <lb/>were not deficient in repartee. I had forgot
	    <lb/>to mention a young gentleman from <placeName>West
	      <lb/>Point</placeName>, a cadet, who was of the company at
	    <lb/>the nuptials; he was of the family of the
	    <lb/><name>Crawfords</name>, a relation of <persName>Mrs. Claibourne's</persName>,
	    <lb/>and had particularly distinguished himself in
	    <lb/>the art of arms—could go through all the
	    <lb/>evolutions with great exactness.</p>
              <p>The company being all assembled, the can­
	    <lb/>dles snuffed, and every one placed according to
	    <lb/>etiquette, the solemn ceremony commenced;
	    <lb/>when the bride was so overcome as to be en­
	    <lb/>tirely insensible for some minutes. Salts were
	    <lb/>applied, and she speedily recovered. The
	    <lb/>ceremony was but two-thirds over when the
	    <lb/>fainting took place; and I assure you, never
	    <lb/>such a sensation did I witness in such an
	    <lb/>assembly before; some thought she was dy­
	    <lb/>ing; however, she recovered. The divine
	    <lb/>thought it most prudent to delay the con­
	    <lb/>cluding of the ceremony until she was per­
	    <lb/>fectly recovered—the conclusion being more

	    <lb/>congenial to her feelings than the first part of
	    <lb/>it, where they promised to do so much for
	    <lb/>each other. To a mind like <persName>Miss Priscilla's</persName>,
	    <lb/>I am not surprised at the excitement it pro­
	    <lb/>duced. The latter part of the ceremony is
	    <lb/>so enchanting, no one would be affrighted at
	    <lb/>it. They were then solemnly pronounced
	    <lb/>man and wife; and the priest hoped she
	    <lb/>might be like <persName>Sarah</persName> and <persName>Rebekah</persName>, fruitful
	    <lb/>and obedient, in the name of the Father, &amp;c.</p>
              <p>The usual compliments passed; and, ac­
	    <lb/>cording to things agreed upon before, the
	    <lb/>happy couple, after tea and other refresh­
	    <lb/>ments, proceeded to the farm house about
	    <lb/>ten o'clock. The company amused them­
	    <lb/>selves with dancing to the melodious music
	    <lb/>of <persName>Toney</persName>, the village fiddler, who was dressed
	    <lb/>like <persName>Don Quixote</persName>, with a helmet, for the oc­
	    <lb/>casion; and this singular circumstance ex­
	    <lb/>cited more curiosity in the country around
	    <lb/>than all the other part of the entertainment,
	    <lb/>for every one in this country has heard of
	    <lb/><persName>Don Quixote</persName>; but never has he been personi­

              <p><persName>Miss Josephine</persName> shed tears at losing her

	    <lb/>her, as she was shortly going to leave them,

	    <lb/>her parents, at parting, that she would
	    <lb/>write as often as convenient, and give all the
	    <lb/>news of the day, such as the rise and fall of
	    <lb/>fashions, feasts public amusements, &amp;c. But
	    <lb/>the history she was going to give of the an­

	    <lb/>The company consisted of <persName>Madame Dampier</persName>

	    <lb/>It is not so lively as <placeName>New-York</placeName>, there are so ma­

	    <lb/>need not be any fear of trouble or riots; peace
	    <lb/>and good order prevail in their councils; profit
	    <lb/>and pleasure are their daily pursuits. The tra­

	    <lb/>to offend them, tell their butter or fish
	    <lb/>is not so good as in <placeName>New-York</placeName>, and the imme­

	    <lb/>manufactories, the beautiful reservoir of water
	    <lb/>at the head of <placeName>Market-street</placeName>, and the well or­
	    <lb/>dered police of the second city in the Union.
	    <lb/>Then their heads are puffed up and their bodies erect;

	    <lb/>such another disaster in the present generation.
	    <lb/>In order to give it publicity, there was a general

	    <lb/>opinionated gentry, and it was agreed among them
	    <lb/>that they would put up large handbills on all the
	    <lb/>aspin trees as a warning, as they shake when
	    <lb/>there is no wind. Pamphlets were printed in
	    <lb/>the confiscated, flourishing village of <placeName>Brooklyn</placeName>,
	    <lb/>setting forth the probable cause of the flight of
	    <lb/>this renowned farmer. His fame as an agricul­
	    <lb/>turalist had overtopped that of all his neighbours;
	    <lb/>and the approaching meeting of the <orgName>Horticultural
	      <lb/>Society</orgName> had so fired his mind with eagerness to
	    <lb/>present the first and best fruits of the earth, that
	    <lb/>previous to his departure he had not suffered his

	    <lb/>finements, and at the same time so humble, she
	    <lb/>would associate with any persons of inferior rank,
	    <lb/>if they were intelligent. In her person, she was
	    <lb/>tall and slender, and her face was an index of
	    <lb/>her mind, placid and serene. No interruption
	    <lb/>from her kind parents had ever prohibited her
	    <lb/>from making researches; and she was more hap­
	    <lb/>py in the society (if I may so call it) of the dead,
	    <lb/>than of the living; that is, in perusing the trials,
	    <lb/>troubles, and all the vicissitudes that this life is
	    <lb/>burdened with. In order to convince her friends

	      <lb/>ridiculed for ignorance, selfishness, and sordid
	      <lb/>manners; but who, on the contrary, from all the
	      <lb/>intelligence I have obtained, far surpa<unclear reason="damaged">ss</unclear> any of
	      <lb/>the human race. In the first place, they do not
	      <lb/>overload their minds with the intrigues and
	      <lb/>crim. con. speculations which the great <persName>Philips</persName>,
	      <lb/>by his eloquence, has in a great measure arrest­
	      <lb/>ed, by convincing the world that man and wife
	      <lb/>are one, and that there should be no more sepa­
	      <lb/>rate receiving of money; and the advice that he
	      <lb/>forcibly gives, is, <quote rend="post()">Let every good man stay at
		<lb/>home, when business will permit, and take care
		<lb/>of his inestimable treasure.</quote> These ancient peo­
	      <lb/>ple do not intermeddle with any affairs that will
	      <lb/>give their posterity trouble, and cause the heart
	      <lb/>to feel oppressed. I am now abridging some
	      <lb/>manuscripts that I hastily wrote; and I shall,

	      <lb/>It is nearly two miles from the first landing
	      <lb/>place, called <placeName>Gravesend</placeName>. Two hundred years
	      <lb/>since, the settlers took a course across the coun­
	      <lb/>try to <placeName>Tappaun</placeName> (that is the original name.) It
	      <lb/>has become known to the world in general as
	      <lb/>the place where <persName>Andre</persName>, the reputed spy, was
	      <lb/>executed. He was buoyed by the expectancy
	      <lb/>that the President would pardon him; however,
	      <lb/>it was not in his power—and <persName>Miss Seward</persName> wrote

<pb n="2063"/><milestone n="6(2)r" unit="sig"/><mw type="pageNum">63</mw><lb/>relations at the <placeName>Ohio</placeName>, then employed her pen in
	    <lb/>relating the many curious adventures the first
	    <lb/>setters met with, their patience, and resignations.</p>
              <p>While the family were at breakfast, they were
	    <lb/>called upon by a plain looking farmer from <placeName>Sus­
	      <lb/>sex</placeName>, by the name of <persName>Arnoldus Hackenberry</persName>,
	    <lb/>who had brought some beeswax and honey to
	    <lb/>market—had a keen appetite, the family being
	    <lb/>all seated at a stylish breakfast of fresh rolls,
	    <lb/>coffee, and mushrooms. They were a little con­
	    <lb/>fused, thinking he would devour all on the
	    <lb/>table; however, after some inquiries, and then a
	    <lb/>great deal of ceremony, he was invited to par­
	    <lb/>take, as they had added a beefsteak. The old
	    <lb/>farmer, after seating himself, began to hold his
	    <lb/>hat before his eyes, and returned thanks by a 
	    <lb/>short prayer; and then presented a letter from
	    <lb/>their parents at the <placeName>Pequest</placeName>.</p>
              <p><said>Pray, sir, what is the best news in your
	      <lb/>parts,</said> said <persName>Mr. Pettit</persName>. <said>All I can say is,
	      <lb/>we will have poor crops this year—the hessian
	      <lb/>fly is in the wheat, and the weevil in the corn;
	      <lb/>and the drought has hurt the potatoes—sad! sad

	      <lb/>indeed! How will the farmers live?</said> <said>They
	      <lb/>must all turn statesmen, and come to <placeName>New-
		<lb/>York</placeName>.</said> <said>I am sure,</said> said <persName>Hackenberry</persName>, <said>I
	      <lb/>should die drinking your water, it is so fever­
	      <lb/>ish.</said> <said>Not at all, for many have died because
	      <lb/>it is so cold.</said> The old farmer then gave a
	    <lb/>groan, which is customary with some old people
	    <lb/>after eating, they being apprehensive their food
	    <lb/>may not easily digest—and they all are alarmed
	    <lb/>at indigestion, as much as they are at prodigal­
	    <lb/>ity. He then mentioned, that if he could do any
	    <lb/>thing for them he was at their service, as he was
	    <lb/>going to leave them that day, it being town
	    <lb/>meeting next week, and he, being one of the
	    <lb/>overseers of the poor, must be at home if God
	    <lb/>spared him his life. He then took a walk up
	    <lb/><placeName>Broadway</placeName>, bowed to every person he met, heard
	    <lb/>music near the Park—and was induced to see
	    <lb/>the lion and lioness by giving a shilling; and he
	    <lb/>was so pleased, and his astonishment was so
	    <lb/>great, that he declared when he returned no
	    <lb/>sight in the city had so delighted him.</p>
              <p>The woman folks, as he called them, he
	    <lb/>thought were handsomer than in the country:—

	      <lb/>and I think they are all rich and happy.</said> <said>Not
	      <lb/>at all,</said> said <persName>Mr. Pettit</persName>; <said>on the contrary, those
	      <lb/>that you meet walking are many of them most
	      <lb/>miserable, and, generally speaking, have such
	      <lb/>wretched houses, that they saunter to make time
	      <lb/>pass agreeable—the females in particular. But
	      <lb/>matrimony is their grand object, and when they
	      <lb/>have secured the affection of some rich youth,
	      <lb/>they are fixed for ever.</said> <said>Is it possible that
	      <lb/>woman is so designing? In the country, if a
	      <lb/>man has a good farm, and two or more daugh­
	      <lb/>ters, on <name>Sunday</name> evening his house will be sur­
	      <lb/>rounded by young men to divide it, though it
	      <lb/>does not take place in years, yet hope is pleasing,
	      <lb/>even hope delayed—not in love, in wealth I
	      <lb/>mean. I now bid you farewell, my city friends,
	      <lb/>and I will relate to your parents, in <placeName>Sussex</placeName>, that

	    <lb/>said, <said xml:id="hackenberry2" rend="post()" next="#hackenberry3">is very fine, and a variety in
 it; for after
	      <lb/>you pass <placeName>Newark</placeName> to <placeName>Morristown</placeName>, you cross
	      <lb/><placeName>Schooley's Mountain</placeName>, famous at present for its
	      <lb/>medicinal springs; and then you pass <placeName>'Squire's
		<lb/>Point</placeName>, a mountain in form similar to a sugar-loaf.
	      <lb/>It is said the name originated from the following
	      <lb/>circumstance:</said></p>
              <p>
                <said xml:id="hackenberry3" prev="#hackenberry2">A few gentlemen, (Squires,) were on the top
	      <lb/>of this mountain, took some refreshment, and ha­
	      <lb/>ving drank freely, could not find their way down,
	      <lb/>and were compelled to stay all night, or until
	      <lb/>they were sober; and thus the name originated.
	      <lb/>From thence to <placeName>Mansfield</placeName> wood houses are found,
	      <lb/>a fine country, and continues so until you reach
	      <lb/>the house of <persName>Mr. Dexter</persName>, who, on the arrival of
	      <lb/>his friendly neighbour, was transported; joy was
	      <lb/>depicted in ever countenance, and all with one

	      <lb/>where I saw long faces with short beards—heard

	      <lb/>were there brought forward; all appeared unani­

	      <lb/>read, not worth attending to; plans formed for
	      <lb/>widening crooked streets, and emptying misers'
	      <lb/>pockets—All seem revived when any new plan
	      <lb/>was in operation, which affects either the living, or

              <p>I shall now acquaint my readers of the profi­
	    <lb/>ciency <persName>Miss Claibourne</persName> made in her narrative of
	    <lb/>the ancient <name>Dutch</name>. In her last letter she de­
	    <lb/>scribes the great confusion that took place on
	    <lb/><placeName>Long Island</placeName>, in looking for <persName>Mynheer Vander­
	      <lb/>donderbarrack</persName>, who had most unfeelingly, and
	    <lb/>unprecedentedly, ran away from his kind, ten­
	    <lb/>der, well-beloved wife <persName>Oraanche Clattertrap</persName>,
	    <lb/>who in silent sobs, it was thought, would melt
	    <lb/>away like honey in the comb.</p>
              <p>Public meetings were called in all the sur­
	    <lb/>rounding villages, to devise plans to prevent the
	    <lb/>like mishap again; and it was sincerely recom­
	    <lb/>mended by <persName>Nicacius de Silla</persName>, late fiscal of the
	    <lb/><placeName>Netherlands</placeName>, to all well-wishers of the tender
	    <lb/>sex, that they would in future pay a proper de­
	    <lb/>ference towards their husbands, as men in gene­
	    <lb/>ral; and particularly, the <name>Knickerbockers</name> insist

	    <lb/>crease of their best fat geese, which are served
	    <lb/>up to regale them as a remuneration for their
	    <lb/>good advice and peace offerings, the worthy fe­
	    <lb/>males were all seized, from <placeName>Wallabacht</placeName> to <placeName>Go­
	      <lb/>wawnes</placeName>, with a shivering coldness, when <persName>Oraan­
	      <lb/>che's</persName> fate was made known. They much feared,
	    <lb/>as times were so precarious, how soon it might
	    <lb/>be their own case, it having been an ancient and
	    <lb/>established custom among the old inhabitants of
	    <lb/><placeName>Long Island</placeName>, to do as your neighbours do, and
	    <lb/>they make it an invariable practice still.</p>
              <p><persName>Mr. Pettit</persName> called on <persName>Miss Claibourne</persName>, to know
	    <lb/>when she was again going to the museum, as he
	    <lb/>was promised some interesting manuscripts, for
	    <lb/>her immediate attention; she politely thanked
	    <lb/>him for his assiduity, and mentioned that it ap­
	    <lb/>peared to her in her researches, that the first in­
	    <lb/>habitants of <placeName>New-York</placeName> and <placeName>Long Island</placeName> were
	    <lb/>extremely attached to some particular minister
	    <lb/>of the gospel, as on all occasions he was con­
	    <lb/>sulted, and his advice strictly adhered to, he be­
	    <lb/>ing supposed to have their welfare at heart.—
	    <lb/>They were much bigoted to their own denomi­
	    <lb/>nation at their friendly meetings; but decency,

	    <lb/>decorum, and a degree of civility prevailed, that
	    <lb/>is not often to be found in the present day.—
	    <lb/>What mostly affected these good people, was
	    <lb/>seeing a tax-gatherer, for they were not often
	    <lb/>solicited for money, and generally the women at­
	    <lb/>tended to this call, as in those days they were al­
	    <lb/>ways to be found at home, seldom on the high
	    <lb/>road, only when going to church, visiting the
	    <lb/>sick, or attending the funeral of a friend or a
	    <lb/>neighbour; only these occasions called them out.</p>
              <p>Happy, happy days of comfort and delight!
	    <lb/>Oh, what blissful scenes then enlivened the ha­
	    <lb/>bitations of our ever to be remembered ances­
	    <lb/>tors! Oh, were they now to arise and behold
	    <lb/>their progeny aspiring after vain pursuits, while
	    <lb/>the charm of liberty is inflaming the minds of
	    <lb/>their children—to arise, and if possible snuff the
	    <lb/>moon! Such are the present times, which I
	    <lb/>shall not at present describe.</p>
              <p>I shall begin with the account of <persName>Guisboet
	      <lb/>Brice</persName>, a collector in <placeName>New-York</placeName>. He entered

	      <lb/>band that question,</said> replied she. <said>I always
	      <lb/>heard,</said> said he, <said>that the Dutch ladies take
	      <lb/>care of the cash, and that they are never known
	      <lb/>to speak an untruth, so I was directed to inquire
	      <lb/>of them.</said> Her name was <persName>Neiltie</persName>, she was very
	    <lb/>still, but very angry at such inquisitiveness; she
	    <lb/>thought that to tell a person you were rich, is a
	    <lb/>sure sign of a fool; so she told <persName>Guisboet</persName> he
	    <lb/>might find out. A great dispute arose, and

	    <lb/>door, which being attended to by one of the ser­
	    <lb/>vants: a gentleman inquired for <persName>Miss Josephine</persName>.
	    <lb/><said>She is not at home.</said> He replied, <said>I shall
	      <lb/>return in the evening.</said> He left his name—and
	    <lb/>called again. She was transported when she
	    <lb/>saw him. I need not mention the inquiries that
	    <lb/>were made; suffice it to say, that <persName>Miss Josephine</persName>
	    <lb/>amused her father all the evening with humorous
	    <lb/>stories that she had collected. One was of <persName>Yacup
	      <lb/>Vanderclip</persName>, who lived on a rock about four miles
	    <lb/>from <placeName>New-York</placeName>. It was customary in times 
	    <lb/>past for all the children, as they rode out of town,
	    <lb/>to point their finger and cry out to him. This
	    <lb/>singular character, it appears, left to his great-
	    <lb/>grand-children all the disputed property from
	    <lb/>the battery to the <placeName>Bridewell</placeName>, and it was so many
	    <lb/>years before they were to get possession that they
	    <lb/>entirely forgot it, not being blessed with good
	    <lb/>memories; and so it was now occupied by those
	    <lb/>who, as the saying is, keep it. So much for the 
	    <lb/>great and wise plans of the ancient inhabitants
	    <lb/>of the <placeName>New Netherlands</placeName>. Rather than their
	    <lb/>children should be made extravagant by leaving
	    <lb/>their property to them, they all wisely put their
	    <lb/>heads together and divided their estates among
<pb n="2073"/>

	    <lb/>the third generation. All the city is now terri­
	    <lb/>fied lest they should be ousted; many have not
	    <lb/>slept soundly for years; and all the old manu­
	    <lb/>scripts and records that have been raked up now
	    <lb/>are searched for, to afford the sons of science an
	    <lb/>opportunity to display their talents whenever
	    <lb/>they can take hold of any thing lawfully.</p>
              <p>She then indulged herself in her father's arms,
	    <lb/>and said—<said>O thou best and kindest of parents,
	      <lb/>how shall I in language paint my ardent feelings,
	      <lb/>and in what exquisite tone shall I raise my voice
	      <lb/>to hail thee, here in the bosom of that family
	      <lb/>that ages to come will venerate for protecting
	      <lb/>her who is searching and endeavouring to make
	      <lb/>known the inhabitants of this city—for very
	      <lb/>few inherit from their ancestors the pure unmixed
	      <lb/>blood.</said></p>
              <p>The time was approaching that her father
	    <lb/>must leave her—which he did, and left this im­
	    <lb/>pression on her mind:—Better be the admiration
	    <lb/>of a few discerning characters, whose opinion
	    <lb/>has weight, than shine like the comet's blaze.
	    <lb/>Her father at parting dropped a silent tear. She

	    <lb/>then hastened to view some manuscripts that she
	    <lb/>had slightly glanced over. Among the number
	    <lb/>was <persName>Volkirk Andriassa</persName>, a country schoolmaster
	    <lb/>from <placeName>Long-Island</placeName>, taken in the act of yawning
	    <lb/>while mending a pen, and who had nearly fallen
	    <lb/>from his high seat, where he always felt digni­
	    <lb/>fied and assumed unbounded authority. He was
	    <lb/>consulted, and his advice taken in all critical
	    <lb/>cases, such as a breach of a promise of marriage.
	    <lb/>He always interfered and prevailed upon the
	    <lb/>young main to renew his addresses, as woman,
	    <lb/>he said, was the weaker vessel, and if she had
	    <lb/>erred, he must forget and forgive. <said>God

	    <lb/>It was the first letter the lady ever penned; the

	    <lb/>Whatever she might have been in prose, I should,
	    <lb/>of all things, wish to see some of her poetical

		    <lb/>famous for great deeds, such as fishing, fowling,
		    <lb/>fighting, and many other pursuits not necessary
		    <lb/>to mention. He was a minister of the gospel,

		    <lb/>ignorance, as they are styled by our present wise,
		    <lb/>deceitful generation. In times past, sincerity
		    <lb/>was pictured on the countenance, and you could
		    <lb/>safely unbosom yourself to a friend; he would
		    <lb/>not deceive you; truth was in his expressions,
		    <lb/>and friendship was in his bosom. If the afflict­
		    <lb/>ing dispensations of Providence crossed you, you
		    <lb/>were sure to find a ready adviser.</p>
                    <p>How changed is the scene! In these days
		    <lb/>of pretended greatness, folly and pride stalk the
		    <lb/>streets, and look with envy on those who do
		    <lb/>well. In those ancient days families were united
		    <lb/>in silken bands, which, for strength, could not
		    <lb/>be broken; and the chains of wedlock could
		    <lb/>never be forgotten; time could not erase it.
		    <lb/>Look at the present thoughtless generation!—
		    <lb/>Every man now seeks wealth under the Hyme­

		    <lb/>depend on the acquisition he obtains in the part­

	      <lb/>bles, such as Van-der-don-der-bar-rack, whose
	      <lb/>character shall appear upwards of an hundred

	      <lb/>there resided a handsome young lady, of the
	      <lb/>name of <name>Middleswart</name>, who always, as a sure
	      <lb/>mark of distinction, wore a bright gold chain
	      <lb/>around her snowy neck, and was heiress of a

                <p>The young farmer, with his mind so impressed
	      <lb/>with the idea of his approaching happiness, bent
	      <lb/>his way to the residence of the young lady.—
	      <lb/>During his absence from home, his neighbours
	      <lb/>had various conjectures concerning him; some
	      <lb/>thought, as he was a busy man, he had gone to
	      <lb/><placeName>Albany</placeName> to apply for a bank; others thought he
	      <lb/>had gone to purchase wild land, in the hope that
	      <lb/>the canal would pass through them; however, he
	      <lb/>passed on, being bent on matrimony. He stop­
	      <lb/>ped at the <name>Cross Keys</name> in <placeName>New Brunswick</placeName>, a
	      <lb/>house kept by a very merry fellow, where he re­
	      <lb/>galed himself with a very hearty supper, and two
	      <lb/>glasses of flip; he then called for a clean bed:
	      <said>Yes, yes,</said> said <persName>Mannus</persName>, the landlord, <said>you
		<lb/>shall have a good bed of live feathers, and <unclear reason="damaged">my</unclear>
		<lb/>wife has been spinning a piece of blanketing,
		<lb/>just as long as <placeName>Raway Bridge</placeName>; I know it to be
		<lb/>true, for when bringing it from the weaver's, to
		<lb/>satisfy myself how long it was, I measured it,
		<lb/>and you may have it all over you if you please;</said>
	      <lb/>so they agreed, and he was conducted to the 
	      <lb/>chamber.</p>
                <p>Now, my dear <persName>Mrs. Claibourne</persName>, I have read

	      <lb/>a great part of <persName>Miss Josephine's</persName> history, and I
	      <lb/>shall continue to relate it. Early on <name>Sunday</name>
	      <lb/>morning, <persName>Everardus Vanderbrinckerhoff</persName> called for
	      <lb/>a basin of water and a clean napkin, which were
	      <lb/>handed him by the neat landlady herself; on one
	      <lb/>corner of the napkin the names of the husband
	      <lb/>and wife were flourished, to the great satisfac­
	      <lb/>tion of the owners, that such a valuable article
	      <lb/>should be preserved in a family. <persName>Everardus</persName>
	      <lb/>took out his pocket book, paid his bill, and has­
	      <lb/>tened away, just asking the nearest way to <persName>Hank

		<lb/>As there are two roads meet opposite their farm,
		<lb/>you must surely take but one, and that brings
		<lb/>you to <persName>Hank Middleswart's</persName>.</said> <said>Thank you, sir,
		<lb/>I wish you a good morning;</said> and then the gay
	      <lb/>youth rode off with flying colours, but forgot in
	      <lb/>the hurry of his mind, and took the wrong road;
	      <lb/>his anger rose for fear he should not be in time
	      <lb/>to secure the young lady's company before a rival
	      <lb/>should be there, she being a great belle; how­
	      <lb/>ever, he was in time, and arrived at the gate at
	      <lb/>4 o'clock, his horse pranced; and he dismounted
	      <lb/>with great activity. He knocked at the door, and
	      <lb/>the old gentleman, in his red cap, came himself,
	      <lb/>and shaking him by the hand, said,</p>
                <p>
                  <said>How do you do, sir?—how do you do?</said>

                <p>
                  <said>Why, only middling, sir; I always think it
		<lb/>safest to ride in the middle of the road, the horse
		<lb/>is not so apt to stumble; and if he should, you
		<lb/>would not be quite so topsy-turvyfied in fallen.</said>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <said>Pray, what news, young man, is there con­
		<lb/>cerning the lariff, or tariff, I heard <persName>Terence Mc­
		  <lb/>Dowdal</persName>, our great schoolmaster, read about? I am
		<lb/>told the great folks in <placeName>New-York</placeName> are quite
		<lb/>alarmed, especially the merchants; I think,
		<lb/>moreover, that <orgName>congress</orgName> are so wise they know
		<lb/>what is best, or they would not stay <unclear reason="damaged">so</unclear> long from
		<lb/>their loving wives and noisy children. I have

                </p>
                <p>Just as the old gentleman finished his soliloquy
	      <lb/><persName>Miss Cornelia Middleswart</persName> entered the room,

	      <lb/>great measure by this display of greatness.—
	      <lb/>I before observed, she held her head high, and
	      <lb/>made a very low courtesy, as low as possible—
	      <lb/>that was another mark of attention; the higher
	      <lb/>the head and the lower the body, the more
	      <lb/>pleased was the lady. And if perchance she
	      <lb/>should be too volatile, and could not refrain from
	      <lb/>showing the greatest civilities to her admirer,
	      <lb/>the mother would speak in a low voice, in broken
	      <lb/><name>English</name>, and say, <said>Swaight,</said> that is, <gloss>silence</gloss>;
	      <lb/>which startled the young lady, and she would
	      <lb/>be quite demure.</p>
                <p>When <persName>Miss Cornelia</persName> was seated, the old gen­
	      <lb/>tleman said, <said>Youngster, this is my second
		<lb/>daughter, and every one says she is the very
		<lb/>spawn of me—what is your opinion?</said> <said>Upon
		<lb/>my word, sir,</said> says the young man, <said>I have
		<lb/>not taken <unclear reason="damaged">sufficient</unclear> notice of her yet.</said> As I
	      <lb/>have before observed, <unclear reason="damaged">he</unclear> was a character rather
	      <lb/>singular—so cautious, for <unclear reason="damaged">fear</unclear> of giving offence;
	      <lb/>so prudent, for fear to alarm <unclear reason="damaged">you</unclear> and perfectly
	      <lb/>satisfied to keep his own secrets; <unclear reason="damaged">so</unclear> much so,
	      <lb/>that I am apprehensive that, should he <gap desc="unknown" reason="damaged" extent="2 letters"/> cap­
	      <lb/>tivated with <persName>Miss Cornelia</persName>, it would be an

	      <lb/>before he revealed it; and then she must first,
	      <lb/>by her plausibility, extract it as you would teeth,
	      <lb/>or she would never wrest it from him.</p>
                <p>The company being pleased with each
	      <lb/>other, they were all called to the tea table, which,
	      <lb/>for good things and friendly offers of them,
	      <lb/>could not be surpassed. The comfit, as it is
	      <lb/>called, which the wholesome, clean lady offered,
	      <lb/>was delicious; the apple pie and other dainties
	      <lb/>were excellent. The only disagreeable thing
	      <lb/>was too much solicitation to eat, and more to
	      <lb/>make you drink six or eight cups of tea. The
	      <lb/>signal when you have done is to cross the cup
	      <lb/>with your spoon; then, to show they are pleased
	      <lb/>with your company, you must always drink one
	      <lb/>more, or give offence.</p>
                <p>After tea the old gentleman left the room to
	      <lb/><persName>Miss Cornelia</persName> and her lover; it was a pleasant
	      <lb/>circumstance that he had no interruption by
	      <lb/>other company. When they were alone he
	      <lb/>hemmed and stammered, and said he liked <placeName>Rari­
		<lb/>ton</placeName> very much.</p>

                  <said>No, sir. Oysters, I hear, are the chief nou­

		<lb/>and the bells of the church ring to the tune of
		<lb/>Corra-malak and Supaun, (<gloss>Buttermilk and Su­
		  <lb/>paun</gloss>,) and speedily collect all the pious inhabit­
		<lb/>ants; and they, I am told, all raise their voices
		<lb/>to the highest pitch, old and young, bond and
		<lb/>free.</said>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <said>I think it singular, Miss, that a young lady
		<lb/>of your acquirements is not yet married; and if
		<lb/>I am not disagreeable, will be happy to have
		<lb/>your company this evening.</said>
                </p>
                <p>She bowed assent, and spoke not for five
		<lb/>minutes. Now being quite alone, and having
		<lb/>the pleasure of her company, <persName>Everardus</persName> began
		<lb/>his courtship. He thought her a lovely girl;
		<lb/>her cheek was like a peach, and the jet hair

		<lb/>with which her brow was adorned, was beautiful.
	      <lb/>Her teeth appeared neglected—the smallness of
	      <lb/>her mouth concealed them. He thus began:</p>
                <p>
                  <said>Could you, my dear girl, be happy, do you
		<lb/>think, to live at <placeName>Communipaw</placeName>?</said>
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                  <said>I hope you will, then, consider seriously of

                <p>
                  <said>I cannot promise what a day may bring

              <p>After <persName>Miss Josephine</persName> returned to her cousin's,

		  <lb/>ness of my life depends? I now have few cares,
		  <lb/>which I am able to bear; but when the scene is
		  <lb/>changed, and have a ruler over my conduct, I
		  <lb/>cannot say how I may brook it. I may become
		  <lb/>peevish and sullen by having too much care; and
		  <lb/>do you think you could submit to any whims
		  <lb/>that wedlock may ensnare me with?</said>—<said>O,
		  <lb/>certainly; if I continue in the same mind and
		  <lb/>opinion, I shall not readily contradict you.—
		  <lb/>So, say—will you consent to be mine? Every
		  <lb/>action of my life shall be to make you happy.</said>
	      <lb/>She blushed consent; and he left the room, and
	      <lb/>retired to bed, but could not sleep. In the morning
	      <lb/>he approached her, and begged she would name
	      <lb/>the day when they should be united. She begged
	      <lb/>him again to ask the old gentleman's consent,
	      <lb/>which he gave in a very pleasing manner, and in
	      <lb/>twenty days the marriage was to be solemnized.
	      <lb/>He hastily took leave, and returned home to pre­
	      <lb/>pare the house for her reception, and said he
	      <lb/>should see her in a few days. The house
	      <lb/>was neat and spacious, the fences in good order;
	      <lb/>the wagon was new painted and the garden wall
	      <lb/>cleaned—that was all that was necessary. He

	      <lb/>now thought it safe to inform his friend—for he
	      <lb/>had but one, and very few acquaintances; the
	      <lb/>most that visited him were his relations; that
	      <lb/>was customary, to keep up family distinctions.
	      <lb/>His friend was <persName>Derech Van Boskirk</persName>, a handsome
	      <lb/>young man, all pure nature, no artificial adorn­
	      <lb/>ments. He was son of the minister of the place;
	      <lb/>and there was a dignity in his appearance that
	      <lb/>exacted respect. His surprise was great when

              <p><persName>Miss Claibourne</persName> was quite demure at the

		<lb/>Emanuel Mantel</persName> was to give a succinct account
	      <lb/>of his family, birth, fortune and expectations.—
	      <lb/>He thus began:</p>
              <said rend="bestow((pre(“))(p))">
                <p>Ladies, you must excuse my manner of ex­
	      <lb/>pression.—In the early part of my life I lived in
	      <lb/><placeName>France</placeName>, though I was not born there; my fami­
	      <lb/>ly is from the <placeName>river Ibbervell</placeName>—my father was a
	      <lb/>physician, and I was intended for the study of
	      <lb/>law; but being an only son, my mother indul­
	      <lb/>ged me to such a degree that I could not be from
<pb n="2119"/>

<mw type="pageNum">119</mw>
	      <lb/>her a day. I was, notwithstanding, the most un­
	      <lb/>happy lad upon earth, and my father being what
	      <lb/>is called a hen-pecked husband, left all the man­
	      <lb/>agement of the family concerns to her; he would
	      <lb/>sometimes say, <said>I fear <persName>Lucian</persName> will be a block­
		<lb/>head.</said> <said>No, no,</said> she would reply, <said>he will
		<lb/>be wiser as he grows old, and be fond of stu­
		<lb/>dy.</said> On the contrary, the older I grew, the
	      <lb/>more indolent I became; and when I was in my
	      <lb/>eighteenth year, I lost my dear and kind mother.
	      <lb/>How shall I paint my feelings at that hour!—life
	      <lb/>lost all its relish, and every thing around appear­
	      <lb/>ed gloomy and sad. Then I mourned, and said
	      <lb/>within myself, what on earth can rend the heart
	      <lb/>more than grief. They say love will, but that
	      <lb/>I cannot admit; grief, excessive grief, and that
	      <lb/>for a good mother, is of all afflictions in this life,
	      <lb/>the most insupportable. I hope no future trou­
	      <lb/>bles, to which all on earth are subject, will ever
	      <lb/>make me so miserable again. My father, after
	      <lb/>a few days, accosted me one morning in the fol­
	      <lb/>lowing serious manner:</p>
                <p><said rend="pre(‘)post(’)">You are now, my son, deprived in a very

		<lb/>feel the poignant stroke; it gives a pang which
		<lb/>I cannot express. All my joy was in her, she
		<lb/>was nature's master-piece—all that was lovely in
		<lb/>woman—gentle, kind, forbearing, communica­
		<lb/>tive, intelligent, and every way favoured to please
		<lb/>and delight. Alas! my <persName>Anna</persName> is no more! But
		<lb/><unclear reason="damaged">we</unclear> must not embitter our future days by too
		<lb/>much grief, we must summon fortitude to our
		<lb/>aid.</said> Thus moralized my father, until we both
	      <lb/>silently left the room.</p>
                <p>My reflections became very painful to me. I
	      <lb/>began to think it full time for me to undertake
	      <lb/>something for myself; the study of the law re­
	      <lb/>quired time of which I had none to spare, and I
	      <lb/>had no inclination to be a physician. A thought
	      <lb/>struck me as I had an ear for music, and could
	      <lb/>play handsomely on the violin, that I would leave
	      <lb/>my father and depend on myself for a livelihood.
	      <lb/>This course appeared the more necessary, as I
	      <lb/>knew his circumstances to be slender; for dur­
	      <lb/>ing my mother's life, she could always so manage
	      <lb/>as to keep us decently without much expense.
	      <lb/>She being now called away, the only expedient
<pb n="2121"/>
<milestone n="11(1)r" unit="sig"/>
<mw type="pageNum">121</mw>
	      <lb/>I had now, was to apply myself to my violin
	      <lb/>whenever my father was called to see a patient,
	      <lb/>for I knew he would be mortified that I should
	      <lb/>fiddle for a living, we having been considered
	      <lb/>the most respectable family at <placeName>Ibberville</placeName>—though
	      <lb/>poor, the world knew it not, for we always kept up appearances, by the industry and good man­
	      <lb/>agement of my mother.</p>
                <p>After I had practiced every opportunity, in the
	      <lb/>absence of my father, I suggested to him one
	      <lb/>day the propriety of leaving him and seeking
	      <lb/>my fortune. My inclination he approved, <said>But,
		<lb/>my son,</said> said he, <said>what are you competent to
		<lb/>do?</said> <said rend="post()">Never mind, father, leave that to me—I
		<lb/>shall not disgrace you by my attempt; only per­
		<lb/>mit me to leave you next week. I shall get my
		<lb/>trunk in readiness; and I have plenty of apparel,
		<lb/>all in good order. I shall proceed to the <placeName>Sciota</placeName>,
		<lb/>as I have a good friend there, a relation of my
		<lb/>mother's, and I shall write you by every con­
		<lb/>veyance, the success of my undertaking. Nay,
		<lb/>do not object, dear father; I know your affection
		<lb/>for me is so great that you would wish me in

		<lb/>stow. I have no reason at present to expect any
		<lb/>great affair, at my first setting out in life; but I
		<lb/>shall, if I exert myself, (for it is always the case
		<lb/>in a new country,) rise, and then it will afford
		<lb/>you pleasure.</said></p>
                <p>My father's countenance changed, and he
	      <lb/>looked with astonishment at me, and listened to
	      <lb/>my resolutions and buoyant expectations, and
	      <lb/>then replied:</p>
                <p>
                  <said rend="pre(‘)post(’)">I shall never oppose such excellent senti­
		<lb/>ments as seem to inspire you; all I hope is that
		<lb/>your wishes may be realized. Go, my son<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">;</unclear>
		<lb/>and may fortune smile upon your undertaking.
		<lb/>But ever bear in mind the example of your mo­
		<lb/>ther's virtues; and if a thought should enter
		<lb/>your mind derogatory of honour, think on her
		<lb/>that bore you.</said>
                </p>
                <p>After all things were prepared I left my
	      <lb/>father's house at <placeName>Ibberville</placeName>, which, though not
	      <lb/>magnificent, was his own. It was situated in a
	      <lb/>vale; the garden was laid out in serpentine
	      <lb/>walks, and tulips, pinks, roses, and daisies

	      <lb/>pleased the eye; and when our friends paid us a
	      <lb/>visit, my father and mother both delighted to
	      <lb/>show their fine garden, and described most plea­
	      <lb/>santly every shrub and flower, and its virtues and
	      <lb/>fragrance. I recollect his sending a pot of
	      <lb/>flowers as a present to the Viceroy of <placeName>Mexico</placeName>;
	      <lb/>and every rare plant that he could obtain he
	      <lb/>would raise, and present it to some great charac­
	      <lb/>ter. By that means he obtained the name of
	      <lb/>the best man at <placeName>Ibberville</placeName>. My mother was not
	      <lb/>quite so generous; her good qualities were, to
	      <lb/>first take care of her own family.</p>
                <p>The day arrived on which I was to depart
	      <lb/>to the <placeName>Sciota</placeName> river; and when I advanced to
	      <lb/>take leave, my father fell lifeless on the floor, his
	      <lb/>emotion and tenderness were so great. The old
	      <lb/>family servant snatched him in his arms, and
	      <lb/><persName>Doll</persName>, the cook, screamed with the gridiron in her
	      <lb/>hand, and would not put it down—all was con­
	      <lb/>fusion. After a few moments my father re­
	      <lb/>covered, and we parted. He gave me a sum
	      <lb/>of money, exceeding what I expected. I sup­
	      <lb/>pose my mother had it, and he thought, in
	      <lb/>honour of her memory, he must give it to me.

	      <lb/>I assure you it was a great pleasure to my weary
	      <lb/>mind, that thought of nothing but making mo­
	      <lb/>ney, like many other of God's creatures, but
	      <lb/>knew not which way to begin.</p>
                <p>All great enterprises must be begun; many
	      <lb/>a well-bred man consoles himself with pleasant
	      <lb/>ideas of what he is going to do—of the thousands
	      <lb/>he is going to make; and yet year after year he
	      <lb/>is no richer—only lives with the hope of better
	      <lb/>days.</p>
                <p>On my arrival at the <placeName>Sciota</placeName>, the first thing
	      <lb/>I thought necessary was to conceal my name,
	      <lb/>and the place I came from, for fear it would
	      <lb/>bring my father's gray hairs with sorrow to the
	      <lb/>grave, if he thought I was to be either a music or
	      <lb/>dancing master, both which I excelled in. For
	      <lb/>(I assure you, ladies, that I speak the truth) there
	      <lb/>was not a thing on earth that I was sufficient
	      <lb/>master of, except these two things. To be sure,
	      <lb/>I might have turned dentist, as many have done,
	      <lb/>and have broken the jaw bones of asses, like
	      <lb/><persName>Sampson</persName>; but harmony was my determination.
	      <lb/>So I called myself <persName>Victor Bicker</persName>, that being so

	      <lb/>uncommon a name I should find none claim rela­
	      <lb/>tionship, and I ventured to give a concert—got
	      <lb/>acquainted with all the musical characters of
	      <lb/>the place, and particularized by playing solo
	      <lb/>on the violin. <persName>Mrs. Monckton</persName> was to play on
	      <lb/>the piano-forte; <persName>Miss Nuremberg</persName> on the guitar,
	      <lb/>as that is now quite fashionable; and the full
	      <lb/>band, by <persName>Halenburg</persName>. The evening was fine—
	      <lb/>we had a full house. I began with the fiddle.
	      <lb/>As it was supposed I had just arrived from <placeName>Paris</placeName>,
	      <lb/>I met with great applause; and though I was
	      <lb/>sensible they were no judges of music, yet, such
	      <lb/>is the weakness of the human mind, I was grati­
	      <lb/>fied with their applause. All the satisfaction
	      <lb/>that arose in my mind was, that I was in the road
	      <lb/>to wealth, and one purse and one heart we mu­
	      <lb/>sicians enjoy.</p>
                <p>The day after the concert I advertised for
	      <lb/>scholars, having just arrived from <placeName>Paris</placeName>. It was
	      <lb/>some days before any application was made. The
	      <lb/>first was <persName>Colonel Fitzpatrick</persName>; he had two sons;
	      <lb/>and the eldest being fond of music, he thought
	      <lb/>he would indulge him—called on me to know
	      <lb/>my terms. I told him, a guinea entrance, and

	      <lb/>twenty-five dollars for three months. He was
	      <lb/>willing I should begin with him on <name>Tuesday</name>,
	      <lb/>which I did. He was rather slow at first;
	      <lb/>however, by perseverance, he improved.</p>
                <p>I then undertook to teach dancing, and was
	      <lb/>very successful. All that made me unhappy,
	      <lb/>was, that I knew I was a deceiver, as I had never
	      <lb/>been to <placeName>Paris</placeName>. It was my necessities compelled
	      <lb/>me to deceive, in order to obtain support. My
	      <lb/>next consideration was, to form some plan to
	      <lb/>write to my father, as I knew it would give him
	      <lb/>pleasure to know that I was making money. I
	      <lb/>had no ambition to more than a living until his
	      <lb/>death, when I knew I should have a competency
	      <lb/>at <placeName>Ibberville</placeName>. I wrote him, and dated my letter—
	      <lb/><said rend="pre(‘)post(’)"><placeName>Succasunny Plains</placeName>, <placeName>New-Jersey</placeName>,
<placeName>Morris county</placeName><lb/>—to the care of <persName>'Squire Norcross</persName>,</said> who had a 
	      <lb/>relation boarded in the same house at <placeName>Sciota</placeName>
	      <lb/>with me. He planned it for me to deceive my
	      <lb/>father, and not to let him or any other of my
	      <lb/>relations know I was a music and dancing
	      <lb/>master.</p>
                <p>Every leisure moment I applied to the im­

	      <lb/>provement of myself—thought very little of the
	      <lb/>attention that was necessary to improve my
	      <lb/>scholars; all that I was particular in, was exactly
	      <lb/>dating the lessons I gave, and every week sum­
	      <lb/>ming up my accounts, to know what I was to
	      <lb/>receive, as my pupils were all of the richest
	      <lb/>families.</p>
                <p>After I wrote to my father, I received a let­
	      <lb/>ter from him in eight weeks from the date of
	      <lb/>mine. I was not happy—he begged me to be
	      <lb/>more particular in my next, what business I was
	      <lb/>in. I thought I would wait a reasonable time, and
	      <lb/>then write I was a broker and bought uncurrent
	      <lb/>notes, and had met with a friend. So, upon
	      <lb/>reflections, I began to think the dreadful conse—
	      <lb/>quences of untruth. I had begun to deceive the
	      <lb/>best of fathers, through pride; and now I was
	      <lb/>wrecked to invent probabilities to strengthen my
	      <lb/>first suggestions.</p>
                <p>In the second letter from my father, he men­
	      <lb/>tioned to me that, as he was so suddenly deprived
	      <lb/>of my mother, and my soon following her, and
	      <lb/>being left alone, he had been so fortunate as to
<pb n="2128"/>

<mw type="pageNum">128</mw>
	      <lb/>become acquainted with a widow of some pro­
	      <lb/>perty at the <placeName>Chickaswaw Bluffs</placeName>. Her husband
	      <lb/>was interpreter to the <name>Indians</name>, and accumulated
	      <lb/>wealth. She had an only daughter, whose
	      <lb/>manners were entirely uncultivated, whom she
	      <lb/>intended to send to <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> for her improve­
	      <lb/>ment, being fourteen years of age. Her name
	      <lb/>was <persName>Orra</persName>; her countenance was lovely, with a
	      <lb/>penetrating black eye—quite reserved in her
	      <lb/>manners. After a short acquaintance, my father
	      <lb/>wrote me that, being so lonely, he had proposed
	      <lb/>marriage to <persName>Mrs. Blacklock</persName>, which she had
	      <lb/>accepted; and they are to be married next
	      <lb/>month. I suppose my father will then remove to
	      <lb/>the <placeName>Chickasaw Bluffs</placeName>, and let me have possession
	      <lb/>of the estate, though small, at <placeName>Ibberville</placeName>.</p>
                <p>I shall forbear, ladies, to be tedious in my
	      <lb/>narrative; suffice it to say, that after making as
	      <lb/>much as I thought sufficient to go to <placeName>New-York</placeName>,
	      <lb/>I would try to get in some respectable situa­
	      <lb/>tion, though I was confident I could not keep it,
	      <lb/>so that I might then with truth inform my father,
	      <lb/>and prepare to return to <placeName>Ibberville</placeName>. Just as

	      <lb/>you would call men of propriety—I always en­

	      <lb/>the corporation burthened them with, for public

              <p>After he left the room, I cannot describe my

	    <lb/>to me, which he forbore to hint until the moment
	    <lb/>he left me; I cannot say that his words were of­

	      <lb/>case. On my return, I will particularize every

	      <lb/>and bless my better stars that so much bliss has
	      <lb/>been laid in store for me, though quite unworthy.
	      <lb/>Now, I pray, let your <name>Knickerbocker</name> be laid
	      <lb/>aside, and think only of him who, in all the

	      <lb/>make life easy to you, and, if possible, strew
	      <lb/>your morning walks with rose-buds of delight.
	      <lb/>I leave you, my angelic Miss, to your own reflec­
	      <lb/>tions; and think, devoutly think on him who is
	      <lb/>always the same, and does not delight to trifle
	      <lb/>away the few moments that are given us in this

              <p>To the great surprise of the <name>Pettit</name> family,
	    <lb/>and the amazement of <persName>Miss Josephine</persName>, her father
	    <lb/>arrived from <placeName>Zainesville, Ohio,</placeName>, to fetch his
	    <lb/>daughter. In vain did she assure him she had
	    <lb/>not finished her writing. He mentioned that he
	    <lb/>thought her mother was in a decline, and that
	    <lb/>she wished, of all things, to see her; and he,
	    <lb/>being apprehensive that she, perhaps, would not
	    <lb/>live a month, had hastened to <placeName>New-York</placeName>, and
	    <lb/>could not possibly stay more than one day, and
	    <lb/>had engaged his and his daughter's passage.
	    <lb/>The family were all astonished, but did not men­
	    <lb/>tion a word of the young lady's love. She im­
	    <lb/>mediately made preparation for her departure,
	    <lb/>not omitting to write to <placeName>Croton</placeName> how she was un­
	    <lb/>expectedly called away, and that to see the last
	    <lb/>moments of her tender mother, and he knew how
	    <lb/>to pity her. She mentioned it would be unne­

	    <lb/>cessary for him to follow her on such a long
	    <lb/>journey—she would write him every particular
	    <lb/>under cover of her cousin, <persName>Mrs. Pettit</persName>, and give
	    <lb/>him directions where he should direct to her, as
	    <lb/>she knew her father's stern manner, who, she
	    <lb/>was certain, would never consent to her marriage
	    <lb/>until she was older. She was perfectly acquaint­
	    <lb/>ed with his sentiments with respect to early
	    <lb/>marriages, which he abhorred, as young ladies
	    <lb/>did not know, until they arrived at years of dis­
	    <lb/>cretion, what a vast number of attentions were
	    <lb/>necessary to secure the affections of a husband.
	    <lb/>Every look of a woman, after marriage, becomes
	    <lb/>of consequence; every word must be studied, for
	    <lb/>fear it may admit two meanings, and the ten­
	    <lb/>der husband may misconstrue the real one.</p>
              <p>How hard is the lot of woman! Pain, care,
	    <lb/>and anxiety for the good of her family, over­
	    <lb/>whelm her! And if, unfortunately, she is linked
	    <lb/>to an ignorant usurper, what is then her lot!—
	    <lb/>Pining discontent, and black despair! Her vivid
	    <lb/>looks vanish; she sinks into some fatal malady;
	    <lb/>and knows not what method to take to please
	    <lb/>him who never will be pleased. She then passes

	    <lb/>her days in indifference; he becomes vexed, and
	    <lb/>flies to the company of bacchanalians for an hour
	    <lb/>of recreation and forgetfulness; his children be­
	    <lb/>come neglected; and when he returns home at a
	    <lb/>late hour, reproaches are the entertainment till
	    <lb/>Somnus closes his eyes. And on the morrow it
	    <lb/>is all as a dream, only his pockets are rifled of
	    <lb/>what would be sufficient to support the family
	    <lb/>the next day. Then economy is the burthen of
	    <lb/>the song; and what has been spent in folly must
	    <lb/>be saved, at the risque of the children's health;
	    <lb/>for it is a solemn truth, that good, wholesome
	    <lb/>food prevents sickness, and drives away the doc­
	    <lb/>tor, the nurse, and the sexton.</p>
              <p>How many have lost their health by abstemi­
	    <lb/>ousness! Many a tender female, for fear of be­
	    <lb/>coming gross and vulgar, will not eat meat,

              <p><persName>Governor Claibourne</persName> left his wife in the care

              <p>On the journey home the father and daughter
	    <lb/>were quite sad; nothing could enliven them,
	    <lb/>though they met with good company in the
	    <lb/>steam boats, and fine feasting, with a particular
	    <lb/>imitation of grandeur. A person, for a short
	    <lb/>time, in the steam boats lives like a king; and
	    <lb/>the cabin, so exquisitely furnished, makes him
	    <lb/>full of importance. How soon the scene changes!
	    <lb/>A man returns to his home—his wife, perhaps
	    <lb/>in her night cap and morning gown, scolding the
	    <lb/>servants for letting the cat eat the cream. What
	    <lb/>a change a few hours make! All things in
	    <lb/>this life pass away as a dream, and there is no­
	    <lb/>thing sure, only death—that is certain. But

	    <lb/>care.</p>
              <p>During the absence of the Governor for his
	    <lb/>daughter, <persName>Mrs. Claibourne's</persName> life was despaired

	    <lb/>all around—the knocker tied with linen, which
	    <lb/>startled <persName>Josephine</persName>; however, she hurried in, and
	    <lb/>the sight of her mother, though near death, was
	    <lb/>satisfactory to her. She silently gazed on her
	    <lb/>dear daughter, and made signs to embrace her,
	    <lb/>but could not rise. <persName>Mrs. Bridgefield</persName> was over­
	    <lb/>whelmed with joy to see her dear cousin once
	    <lb/>more, and assisted the servant to raise <persName>Mrs.
	      <lb/>Claibourne</persName>; but she was too weak to make any
	    <lb/>effort; she sunk again into her bed, and could
	    <lb/>scarcely speak. Her daughter embraced her
	    <lb/>after she spoke a little, when her husband en­
	    <lb/>tered the room. He clasped her hand in his,
	    <lb/>and poured out the following ejaculations:—</p>
              <p>
                <said>Great Disposer of Events, grant, I beseech
	      <lb/>thee, that my beloved partner may rise once

	      <lb/>Mercifully Great Omnipotent, restore her once
	      <lb/>more to her dejected family, who will praise

              <p>He then retired, and <persName>Mrs. Bridgefield</persName> gave her
	    <lb/>a little tamarind water to drink—she could
	    <lb/>eat nothing—and observed that she had poor
	    <lb/>hopes of her recovery. The doctor then entered
	    <lb/>the room, and, keeping a profound silence, which
	    <lb/>always discovers skill, shook his head and went
	    <lb/>away—made no remarks. <persName>Mrs. Bridgefield</persName> took
	    <lb/>this as an unfavourable omen; <persName>Miss Josephine</persName>
	    <lb/>shed tears; and it was an unhappy family. She
	    <lb/>survived but a few days. She begged to see the
	    <lb/><persName>Rev. Mr. Sampson</persName>, and he prayed with her and
	    <lb/>for her, from the following words:—<said>Blessed
	      <lb/>are the dead that die in the Lord, for their
	      <lb/>works do follow them.</said> She continued a few
	    <lb/>days, and the day before her death she was ap­
	    <lb/>parently better. She called <persName>Josephine</persName> to her
	    <lb/>bed, and thus addressed her:—</p>
              <p>
                <said>Weep not for me, for I go, I trust, to the
	      <lb/>place of my Redeemer, where you will, sooner
	      <lb/>or later, follow me. Comfort your father, and
	      <lb/>be to him both me and yourself; and I hope that
	      <lb/>as reason ascends in your mind; you will pre­

	      <lb/>morning song to praise your Redeemer; and
	      <lb/>remember, in this life there is nothing desirable
	      <lb/>but the love of God.</said>
              </p>
              <p><persName>Miss Josephine</persName> said to her mother, as she had
	    <lb/>always endeavoured to obey her, she should, in
	    <lb/>a particular manner, strive to follow her advice—
	    <lb/>and left the room; when she dozed a little, and
	    <lb/>they left the nurse waiting on her.</p>
              <p>Just as they entered the drawing room, <persName>Judge
	      <lb/>Bridgefield</persName> arrived to fetch his wife, but they
	    <lb/>could not remove her, as the doctor said she
	    <lb/>would not live two days; he consented to let her
	    <lb/>remain, and returned home. The family were
	    <lb/>all in commotion, preparing for the sad event,
	    <lb/>which finally took place. She died without a
	    <lb/>struggle, in the forty-second year of her age,
	    <lb/>leaving <persName>Josephine</persName> under the particular care of
	    <lb/><persName>Mrs. Bridgefield</persName>.</p>

	    <lb/>himself to patience, for he was assured of her
	    <lb/>partiality, and had only to await the event of
	    <lb/>time. He very soon established himself in busi­
	    <lb/>ness, as he had now some inducement, and was
	    <lb/>very assiduous to make money; in a day or
	    <lb/>two he got his letter, and was perfectly recon­
	    <lb/>ciled to his doom. After a few weeks, <persName>Mr. Pet­
	      <lb/>tit</persName> received a letter with the melancholly account
	    <lb/>of the death of <persName>Mrs. Claibourne</persName>, and <persName>Miss Jo­
	      <lb/>sephine</persName> being under the care of her cousin; he
	    <lb/>was now convinced that he should see her in a
	    <lb/>few months, and should endeavour by all indus­
	    <lb/>trious means to make money. He had received
	    <lb/>a letter from his father, giving him an account of
	    <lb/>his marriage with the widow of the Indian In­
	    <lb/>terpreter, at the <placeName>Chickasaw Bluffs</placeName>, and having
	    <lb/>sent her daughter to boarding school at <placeName>Phila­
	      <lb/>delphia</placeName>, and that he intended to remove to the
	    <lb/><placeName>Bluffs</placeName>, as the practice of physic was his business,
	    <lb/>he would obtain wealth.</p>
              <p>However, that was not named; as she was a
	    <lb/>lady of property, and much esteemed him, the
	    <lb/>place at <placeName>Ibberville</placeName> would ere long be for his benefit.

	      <lb/>when I again behold her, nothing shall separate
	      <lb/>us, father, cousin, friend, nor relation—she must
	      <lb/>be mine—we are destined for each other. Wel­

	    <lb/>she had an opportunity of seeing all the young

	    <lb/>son, just from <placeName>Washington City</placeName>, where he had
	    <lb/>been studying law; he was an elegant youth, of
	    <lb/>engaging manners, and polite address, seeing
	    <lb/><persName>Miss Josephine</persName> standing, he rose and made her a
	    <lb/>seat from the branches of trees that were near,
	    <lb/>for which she returned him many thanks. He
	    <lb/>never left her during the sermon, and on her get­
	    <lb/>ting into the carriage, he asked the favour to ac­
	    <lb/>company her home, which she could not refuse
	    <lb/>him. <persName>Judge Bridgefield</persName> treated him very kind­
	    <lb/>ly, and <persName>Miss Claibourne</persName> entertained him with
	    <lb/>the manners of the ladies of <placeName>New-York</placeName>, who, she
	    <lb/>observed, <said rend="pre()">had all the accomplishment necessary
	    <lb/>to adorn the female character, and a disposition

	    <lb/>ed <persName>Miss Josephine</persName> to take a little ramble in the
	    <lb/>neighbourhood to see the peasants, which she
	    <lb/>cheerfully did, and in rising a little summit, he

              <p>

	    <lb/>politeness she was capable of toward the lawyer,
	    <lb/>said his conversation and sentiments were un­
	    <lb/>expected to her—begged him to discontinue the
	    <lb/>subject, as her mother's death had banished every
	    <lb/>passion but grief from her mind, and that she
	    <lb/>must indulge for some time yet. He seemed
	    <lb/>unhappy, and in extacy exclaimed,</p>
              <p>
                <said>I shall always love you, in sorrow or in joy;
	      <lb/>my passion is not to be subdued by grief—death
	      <lb/>only can ease me; and if I am not suffered to
	      <lb/>hope, I must fly to some remedy. I cannot en­
	      <lb/>dure so much misery.</said>
              </p>
              <p>She seemed panic-struck, and thought it best
	    <lb/>not to fill him with vain hope, for her heart was
	    <lb/>gone, <persName>Mantel</persName> had it; so she began in a mild,
	    <lb/>soothing manner, to lament his misplaced affec­
	    <lb/>tion:—<said>Sir, I must, though painful the task, as­
	      <lb/>sure you, that my heart is not at my own dis­
	      <lb/>posal; I have left it in care of a person, whom
	      <lb/>I thought deserved the confidence; and when
	      <lb/>time shall elapse, and my inclination lead me, I

              <p>They both quickly returned to the house, but
	    <lb/>in perfect silence, and were met in the hall by
	    <lb/>the good lady, who observed they looked gloomy;
	    <lb/>(for they could not hide their chagrin,) she hand­
	    <lb/>ed them some refreshments and wine—he gave
	    <lb/>the following toasts:</p>
              <p>
                <said>May the hope of happiness, that is now the

              </p>

              <p>
                <said>May no disappointments that you may have

              <p>The Counsellor took leave of the polite family,
	    <lb/>assuring them he should again see them. <persName>Miss
	      <lb/>Josephine's</persName> situation can be better felt than de­
	    <lb/>scribed. Her father, who had been travelling,
	    <lb/>returned to <persName>Mrs. B.'s</persName>, and they spent a few days
	    <lb/>together. <persName>Judge B.</persName> brought a letter from the
	    <lb/>post-office to <persName>Miss Josephine</persName>; it was what she
	    <lb/>expected, and enclosed an epistle from her friend
	    <lb/>and lover, who made sad complaints of the tedi­
	    <lb/><choice><sic>di</sic><corr/></choice>ousness of time, how many vibrations before
	    <lb/>the clock struck ten, for that was the hour he
	    <lb/>always wished for, and then he thought he could
	    <lb/>dream something agreeable.</p>
              <p>The critical moment had now arrived, when
	    <lb/>she must make known to her father her
	    <lb/>solemn intention. <said>Oh—how shall I reveal it
	      <lb/>to him? His tender heart, I know, feels
	      <lb/>for me; and he now wants to part with me.
	      <lb/>When he comes to reflect that I shall have
	      <lb/>a protector, he will forget his feelings, to the
	      <lb/>gratifying of my own. To-morrow—oh, to-

	      <lb/>morrow will I address him, and, in the ful­
	      <lb/>ness of my heart, exclaim,—my hand is promised
	      <lb/>to another, and, my respected, indulgent, kind
	      <lb/>parent, forgive me my attachment—you shall
	      <lb/>never have cause to mourn for my intentions.</said></p>
              <p>Just as she was in this soliloquy, some of the
	    <lb/>neighbours called to spend the evening. Among
	    <lb/>the number were <persName>Rev. Mr. Fantorn</persName> and
	    <lb/>lady, who came to commiserate with the father
	    <lb/>and daughter, for their late loss. The old divine
	    <lb/>began in the following manner to comfort
	    <lb/>them:—<said rend="pre()">The Lord hath given, and he hath taken
	      <lb/>away: blessed be his name;</said> and his kind help­
	    <lb/>mate said, <said>The clay is in the hands of the pot­
	      <lb/>ter, and he moulds and fashions it agreeably to his
	      <lb/>divine will.</said>—<said>True, indeed,</said> said the Gover­
	    <lb/>nor; <said>we must submit to the will of him who
	      <lb/>governs the world by his omnipotent power; and
	      <lb/>we must, like <persName>Job</persName>, patiently bear the ills of life.</said>
	    <lb/>After <persName>Judge B.</persName> and lady entered, the conversation
	    <lb/>became more lively, and the kind offers of wine
	    <lb/>cake, and cordials, seemed to enliven the priest
	    <lb/>and his spouse. A sumptuous dinner was served
	    <lb/>up in style, at the head of which was a sirloin
<pb n="2155"/>

<mw type="pageNum">155</mw>
	    <lb/>of beef, and cabbage, and a fine fat pig, nicely
	    <lb/>crisped and browned. The Reverend Divine
	    <lb/>smacked his lips, and said that he thought good
	    <lb/>eating and drinking was the most desirable thing
	    <lb/>in life. His wife interrupted him, and said she
	    <lb/>thought good health was more. He said, —
	    <lb/><said>How can you have good health, if you live
	      <lb/>poor? The blood becomes impoverished; and
	      <lb/>half the deaths by consumption are on account of
	      <lb/>their abstemiousness, and stinting children, to
	      <lb/>make them wise and meek. I by no means
	      <lb/>commend gluttony; that is odious; but to have
	      <lb/>good food and thankful hearts, is a great bless­
	      <lb/>ing: so says <persName>Solomon</persName>, the wise.</said></p>
              <p>The friendly party enjoyed themselves, talk­
	    <lb/>ing over every dish, which seemed to give a
	    <lb/>double relish; and the Reverend Divine and his
	    <lb/>lady feasted to their mutual satisfaction, tasting
	    <lb/>every dish. In the evening they returned to
	    <lb/>their comfortable homes, leaving the family as
	    <lb/>much pleased when they absented themselves,
	    <lb/>as when they came.</p>

	      <lb/>what I am going to communicate will in no

	      <lb/>When will you reflect, and tell me your mind on
	      <lb/>the subject so near my heart?</said> He stood aghast;
	    <lb/>surprise, indignation, and horror, seemed to fill
	    <lb/>his mind, which was almost bursting. He cried
	    <lb/>out,—<said xml:id="bridgefield1" rend="post()" next="#bridgefield2">Unthinking girl, to serve me so! me, that

	      <lb/>whose early inhabitants were men of goodness,
	      <lb/>wisdom, and piety; they panted not for liberty—

	      <lb/>mark, so expressly <choice><sic>b</sic><corr>f</corr></choice>orbidden in the Old and
	      <lb/>New Testament. Much I fear that these cries
	      <lb/>for liberty (for many, very many, have no pro­
	      <lb/>perty) only mean a desire to be great, to be busy,
	      <lb/>to be inquisitive, to know what is in the banks,
	      <lb/>in order to tax the usurer, whose waking dreams
	      <lb/>teach him only the rule to multiply, to take from

	    <lb/>lose the contested property, than risque any more
	    <lb/>after it. In this was wisdom not to be found in
	    <lb/>the present generation. Every man is now a
	    <lb/>counsellor, and every man thinks he has a friend,
	    <lb/>who in fact cares not for him, but is a cheap ad­
	    <lb/>viser when urgency requires. How wretched
	    <lb/>must that mortal be who has no firm opinion of
	    <lb/>his own, but must advise with his friend, who
	    <lb/>from the impulse of the moment is prompted to
	    <lb/>speak what first occurs to his mind, and the pa­
	    <lb/>tient hearer is satisfied, and returns to his dear
	    <lb/>fireside quite contented. It is in vain to remon­
	    <lb/>strate, and happy is that being, who, as <persName>Burns</persName>

              <p>After a few days, I went no more to the mu­

	    <lb/>ting to paper, what I had already seen, and pay­
	    <lb/>ing visits to my friends, in order to remove from
	    <lb/>my mind reflections the most painful. The loss
	    <lb/>of my dear parent I now began sensibly to feel,
	    <lb/>and the world lost most of its charms; I had no

	    <lb/>self, and my father at such a distance, that I be­
	    <lb/>gan to give myself up to despair. The idea of
	    <lb/>making myself of use and entertainment to the
	    <lb/>world, seemed to wear from my mind, and every
	    <lb/>day I became less fond of writing. At length,
	    <lb/>one morning as I was musing over some old ma­
	    <lb/>nuscripts, my cousin entered my apartment—</p>
              <p><said>I have just,</said> said she, <said>read a letter from
	      <lb/><placeName>Ibberville</placeName>; it is from our friend, who informs me
	      <lb/>that his father has just put him in possession of
	      <lb/>his farm, he having removed to <placeName>Chickasaw
		<lb/>Bluffs</placeName>, on the farm of his lady. He also most
	      <lb/>particularly wished me to write to him, as soon
	      <lb/>as you returned to <placeName>New-York</placeName>, and inform him
	      <lb/>of your real sentiments, as he will then know
	      <lb/>what course to pursue, and will be guided by
	      <lb/>what you may think proper to advance.</said></p>
              <p>I sunk into the arms of my friend, knowing
	    <lb/>not what to determine. My father's late severe
	    <lb/>remonstrations burst on my mind, and I did not
	    <lb/>dare forget them. It was now that I felt the loss
	    <lb/>of my mother; she was my adviser in all intricate
	    <lb/>matters—alas! she is no more! This being the
<pb n="2163"/>

<mw type="pageNum">163</mw>
	    <lb/>most important trial which I have ever met, I
	    <lb/>shall, notwithstanding the hurry of the moment,
	    <lb/>deliberate as quickly as possible.</p>
              <p>
                <said rend="pre()post()">Now, my dear friend, this is my resolution:
	    <lb/>I know that my father's affection for me is un­
	    <lb/>bounded, but I will risque his displeasure. In
	    <lb/>the first place, write to <placeName>Ibberville</placeName> that I have re­
	    <lb/>turned, and am busily engaged, at the request of
	    <lb/>my father, in finishing my writings, which will
	    <lb/>yet take three months close application, and du­
	    <lb/>ring that time he can write me, giving me infor­
	    <lb/>mation where to direct my communications to
	    <lb/>him, the subject of our correspondence to remain
	    <lb/>within our own breast, as nothing appears at pre­
	    <lb/>sent, but the want of a little time, to make us
	    <lb/>happy. I shall continually write to my father,
	    <lb/>and endeavour to gain on his heart so as to ob­
	    <lb/>tain his consent, for I think it an incumbent du­
	    <lb/>ty to obey my father, and I have no doubt but
	    <lb/>I shall soothe him in time.</said>
              </p>
              <p>After a few moments, my cousin left the room
	    <lb/>to write to our friend, while I continued writing
	    <lb/>my history, which I think is almost enough

	    <lb/>to prepare for the press. I confess that I have
	    <lb/>no wish to become conspicuous; the lonely grove
	    <lb/>and warbling birds, the croaking of frogs in a
	    <lb/>marshy pond, give more delight to me, than the
	    <lb/>flattering adulation of a thousand tongues. I
	    <lb/>wish not praise—I sigh not for grandeur nor rich­
	    <lb/>es; the humble walks of life have to me more
	    <lb/>charms, and afford more real happiness, than is
	    <lb/>to be found in costly palaces. I wish not to in­
	    <lb/>crease the trouble on my mind, by froward am­
	    <lb/>bition; let me wander unseen and unnoticed, so
	    <lb/>as not to excite envy.</p>
              <p>The season is now charming, and an evening
	    <lb/>walk to <placeName>Castle Garden</placeName> is like paradise. There
	    <lb/>beauty displays all her allurements, for where
	    <lb/>pleased, woman exceeds all God's creation, there
	    <lb/>lordly man is all officiousness, his ready atten­
	    <lb/>tion is evident. But on the morrow, when the
	    <lb/>banks open, and he has obligations to encoun­
	    <lb/>ter, then horror seizes him, and distractedly he
	    <lb/>walks until almost faint, when at length the
	    <lb/>clock strikes three, and a respite takes place—
	    <lb/>he immediately seeks pleasure at the expense of
	    <lb/>his next day's feelings—he cares not! So hurries

              <p><persName>Miss Josephine</persName> was all joy at the receipt of
	    <lb/>this letter. She had anticipated her father's
	    <lb/>forgiveness. Her mind was now at rest, and she
	    <lb/>continued her writings—only experienced a short
	    <lb/>interruption by the arrival from <placeName>Pequest</placeName> of her
	    <lb/>cousin, father, and mother, who spent only a few

	    <lb/>The manners, he observed, of all the inhabitants
	    <lb/>were much changed in the present day, from
	    <lb/>what they were in his youth. For their best
	    <lb/>clothes seemed now every day on, as it ap­

	    <lb/>describe his character—only to observe, he knew
	    <lb/>mankind and all their propensities, from the
	    <lb/>cottage to the throne. <persName>Mrs. Dexter</persName> was a lady in
	    <lb/>every sense of the term—polite, easy, and never
	    <lb/>engrossed the conversation, even should it be on

	    <lb/>the grievance was rather singular; and what
	    <lb/>took from its beauty was, cash being demanded
	    <lb/>at its entrance. Shameful of this rich metropolis,

              <p>Oh, ye bright effulgent orbs! witness this day
	    <lb/>of our rejoicing, at the sight of him who was a
	    <lb/>companion of our great deliverer—who felt for
	    <lb/>him in his anxiety, when he could not gratify
	    <lb/>his soldiers with every necessary comfort, but
	    <lb/>addressed them in soft speeches, promising more
	    <lb/>than at that time he could perform! Since his
	    <lb/>dissolution, <placeName>America</placeName> has fed the hungry and those
	    <lb/>who fought her battles, and clothed those of the
	    <lb/>naked who were in want, and heaped honours
	    <lb/>on their posterity. Could our ancestors only rise
	    <lb/>from their graves and see, they would certainly
	    <lb/>wish to stay on earth, and roll in chariots which
	    <lb/>they never expected, as the reward of their
	    <lb/>bravery, and to see it descend to their third and
	    <lb/>fourth generation. View the present times, look
	    <lb/>into the face of former men, and you cannot but
	    <lb/>observe the smiles of contentment—riches bright­
	    <lb/>en their appearance, and the liberty of which
	    <lb/>they have to boast, inflames their hearts with a
	    <lb/>continual desire to grow greater. Public edifi­
	    <lb/>ces are erected in every part of our city, not only
	    <lb/>for religious purposes, but for great and studious
	    <lb/>men to harangue and make themselves popular;
	    <lb/>and also for reclaiming youth, and pointing out
<pb n="2178"/>

	    <lb/>the way to honour, without defrauding any one,
	    <lb/>which promises to the rising generation much
	    <lb/>real honesty, a matter devoutly to be wished.—
	    <lb/>In the hurry and confusion that overspread our
	    <lb/>city, the post-man dropped a letter at the door,
	    <lb/>and could not wait for the postage. <said>Goodness!</said>
	    <lb/>I exclaimed, <said>I would have given a guinea, if I
	      <lb/>had no change, provided I had seen the super­
	      <lb/>scription,</said> as I knew it to be from my father.
	    <lb/>To my great satisfaction it was from him, as­
	    <lb/>suring me that he would be in <placeName>New-York</placeName> in
	    <lb/>four weeks.</p>
              <p>How I was delighted!—I flew to my friend,
	    <lb/>to whom I communicated the glad news. The
	    <lb/>next day my lover called, and I showed him the
	    <lb/>letter; he was pleased beyond expression, and
	    <lb/>handed me a ticket to go to <persName>Mr. Keene's</persName> benefit,
	    <lb/>which was to take place in a few evenings. Not
	    <lb/>many days had elapsed ere I received a letter
	    <lb/>from <placeName>Zainesville</placeName> from my aunt, who could not
	    <lb/>wait on me, as her husband was inclined to the
	    <lb/>dropsy and already showed symptoms of it. I
	    <lb/>think it would be a public calamity to lo<choice><sic>o</sic><corr/></choice>se so

	    <lb/>good a man, and society would no doubt deeply
	    <lb/>regret his loss.</p>
              <p>In a few weeks more my father arrived in the
	    <lb/>steam-boat from <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, he approached
	    <lb/>me with endearing smiles—<said>You have conquer­
	      <lb/>ed your father's wishes, who had no desire to
	      <lb/>part with you. Where is the youth that I must
	      <lb/>be allied to?</said></p>
              <p>
                <said>He will be here immediately, as it is now
	      <lb/>near visiting hours, and he would not intrude in
	      <lb/>any other.</said>
              </p>
              <p>He then entered the room and was introdu­
	    <lb/>ced to the governour, who kindly shook his hand,
	    <lb/>while he uttered not a word, as it was usual with
	    <lb/>him to be silent until he became acquainted.—
	    <lb/>The conversation turned on agriculture—He
	    <lb/>mentioned that <said xml:id="mentioned1" rend="post()" next="#mentioned2">the
<placeName>Mississippi</placeName> was a fine coun­
	      <lb/>try, and the soil rich, but not better I presume

	      <lb/>the first rising ground above <placeName>New-Orleans</placeName>, I

              <p>The conversation ended, and young <persName>Mantel</persName>
	    <lb/>took leave until evening, when he engaged him­
	    <lb/>self to return. When he left the house, the

	    <lb/>youth, and he thought his daughter might be
	    <lb/>happy. They all dined together; and after

	    <lb/>he began the subject nearest his heart.—
	    <lb/><said>Now, my fair girl, do not delay, through the
	      <lb/>modesty of your behaviour, to make known to
	      <lb/>me the real feelings of your heart; and when the
	      <lb/>happy hour will come that is to make us one.
	      <lb/>I am so absorbed in thought I know not what to
	      <lb/>say; I have exhausted my rhetoric to gain you,
	      <lb/>and now I submit my whole soul to you.</said></p>
              <p><said>Do not, my friend, upbraid me; my temper
	      <lb/>is soft, and I am easily persuaded. To-morrow
	      <lb/>I will determine. Let me recline on my pillow,
	      <lb/>and give my thoughts to determine what is to be
	      <lb/>my fate, happiness or misery.</said> He agreed, and
	    <lb/>they parted.</p>
              <p>At breakfast, my father joked me, as he said
	    <lb/>he must leave <placeName>New-York</placeName> in ten or twelve days.
	    <lb/>Good God! what shall I do? This—this is
	    <lb/>the important day of my life, and I must deter­
	    <lb/>mine good or evil. I have no particular wish to
	    <lb/>marry at present, I would rather wait; but two
	    <lb/>considerations harrass me,—my father's wish to
	    <lb/>depart, and my lover's wish to secure me.</p>

              <p>O woman! what mighty events await thy
	    <lb/>too sudden decision! Yet I must, and will
	    <lb/>determine. So I ran from the table, and pre­
	    <lb/>pared to take a walk to relieve my mind, and
	    <lb/>begged my father to dine with us, which he
	    <lb/>agreed to. I wandered along the north side
	    <lb/>of the town, thinking I should meet some of
	    <lb/>my acquaintances, and stopped at the museum
	    <lb/>to take a last look at the different curiosities, and
	    <lb/>returned to dinner. My father began, as they
	    <lb/>were preparing the dishes—<said>Any thing, my
	      <lb/>child, you want, you must suggest to me, and
	      <lb/>you shall be gratified.</said> <said><choice><sic>t</sic><corr>T</corr></choice>hank you, Sir; fe­
	      <lb/>males have many little wants that your sex have
	      <lb/>no idea of. We must always appear charming,
	      <lb/>always appear pleased, and never ungrateful
	      <lb/>if caught in dishabille—that, to a studious fe­
	      <lb/>male, is very troublesome. However, Sir, I shall
	      <lb/>be as prudent as I can for one of my years.</said></p>
              <p>In the evening all friends were absent walk­
	    <lb/>ing, which I declined, having fixed a resolution
	    <lb/>to prepare to meet my lover, and crown his
	    <lb/>wishes, by fixing the hour for solemnization
	    <lb/>of our marriage. Oh, all feeling minds, who

	    <lb/>only know my situation at this moment:—To
	    <lb/>give up our liberty to man, the first of God's
	    <lb/>images, to promise ever to obey and please him.
	    <lb/>Gracious Powers! what a task am I going to
	    <lb/>put on my now free will! For in the absence
	    <lb/>of my father I do as I please, and the determi­
	    <lb/><choice><sic>mi</sic><corr/></choice>nations of this evening will place me in such
	    <lb/>a situation that I must live to please him who
	    <lb/>now adores me. Suppose that those charms
	    <lb/>which now allure him should vanish, by sick­
	    <lb/>ness, misfortune, disappointment, and all the
	    <lb/>changing scenes that this life is embittered with,
	    <lb/>what then will be my situation! I know myself
	    <lb/>in sunshine and prosperity, my heart is elated,
	    <lb/>my countenance beams pleasure. On the con­
	    <lb/>trary, when afflictions arise, I am as dull as a

	    <lb/>cannot be happy within themselves. However,

              <p>They parted that evening, not to see each
	    <lb/>other in four days, as <persName>Lucius</persName> was engaged with
	    <lb/>a party of gay persons to visit <placeName>Schooley's Moun­
	      <lb/>tain Springs</placeName>. The company were, the <persName>Marquis
	      <lb/>Lafayette</persName> and his friend, <persName>Don Diego Joseph
	      <lb/>Navarro</persName>, and a few politicians of the present
	    <lb/>day. There were no ladies of the party. The
	    <lb/>Spanish gentleman could not speak a word of
	    <lb/><name>English</name>; <persName>Mantel</persName> was his interpreter. He was
	    <lb/>delighted with the country<choice><sic/><corr>.</corr></choice> He said the <name>Spa­

	    <lb/>for his part, he thought it a paradise; the Ame­
	    <lb/>rican women, whose complexions, in general,
	    <lb/>are fair, appeared to him as fallen angels. All
	    <lb/>he lamented was, he could not express his feel­
	    <lb/>ings towards them, which <persName>Mantel</persName> was endea­
	    <lb/>vouring to teach him, for which he was very
	    <lb/>grateful. He very humorously said, that the

	    <lb/>could describe—<name>French</name>, <name>English</name>, <name>Spanish</name>, or
	    <lb/><name>Irish</name>—none could express it—nothing but the

	    <lb/>ners, grace, dignity, sublimity of ideas, and every
	    <lb/>requisite to please and so far from having any
	    <lb/>knowledge of the charms she was possessed of,
	    <lb/>that they escaped her notice.</p>
              <p>There were a variety of characters assembled
	    <lb/>from the different states; and it did not altoge­

	    <lb/>posely for health, as there were so many inqui­
	    <lb/>sitive characters from all countries—the <name>Jew</name>
	    <lb/>and the <name>Greek</name>, the wise and the foolish, rich
	    <lb/>and poor—all trying to find some alleviatives for
	    <lb/>misery; and many professional gentlem<choice><sic>a</sic><corr>e</corr></choice>n, and
	    <lb/>many no gentlemen at all, only in dress and
	    <lb/>pretensions. One who drew great attention was
	    <lb/>a dandy of great pomposity—talked of our be­
	    <lb/>nevolence in aiding the <name>Greeks</name>, our philanthropy
	    <lb/>to distressed emigrants from every part of the

	    <lb/>divine would most cheerfully do, as no part of

              <p>The company all assembled in <placeName>Broadway</placeName>,
	    <lb/>near the <placeName>Battery</placeName>; the evening was calm and se­
	    <lb/>rene, and Luna's pale beams invited to pleasure;
	    <lb/>a perfect silence prevailed previous to the cere­
	    <lb/>mony, when all eyes were fixed on <persName>Miss Jose­
	      <lb/>phine</persName>, whose dress was a white satin pelisse and
	    <lb/>petticoat, elegantly decorated with wreathes of
	    <lb/>white roses—a fan in her hand, emblematic of
	    <lb/>the present time, a small pigmy endeavouring to
	    <lb/>erect himself above a large figure, and by his
	    <lb/>exertions, had it not been for the light of gas,
	    <lb/>he had nearly fallen, to the astonishment of all
	    <lb/>present.</p>
              <p>The ceremony was short, though very so­
	    <lb/>lemn. <persName>Miss Josephine</persName> appeared serene and
	    <lb/>happy, which afforded pleasurable sensations
	    <lb/>to her friends, and the evening was spent in
	    <lb/>great hilarity. The company dispersed—some
	    <lb/>to the south, and others to the east. The part­
	    <lb/>ing scene between the bride and her father was
	    <lb/>interesting. He said as follows:</p>
              <p>

	      <lb/>other be decorous and kind, and time will then
	      <lb/>not lessen your attachment; this is the first wish
	      <lb/>of my heart. Endeavour to be patterns of con­
	      <lb/>jugal felicity, and may the ever-green bay deck
	      <lb/>your brow; and when the storms of life beset
	      <lb/>your declining age, may you find comfort in

              </p>
              <p>After the ceremony and parade which is cus­

	    <lb/>pair contemplated what would be most benefi­
	    <lb/>cial for them to pursue, in order to make life a­
	    <lb/>greeable. They consulted their friends, who
	    <lb/>advised, as they were both literary characters,
	    <lb/>to amuse the world with some effusion of their
	    <lb/>fancy, and they commenced by beginning the
	    <lb/>history of my nephew, which was promised in
	    <lb/>the beginning of this book.</p>
