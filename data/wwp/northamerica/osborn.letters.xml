               <lb/>her beauty, mar her importance, and weaken

               <lb/>ſeem to ſee more than ever, wherein I am
               <lb/>wanting to myſelf; and it is, in not improv­

               <lb/>of righteouſneſs, there is in the <persName>Lord Jeſus</persName>!
               <lb/>—It is indeed for want of this, that I ſo often
               <lb/>faint, and ſit down diſcouraged, ready with
               <lb/><persName>Jonah</persName> to ſink, and wiſh to die, when corrup­
               <lb/>tions preſs hard upon me; and though with
               <lb/><persName>Sampſon</persName>, when his hair was cut, I begin to
               <lb/>ſhake myſelf a little; yet finding no ſtrength
               <lb/>of my own, I forget where help is to be 
               <lb/>found; and ſo ſuffer theſe <name>Philiſtians</name> to put
               <lb/>out <mcr>both</mcr> the eyes of my faith, and make their
               <lb/>own ſport of me! Whereas, could I but
               <lb/>learn and practice, the art of living on Chriſt
               <lb/>by faith, I might ſnap their bands aſunder

               <lb/>them! They could not bind me, no, not
               <lb/>with ſtrong cords! O pray for me, that I
               <lb/>may do ſo. May the Lord go on to ſtrength­
               <lb/>en you. I rejoice in his goodneſs to you,
               <lb/>that he doth not ſuffer you to be overwhelm­
               <lb/>ed by thoſe, who ſeek your ruin! Oh, bleſſ­
               <lb/>ed be God, he is ſtronger than the ſtrong
               <lb/>man armed, and will not ſuffer you to be
               <lb/>tempted, above what you are able, and will
               <lb/>with the temptation, make a way for your
               <lb/>eſcape! The Lord be with you.
