        <p><hi rend="case(allcaps)">I lament</hi> your absence from <placeName>Charlestown</placeName>, at the time
	  <lb/>my setting out; yet perhaps it is better so, expecially as it was
	  <lb/>not in your power to transact the business with <persName>S――</persName>. On
	  <lb/>my arrival here, I sent for <persName>Mr. Ladely</persName>, who very politely un­
	  <lb/>dertook to execute the business without delay; but how you
	  <lb/>are to get the papers in time, Heaven only knows. I must

	    <lb/>Carolina</placeName>, or any southern climate. Go to bed early, and rise

	  <lb/>late. Hang the cards, they are to be your ruin: I never knew

        <p>But I see I must quit writing. <persName>Mr. L.</persName> and myself are

	  <lb/>to give it up. The room we are in, which is the family apart­
	  <lb/>ment, was occupied when I came in, by two or three rough looking
	  <lb/>men. They had been drinking, and were disputing on politics
	  <lb/>when I entered. When <persName>Mr. L.</persName> and myself sat down to write, I
	  <lb/>thought they would take the hint; but no! here they sit. I sus­
	  <lb/>pect they must be some of the <emph>consequentials</emph> of the neighbor­

	  <lb/>of the landlady, to the groast molestation of the guests. They
	  <lb/>have begun on the scriptures now, and a fight, I suspect, will
	  <lb/>break up the debate. Strange! how the sacred writings are
	  <lb/>abused by the misguided vulgar. How absurd! and yet how
	  <lb/>common! You will scarcely see two or three persons together
	  <lb/>who do not engage in disputes about the scriptures; and yet no
	  <lb/>subject is so little calculated to sustain contradiction. One
	  <lb/>party always, and often both, fall into a rage. Were the
	  <lb/>scriptures given for this? But some will say <quote>it is our privi­
	    <lb/>lege to talk in a free country.</quote> True—but not to quarrel!
	  <lb/>I never knew any good, but on the contrary much harm, flow
	  <lb/>from these disputes: neither is this practice confined to drunk­
	  <lb/>ards over their cups: sober, but narrow minded religious
	  <lb/>sects are addicted to it; and it is always found to pre<supplied reason="flawed-reproduction">sent</supplied> most
	  <lb/>amongst those who practice the duties of the Christian religion
	  <lb/>least. As there is no surer mark of an evil disposed female,
	  <lb/>or want of virtue, than to hear her defame her own sex; so 
	  <lb/>there can be no stronger evidence of a hypocrite than to hear
	  <lb/>him rail at other sects than that to which he belongs: and I
	  <lb/>should want no better proof of his being every thing but a
	  <lb/><name>Christian</name>. The Christian religion does not consist in vain
	  <lb/>disputes and idle talk, but in the practice of its precepts. I
	  <lb/>have never heard any of these sectarians dispute the privelege
	  <lb/>of relieving the distressed. The idea of such a dispute never
	  <lb/>entered their heads or hearts.</p>
        <p>I find <persName>Mr. L.</persName> a man of much patience. I confess I must
	  <lb/>yield to him the victory. He is certainly a modest as well as
	  <lb/>a very pleasant man. Dear <persName>M.</persName> I must retire to rest. God
	  <lb/>bless you! Pray take care of your health.</p>

	  <lb/>worth your attention has occured since I wrote to you from 
	  <lb/><placeName>Cabell</placeName>. I had not proceeded a mile on my way the next morn­
	  <lb/>ing, before I was met by a gentleman riding on horseback, and
	  <lb/>alone. This was the thing I wished, provided he was going
	  <lb/>so far as your town; but from the stranger's appearance, I had
	  <lb/>little hope of that. He was without any thing that might in­
	  <lb/>dicate a journey of any distance. He was thinly clad, without
	  <lb/>portmanteau or saddle bags, and even without a great coat,
	  <lb/>although it had snowed during the night, and the morning was
	  <lb/>intensely cold. He addressed me with the easy politeness of a
	  <lb/>gentleman, and inquired how far it was to town, meaning <name>Ca­
	      <lb/>bell Court House</name>, and also how far it was to <placeName>Charlestown</placeName>?
	  <lb/>My heart leaped for joy on hearing the last interrogatory. Af­
	  <lb/>ter giving him the desired information on each of his inquiries,
	  <lb/><said>Are you going to <placeName>Charlestown</placeName>, Sir,</said> said I, drawing forth
	  <lb/>my packet from my pocket. He replied in the affirmative.
	  <lb/><said>Will you be so good then,</said> I asked, <said>as to take charge of this
	    <lb/>packet and deliver it there?</said> He kindly assented, observing
	  <lb/>that he would execute my commands with pleasure. All this
	  <lb/>was the business of the moment; but no sooner had he disposed
	  <lb/>of the packet, and we were about to separate, than I repented
	  <lb/>my rashness in confiding so much in a stranger, and thought
	  <lb/>it might not be amiss to inquire for his place of residence. But
	  <lb/>what was my astonishment, when he told me he lived in <placeName>Scot­
	    <lb/>land</placeName>; but that, at present, he was going to <placeName>Canada</placeName>. <said>At any
	    <lb/>rate, Sir,</said> said I, <said>you have the deportment of a gentleman,
	    <lb/>and I will venture to trust you.</said> <said>Fear me not,</said> said he,
	  <lb/><said>I will not deceive you.</said> We bowed to each other and sepa­
	  <lb/>rated. You are in a poor trim, thought I, for a journey to
	  <lb/><placeName>Canada</placeName> at this season, as he parted from me shivering with
	  <lb/>the cold.</p>
        <p>At the distance of a mile from the place of our meeting,
	  <lb/>I met three men riding with led horses, heavy laden. They
	  <lb/>were muffled up in great coats, cloaks, &amp;c. I concluded they
	  <lb/>belonged to the gentleman ahead, probably his <foreign xml:lang="fr">suite</foreign>; which I
	  <lb/>found to be the fact. You will have heard, ere this, that this
	  <lb/>great personage was <persName rend="slant(italic)">Lord <placeName>Selkirk</placeName></persName>. On the second night after
	  <lb/>parting with his Lordship, we—I say <emph>we</emph>, for the companions

	  <lb/>of my journey found me at <placeName>Big Sandy River</placeName>—we stopped for
	  <lb/>the night at an Inn kept by old <persName>Mr. Clack</persName>. Here I learned
	  <lb/>the name and quality of the Scottish Lord; and I could not but
	  <lb/>blame myself for the liberty I had takenwith his Lordship.
	  <lb/>Yet what the plague could he be poking about our wild hills
	  <lb/>and mountains for? And how was I to know that he was a fo­
	  <lb/>reign dignitary? Indeed, he had more the appearance of an
	  <lb/>out-rider, in the way I met him, than any thing else.</p>
        <p>Old <persName>Mr. Clack</persName> informed us, that <persName>Lord <placeName>Selkirk</placeName></persName> put up at
	  <lb/>his house, as he went on—that he was on his return from a tour
	  <lb/>of three years, which were spent in exploring the western
	  <lb/>country bordering on the <placeName>Pacific</placeName>—and that his <foreign xml:lang="fr">suite</foreign> consisted
	  <lb/>of his Physician, his Secretary and his servant. These were
	  <lb/>the three men I met in the rear of his Lordship. These par­
	  <lb/>ticulars <persName>Mr. C.</persName> collected from the servant, without the know­
	  <lb/>lege of his superiors, who maintained the strictest silence on
	  <lb/>the subject of their journey. <persName>Mr. C.</persName> stated, that his Lord­
	  <lb/>ship's domestics behaved with the greatest humility towards
	  <lb/>him, never presuming to sit in his presence, nor to eat until
	  <lb/>he had finished his meal—for the rest, he ate a great many eggs,
	  <lb/>ten or fourteen at a meal; wrote to a late hour at night; and
	  <lb/>slept under a great many blankets between his own sheets.</p>
        <p>The fears of <persName>Mrs. Clack</persName>, on account of the Earl, afforded
	  <lb/>us much amusement. She said he must harbor some bad de­
	  <lb/>sign again<choice><sic/><corr>s</corr></choice>t the country—that was certain: <said>for,</said> said she,
	  <lb/><said>he must be a <name>Jew</name>, or a <name>Turk</name>, or a <name>Tory</name>, or some outlandish
	    <lb/>animal; for, because, whenever my old man would go out, he
	    <lb/>would always be a axin me how many neighbors I had, how
	    <lb/>many were in each family, and how far distant the country
	    <lb/>was inhabited around us; but, whenever my old man came in,
	    <lb/>he would just be as still as a mouse!</said> We endeavored to re­
	  <lb/>move the old lady's fears, by assuring her that little danger
	  <lb/>was to be apprehended from his Lordship. I have since learn­
	  <lb/>ed that his motive in visiting the west, was to seek an asylum
	  <lb/>for his poorer countrymen.</p>

        <p><hi>I intend</hi> to spend a few days in this town, or city, what­
	  <lb/>ever it he called. I have seen but little of it yet. Should I
	  <lb/>describe it to you, it would be too much like repeating <quote>a
	    <lb/>thrice told tale.</quote> The country around it is well situated—
	  <lb/>beautiful in the extreme, and in a state of high cultivation.
	  <lb/>The first three days of my journey, after entering <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>,
	  <lb/>presented no variety, the soil and face of the country being
	  <lb/>nearly the same from <placeName>Big Sandy River</placeName> to <placeName>Mount Sterling</placeName>,
	  <lb/>about ninety miles. The surface is very uneven, covered with
	  <lb/>heavy timber, and thinly inhabited; but on approaching <placeName>Mount
	    <lb/>Sterling</placeName>, you are suddenly transported, as it were, into another
	  <lb/>world. The face of the country assumes a new appearance,
	  <lb/>the soil and its productions differing entirely from the preced­
	  <lb/>ing. It is not in the power of imagination to paint the con­
	  <lb/>trast, which you behold on emerging from the gloomy, lone­
	  <lb/>some woods into open day. The light, which was hitherto ex­
	  <lb/>cluded by the lofty timber, rushes upon you in an instant; and
	  <lb/>you find yourself in a soil, rich indeed, but the growth of tim­
	  <lb/>ber, which principally consists of locust, cherry-tree, and
	  <lb/>black-walnut, is low and small, and the trees universally ter­
	  <lb/>minate abruptly from a large base to a diminutive top, although
	  <lb/>they have wide spreading branches. The fruit trees on the
	  <lb/><placeName>Kenhawa</placeName> equal them in height: they are thinly scattered over
	  <lb/>the ground. Such is the face of the country from <placeName>Mount Sterl­
	    <lb/>ing</placeName> to this place, and it is said to extend to <placeName>Danville</placeName> in this
	  <lb/>state. The farmers give their attention chiefly to the raising
	  <lb/>of <name>Indian</name> corn and tobacco, though other vegetables are pro­
	  <lb/>duced in plenty and in great perfection. But with these sub­
	  <lb/>jects, as well as most others, relative to the manufactures and
	  <lb/>produce of <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>, you are much better acquainted with
	  <lb/>than I am.</p>
        <p>You have often heard it stated, that a solid rock of lime­
	  <lb/>stone runs beneath the surface of the earth here. This is not
	  <lb/>generally the fact; it only exists in what is called old <placeName>Kentuc­

	    <lb/>ky</placeName>, meaning that part of the state, which extends from <placeName>Mount
	    <lb/>Sterling</placeName> to <placeName>Danville</placeName>, and which, I presume, was the first settled.
	  <lb/>This rock is said to be at unequal distances from the surface,
	  <lb/>from two and a half to four feet. To this circumstance may
	  <lb/>be ascribed the diminutive growth of the timber. As I rode
	  <lb/>through the country from <placeName>Mount Sterling</placeName> to this place, I ob­
	  <lb/>served that the sugar trees were dead. Upon inquiry into the
	  <lb/>cause of this novel appearance, I was informed that they were
	  <lb/>killed by a worm, which attacks the leaves and boughs with
	  <lb/>such avidity, and in such numbers, that they succeed in des­
	  <lb/>troying the tree; and having despatched the sugar trees, it had
	  <lb/>begun the same process on all others, except the walnut, which 
	  <lb/>it has never yet been known to touch.</p>
        <p><persName>Dr. Claud</persName> has called to see me, and I must conclude.</p>

	  <lb/>scarcely seated ourselves by a welcome fire, when some one
	  <lb/>batted the house from the opposite shore. The landlord step­
	  <lb/>ped out, answered the call, and in a few minutes returned,
	  <lb/>ushering in a man all dripping with water. We made room
	  <lb/>for him to approach the fire; but he declined seating himself
	  <lb/>amongst us, and retreating into the chimney corner, seated

	  <lb/>himself, not on one corner, but on the edge of a chair. All
	  <lb/>eyes were turned towards him. How common, and yet how
	  <lb/>ungenteel—nay, how uncivil—to embarrass a poor, unfortunate
	  <lb/>stranger! How apt we are to do the very thing we would wish
	  <lb/>not to have done unto us! It is cruel to stare a poor creature
	  <lb/>out of countenance only because he is a stranger, and differing
	  <lb/>from outselves only in his outward appearance, while his mo­
	  <lb/>dest, downcast look, tacitly disclose his superior manners.</p>
        <p>Poor <persName>Paddy</persName>, for an <name>Irishman</name> he was, replied to the in­
	  <lb/>quires of the guests, respecting his unpleasant trim, <said>that his
	    <lb/>horse was after trowing him in the wather: by the powers
	    <lb/>he niver was witter in his life. And I wish,</said> continued he,
	  <lb/><said>I wasn't safe at ome, in old <persName>Patrick O'Brian's</persName> to night. I
	    <lb/>wouldn't be here, so I wouldn't. Do, if you plase, landlord,
	    <lb/>give us a gill of whiskey.</said> By this time, the landlord, of his
	  <lb/>own accord, had appeared with a glass of spirits. <said>Och, <unclear reason="obscured">long</unclear>
	    <lb/>life to your honor,</said> cried <persName>Paddy</persName>: <said>here's wishing you may
	    <lb/>live all the days of your life, so I do.</said> On being urged to
	  <lb/>change his clothes, he replied—<said>indeed, and I haven't a clean
	    <lb/>rag at all, at all; and so I will just sit here and dry myself by
	    <lb/>this good fire, and never mind—and I ought to go and see that
	    <lb/><name>Gin</name> has her meat, poor bayst! She is the swaytest craycher
	    <lb/>in the world, for all she trow'd me in the pool; but 'twasn't her
	    <lb/>fault, for the saddle fill in first, and then you know, she couldn't
	    <lb/>help that.</said> The landlord begged him to make himself easy,
	  <lb/>and he would see that <name>Gin</name> should have a plentiful supper.</p>
        <p>One of our party asked him, if he had travelled far: <said>Och!
	    <lb/>indeed, I have then,</said> said he; <said>I've been all the way to the
	    <lb/><placeName>Orleans</placeName> among the agues, and the fayvers, and the miskeetoes,
	    <lb/>where they make sugar out of dare cane, and grind it in dare
	    <lb/>mills, wid dare nagurs. It is mesilf that had the ague, tree
	    <lb/>long monts and nine days; an all the time I lay flat o'me back,
	    <lb/>an the fayver shakin the skin traugt the bones, an not a chris­
	    <lb/>tian craycher anigh me to give me a drink, but the doctor, and
	    <lb/>an old woman to wait on me. And there I lay spaychless, all
	    <lb/>the time talkin all the nonsense; an if I ever live to get home
	    <lb/>to <placeName>Ireland</placeName> again, it will never be me that will come to this
	    <lb/>here country again—if I do, my name isn't <persName>Dennis O'Brian</persName>.

	    <lb/>Many's the time I'd say to the doctor, doctor, says I, I can't
	    <lb/>stand it much longer, so jist lit me alone, an lit me die in
	    <lb/>payce, for the miskeetoes is aytin me up, any way, Says the

	  <lb/>had he not been interrupted by the entrance of two more travel­
	  <lb/>ers; and in a short time afterwards supper was announced.</p>
        <p>We all arose to go to supper. Poor <persName>Dennis</persName> arose very
	  <lb/>slowly, apparently hesitating whether he ought to advance or
	  <lb/>not. One of our party tarried behind the company, waiting
	  <lb/>for him. Finding he was about to decline the summons, he
	  <lb/>asked, if he would not walk in and take supper with us. <said>Och!
	    <lb/>may the blessings attend you for that, for I havn't broke my 
	    <lb/>fast on mayt to day, but I hated to be afther aytin wid gentle­
	    <lb/>folks; an I have but little money too, for I give the last dollar
	    <lb/>I had away to a poor woman that I met in the road a walkin.</said>
	  <lb/><said>Come along, sir,</said> said the gentleman, <said>You are as good
	    <lb/>as we are.</said> The kindess of this address made his eyes 
	  <lb/>sparkle, and he took the precedence, which the gentleman gave
	  <lb/>him, in walking before him to the supper room—exclaiming,
	  <lb/><said>God forbid I should ever be half so good as your honor.</said></p>
        <p>During supper, and long after, he entertained us with a
	  <lb/>history of his travels from <placeName>New York</placeName> to <placeName>Pittsburg</placeName>, thence to
	  <lb/><placeName>New Orleans</placeName>, and last of all from 
	  <placeName>Ireland</placeName> to <placeName>America</placeName>: not,
	  <lb/>however without the assistance of another glass of whiskey
	  <lb/>and a great number of <distinct>says I's</distinct> and <distinct>says he's</distinct>. Long before he
	  <lb/>closed his narrative, I went to bed, and fell asleep; and I know
	  <lb/>not how long it was before I was awakened by some one who
	  <lb/>was singing. It was our <name>Hibernian</name>, beguiling his sorrows with
	  <lb/>a song. Happy man! Is he not to be envied? thought I. In 
	  <lb/>my opinion, much more than he who possesses thousands.</p>

	  <lb/>I have been here two days, I have learned but little concern­
	  <lb/>ing it, having been confined most of the time. In size and po­
	  <lb/>pulation, it is such as it has been described: and is the largest
	  <lb/>town I ever saw. The first thing that strikes the eye of a
	  <lb/>stranger, is its white houses, gates, and posts (which last are
	  <lb/>very large) and the great activity in the streets—many people,
	  <lb/>carriages, &amp;c. moving in all directions. Here are, also, very
	  <lb/>extensive Rope Walks. I have not visited any of the manufac­
	  <lb/>turing houses in <placeName>Lexington</placeName>, but I have been told they are in a 
	  <lb/>flourishing condition. Of the market, I say nothing, as the
	  <lb/>cheapness, variety, and abundance of its supplies have been so
	  <lb/>often proclaimed by others.</p>
        <p>I am informed that the citizens of <placeName>Lexington</placeName> are remark­
	  <lb/>able for their benevolence and humanity to the distressed of all
	  <lb/>descriptions, particularly to poor emigrants, who pass through
	  <lb/>their town. In no part of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, perhaps, do the
	  <lb/>unfortunate meet with more compassion than in <placeName>Lexington</placeName>.
	  <lb/>This is a noble trait in their character. I found, however, one
	  <lb/>exception in the person of <persName>Mr. Keen</persName> (I think his name is,) a
	  <lb/>vain, impertinent upstart. It contains about 5,000 inhabitants,

        <p><hi>We</hi> arrived here without meeting with any accident. This
	  <lb/>place is situate in the barrens of <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>, and is a handsome
	  <lb/>village. These barrens are almost destitute of timber. The
	  <lb/>soil, however, is very rich, and produces crops equal to any in
	  <lb/>the state: it is of a black color, tinged with red. Black Jack
	  <lb/>abounds on these barrens, and serves the inhabitants for fire
	  <lb/>wood; but it is not sufficient to defend them against the beams
	  <lb/>of the sun in summer, nor shield them from the cold blasts
<pb n="14"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2(3)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">14</mw>
	  <lb/>of winter—neither can it furnish rails for fencing; and the in­
	  <lb/>habitants are obliged to procure timber for this purpose, and
	  <lb/>also for building elsewhere at considerable expense. These
	  <lb/>barrens are but poorly watered, being destitute of springs;
	  <lb/>and the inhabitants have to supply the deficiency by digging
	  <lb/>wells. I am informed that the scenery, in summer, is beauti­
	  <lb/>ful, being varigated with flowers of the richest hue, and cloth­
	  <lb/>ed with a coat of most luxuriant grass.</p>
        <p>I was considerably amused this evening, in listening to a 
	  <lb/>conversation which took place in the room where I was sitting.
	  <lb/>There were present five persons—I made the sixth: two doc­
	  <lb/>tors of physic, one lawyer, one old farmer, and one of your
	  <lb/>dandies. For myself, I sat a silent spectator. The subject
	  <lb/>of disputation arose from the circumstance of a burning coal
	  <lb/>of fire flying, by accident, into <persName>Doctor E's</persName> bosom, as the ser­
	  <lb/>vant threw a log of wood with much force on the fire. This
	  <lb/>instantly called up the two great properties of all bodies, de­
	  <lb/>nominated by philosophers the power of attraction and repul­
	  <lb/>sion. After dwelling some time on these points, they glided,
	  <lb/>imperceptibly, into the proofs of chymical affinity,<anchor xml:id="a01" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n01"/> by exhibit­
	  <lb/>ing in full array the different experiments—such as exposure of
	  <lb/>phosporus to the action of the atmosphere, muriate of ammonia
	  <lb/>and carbonate of magnesia, muriate of soda and sulphate of
	  <lb/>magnesia, ardent spirits and a solution of salt and water, the
	  <lb/>attraction between mercury and oxygen gas upon being ex­
	  <lb/>posed to the common temperature of the atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The conversation (which was all <name>Greek</name> to me) was inter­
	  <lb/>rupted by the old farmer who exclaimed, <said>Oh, d—n your
	    <lb/><emph>oxen</emph> and <emph>grass</emph>, <persName>Dick</persName>; its all nonsense—better come and take
	    <lb/>some grog, gentlemen, and let us go to supper. What do you
	    <lb/>think your aunt <persName>Patty</persName> will do to night, <persName>Dick</persName>; hey!</said> <said>I sup­
	    <lb/>pose, sir, she will guess at the truth, and conclude that you
	    <lb/>could not accomplish your business in time to return home.—
	    <lb/>I think you may make yourself easy, uncle, and enjoy your­
	    <lb/>self with your friends.</said> We discovered that one of the young
	  <lb/>champions was the old gentleman's nephew; and that modest
	  <lb/>and respectful deportment, which he manifested towards him,
	  <lb/>inspired the guests with an exalted opinion of his merit.</p>
        <pb n="15"/>
        <milestone unit="sig" n="2(4)r"/>
        <mw type="pageNum">15</mw>
        <p>The old gentleman having drunk his grog and recom­
	  <lb/>mended his example to the other guests, supper was announc­
	  <lb/>ed, and we arose and followed the landlord to the supper-room.
	  <lb/>After we were seated, the old farmer, who had listened atten­
	  <lb/>tively to the illustrations of chymistry, without attempting to
	  <lb/>join in the conversation, was the first person, who spoke, de­
	  <lb/>livering himself as follows: <said>I tell you what, <persName>Dick</persName>, I don't
	    <lb/>understand none of your high flowing words, see, about this
	    <lb/>chymistry, nor  your <distinct><unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">paresses</unclear></distinct> and 
	    <distinct>rats</distinct>, 
	    and magnitudes, and
	    <lb/>all that are stuff. I don't see that any of you can get along
	    <lb/>any better than I do, with all your <distinct>larnin</distinct>, and I never knowed
	    <lb/>nothing about 'em.</said> The young gentleman's face colored
	  <lb/>with a deep blush, and he replied: <said>You deserve much credit,
	    <lb/>sir, for that success, which has distinguished your industry
	    <lb/>and skill as a farmer, which has not only secured to yourself
	    <lb/>an easy independence, but has furnished you with the means of
	    <lb/>gratifying that liberality and benevolence, for which you are
	    <lb/>so justly celebrated.</said> <said>Oh, now hold your tongue about
	    <lb/>them things, and let us go on about these chymistries. Why,
	    <lb/>d—n it, I don't understand a word of the confounded stuff at all.
	    <lb/>I suppose we shall have the sun, moon, and stars, and <persName>Joe
	      <lb/>Graphy</persName> next. What do you think of these thinks, friend,</said>
	  <lb/>said the old man, turning to the dandy?</p>
        <p><persName>Mr. Fop</persName>, who had evinced his restiveness in a variety of
	  <lb/>ways during the learned discussion before supper, in which he
	  <lb/>took no part, being now appealed to, delivered himself thus:—
	  <lb/><said>The rotundity of the earth's velocity, and the humidity of
	    <lb/>hydrolics, and their specific gravity, <distinct>ar</distinct> quite ridiculous in the
	    <lb/>abstract. I <distinct>ar</distinct> astonished to hear <unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">some</unclear> folks 
	    <distinct>pur<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">fess</unclear></distinct> to have
	    <lb/><distinct>larned</distinct> the infinities of tractions, when that 
	    <distinct>ar</distinct> a thing that <distinct>ar</distinct>
	    <lb/>out of the question!</said> This rhodomontade was uttered as it
	  <lb/>were, in a breath. If you had seen the old man, with his
	  <lb/>mouth and eyes wide open, staring at our dandy, while he was
	  <lb/>blending the different properties of bodies in a mass, and then
	  <lb/>hurling the whole to destruction, you would have stared, I be­
	  <lb/>lieve, far more than the old man himself. <said>D—n your <distinct>ars</distinct>
	    <lb/>and your <distinct>finities</distinct>,</said> said the farmer. The company could con­
	  <lb/>tain themselves no longer—a general burst of laughter from
<pb n="16"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2(4)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">16</mw>
	  <lb/>all, even from the servants, put an end to further conversation.
	  <lb/>The lawyer, who was a pretty clever fellow, I thought would
	  <lb/>have gone into fits. He laid down his knife and fork, clapped
	  <lb/>his hands on his sides, and continued to repeat the old man's
	  <lb/><distinct>ars</distinct>, and laugh, till I expected he would drop<choice><sic/><corr>.</corr></choice> The gravity of
	  <lb/>the nephew was constrained to give way: and, in short, we
	  <lb/>were compelled to quit the supper-table. My young fop mov­
	  <lb/>ed off, and I have not seen him since. Have I not taken some
	  <lb/>pains to amuse you, instead of going to bed? which last I shall
	  <lb/>now do, however, in a few minutes. Good night.</p>

        <p><hi>At</hi> length I have reached the state of <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>, the land
	  <lb/>of Heroes. I have been in the state about three hours, and
	  <lb/>already I seem to tread on sacred ground.<anchor xml:id="a02" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n02"/> As I rode to the
	  <lb/>Inn, where I now am, I was informed, that I was in <placeName rend="slant(italic)">Tennessee</placeName>,
	  <lb/>and I immediately fell into a train of pleasant musing. The
	  <lb/>victory of <name>New Orleans</name>, the battles of <name>Tallushatches</name>, <name>Talla­
	    <lb/>dega</name>, and <name>Emuckfau</name>, all passed, in retrospection before me—

	  <lb/>see him! thought I. I shall now be gratified with a sight of the
	  <lb/>brave <name>Tennesseeans</name>, whose valour has secured forever the
	  <lb/>honour of their state!</p>
        <p>After the necessary attention to ourselves, horses, &amp;c. the
	  <lb/>landlord appeared to be at leisure, and I began a desultory
	  <lb/>conversation with him on the subject of his state. He inform­
	  <lb/>ed me, that he had been only two years an inhabitant of the
	  <lb/>state, having removed hither from <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>. I found him
	  <lb/>disposed to bestow no very favorable encomiums upon the
	  <lb/><name>Tennesseeans</name>: in fact, he endeavored to impress me with an
<pb n="17"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="3(1)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">17</mw>
	  <lb/>opinion, redounding very little to the honor of their moral char­
	  <lb/>acter. He related the story of a robbery, which had lately been
	  <lb/>committed at the next house of entertainment, in that direction
	  <lb/>in which we were travelling. I am amongst the few that do
	  <lb/>not credit evil reports upon slight grounds, and concluded that
	  <lb/>in the present instance, rivalry, or something else that the
	  <lb/>landlord thought proper to conceal, was the cause of this ill­
	  <lb/>natured <unclear>al</unclear>umny; which I found in the end to be true. I was
	  <lb/>however gratified this evening in becoming acquainted with
	  <lb/>one of the subaltern officers, who served under <persName>General Jack­
	    <lb/>son</persName> as a volunteer. He came to the inn for the purpose of
	  <lb/>passing the night there; and finding he had been in the army,
	  <lb/>I attached myself to him the residue of the evening. He be­
	  <lb/>stowed the highest praise on <persName>General Jackson</persName>, and related
	  <lb/>many anecdotes of that great man, among which were the two
	  <lb/>following—one of which concerns his deportment whilst he was
	  <lb/>a judge.</p>
        <p>One day, when he was sitting on the bench at <placeName>Jonesbo­
	    <lb/>rough</placeName>, the sheriff came into the court and informed him that
	  <lb/>the man (charged with the commission of some offence) would
	  <lb/>not be taken. Summon every man in the court yard, said the
	  <lb/>judge. The sheriff did so, and approached the man a second
	  <lb/>time; but the notorious offender placed his back against the
	  <lb/>stone wall of a house, and, with arms in his hands, set his
	  <lb/>pursuers at defiance. Hereupon the sheriff once more com­
	  <lb/>plained to the judge, that the man would not be taken. Did
	  <lb/>you summon all the men in the court yard? asked the judge.—
	  <lb/>I did, replied the sheriff; but he is armed, and none of the men
	  <lb/>will approach him. But summon <emph>every</emph> man you <emph>see</emph>, said the
	  <lb/>judge: and the sheriff, taking the hint, answered—<said>I summon
	    <lb/><emph>you</emph>, then sir,</said>—whereupon the judge arose, came down from
	  <lb/>the bench, approached the man, took him, and delivered him
	  <lb/>to the sheriff.</p>
        <p>The other anecdote relates to his conduct towards <persName rend="slant(italic)">With­
	    <lb/>erford</persName>, the <name>Indian</name> Chief, who commanded at <name>Fort Mims</name>, the
	  <lb/>scene of a then recent inhuman butchery by the <name>Indians</name>. After
	  <lb/>the battle of the <name>Horse Shoe</name>, the <name>Indians</name> sued for peace; and
	  <lb/><persName>Jackson</persName>, to prove their sincerity, ordered them to bring

	  <lb/><persName>Witherford</persName>, bound, to his camp. Learning what <persName>Jackson</persName> de­
	  <lb/>manded, <persName>Witherford</persName> determined to go and surrender himself
	  <lb/>voluntarily. He gained <persName>Jackson's</persName> camp without being known,
	  <lb/>and desired admittance to the General. <persName>Jackson</persName>, astonished
	  <lb/>at his presumption, asked him how he dared to appear in his
	  <lb/>presence, after acting such a part as he did at <placeName>Fort Mims</placeName>?
	  <lb/><persName>Witherford</persName> replied—<said>I am <persName>Witherford</persName>: I am in your power.
	    <lb/>Do with me what you please. I am a soldier still. I have
	    <lb/>done the white people all the harm I could. I have fought
	    <lb/>them, and fought them bravely. If I had an army, I would
	    <lb/>fight them still. But I have none! My people are no more!!
	    <lb/>Nothing is left me but to weep over the misfortunes of my
	    <lb/>country.</said></p>
        <p><persName>Jackson</persName>, admiring the firmness of his address, told him,
	  <lb/>that if he rejected his (<persName>Jackson's</persName>) terms, although he (<persName>Wither­
	    <lb/>ford</persName>) was completely in his power, he (<persName>Jackson</persName>) would take
	  <lb/>no advantage of his situation—that he was at liberty to return
	  <lb/>to his own camp. <said rend="post()">But if,</said> said Jackson, <said rend="pre()">you choose to try the
	      <lb/>fate of arms once more, and I take you prisoner, your life
	      <lb/>shall pay the forfeit of your crimes. But if you really wish
	      <lb/>for peace, stay where you are, and I will protect you.</said></p>
        <p><said>Well may you speak to me in this style, now!</said> replied
	  <lb/><persName>Witherford</persName>. <said>There <emph>was</emph> a time, when I <emph>had a choice</emph>. I have

        <p><hi><placeName>Nashville</placeName></hi>, like everything else, sounds louder at a dis­
	  <lb/>tance than when it draws near. At the distance of a mile
	  <lb/>from the town, you see a board, with a hand painted on it as
	  <lb/>large as life, and the fore finger pointing with the following
	  <lb/>inscription, in large letters, underneath—<quote rend="slant(italic)">Look and see the
	    <lb/>Town!</quote> Upon looking down the road, you see the town,
	  <lb/>sure enough. It has a beautiful appearance, when viewed
	  <lb/>from this point. As  you approach it, you are so much
	  <lb/>engrossed by its lofty looks, from which it is difficult to avert
	  <lb/>your eyes, that you would be apt to plunge into the narrow
	  <lb/><placeName>Cumberland</placeName>, which flows between you and <quote>the Town.</quote> We,
	  <lb/>however, did happen not to do so; but preferred a boat, which
	  <lb/>met us in good time.</p>
        <p><placeName>Nashville</placeName> is built on a high bluff, and the houses look very
	  <lb/>much like tumbling on your head, as you cross the river in a small
	  <lb/>boat at what is called the middle ferry. The citizens have, with
	  <lb/>much labor and expense, cut a passage through this bluff, large
	  <lb/>enough for carriages to pass and repass. This passage, which is
	  <lb/>cut through a solid rock, turns abruptly down the river as if to seek
	  <lb/>a more commodious place to land the passengers, who receive no
	  <lb/>sort of hospitality or attention from the high minded gentleman,
	  <lb/>who looks down upon them while crossing the <placeName>Cumberland</placeName>. I was
	  <lb/>much disappointed in the size of this far famed <placeName>Cumberland
	  <lb/>river</placeName>. Although the large barges on it seem to indicate that
	  <lb/>there is much water, yet it is very narrow and steals softly
	  <lb/>along, its blue smooth waters making not the least noise.</p>
        <p>The soil of West <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>, north of <placeName>Cumberland river</placeName>,
	  <lb/>is very rich and equally as productive as any in <placeName>Kentucky</placeName> or

	  <lb/>on the <placeName>Kenhawa</placeName>—it is an open plain of uninterrupted good
	  <lb/>land; and the farmers raise corn, tobacco, and pumpkins,
	  <lb/>in great abundance. They rear great numbers of hogs and
	  <lb/>horses, and have a great many distilleries in operation. In
	  <lb/>this way they convert their surplus produce into cash. But
	  <lb/>neither their hogs nor horses are so large as those of <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>;
	  <lb/>nor can their cattle be compared, in size, with those of that
	  <lb/>state.</p>
        <p>I am afraid my brave <name>Tennesseeans</name> indulge too great a
	  <lb/>fondness for whiskey. When I was in <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, it was too
	  <lb/>much whiskey—in <placeName>Ohio</placeName>, too much whiskey—in <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>, it
	  <lb/>is too, too much whiskey! But I must relate an anecdote of a
	  <lb/>blind man, before I take leave of the north side of <placeName>Cumberland
	    <lb/>river</placeName>.</p>
        <p>We slept, last night, about ten miles north of <placeName>Nashville</placeName>.
	  <lb/>When we stopped at the stile in order to dismount, we observed
	  <lb/>a gentleman of middle age and decent dress, standing in the 
	  <lb/>yard with a cane in his hand, apparently giving direction to
	  <lb/>a servant, who was feeding the cattle: as soon as we stopped our
	  <lb/>horses, he pointed his cane towards us and told the servant to go
	  <lb/>and take those horses. When we had crossed the stile, this
	  <lb/>gentleman saluted us very politely, and asked us to walk into
	  <lb/>the house. After giving directions relative to our horses, he
	  <lb/>also came in, took a seat, and entered into conversation with
	  <lb/>us. It was now dark. Some men, whom we found there,
	  <lb/>when we stopped, asked <said>how much is there to pay?</said> The
	  <lb/>landlord, who was no other than the gentleman whom we first
	  <lb/>saw in the yard, told them the amount; they gave him some
	  <lb/>money, and he walked to his desk, took out the requisite
	  <lb/>change, and gave it to them. He then walked out of doors,
	  <lb/>was gone sometime, returned, took a chair, sat down by the fire,
	  <lb/>and continued to converse with us till bed-time. But g<choice><sic/><corr>u</corr></choice>ess my 
	  <lb/>astonishment, upon being informed, that this man was totally
	  <lb/>blind! and had not distinguished day from night for ten years.
	  <lb/>His wife, who is one of the finest women I have seen, says, that
	  <lb/>most travellers who spend the night there, go away without
	  <lb/>discovering that he is blind—that he could change specie to
	  <lb/>any amount correctly, but in changing notes, or bills, she had
	  <lb/>to tell him the amount of the bills.</p>

        <p><placeName>Nashville</placeName> is principally built of bricks, and is very hand­
	  <lb/>some, and does much business. In size it is nearly as large as <placeName>Lex­

	  <lb/>the character of my hostess. The old man had not made his
	  <lb/>appearance, being, as she said, out in the field to look after
	  <lb/>his hands, (meaning his slaves) for he is rich. My landlady is
	  <lb/>not homely: she is about forty, low, corpulent, and has a coun­
	  <lb/>tenance that sets one at defiance. She was all bluster, bustle
	  <lb/>and anxiety, as if she actually intended to give the lie to the
	  <lb/>old proverb, that <quote><placeName>Rome</placeName> was not built in a day.</quote> She would
	  <lb/>go out, come in, sit down, get up, and walk to the door and
	  <lb/>call as loud as if the house were on fire—<said rend="post()"><persName>Luke</persName>, an't you done

        <p>In the midst of the scrape a lad came in, who, it seems,

	  <lb/>the room to dispose of her bonnet; and finding a stranger in the
	  <lb/>house, she frisked back, and began to adjust her Feginny
	  <lb/>cloth dress. Not so, the old lady; but before she opened the
	  <lb/>flood-gate of her tongue, I made my escape to my chamber.
	  <lb/>The apartment, however, being on the same floor, I heard the
	  <lb/>whole lecture distinctly, like a torrent, overwhelming the new
	  <lb/>married pair. You know how quick those negro-raised <name>Tuc­

	    <lb/>your 'state—I'd put him in jail, this very night, before he

        <p>On a sudden she stopped; but soon she exclaimed, <said>No!
	    <lb/>you may go some wha, else—I takes no <emph>sich</emph> trash as you is,
	    <lb/>into my house!</said> The person, whom she addressed, was a fe­
	  <lb/>male, who spoke so low that I could not distinguish her words
	  <lb/>clearly. It was a bitter cold evening; the sun was setting; and
	  <lb/>I framed an excuse of asking for water, to go into the apart­
	  <lb/>ment to ascertain whether she was such a savage as to turn 
	  <lb/>the woman out of doors. When I entered the apartment, I
	  <lb/>beheld a poor, but decent-looking woman, with a child in her
	  <lb/>arms, standing in the door—the wretch had not asked her to
	  <lb/>the fire, nor offered her a seat. Poor woman! thought I, you
	  <lb/>have happened to fall in here in a bad time. I ventured to
	  <lb/>soften the brute of a landlady, and expostulated with her very
	  <lb/>mildly upon the cruelty of turning a fellow-creature out of
	  <lb/>doors on such a night! The poor woman turned her eyes upon
<pb n="24"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="3(4)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">24</mw>
	  <lb/>me in grateful silence. It came into my head to try the effect
	  <lb/>of money upon this she-imp. I offered to pay her double the
	  <lb/>poor woman's expenses—but no! oceans of grace would not
	  <lb/>melt <emph>her</emph> heart to pity. I might as well have attempted to stop
	  <lb/>the mouth of a roaring lion as to soften her more than savage 
	  <lb/>heart. <said>Let her go long, wha ever she's goin—I 'spose she's
	    <lb/>bin with the sojers: how came she by herself? I'm not goin to
	    <lb/>have my house scandalized by no sich trash—I got nuff of um
	    <lb/>last fall, stopp'n here; and when I come to find out, nothin 'tall
	    <lb/>but strumpits come from camp. I 'spose you the same—so you
	    <lb/>may clear yourself.</said></p>
        <p>The poor woman, during this speech, was struggling to
	  <lb/>suppress the big tear, which, in spite of her efforts, rolled
	  <lb/>down her cheeks—she was alone, on foot, and carrying a child.
	  <lb/>I asked her how far she had to travel. She answered that
	  <lb/>she believed it was fifteen miles; that she was going to see her
	  <lb/>husband, who was lying sick on the road; and that he was re­
	  <lb/>turning home from <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>, when he was taken so ill he
	  <lb/>could travel no farther. I endeavored to comfort her, giving
	  <lb/>her a trifle at the same time. The sun was now in the horizon,
	  <lb/>and I told her she had better proceed, lest night should over­
	  <lb/>take her, since the landlord said the nearest house was two
	  <lb/>miles distant. <said>It's not a great distance,</said> said I; <said>keep a
	    <lb/>good heart—it cannot be possible that there are many such
	    <lb/>people as these,</said> darting a look of contempt at the landlord at
	  <lb/>the same time, who must be a pusillanimous wretch to suffer
	  <lb/>his wife to usurp his prerogatives to the great dishonor of
	  <lb/>his head and heart. The woman departed. Had my horse
	  <lb/>been able to travel, I could willingly have left this house with her,
	  <lb/>sought another lodging. I stood in the door looking after her and
	  <lb/>for some minutes. To that God, <quote>who tempers the wind to
	    <lb/>the shorn lamb</quote>—even to him, who says to the wicked thus far
	  <lb/>shalt thou go, and no farther, did I breathe a supplication in

        <p><hi>I had</hi> been in my apartment but a short time when I was
	  <lb/>called to supper, which was excellent, considering the eternal
	  <lb/>clatter of this woman's tongue. I was silent, all her obsolete po­
	  <lb/>liteness notwithstanding; and, it was <said>would I be <emph>hope</emph> to this,
	    <lb/>and would I be <emph>hope</emph> to that?</said> During our repast, I showed, by my
	  <lb/>looks, as much as possible, my abhorrence of her conduct;
	  <lb/>and the moment I had finished my supper, I retreat­
	  <lb/>ed once more to my chamber. I called for more wood and
	  <lb/>stirred up my fire; and having given orders relative to my
	  <lb/>horse and dismissed my servant, I fell into the following train
	  <lb/>of reflections on the nature and character of woman! <said>Yes, I
	    <lb/>knew that would come next,</said> you will say. Very well; you
	  <lb/>guessed right, for once.</p>
        <p>It is said that woman is the last—best—gift of the Creator.
	  <lb/>She is celebrated by poets—praised by historians—extolled
	  <lb/>by travellers—and by all authors, both ancient and modern,
	  <lb/>is allowed to excell the other in every virtue that dwells in the
	  <lb/>human heart. Woman are renowned for wit, learning, taste,
	  <lb/>and talents. <persName>Pack</persName>, <persName>Ledyard</persName>, 
	  <persName>Weld</persName>, <persName><placeName>Liancourt</placeName></persName>, and many
	  <lb/>others, have proclaimed aloud to the world the obligations they
	  <lb/>are under to women, who at the hazard of their lives flew to
	  <lb/>their assistance in the hour of danger. When abandoned to
	  <lb/>despair, afflicted with disease, famine, and in death—woman,
	  <lb/><quote>lovely woman,</quote> stood before them; and, like an angel, dis­
	  <lb/>pelled their fears, relieved their wants, and soothed their sorrows.
	  <lb/>The <persName>Duke of <placeName>Liancourt</placeName></persName>, who narrowly escaped the guillotine
	  <lb/>in <placeName>France</placeName>, and who owed his life to the friendship of a woman,
	  <lb/>has drawn their character with a master's hand. <quote>Their
	    <lb/>friendship,</quote> he says, <quote>is inviolable, their fidelity unshaken, their
	    <lb/>courage invincible. They are intimidated by no difficulty,
	    <lb/>and bid defiance to dangers. Amiable woman! When man
	    <lb/>desponds, she animates him with new hopes—when he is sick,
	    <lb/>she ministers unto him—when in distress, she comforts him,
	    <lb/>bids him live, and makes him in love with himself. And well
<mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(+2)">4</mw>

<mw type="pageNum">26</mw>
	    <lb/>can she soothe and comfort him: she is all patience, she is all
	    <lb/>fortitude. The endearment of her smiles, the melting accents
	    <lb/>of her voice, and her bewitching softness, beguile him of his
	    <lb/>sorrows and makes his prison a palace!</quote> In short, it would
	  <lb/>be endless to enumerate examples of that decided superiority
	  <lb/>of women over men in acts of benevolence.</p>
        <p>But, fair and softly—who are the objects of this divine
	  <lb/>excellence?—Man—<emph>not</emph> woman—not their own helpless, friend­
	  <lb/>less, cheerless, forlorn sex—but <emph>men</emph>, who by their nature and
	  <lb/>constitutions are every way better calculated to bear misfor­
	  <lb/>tunes. <quote>But this preference, which is manifested towards man,
	    <lb/>almost to the exclusion of their own sex in redressing their
	    <lb/>grievances, is founded in nature, from which they cannot devi­
	    <lb/>ate.</quote> I admit it—I make every allowance for that immuta­
	  <lb/>ble law that pervades the material world. I would not dissolve
	  <lb/>it if I could, and particularly that mutual predilection that the
	  <lb/>sexes have for each other, independently of moral obligation.
	  <lb/>In my judgment it is the basis of all our social happiness.
	  <lb/>The result, then, from this view of the case is, that this irri­
	  <lb/>sistable influence, flowing from necessity, reflects neither praise
	  <lb/>nor blame on the female character. But does it follow that
	  <lb/>this impulse, which discovers itself in acts of noble gene­
	  <lb/>rosity towards men, should dispose them to a contrary course
	  <lb/>of conduct towards their own sex? I presume not. At most, it
	  <lb/>leaves them free to avoid doing them harm. If they choose
	  <lb/>not to relieve their sufferings, they could pass on as the Priest
	  <lb/>and the <name>Levite</name> did of old—But no—cruel woman does not
	  <lb/>imitate those holy men, and much less the good <name>Samaritan</name>.
	  <lb/>When woman is the subject—woman is all hostility, either
	  <lb/>directly or indirectly, in public, in private, in adversity, in
	  <lb/>prosperity, in the palace, in the cottage; in all alike a deep
	  <lb/>rooted malignity seem to prevail! In the most civilized nations,
	  <lb/>in the most civilized age, in the most polished circles of society,
	  <lb/>history affords us a lamentable evidence that the <emph>general</emph> ten­
	  <lb/>or of woman to her own sex, is envious, deceitful, malicious,
	  <lb/>haughty, bitter, insolent, revengeful, treacherous, implacable.
	  <lb/>However specious they may carry themselves, while in each
	  <lb/>other's presence, no sooner do they turn their backs, than most

	  <lb/>of them indulge more or less in some species of detraction,
	  <lb/>from the sly insidious hint to broad assertion.</p>
        <p>I never in my life witnessed an assembly of women, great
	  <lb/>or small, but indulged in that most hateful of all vices, slander
	  <lb/>against her own sex!</p>
        <p>What a picture you will say of a woman—yet my dear sir,
	  <lb/>all this your candor will admit!</p>
        <p>Were you <emph>not</emph> present once when the news of the unfortu­
	  <lb/>nate―― ――was announced?—I think you were. It was
	  <lb/>then you saw the true character of woman. It is needless to
	  <lb/>repeat the peals of artillery discharged from their tongues upon
	  <lb/>the unfortunate. I recollected well, and so might you, the whole
	  <lb/>posse, with rage (instead of pity for the frailty of the sex) in
	  <lb/>their looks; they hunted down their prey, more like blood
	  <lb/>hounds than human beings, and the forlorn sufferer was
	  <lb/>spurned from society! This is a pretty general case.</p>
        <p>Whither was this unfortunate to go?—seduced!—betray­
	  <lb/>ed!—abandoned!—by whom?—By man—by man who was
	  <lb/>designed to protect her. Inhuman villain! He robbed her of
	  <lb/>that <quote>which not inriches him, and makes her poor indeed.</quote>
	  <lb/>Poor, forlorn, and friendless as thou art, thou needest not go to
	  <lb/>thy own sex for shelter. As well might thou apply to the
	  <lb/>savage beasts of prey.—What then?—Go to man?—O no.
	  <lb/>He is the cause of all thy wo! An outcast must thou roam,
	  <lb/>unpitied and forgot.</p>
        <p>All this time not a word of reproach is uttered against
	  <lb/>the seducer: This is strange, <quote>But he is a wicked profligate,
	    <lb/>unworthy of respect, and ought to be banished society.</quote> No
	  <lb/>such thing!! He is received into company—he is invited to all
	  <lb/>our parties—nay, he is a <emph>greater</emph> favorite than ever with the
	  <lb/>ladies. Oh, fie! not for his virtue I presume, but for what all
	  <lb/>thinking people will concur in, viz: a similarity of taste—de­
	  <lb/>pravity of heart—and, above all, that secret something which
	  <lb/>is paramount to all motives and resists education.</p>
        <p>But I deny that this innate principle, which is involuntary,
	  <lb/>acts as an incentive to cruelty to their own sex, which is vol­
	  <lb/>untary. Does it bind them hand and foot? Does it control
	  <lb/>the faculties of the mind? Thousands of females come to a
<pb n="28"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="4(2)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">28</mw>
	  <lb/>miserable end, not by the cruelty of man, but by the savage­
	  <lb/>ness of their own sex. These unhappy sufferers, without house
	  <lb/>or home!—without friends!—destitute!—driven out from socie­
	  <lb/>ty!—doomed to roam through winter's storms!—perhaps with­
	  <lb/>out clothes to put on or bread to eat! I weep for you!—it is all
	  <lb/>I can do! May the God of mercy have mercy on you. Long,
	  <lb/>long, heavily will ye have to suffer in a world where repen­
	  <lb/>tance is vain! Your sorrows are without hope!!!</p>
        <p>But you will say, what would I have ladies to do? Take
	  <lb/>such persons into their houses, associate with them? They
	  <lb/>would be thought no better<anchor xml:id="a06" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n06"/>—<quote>Every one is known by their
	    <lb/>company.</quote> Yes—if they repent, I would not only take them
	  <lb/>into my house, but into my bosom. I would wipe the tears 
	  <lb/>from their eyes—I would soothe their sorrows, and support
	  <lb/>them in the trying hour; I would divide my last morsel with
	  <lb/>them!!</p>
        <p>For those who would not repent,—if they were hungry I
	  <lb/>would feed them; if they were naked, I would clothe them; and
	  <lb/>much more, if they were sick, would I minister unto them; I
	  <lb/>would admonish them, and I would then have done. What did
	  <lb/>our Saviour? I would not revile them; I would not persecute
	  <lb/>them. Good night! I beg pardon, once more, for troubling
	  <lb/>you with a long letter. I was led on by my feelings.</p>

        <p><hi>I found</hi> my horse better this morning, and with no other
	  <lb/>company than my servant, I bade my entertainers adieu. The
<pb n="29"/>

<mw type="pageNum">29</mw>
	  <lb/>family, when I left them, were preparing to attend preaching—
	  <lb/>for with all the old lady's good qualities, she is in the Church!
	  <lb/>None attending it but the mother and her daughter! Mighty
	  <lb/>good <name>Christians</name>, thought I. Of what denomination, I inquir­
	  <lb/>ed? A <name>Methodist</name>. I suspect that one of the same is here
	  <lb/>now, a guest, with two others beside myself. The Inn is kept
	  <lb/>by <persName>Mr. Reynolds</persName>, and looks very well.</p>
        <p>The parson looks very holy: sighs very often and loud; so
	  <lb/>there is no mistake. His dress is a black, sleek, broadcloth
	  <lb/>coat, blue pantaloons and vest, with short skirts (domestic:) his
	  <lb/>cravat is white, and tied on very closely. He is about the
	  <lb/>middle size, young, ignorant, and very important. He scarce­
	  <lb/>ly deigns to cast a look at us, poor sinners; and when he does,
	  <lb/>he withdraws his eyes with conscious triumph! The other
	  <lb/>guests are a good natured Yankee pedlar, and a gentleman of
	  <lb/>genteel appearance. I shall let them rest till after supper.—
	  <lb/>I promise myself much amusement with the parson and the 
	  <lb/>pedlar.</p>
        <p>Prepared with my pencil, I waited some time; nothing to
	  <lb/>do—all set mute. At length the pedlar, throwing his sparkling
	  <lb/>black eyes around upon the company, addressed his holyness
	  <lb/>with, <said>be you travelling Mister?</said> The parson, turning his
	  <lb/>gloomy face towards the speaker, as if his immaculate pu­
	  <lb/>rity was now about to be tarnished by this vile pedlar, answer­
	  <lb/>ed him with a look of contempt; after an interval of some
	  <lb/>seconds, he said, <said>I am travelling the <emph>circuit</emph>.</said> <said>I guess,
	    <lb/>if you travels the <emph>circle</emph> I bin, you'll have bad travelin on't,</said>
	  <lb/>said the pedlar. The third gentleman whose name, I find is
	  <lb/><persName>K――</persName>, asked, if <said>the road was worse towards <placeName>Huntsville</placeName>?</said>—
	  <lb/><said>I guess you'l find purty much so<anchor xml:id="a07" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n07"/>—tarnation swamps and

	    <lb/>gets to hum agin I'll stay there.</said> <said>Have you made good sales,

	    <lb/>if they had no sense; guess they'll know more on't when I tak't
	    <lb/>to 'um.</said></p>
        <p>While he was speaking, the hostler made his appear<choice><sic>e</sic><corr/></choice>ance
	  <lb/>to know how much oats each traveller wished to give his
	  <lb/>horse. The pedlar was the first to reply. He said, he <said>won
	    <lb/>to have his horses have two gallon a piece.</said> <said>I have fed
	    <lb/>yours, sir.</said> <said>You hadn't ought to fed 'um; I guess you'll
	    <lb/>gi'um too much.</said></p>
        <p>It appeared the pedlar was direct from <placeName>Huntsville</placeName>, and
	  <lb/>he had put up for the night long before I arrived. <persName>Mr. K.</persName> is
	  <lb/>travelling that way, and so also is the preacher. The preach­
	  <lb/>er, I suspect, thought the <name>Yankee</name> below him, (but so thought
	  <lb/>not I,) and <persName>Mr. K.</persName> above him. I made some remarks on the
	  <lb/>country, addressed to <persName>Mr. K.</persName> who is a man of intelligence.
	  <lb/>We descanted upon the progress of society, agriculture, &amp;c.</p>
        <p>Supper being over, <persName>Mr. K.</persName> and myself dipped a little into
	  <lb/>the sciences, merely from mutual curiosity. Could we have
	  <lb/>drawn the pedlar and the preacher in, it would have been 
	  <lb/>worth repeating; but, as you hate <emph>learning</emph> (and so do I, be­
	  <lb/>tween familiar friends,) I pass it over.</p>
        <p>The people generally, through this state, so far, are almost
	  <lb/>the middle grade as to information. If you ask how far it is
	  <lb/>to the next house?—<said>Well, I don't know</said>—Does such a man
	  <lb/>live on the road? <said>Well he does.</said> They have the <quote rend="slant(italic)">well</quote> to
	  <lb/>every thing, just as they do with us. There are a great many
	  <lb/><name>Methodists</name> in <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>, and in the new settled part of <placeName>Ken­
	    <lb/>tucky</placeName>. I have frequently seen them, and <emph>heard</emph> them, as I

        <p><hi>In</hi> my last, I forgot to inform you we passed the woman
	  <lb/>on the road who was turned out of doors. She informed me,

	  <lb/>riding in it when I passed her, yesterday, about twelve o'clock.
	  <lb/>The story she related I found was correct, having passed
	  <lb/>the house, to day, where her husband was confined. But,
	  <lb/>alas! no wife, nor home, nor children, will he <emph>ever see more—
	  <lb/>He is dead</emph>! I slept last night in a room adjoining to the one
	  <lb/>occupied by the preacher mentioned in my last; and, whether
	  <lb/>sitting up or in bed, I could not ascertain, but a long dialogue
	  <lb/>passed between him and some other person. This person was
	  <lb/>a man, I think one of the neighbors, as one came in after
	  <lb/>dark, who called the preacher <mentioned>Brother</mentioned>,—the person, whoever
	  <lb/>it was, was likely to bring disgrace on the <emph>church</emph>, in violating
	  <lb/>some of the rules, by intemperance, and something worse:

        <p><hi>I remember</hi> when you and I, sitting by my fireside, in
	  <lb/>that easy familiar frankness, indulged in our remarks on
	  <lb/>Priests—that they are always the same, let them be of what
	  <lb/>persuasion they may. I retain that opinion still! Hitherto I
	  <lb/>have only learned mankind in theory—but I am now studying
	  <lb/>him in practice. One learns more in a day, by mixing with
	  <lb/>mankind, than he can in an age shut up in a closet.</p>
        <p>But the Priests, I perceive, are precisely the same they
	  <lb/>were centuries passed—they all aim at power. Their drift, I
	  <lb/>see, is to gain as many proselytes as possible, without regard
	  <lb/>to the conduct of their flock—they will not suffer them to pos­
	  <lb/>sess any will of their own—perfect despots. No potentate is
	  <lb/>more despotic, and no subjects more submissive, whilst  in the
	  <lb/>presence of their Priests, but the greatest rogues in the world
	  <lb/>when out of sight. I perceive, too, they are very jealous in
	  <lb/>controversy. They seem to me as though they would fight in
	  <lb/>defence of their principles, while they leave the practice of
	  <lb/>religion to the sinners who make no fuss at all about religion.—
	  <lb/>Between you and I, <persName>Matt</persName>, this world is most abominably wick­
	  <lb/>ed. I have seen such sights—nothing but preaching and
	  <lb/>praying—and not one to relieve the poor. No! not one steps

        <p>Christ says, if you love me, keep  my commandments—and
	  <lb/>this is my commandment—that you love one another. This
	  <lb/>was our preacher's text last night. I should like to have this
	  <lb/>text indemnified for the depredation committed on it by his
	  <lb/>Reverence. His discourse was nothing by a hop, skip, and 
	  <lb/>jump—from one thing to another. Nothing but <said>hardened
	    <lb/>sinners you will go to hell and be d—d.</said> Why, the man
	  <lb/>swore outright. <said>The wickedness of this world; and the
	    <lb/>pleasures of this world; and the temptations of this world.</said>
	  <lb/><emph>Mem</emph>! thought of the affair of <quote>Brother,</quote> the <name>Irishman</name>, and
	  <lb/>his devout sister.</p>
        <p>Now for the righteous: <said>Press on ye mourners to the

	  <lb/>word on the subject of love to our neighbors.</p>
        <p>I never but once in my life heard a sermon to please me;
	  <lb/>and that was preached by a <persName>Mr. Sargent</persName>, sometime of <placeName>Ohio</placeName>.—
	  <lb/>But this preacher (as he is called) poured out a torrent of non­
	  <lb/>sense. The men groaned—the young ladies cried—the louder
	  <lb/>the preacher bawled, the louder they cried—at last they
	  <lb/>screamed!—Did you ever hear wolves howl? It was more like
	  <lb/>their howling than any thing else I can name. Is <emph>this</emph> religion?
	  <lb/>These would, like their sister, turn the poor friendless female
	  <lb/>from their door. But let facts speak. A gentleman removed
	  <lb/>to this country last year. He came on sometime before his
	  <lb/>family, in order to engage provisions for their arrival. Through
	  <lb/>some oversight, he forgot his money. The neighborhood con­
	  <lb/>sisted chiefly of professors of religion. He went to a man,
	  <lb/>who, as he was told, had a large quantity of bacon and corn for
	  <lb/>sale, and withal was very religious. He told him his situation:
	  <lb/>that he had a large family, both black and white, coming on,
	  <lb/>and he wished to purchase provisions sufficient for them till he
	  <lb/>could raise a crop; and that, when his family arrived, he would
	  <lb/>pay him. No!—He would not trust him. The applicant went
	  <lb/>to another and another, and still received the same answer.
	  <lb/>Thus discouraged, he at length inquired for the wickedest
	  <lb/>man in the neighborhood. He was told where to find him.
	  <lb/>He went to him, and related his situation, and what he wanted.

          <salute>Dear <persName>Matt</persName>,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p><hi>I am</hi> now within a short day's ride of <placeName>Huntsville</placeName>. I have
	  <lb/>travelled slow, on account of my horses, the roads being deep
	  <lb/>and heavy, such as the pedlar described them. The <emph>cane</emph> has
	  <lb/>made its appearance for some days past, and my servant has
	  <lb/>been breaking whole arm's full of pipe stems, and throwing
	  <lb/>them away alternately, as he finds they increase without end.
	  <lb/>Having never witnessed the growth of the cane before, I was
	  <lb/>much gratified to meet with it. It first appears scattering, very
	  <lb/><emph>slender</emph>, but tall, from eight to twelve feet high. It has blades
	  <lb/>like <name>Indian</name> cord, and some resemblance of a tassel on the top.
	  <lb/>It grows every where through the woods; but, as you proceed,
	  <lb/>it is larger and higher, and <emph>tons</emph> of it lie on the ground, on
	  <lb/>each side of the road, broken in pieces and rotting; and where
	  <lb/>this is the case, the green cane is extinct forever, doubtless.
	  <lb/>The cause of this I cannot learn. <emph>These</emph> stalks are larger
	  <lb/>than corn stalks, and must have been twenty feet in height!</p>
        <p>The land increases in fertility as we advance; and this 
	  <lb/>fertility extends a vast distance on each side of us. The land
	  <lb/>at this place, and <placeName>Fayetteville</placeName>, resembles that north of the
	  <lb/><placeName>Cumberland</placeName>, as black as your hat, and level.</p>
        <p>I have travell<choice><sic/><corr>e</corr></choice>d a south course since I left <placeName>Nashville</placeName>, from
	  <lb/>which <placeName>Huntsville</placeName> is distant 100 miles. <name>Pony</name>, (15 hands high!)
	  <lb/>is a horse of great patience and slow to anger, or he would
	  <lb/>have testified his displeasure at this same road: but he tugs
<pb n="36"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="5(2)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">36</mw>
	  <lb/>along without a murmur. We are now to have a change for
	  <lb/>the better.</p>
        <p>This inn is kept by a bachelor. His mother lives with
	  <lb/>him, and attends to the cooking department. The tavern is a
	  <lb/>separate building from the one occupied by the old lady, which 
	  <lb/>is also the kitchen. I was shown into the latter by the land­
	  <lb/>lord, and was pleased to find the house large, neat, and warm;
	  <lb/>but the lady looked old, cold, and crusty. Being very hungry,
	  <lb/>(not having dined,) my appetite was no little increased by the
	  <lb/>savory smell of bacon and cabbage, which <persName>Mrs. W.</persName> had sitting
	  <lb/>by her, very snug in the corner, for the family dinner.</p>
        <p>I knew from her looks, it would be a cross and pile chance
	  <lb/>whether she would condescend to set a part of it on the table 
	  <lb/>for me till she saw her own time. But, setting my wits to work,
	  <lb/>I prevailed finally, and made a hearty meal, cunningly, by the
	  <lb/>fire.</p>
        <p>There were two good beds, with curtains, in the room, and
	  <lb/>being weary, my next court to <persName>Mrs. Wells</persName> was, for liberty to
	  <lb/>repose on one of the beds: this was also granted. Thus every
	  <lb/>wish was gratified. Upon inquiry, I learned that the guests,
	  <lb/>should any arrive, dined in the kitchen, or what you choose to
	  <lb/>denominate it. Night was drawing on, and I was quite de­
	  <lb/>lighted with a place of concealment, should travellers arrive;
	  <lb/>and, drawing the curtains of a princely bed close, I lay still
	  <lb/>and snug out of sight.</p>
        <p>It was hog killing day at <persName>Wells'</persName>, and dinner was delayed
	  <lb/>till the business was over, and the table was sitting for dinner
	  <lb/>as I lay down, when, as I expected, word came <said>that two 
	    <lb/>travellers had arrived and wanted supper.</said> The lady return­
	  <lb/>ed for answer, <said>that the table was setting for her own family,
	    <lb/>and if they thought proper to accept such fare as she had
	    <lb/>ready, they were welcome, but that she would prepare nothing
	    <lb/>more tonight.</said> The Negro woman, who was charged with
	  <lb/>the message, remonstrated with her mistress, and said <said>coffee,
	    <lb/>or tea, ought to be made.</said> <said>No, I will make none to night;
	    <lb/>if they don't eat such as there is, they may go without.</said>
	  <lb/><said>Very well!</said> replied the woman; <said>you may do as you please,
	    <lb/><unclear>you</unclear> know, very well, <persName>Massa Tommy</persName> won't like it.</said> <said>Who
<pb n="37"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="5(3)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">37</mw>
	    <lb/>cares for your <persName>Massa Tommy</persName>, or you either,</said> said <persName>Mrs. W</persName>.
	  <lb/>Accordingly, the bacon and cabbage was placed on the table,
	  <lb/>with milk, in tin cups—plenty of corn bread—a small plate of
	  <lb/>butter, and all placed upon a table hard by your humble ser­
	  <lb/>vant.</p>
        <p>Highly delighted with my situation, ensconsed behind the
	  <lb/>curtains, I awaited the entrance of <persName>Mr. Tommy</persName> and the tra­
	  <lb/>vellers. The candle was lit, and our guests summoned to sup­
	  <lb/>per. I took a sly peep at them as they were sitting down.
	  <lb/>One was lame, and a small man, but had a genteel and manly
	  <lb/>appearance; the other was still less, with a small sallow face
	  <lb/>and a perfect dandy, or fop, who looked over the table with
	  <lb/>sovereign contempt.—Mean time the genteel looking man asked
	  <lb/>if he should help him? The fop hung back some time, but at
	  <lb/>last said, <said>yes, sah,</said> [sir,] a <name>Tuckahoe</name>, by the way [a citizen
	  <lb/>of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, below the <placeName>Blue Ridge</placeName>.] 
This was <gap extent="two letters" reason="flawed-reproduction" desc="printed"/>ts for me.
	  <lb/><persName>Tommy</persName>, who had likewise taken a seat, paid no attention to
	  <lb/>the strangers. He was a good looking man, rather swarthy,
	  <lb/>and about forty years of age.</p>
        <p>After eating some time, the little <name>Tuckahoe</name> erected him­
	  <lb/>self on his seat, and observed, without addressing any one in
	  <lb/>particular, <said>I believe you have no tea, no coffee in this country.</said>
	  <lb/>The old lady, with great composure replied, <said>sometimes.</said>
	  <lb/><said>You dosen't have any flower hea' neither.</said> The lady sung
	  <lb/>out <said>sometimes,</said> again. <said>I b'lieve you' all savages in this
	    <lb/>country.</said> <said>Savage enough.</said> said the lady quite in a good
	  <lb/>humour. Both gentlemen sat in my view, and the face
	  <lb/>of the other gentleman colored deep at foppy's remarks;
	  <lb/>who asked, with great spirit, <said>what country may you call
	    <lb/>yours, sir?</said> <said>I <distinct>ar</distinct> from <placeName>Norfolk</placeName>, <placeName>Virginny</placeName>, 
	    <distinct xml:id="a09" corresp="#n09" rend="slant(upright)post(*)">su'</distinct></said> <said>And
	    <lb/>how do they live there?</said> <said>Why, su', they live, su', like
	    <lb/>gentlemen, su'; I hasn't seen a bit of victuals fit to eat since I
	    <lb/>left <placeName>Norfolk</placeName>, except in <placeName>Nashville</placeName>.</said> <said>That is a great pity,
	    <lb/>sir,</said> said the other. <said>But we, of this country, do not rate
	    <lb/>ourselves by eating: we rate ourselves by fighting. Would
	    <lb/>you like to take a shot?</said></p>

        </opener>
        <p><hi>Here</hi> I am, landed safe and sound, and in high spirits.
	  <lb/>This will go by the same mail with yesterday's adventures.
	  <lb/>I broke off short last night, being sleepy: but, taking up the
	  <lb/>subject—The little man dropped his feathers quite low, upon
	  <lb/>the departure of his friend, who, immediately arose and walked
	  <lb/>out of the house. The <name>Tuckahoe</name>, after asking the girl for
	  <lb/>mo' milk, and mincing awhile, left the table likewise, and
	  <lb/>walked into the tavern. Had the latter as much spunk as he
	  <lb/>had impudence, they certainly would have fought—but I heard
	  <lb/>no more of it. The old lady said, <said>if my <persName>Billy</persName> had been at
	    <lb/>home he would have slapped his jaws.</said></p>
        <p>This morning very early, upon sallying forth, I found my
	  <lb/>little fop inquiring for his <distinct>mar</distinct>, [mare,] and it was laughable
	  <lb/>enough to hear him insist upon sending his <distinct>mar</distinct> to water, the
	  <lb/>very self-same way we were going. <said>I always has my mar
	    <lb/><distinct>wartered</distinct> befo' I starts.</said></p>
        <p>They were both going to <placeName>Huntsville</placeName>, where the fighting
	  <lb/>gentleman lived, as I found in the course of the day. We will
	  <lb/>have a merry time of it, thought I; and, taking leave, we all
	  <lb/>set out.</p>
        <p>Having every prospect of a rainy day, we whipped on
	  <lb/>pretty brisk. I found the land high and dry after leaving
	  <lb/><persName>Wells'</persName>, and another change in the growth, which is very light,
	  <lb/>and in many places none at all. The land is of a redish black,
	  <lb/>light as ashes, and very rich.</p>
        <p>I attached myself to the <name>Tennesseean</name>, (he of <placeName>Huntsville</placeName>,)
	  <lb/>being pleased with his manners, and, above all, with his spirit.
	  <lb/>He related many anecdotes of the recent battles, and was very
	  <lb/>communicative on the situation and prospects of <seg xml:id="a10" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n10">the territory.</seg></p>
        <p>We had taken up more company, and at length the con­
	  <lb/>versation turned on the renown of <persName>General Jackson</persName>. My little
	  <lb/><name>Tuckahoe</name>, not pleased that he was overlooked in the conversa­
	  <lb/>tion, would some times be alongside, often before, but never be­

	  <lb/>hind. His hat stuck on the top of his head, to the hazard of
	  <lb/>falling off. He twisted and turned, his head now on one
	  <lb/>shoulder, and now on the other; and again elevated, and next
	  <lb/>bending forward to look at his stirrups. Finding all his evolu­
	  <lb/>tions failed to attract attention, after displaying all his fine
	  <lb/>parts, and the fine parts of his <distinct>mar</distinct>, he could brook the indig­
	  <lb/>nation no longer.—<said>By G—d, I suppose, you think <persName>General
	      <lb/>Jackson</persName> is a G—d almighty about here.</said> <said>By G—d, sir, I
	    <lb/>think he is next to him,</said> said the <placeName>Huntsville</placeName> man; <said>and none
	    <lb/>but a d—d fool would have made the remark.</said> Now thought
	  <lb/>I, they will fight. <said>You, nor no other man, Sir, shall speak
	    <lb/>disrespectfully of <persName>General Jackson</persName>, in my presence.</said> This
	  <lb/>spirited reply, rather cooled the little gentleman's <emph>ire</emph>. He
	  <lb/>ventured, however, to draw a comparison in favor of <persName>General
	    <lb/>Washington</persName>. The other said he <said>was disposed to acknowl­
	    <lb/>edge all possible praise of <persName>General Washington</persName>, but, at the
	    <lb/>same time, Sir, the man who dares to impugn the name of
	    <lb/><persName>Jackson</persName> in my presence, does it at his peril.</said> I begged the
	  <lb/>gentleman to resume his good humour, and turn the little gen­
	  <lb/>tleman over to me. Thus he fell out of the pan into the fire.
	  <lb/><said>That ar a fine mar of yours, <persName>Mr. Jones</persName>,</said> said I, that being
	  <lb/>his name. <said>How far have she toted you?</said> <said>She have toted
	    <lb/>me a thousand miles, and she could a toted me a thousand miles
	    <lb/>mo'.</said> I then inquired after the lobster family, at <placeName>Norfolk</placeName>;
	  <lb/>said I understood <said>they were a numerous and respectable
	    <lb/>family.</said> <said>Humph!</said> he replied. <said>I ar astonished to hear
	    <lb/>some folks talk: the lobsters ar a fish.</said><anchor xml:id="a11" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n11"/> Thus I continued to
	  <lb/>torment him, to the great amusement of the party. He had the
	  <lb/>only umbrella in company, and the <placeName>Huntsville</placeName> gentleman, who
	  <lb/>could scarcely sit on his horse for laughing, asked <said>if he
	    <lb/>would not compromise with the lady, by giving her the um­
	    <lb/>brella?</said> which I would not accept, though it rained moderately
	  <lb/>fast. He had the most scornful lip I ever beheld.</p>
        <p>The cotton fields now began to appear. These are aston­
	  <lb/>ishingly large; from four to five hundred acres in a field!— It
<pb n="40"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="5(4)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">40</mw>
	  <lb/>is without a parallel! Fancy is inadequate to conceive a pros­
	  <lb/>pect more grand! The cotton, as it now stands, has the ap­
	  <lb/>pearance of buckwheat when ripe, being divested of the cotton,
	  <lb/>(as my friend informed me,) which is picked out. Although
	  <lb/>the land is level, you cannot see the end of the fields either
	  <lb/>way. To a stranger, coming suddenly amongst these fields,
	  <lb/>it has the appearance of magic. He is lost in wonder, and
	  <lb/>nothing but the evidence of his senses can persuade him it is
	  <lb/>reality. In laboring to do this, I was forced to abandon my
	  <lb/>ideas of human industry, which I could not accommodate to this
	  <lb/>novel appearance.</p>
        <p>We arrived in <placeName>Huntsville</placeName> about 2 o'clock, P.M. and met
	  <lb/>another wonder at the entrance of the town, which was one of
	  <lb/>the great cotton machines.</p>

        <p><hi>A merry</hi> <name>Christmas</name> to you, in the first place. I was sa­
	  <lb/>luted by a few guns, last evening, which reminded me of old
	  <lb/>times.</p>
        <p>The face of the country has changed five times in my
	  <lb/>tour! From <placeName>Big Sandy River</placeName> (the boundary of <placeName>Kentucky</placeName> and
	  <lb/><placeName>Virginia</placeName>) to <placeName>Mount Sterling</placeName>, the soil is black, firm, uneven,
	  <lb/>and covered with heavy timber, beach and oak principally.</p>
        <p>From <placeName>Mount Sterling</placeName> to <placeName>Danville</placeName>, called first rate land,
	  <lb/>it is generally black as your hat, but in many places, for in­
	  <lb/>stance on the margin of creeks, it has a grayish color, and re­
	  <lb/>sembles calcined stone, and has a light crumbling appearance;
	  <lb/>the growth is locust, cherry, and walnut; very low, as I remark­
	  <lb/>ed before. I do not think it produces better than Kenhawa
	  <lb/>bottom. It is well watered. Some of the farms are wretched­
	  <lb/>ly managed. I was told these were the School lands.</p>
        <pb n="41"/>

        <mw type="pageNum">41</mw>
        <p>Upon leaving <placeName>Danville</placeName>, a very handsome little town, the
	  <lb/>timber gradually diminishes, and you are soon in the barrens,
	  <lb/>and the soil changes to a redish, or chocolate color, and very
	  <lb/>little water: but the land is rich and level. I forgot to inform
	  <lb/>you that I met with <persName>Mrs. Madison</persName>, the celebrated <persName>Patrick
	    <lb/>Henry's</persName> sister. She has removed to the barrens, and has an
	  <lb/>excellent farm. I dined at her house. She has two sons who
	  <lb/>live with her, both single; also, a grand daughter. She is
	  <lb/>quite an active woman, and very little inferior, it is said, to
	  <lb/>her brother, in mental powers. Seeing a house on the road,
	  <lb/>some distance ahead, I sent my servant forward to bespeak
	  <lb/>breakfast, concluding it was a tavern. When I rode up, what
	  <lb/>was my surprise to find <persName>Mrs. Madison</persName>, who formerly lived in
	  <lb/>the same county I did. I was invited in; but my companions,
	  <lb/>finding it was a private house, road on. But to return:—these
	  <lb/>barrens have no timber but black Jack. They continue to
	  <lb/><placeName>Red river</placeName>, in <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>, one hundred miles. They are not a
	  <lb/>dead, or prairie like level, but rather waving.</p>
        <p>Next to this comes on the lofty timbered black rich soil,
	  <lb/>and large grape vines, and continues to <placeName>Nashville</placeName>. Upon
	  <lb/>leaving <placeName>Nashville</placeName>, the red cedar begins, and though the land is
	  <lb/>still rich, it is much interrupted with swamps and stones. This
	  <lb/>is well watered. This description continues to <placeName>Fayetteville</placeName>,
	  <lb/>on <placeName>Elk river</placeName>, near the southern boundary of the state. There 
	  <lb/>again we have the black loam and heavy timber, till, within
	  <lb/>eighteen miles of <placeName>Huntsville</placeName>, when the chocolate land comes
	  <lb/>again, like the barrens; though light, it is not destitute of tim­
	  <lb/>ber; but water is very scarce; many have to haul the water
	  <lb/>three miles in summer.</p>
        <p>All these varieties of land extends from the mountains,
	  <lb/>on the left, to the <placeName>Ohio river</placeName> on the right.</p>
        <p>We forded all the rivers in <placeName>Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>, ex­
	  <lb/>cepting the <placeName>Kentucky river</placeName>, which is very often forded.</p>
        <p>The <name>Kentuckyans</name> are the handsomest people, by far, in
	  <lb/>the <placeName>United States</placeName>. They are not only stout men, but have
	  <lb/>fine features, and very beautiful complexions.</p>
        <p>The <name>Tennesseeans</name> are not so stout as the <name>Kentuckyans</name>,
	  <lb/>not so fair, but they are well shaped, and more active. There

<pb n="42"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="6(1)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">42</mw>
	  <lb/>is a native bold independence in both, with this difference—
	  <lb/>the <name>Kentuckyans</name> are great brags, whilst the <name>Tennesseeans</name>,
	  <lb/>equally brave and gallant, are wholly unconscious of those vir­
	  <lb/>tues. The <name>Kentuckyan</name> is rash and hot headed—the <name>Tennes­
	    <lb/>seean</name> is cool and steady. The <name>Kentuckyan</name> is froward and
	  <lb/>assuming—the <name>Tennesseean</name> is modest and retiring. There is
	  <lb/>an independence, even in the children, which is neither awed by
	  <lb/>fear nor won by love. But what astonished me was their careless
	  <lb/>indifference on the subject of their late gallant achievements,
	  <lb/>particularly at <name>New Orleans</name>. They spoke of it with perfect
	  <lb/>unconcern, and only mentioned it when applied to, and then
	  <lb/>with not half the same interest they would on the subject of
	  <lb/>hunting or killing a deer. Not so the <name>Kentuckyans</name>: they ap­
	  <lb/>preciate their bravery in its widest extent. Nor are the
	  <lb/><name>Tennesseeans</name> so distinguished as the former for industry, or
	  <lb/>the art of acquiring wealth; though both are great jockeys.</p>
        <p>The <placeName>Kentucky</placeName> ladies are very large, but are fair and well
	  <lb/>featured, and much  more polished (excepting the ladies of <placeName>Nash­
	    <lb/>ville</placeName>) than the ladies of <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>: but the latter are better
	  <lb/>shaped; are very artless; and the young women have a sweet
	  <lb/>simplicity in their looks and countenance. Both men and 
	  <lb/>women are without disguise, nor have they any of that imper­
	  <lb/>tinent curiosity common to other states; I mean that of teaz­
	  <lb/>ing travellers. But the most distinguishing trait of a <name>Tennes­
	    <lb/>seean</name> is, that he treats all men alike—the Nabob, with his
	  <lb/>splendid equipage, receives no more, nor as much attention,
	  <lb/>as the pedestrian. They are extremely jealous of wealthy, or
	  <lb/>what we call big, men. One of them, as I came on, being

        <p>Now here is the twentieth letter I have written, without
	  <lb/>receiving an answer to one of them, until to-day—and that is
	  <lb/>no answer I may say. What are you about? Have you got
	  <lb/>the blues again, or blacks; or are you in love? I have been
	  <lb/>thinking your complaint is altogether a love matter—I am 
	  <lb/>told it has that effect sometimes. Should that be the case, you
	  <lb/>had better apply to <emph>Dr. Matrimony</emph> at once, as delays are dan­
	  <lb/>gerous. <persName>Cupid</persName> is a cunning rogue—very likely he has given
	  <lb/>you a sly shot in your <emph>sleep</emph>.</p>
        <p>But seriously, I am sorry to hear you mend so slow. I
	  <lb/>am convinced this climate would restore you. It is summer
	  <lb/>here, compared to our country: the trees, many of them, are
	  <lb/>still green.</p>
        <p><placeName rend="case(allcaps)">Huntsville</placeName>. You will expect something of this
	  <lb/>flourishing town. It takes its name from a man called <persName>Captain
	    <lb/>Hunt</persName>, who built the first cabin on the spot, where the <name>Court 
	    <lb/>House</name> now stands, in <date when="1802">1802</date>. In front of this cabin, which was
	  <lb/>built on a high bluff, there was a large pond, which is now
	  <lb/>nearly filled up by the citizens. <persName>Captain Hunt</persName> cleared a small
	  <lb/>field west of his cabin, the same year. This was between his
	  <lb/>cabin and the <placeName>Huntsville Spring</placeName>. He spent much of his time
	  <lb/>in wageing war with the rattlesnakes, who were very numer­
	  <lb/>ous in his day, and had entire possession of the Bluff at the
	  <lb/>Spring. Thousands of them, it appears, were lodged amongst
	  <lb/>the rocks, and the Captain would shoot hundreds of a day, by
	  <lb/>thrusting long canes filled with powder, into the scissures<anchor xml:id="a12" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n12"/> of
	  <lb/>the rocks.</p>
        <p>Whether <persName>Hunt</persName>, or the snakes acquired victory, I have
	  <lb/>not heard, as he was compelled to abandon his settlement to a 
	  <lb/>more successful rival, who purchased the land. This was
	  <lb/><persName>Colonel L. Pope</persName>, who, in company with <persName>Dr. Maning</persName>, and
	  <lb/>others, purchased the land at a <orgName>Land Office</orgName> opened in <placeName>Nash­
<pb n="44"/>

	    <lb/>ville</placeName>; and though this sale did not stand, these gentlemen at
	  <lb/>this time own vast bodies of land around <placeName>Huntsville</placeName>, and are
	  <lb/>the wealthiest men in the Territory. <persName>Colonel Pope</persName>, it is said,
	  <lb/>tried hard to have the name changed, to <mentioned>Twickenham</mentioned>, after the
	  <lb/>residence of his namesake (and from whom it is said he is
	  <lb/>descended) in <placeName>England</placeName>. But, places, somehow or other, will
	  <lb/>retain their first names. The land around <placeName>Huntsville</placeName>, and
	  <lb/>the whole of <placeName>Madison county</placeName>, of which it is the capital, is rich
	  <lb/>and beautiful as you can imagine; and the appearance of wealth
	  <lb/>would baffle belief. The town stands on elevated ground, and
	  <lb/>enjoys a beautiful prospect. It contains about 260 houses,
	  <lb/>principally built of brick; has a bank, a court house<choice><sic>.</sic><corr>,</corr></choice> and mar­
	  <lb/>ket house. There is a large square in the centre of the town,
	  <lb/>like the towns in <placeName>Ohio</placeName>, and facing this are the stores, twelve
	  <lb/>in number. These buildings form a solid wall, though divid­
	  <lb/>ed into apartments.<anchor xml:id="a13" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n13"/> The workmanship is the best I have
	  <lb/>seen in all the states; and several of the houses are three stories
	  <lb/>high, and very large. There is no church. The people
	  <lb/>assemble in the <name>Court House</name> to worship. <placeName>Huntsville</placeName> is set­
	  <lb/>tled by people mostly from <placeName>Georgia</placeName> and the <placeName>Carolinas</placeName>—though
	  <lb/>there are a few from almost every part of the world;—and the
	  <lb/>town displays much activity. The citizens are gay, polite,
	  <lb/>and hospitable, and live in great splendor. Nothing like it in
	  <lb/>our country.</p>

        <p>To go on. The <placeName>Huntsville Spring</placeName>, is a great natural
	  <lb/>curiosity. This you, as well as myself, heard before. But I
	  <lb/>had no conception of it. It flows from under the Bluff men­
	  <lb/>tioned, and forms a stream large enough for the purposes of
<pb n="45"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="6(3)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">45</mw>
	  <lb/>navigation, and empties into <placeName>Indian Creek</placeName>, also navigable.
	  <lb/>The head of the spring is about sixty yards wide, but spreads
	  <lb/>out to a much greater length, covering about three acres of 
	  <lb/>ground!!! The Bluff, at its head, forms a perpendicular of 60
	  <lb/>or 70 feet in height, perhaps more, and is conical.</p>
        <p><placeName>Huntsville</placeName> is situated in latitude 34° 45″, 18 miles from
	  <lb/>the line of <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>, 100 South from <placeName>Nashville</placeName>, and 10 miles
	  <lb/>north of <placeName>Ditto's Landing</placeName> on <placeName>Tennessee river</placeName>.</p>
        <p><persName rend="case(allcaps)">General Coffee</persName>. Last evening I had the pleasure
	  <lb/>of seeing this renowned soldier and companion of <persName>General
	    <lb/>Jackson</persName>. This hero, of whom you have heard so much, is
	  <lb/>upwards of six feet in height, and proportionally made. Nor
	  <lb/>did I ever see so fine a figure. He is 35 or 36 years of age.
	  <lb/>His face is round and full, and features handsome. His com­
	  <lb/>plexion is ruddy, though sunburnt. His hair and eyes black,
	  <lb/>and a soft serenity diffuses his countenance. His hair is
	  <lb/>carelessly thrown one side, in front, and displays one of the
	  <lb/>finest foreheads in nature—high, smoothe, and retreating.
	  <lb/>His countenance has much animation, while speaking, and his
	  <lb/>eyes sparkle; but the moment he ceases to speak, it resumes
	  <lb/>its wonted placidness, which is a characteristic of the <name>Tennes­
	    <lb/>seeans</name>.</p>
        <p>In <persName>General Coffee</persName>, I expected to see a stern, haughty,
	  <lb/>fierce, warrior. No such thing. You look in vain for that
	  <lb/>rapidity with which he marched and defeated the <name>Indians</name> at
	  <lb/><name>Tallashatches</name>: nor could I trace in his countenance the swift­
	  <lb/>ness of pursuit, and sudden defeat of the <name>Indians</name> again at
	  <lb/><name>Emuckfau</name>; much less his severe conflicts at the head of his 
	  <lb/>gallant men at <name>New Orleans</name>. He is as mild as the dew drop;
	  <lb/>but deep in his soul you see very plain that deliberate, firm, 
	  <lb/>cool, and manly courage, which has covered him with glory.
	  <lb/>He must be a host when he is roused. All these <name>Tennesseeans</name>
	  <lb/>are mild and gentle, except they are excited, which is hard to
	  <lb/>do; but when they are once raised, it is victory or death.—
	  <lb/><persName>General Coffee</persName> speaken very slow, and may weigh about 200
	  <lb/>weight. <persName rend="slant(italic)">Major Rose</persName>, another of the heroes, is a <name>Scotch</name> gen­
	  <lb/>tleman, but a <placeName>Tennessee</placeName> soldier. You have not to look very
	  <lb/>deep for the qualities of his mind. It is plainly depicted in
<pb n="46"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="6(3)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">46</mw>
	  <lb/>his fine open countenance, and soft blue eye. He is a middle
	  <lb/>aged man, of portly size, and acted in the <orgName>Quartermaster's
	    <lb/>Department</orgName> in the late war. This man, from the land of <persName>Wal­
	    <lb/>lace</persName> and <persName>Bruce</persName>, was in high favor with <persName>General Jackson</persName>; and
	  <lb/>his labors in procuring supplies for the army were unequalled
	  <lb/>by any thing in history. He rode from the seat of war to
	  <lb/><placeName>Huntsville</placeName>, very often, without sleep or rest! proceeding night
	  <lb/>and day express: when one horse would give out he would
	  <lb/>press another. I am called to dinner.</p>

        <p>I learn that, next to <persName>General Jackson</persName>, <persName>General Carroll</persName> is
	  <lb/>the idol of the people. As I travelled through the state, I

	  <lb/>how these men doat on their officers. It would be a serious
	  <lb/>matter to say any thing against them in this country. <persName>Gene­
	    <lb/>ral Carroll</persName>, as well as <persName>General Jackson</persName>, are worshipped as
	  <lb/>Deities.</p>
        <p>When <persName>General Carroll</persName> was descending the <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>
	  <lb/>with his troops, to join <persName>General Jackson</persName> at <name>New Orleans</name>, he
	  <lb/>used to exercise his men by moonlight on the decks of the 
	  <lb/>boats, as they floated down the river, to fit them for the con­
	  <lb/>flict with the <name>British</name>, which awaited them on their arrival.
	  <lb/><persName>General Carroll</persName> is said to be a mild good natured man, and
	  <lb/>contributed no little to the brilliant victory of <name>New Orleans</name>.
	  <lb/>He commanded the centre of the American line.</p>
        <p>I understand a work is now in press, written by one of
	  <lb/><persName>Jackson<choice><sic/><corr>'</corr></choice>s</persName> aids, <persName>Major Eaton</persName>, in which we are to have the

        <p><hi>After</hi> packing up last evening for the Bluff, I sat mus­
	  <lb/>ing in my parlour, when all at once my ear was saluted with
<pb n="49"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="7(1)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">49</mw>
	  <lb/>the sound of mirth and jollity below. Eager to learn what
	  <lb/>was going on, I descended to the parlour, and there I found
	  <lb/>the sweet girl, the grave matron, the sparkling belle, the con­
	  <lb/>ceited fop, the modest young gentleman, vetran soldier, and 
	  <lb/>a sociable old planter. They were all talking and laughing
	  <lb/>about the gas, (all the rage,) planting cotton, courting, phi­
	  <lb/>losophy, biography, &amp;c. Every one expressed themselves with
	  <lb/>freedom and good humour; but I perceived great deference
	  <lb/>was paid to the old planter, a <name>Virginian</name> by birth, immensely
	  <lb/>rich, and a <emph>widower</emph>.</p>
        <p>I had scarcely seated myself when my landlady, a spright­
	  <lb/>ly black-eyed woman, and no fool either, joked the old planter
	  <lb/>about the girls. <said>Poh, poh.</said> said the planter, <said>I don't care
	    <lb/>a cent about the girls: why they won't let such an old fellow
	    <lb/>come within a squirrel's jump of 'em.</said> <said>But you must perse­
	    <lb/>vere—don't give up the ship—I'll engage you will succeed—
	    <lb/>many a girl would jump at you.</said> <said>Faith, that's the greatest fault
	    <lb/>I find with them; but instead of jumping at me, they jump away;
	    <lb/>and if I offer to lay my hand on one, she runs and squalls, as
	    <lb/>though I were a robber, and were tempting her life.</said> <said>But,</said>
	  <lb/>says the sprightly <persName>Mrs. Mosely</persName>, <said>there you are wrong: no
	    <lb/>one offers to touch a lady in these days. I am surprised at
	    <lb/>you. When you court a girl, you must set off at a dis­
	    <lb/>tance and talk to her; and write verses in her praise, and send
	    <lb/>them to her; the old time's fashion, when you and my mother
	    <lb/>were young people, will not do now-a-days.</said> <said>The d—l it 
	    <lb/>won't; then they may all die old maids for me. I tell you
	    <lb/>what, <persName>Mrs. M.</persName>, I think the <distinct>gals</distinct> was as virtuous in my young
	    <lb/>days, and may be, a little more so, then they are now—and
	    <lb/>many an arm have I laid round 'em, see.</said> <said>Oh, fie! don't 
	    <lb/>talk so—you will make the ladies faint. These were old times,
	    <lb/>the fashions have changed.</said> <said>Faith, I believe so; but it is
	    <lb/>from good to bad. I am opposed to all these new kick-ups.
	    <lb/>Whenever I see a gal so very coy and prudish, and won't let 
	    <lb/>a man come near her, it gives me a bad opinion of her; and
	    <lb/>I'll tell you why—when I was a young man, I happened to be
	    <lb/>at a ball—your mother was there too. So, there was one gal
	    <lb/>there; a m—i—g—h—t—y precise creature, and would not let me

	      <lb/>t—o—n—i—g—h—t,</said> and primped up and tossed her head, and cri­
	    <lb/>ed out to a friend, sitting by her, <said rend="pre(‘)post(’)">how odious it was, for men
	      <lb/>to be taking hold of ladies' hands—she was surprised at my
	      <lb/>presumption;</said> and not long after this, this same nice lady met
	    <lb/>with a misfortune ladies, which I leave you to guess. Ever 
	    <lb/>since that I marks 'em—I has my own opinion of 'em.</said> <said>La,
	    <lb/>what nonsense,</said> said the belle; <said>such talk <distinct>ar</distinct> quite ridiculous.</said></p>
        <p>While the old planter and the ladies were conversing,
	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Fop</persName> and the young gentleman were engaged in an anal­
	  <lb/>asys of the gases. <said>And what is gas?</said> inquired <persName>Mrs.
	    <lb/>Mosely</persName>: <said>I hear nothing but <emph>gas, gas, gas</emph>, where I go—
	    <lb/>and I know no more about it than a monkey. I have asked
	    <lb/>hundreds, and either they, or I, must be fools: Not a soul that
	    <lb/>I meet can explain it in terms I can comprehend. They stuff
	    <lb/>it with such a number of outrageous hard words, that I could
	    <lb/>understand <name>Greek</name> sooner. Now, gentlemen, do if you please,
	    <lb/>tell me in plain words what is this gas.</said> She looked at <persName>Mr.
	    <lb/>Fop</persName> as she spoke, who being appealed to, cocked his head, spit,
	  <lb/>and hemmed; and edging his chair towards the ladies, said:

	    <lb/>istry, Madam?</said> <said>No, I have not,</said> said <persName>Mrs. M.</persName>, in a pet,
	  <lb/><said>and I should not understand a word of it if I had. I despise 
	    <lb/>your theoreticals and practicals. I understand none of your
	    <lb/>hard names. If you cannot tell me, in plain <name>English</name>, what
	    <lb/>gas is; where it comes from; and what it is made of; or
	    <lb/>whether made at all, or not, you need say no more. I am sick
	    <lb/>of the gases.</said> Now, thought I, I shall hear what these gases
	  <lb/>are at last. She will certainly get it out of him. <said>There
	    <lb/>are several sorts of gases</said>—<said>Oh, if you have more than
	    <lb/>one gas, I am sure I will never understand it, so you may
	    <lb/>stop at once—just tell me what is gas!</said> <said>Gas, Madam, is
	    <lb/>a combination of certain substances, reduced to a gaseous state,
	    <lb/>formed by adding a solvent substance, and by their joint
	    <lb/>formation.</said> <said>Thank you, Sir, I have heard enough of it,</said>
	  <lb/>said the lady, very short and illnatured. She must be one of
	  <lb/>the Honourables, as he took it all in good humour.</p>

	    <lb/><persName>Mrs. M.</persName> this is more of your new fangled fashions, I suppose.
	    <lb/>What the d—l it means I don't know. It is like your new
	    <lb/>fashion of wooing. I mean no disparagement to you, ladies
	    <lb/>and gentlemen; but I thin<choice><sic>g</sic><corr>k</corr></choice> the good old times were the best;
	    <lb/>and I never herd a word about <distinct>Gashes</distinct>, or what you may call
	    <lb/>it. Landlord, times are dry, hand round some wine.</said> I was
	  <lb/>pleased to hear the order, though I could not join them, as I
	  <lb/>wished to hear the old man talk another talk.</p>
        <p>A little bustle succeeded, but in a short time all were seat­
	  <lb/>ed again; when I asked <persName>Mrs. M.</persName> if she gave up the gases?—
	  <lb/>The other young gentleman blushing deeply, and regarding
	  <lb/><persName>Mrs. M.</persName> earnestly, at first, faultering, but growing firm as he
	  <lb/>proceeded, (being very young) addressing himself to the ladies
	  <lb/>expressed himself nearly as follows: <said>Gas is a fluid substance,
	    <lb/>and is similar to air. It is transparent like water; and like
	    <lb/>water, elastic, forcing itself to its level. It is heavy, but invi­
	    <lb/>sible. It cannot be affected by cold, but can by heat. Gas
	    <lb/>exists throughout nature. There is gas, more or less, in all
	    <lb/>substances; and all gases (for as my friend said, there are
	    <lb/>several kinds of gas) are a combination of substances, such as
	    <lb/>common salt and water; to these add half their weight of sul­
	    <lb/>phuric acid; heat applied to these, gas is produced, and may
	    <lb/>be collected by an instrument suited to the purpose; but to
	    <lb/>retain it, it must be placed over mercury. There is gas in all
	    <lb/>substances, and of <emph>three</emph> distinct kinds, viz: Oxygen, hydrogen,
	    <lb/>and nitrogen, gas. These are produced by different processes,
	    <lb/>and their properties differ: Oxygen gas, for instance, is indis­
	    <lb/>pensable to the respiration of animals—it is the cause of ani­
	    <lb/>mal heat. In its artificial state, it will, when brought into
	    <lb/>contact with any combustion, burn, and emit a flame. Hydro­
	    <lb/>gen gas, is what was formerly called inflammable air. Animals
	    <lb/>will die in it instantly, as they cannot breathe in it, though
	    <lb/>vegetables will grow in it. When brought in contact with
	    <lb/>atmospheric air, or what is the same thing, oxygen gas, it
	    <lb/>will burn fiercely. Nitrogen gas, in its primitive state, will
	    <lb/><emph>not</emph> burn on touching combustion. In chymistry it has various
	    <lb/>uses. It is a component part of all animal substances, and
<pb n="52"/>

<mw type="pageNum">52</mw>
	    <lb/>communicates to them their most distinctive characters.</said> He
	  <lb/>concluded by adding, that he <said>had a very limited knowledge
	    <lb/>of the gases, having but just commenced the study of chymistry,
	    <lb/>and that it was a science the most difficult of all others to ex­
	    <lb/>plain to those who have not a practical knowledge of the
	    <lb/>same.</said> Loud were the plaudits of the ladies; and the old plan­
	  <lb/>ter said, <said>the young man must take a glass of wine with him:
	    <lb/>he spoke like a man of sense, though he (the planter) did not
	    <lb/>understand his <distinct>argufication</distinct>.</said> The party ended with a dance,
	  <lb/>and I retired shortly after they commenced, as I had to rise
	  <lb/>betimes.</p>

        <p><hi>I was</hi> three days on the road to this place. <placeName>Melton's 
	    <lb/>Bluff</placeName> is at the head of <placeName>Mussel Shoals</placeName>. But to see more of the
	  <lb/>lands shortly to be sold, I went direct to the foot of the Shoals,
	  <lb/>70 miles from <placeName>Huntsville</placeName>, crossed the river, and came up on
	  <lb/>the south side of <placeName>Tennessee river</placeName>. We had a soaking rain
	  <lb/>the first day, but the road was fine, the country being a level
	  <lb/>plain, and the land as rich as any in the world, doubtless, and
	  <lb/>well watered. Many houses are already built on the road side,
	  <lb/>and good entertainment. The lady, however, where we staid
	  <lb/>the first night, said it was very sickly.</p>
        <p>The second day, towards evening, as <persName>Mr. Beech</persName> (my 
	  <lb/>fellow traveller) and I were at our ease, chatting on different
	  <lb/>subjects, my servant, behind us, cried out <said>Looky! looky!
	    <lb/>what a great river!</said> We had heard a roaring sometime, and
	  <lb/><persName>Mr. B.</persName> who was acquainted with the country, observed we
	  <lb/>could not be far from the foot of the Shoals. Upon turning
	  <lb/>our horses out of the road a few steps, we saw the river—a
	  <lb/>most sublime picture it was! That part which first burst on
<pb n="53"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="7(3)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">53</mw>
	  <lb/>our view, was three miles in width! the largest body of water I
	  <lb/>ever saw. It was at this time very high and muddy; and the 
	  <lb/>noise produced by the water washing over the rocks was
	  <lb/>tremendous.</p>
        <p>We saw a boat hung on a rock, about the middle of the
	  <lb/>stream, and many persons around it on the rocks, endeavoring
	  <lb/>to get it off; the waves and white caps were dashing furiously
	  <lb/>around them; and unable even to hail them, we proceeded,
	  <lb/>being near our destination.</p>
        <p>The sun was verging upon the horizon, while I was
	  <lb/>musing upon the fall in the river (which was evident.) Hav­
	  <lb/>ing travelled over level ground from <placeName>Huntsville</placeName>, we began to
	  <lb/>descend rapidly, almost a precipice, the road making a sud­
	  <lb/>den bend to the left; and shortly the house, at which we were
	  <lb/>to spend the night, stood before us, on the bank of the river.
	  <lb/>But it here flowed in a smoothe current; yet, upon looking up
	  <lb/>the river, the wide spreading Shoals were seen. The gran­
	  <lb/>deur of the scene engrossed my attention, until night fall com­
	  <lb/>pelled me to retire into the house.</p>
        <p>Upon entering the tavern, I had the pleasure of meeting
	  <lb/>with the <persName>Reverend Gideon Blackburn</persName>, the same who civilized
	  <lb/>the <name>Cherokee Indians</name>. I had heard of <persName>Mr. Blackburn</persName> often.
	  <lb/>He is represented as a man of superior talents, both as a
	  <lb/>divine and a politician, and rendered his country many signal
	  <lb/>benefits in co-operating with <persName>General Jackson</persName> last war, in
	  <lb/>raising the necessary requisites for the army. He is a stout
	  <lb/>coarse featured man, of middle age, and very distant in his
	  <lb/>manners; but has great expression of countenance, and every
	  <lb/>mark of a sensible man. He did not seem pleased with the 
	  <lb/>house, and crossed the river, late as it was, to seek a lodging
	  <lb/>elsewhere. It was a great disappointment to me, as I pro­
	  <lb/>mised myself much pleasure in his society. The landlord,
	  <lb/>and a number of boatmen had been drinking freely, which, I
	  <lb/>suspect, displeased the Parson.—The lady of the house, a very
	  <lb/>beautiful and accomplished woman, was no less sorry, adding,
	  <lb/>she had known him from her infancy.</p>
        <p><persName>Mr. Beech</persName> going no farther, I took a guide, one of the
	  <lb/>pilots, and crossed the river next morning, in a ferry boat.
<pb n="54"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="7(3)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">54</mw>
	  <lb/>I should have found it difficult, on account of several creeks
	  <lb/>which were backed up by the river, without a guide. The
	  <lb/><placeName>Tennessee river</placeName> is wider at the foot of the Shoals than the
	  <lb/><placeName>Ohio</placeName>, at any part I have seen, and equally beautiful, perhaps
	  <lb/>superior. It has not those high banks which confine the <placeName>Ohio</placeName>,
	  <lb/>if we except what the people, in this country call Bluffs.
	  <lb/>These are steep ledges of rocks which appear at very con­
	  <lb/>siderable intervals, sometimes on one side of the river, and
	  <lb/>sometimes on the other—and from appearances I would sup­
	  <lb/>pose it often inundates the bottom lands. These are covered
	  <lb/>with cane, as thick as the hairs on your head, and look like
	  <lb/>so many fields of green wheat. These, contrasted with the
	  <lb/>leafless forest, are singularly beautiful. Not only the islands,
	  <lb/>but the bottoms are so thickly covered with cane, that you
	  <lb/>could not see a man on horseback five steps from you.</p>

        <p><hi>Upon</hi> leaving the ferry, I was pensive and melancholy;
	  <lb/>for, being told by my guide I was to pass several <name>Indian</name>
	  <lb/>farms, it struck a damp on my spirits, of which he was uncon­

        <p>On leaving the river the beauties of this deservedly ex­
	  <lb/>tolled country broke on my view by degrees. To compare it
	  <lb/>with the <placeName>Elysian fields</placeName> of the ancients, would give but a feeble
	  <lb/>idea of it. The diminutive vale of <name>Tempe</name> and their thousand
	  <lb/>sylvan shades, vanish into nothing, compared with this. As
	  <lb/>you are partial to any thing I say or do, I shall throw my

	  <lb/>them at your leisure.</p>

        <p>It is unnecessary to state what you have learned from
	  <lb/>the newspapers, that this land was abandoned last fall by the
	  <lb/><name>Indians</name>. The fires were still smoking, when the white people
	  <lb/>took possession. Although I had travelled through a beautiful
	  <lb/>country, the two preceding days, and my mind had been
	  <lb/>raised to the highest pitch of expectation by repeated descrip­
	  <lb/>tions of this land; yet, it far exceeded all I anticipated. On
	  <lb/>quitting the impervious river-bottom, I emerged into an open
	  <lb/>country, high and dry. The exuberance of cane and timber
	  <lb/>subsides. This enables the eye to see a great distance—no
	  <lb/>hill nor dale—neither is it a perfect level; but the surface is
	  <lb/>gently undulating, or alternately elevated or depressed like
	  <lb/>waves. The eye can range without controul in all directions.
	  <lb/>This is what charms; and this I was not prepared for.</p>
        <p>But what struck me with most wonder was, that I always
	  <lb/>appeared to occupy the highest ground; and, all from that
	  <lb/>point, seemed to descend; and when I gained the extreme 
	  <lb/>boundary of view from a given point, it was the same thing
	  <lb/>as before—this appeared the highest; that which I had left,
	  <lb/>the lowest. A warm hospitality seemed to breathe among the
	  <lb/>trees: they have something cheering in their aspect. They
	  <lb/>do not terrify by their gigantic looks—they open on all sides,
	  <lb/>as if to let you pass, and welcome your approach. The sun
	  <lb/>throws a shining lustre over them. How unlike the cold,
	  <lb/>dreary, hard frozen hills of <placeName>Monroe</placeName>, or in fact any thing in
	  <lb/>our country.</p>
        <p>About ten o'clock we came in sight of the first <name>Indian</name>
	  <lb/>farm—but <name>Indian</name> farm no longer! The smoke was issuing
	  <lb/>slowly through the chimney. Why, these <name>Indians</name> have been
	  <lb/>like us!—could not be savage—cornfields—apple trees, and
	  <lb/>peach trees. Fences like ours, but not so high—trusted to
	  <lb/>their neighbor's honesty—perhaps these being more civilized
	  <lb/>had more reason to fear their neighbor. Provoked with my
	  <lb/>guide because he could not tell me the original cause of these
	  <lb/>enclosures among the <name>Indians</name>—from four to five rails high—
	  <lb/>this would not do among us—'twould breed a civil war.—
	  <lb/>There were the lusty corn-stalks—looked grayish—some were
	  <lb/>standing erect, some were broken off at the middle and hung
<pb n="56"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="7(4)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">56</mw>
	  <lb/>together still, some were prostrate. The house looked tight
	  <lb/>and comfortable; the fruit-trees are large, and show age—
	  <lb/>there the <name>Indian</name> sat under their shade, or stood up and pluck­
	  <lb/>ed the apples—wonder he did not plant more—suppose he did
	  <lb/>not know how to make cider. Blockhead!—better than
	  <lb/>whiskey.</p>
        <p>My guide says peaches are delightful in this country.</p>
        <p>Poor <persName>Gourd</persName>! That was the <name>Indian's</name> name; had he still
	  <lb/>been there, I would have called to see him: but I felt no desire
	  <lb/>to see his successor. Guide says <persName>Gourd</persName> was very kind; he
	  <lb/>knew him for fifteen years. He helped to subdue the <name>Creeks</name>,
	  <lb/>and made an excellent soldier. There was a portico over the
	  <lb/>door—there <persName>Gourd</persName> used to sit in the warm summer days. We
	  <lb/>rode close to the fence, built by his hands, or perhaps his
	  <lb/>wife's; no matter which it was, it was no less dear!—It was
	  <lb/>his home! The sun, at this moment, overcast with clouds,
	  <lb/>threw a solemn gloom upon the <name>Indian</name> farm. Nothing moved
	  <lb/>but the smoke from the chimney—all was silent and hushed
	  <lb/>as death!—Poor <persName>Gourd</persName> had to leave his home, his cornfield,
	  <lb/>and his apple trees.</p>
        <p>There could not exist a greater evidence of unbounded
	  <lb/>avarice and ambition which distinguished the Christian world,
	  <lb/>than the one that lay before me. There was a time when the
	  <lb/>owners of this beauteous country flattered themselves that
	  <lb/><emph>distance</emph> alone would screen them from the intrusion of the 
	  <lb/>whites. Vain hope!</p>
        <p>Absorbed in pensiveness, I heeded not the loquacity of my
	  <lb/>servant and guide, who cared for none of these things. My
	  <lb/>guide tripped lightly along—a tall keen man. I proposed that
	  <lb/>my servant should walk and let him ride; but he refused; said
	  <lb/>he would rather walk. <said>But you will have to swim presently,</said>
	  <lb/>said he. <said>How so? I would rather not.</said> <said>Your horses, I
	    <lb/>mean; you cross <placeName>Town Creek</placeName>, in a canoe, and swim your
	    <lb/>horses; this will cost you one dollar.</said> <said>One dollar!</said> These
	  <lb/>white people I thought are greedy. Shortly after this we
	  <lb/>came to the house where the man lived who was to have the
	  <lb/>dollar—another <name>Indian</name> house, and I hastened to view the
	  <lb/>interior. It was a roomy tight built cabin, similar to many
<pb n="57"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="8(1)r"/>

	  <lb/>you have seen. The logs are round, very light, and lie
	  <lb/>close upon each other. The door was the only singularity:—
	  <lb/>It was as high as common doors, but not more than half as
	  <lb/>wide.</p>
        <p>As I sat musing upon the ups and downs of this life, I was
	  <lb/>roused by the man who was to put us over, observing, <said>I 
	    <lb/>can't tell what's to be done about putting you over <placeName>Town
	      <lb/>Creek</placeName>. Some of my good neighbours, on the other side, has
	    <lb/>cut down four or five trees into the crossing; and it is almost
	    <lb/>impossible to cut them away, as the Creek is high, and they
	    <lb/>have to be cut in such a manner, (the ends of them lying on
	    <lb/>the land,) as the water may float them off.</said> <said>But can we
	    <lb/>not find another place by going higher up the Creek?</said> <said>No!
	    <lb/>Impossible! and it will be a hard job, if it can be done at all.
	    <lb/>There is no possible way but to stand in the canoe, to the dan­
	    <lb/>ger of our lives.</said> <said>Then,</said> said I, <said>we will return, and
	    <lb/>await the falling of the river.</said> I saw through the matter at 
	  <lb/>once; he wished to have something extra; and had he not been
	  <lb/>a sharper, I would have given him something extra. Now see
	  <lb/>these white people! These <name>Christians</name>! His Christian neigh­
	  <lb/>bours felled the trees in the stream, and he wanted to filch the
	  <lb/>damage out of me! So would not the <name>Indians</name>!—<said>Oh, we
	    <lb/>will go and see what can be done. Shall I help you on your
	    <lb/>horse? The Creek is a good step off.</said></p>
        <p>A few minutes brought us to <placeName>Town Creek</placeName>; and there were
	  <lb/>the trees, sure enough—cut near the margin—four of them;
	  <lb/>and all their tops lying piled on each other, precisely where
	  <lb/>our horses were to land. None but a fiend would have
	  <lb/>thought of such hellish malice, and such an ingenious piece of
	  <lb/>mischief too. I should never have dreamed of it.</p>
        <p>Leaving the horses on this side, the ferryman and <persName>Rhea</persName>,
	  <lb/>(my guide's name,) and my servant, crossed over, and com­
	  <lb/>menced chopping the trees, at the surface of the stream, some
	  <lb/>alternately holding the canoe to the place.</p>
        <p>I sat down on a log, and taking a newspaper to pass the
	  <lb/>time; behold! a long holding forth upon converting the <name>Indians</name>,
	  <lb/>was the first thing that struck my eye! I would have a much

	  <lb/>better opinion of robbers and pirates, than such men: <emph>they</emph> do
	  <lb/>not belie their trade.</p>
        <p>In a quarter of an hour the trees were removed, and I,
	  <lb/>with my horses, were safely on the other side; and do you
	  <lb/>think the fellow had not the impudence to ask seventy-five
	  <lb/>cents extra, after drinking between them a bottle of whiskey,
	  <lb/>which I gave them as a treat, and <persName>Rhea</persName> and my servant also
	  <lb/>assisting them!! <said>No, Sir,</said> said I, <said>I will advertise you
	    <lb/>as a sharper besides!</said> Give him seventy-five cents extra! I
	  <lb/>was on the rong side of the river for that. <persName>Rhea</persName> said I had
	  <lb/>two more creeks to pass! <name rend="pre(“)post(”)">Big Nance,</name> (called after a woman
	  <lb/>by that name, who lived there.) These, however, were easily
	  <lb/>forded—and chatting with <persName>Rhea</persName>, I learn<choice><sic/><corr>e</corr></choice>d he was from <placeName>Rock­
	    <lb/>bridge county</placeName>, <placeName>Virginia</placeName>; had piloted boats through the <placeName>Muscle
	    <lb/>Shoals</placeName>, fifteen years; sometimes four at a time, at <emph>ten</emph> dollars
	  <lb/>each. He sails down one day, and walks back the next. He
	  <lb/>never met, in all that time, with an accident! There are seve­
	  <lb/>ral of these pilots.</p>
        <p>You cannot imagine a sight so beautiful as this country
	  <lb/>exhibits to this place. But the sight of the Bluff at a mile's
	  <lb/>distance, fairly entranced me. It is an even high plain, and
	  <lb/>resembles a hanging garden. The sun favored us with his
	  <lb/>rays as we drew in sight, and shed a beautiful lustre on the
	  <lb/>Bluff.—This land is so clear of undergrowth that you may
	  <lb/>drive a wagon any where through the woods; and this body
	  <lb/>extends, I am told, twenty miles in width. We passed many
	  <lb/><name>Indian</name> houses in the day, and some beautiful springs.</p>

	  <lb/>two years since, at an advanced age. Various stories are
	  <lb/>related of this man; but all agree in this: that he was an <name>Irish­
	    <lb/>man</name> by birth; became displeased with the white people;
	  <lb/>attached himself to the <name>Cherokee Indians</name>; married a squaw,
	  <lb/>and settled at this place many years ago; that, with the assist­
	  <lb/>ance of the <name>Indians</name>, he used to rob the boats which passed
	  <lb/>down the river, and murder the crews. By these means he
	  <lb/>became immensely rich; owned a great number of slaves;
	  <lb/>most of whom he robbed from these boats. Thus 't is said he
	  <lb/>continued his piracies until the treaty between the <name>United
	    <lb/>States</name>  and the <name>Cherokees</name>.</p>
        <p>He had several children by his <name>Indian</name> wife, one of whom
	  <lb/>married <persName>Rhea</persName>, the pilot. After peace was signed with the
	  <lb/><name>Indians</name>, <persName>Melton</persName> lived quietly at home, and cultivated his
	  <lb/>farm; but towards the latter part of his life he became alarm­
	  <lb/>ed from the threats of the <name>Creeks</name>, and removed over the
	  <lb/>river, where he also had a large farm, and built a fine house,
	  <lb/>(which I have seen,) and died rich in a good old age. Most
	  <lb/>of his children married white people.</p>
        <p>He used to keep a house of entertainment at <placeName>Melton's Bluff</placeName>,
	  <lb/>after his piracies ceased; and kept an excellent house. His
	  <lb/>table was furnished with the best of liquors, meat, coffee, and 
	  <lb/>tea, and all prepared in the best manner. I met with a gen­
	  <lb/>tleman who spent a week at <persName>Melton's</persName> house, in company with
	  <lb/>six others. He said he never fared better in any part of the
	  <lb/><placeName>United States</placeName>: but their bill was excessively high.</p>
        <p>I saw and conversed with many of <persName>Melton's</persName> slaves;
	  <lb/>amongst whom was a cook whom he purchased in <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>,
	  <lb/>at a very high price, as a first rate cook. She said that <persName>Mrs.
	    <lb/>Melton</persName> would sometimes take it into her head to go into the
	  <lb/>kitchen, (particularly when she took a dram,) and kick up a 
	  <lb/>dust with her about the dinner. <persName>Mrs. M.</persName> wanted to model the
	  <lb/>cooking to her own mind, that is, <name>Indian</name> fashion. She, the
	  <lb/>cook, being responsible to her master for the forthcoming of
	  <lb/>the dinner would go to her master; upon which the old man
	  <lb/>would sally forth, with whip in hand, and if fair words failed,
	  <lb/>the horsewhip always restored order.</p>
        <p>You recollect <persName>Rhea</persName> whom I have mentioned: he married
<pb n="60"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="8(2)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">60</mw>
	  <lb/>one of <persName>Melton's</persName> daughters—a most amiable woman, and very
	  <lb/>lame. When the <name>Cherokee Indians</name> abandoned this territory
	  <lb/>last fall, some of them went up the river to the <name>Cherokee nation</name>,
	  <lb/>there to remain, till boats were provided for their removal to
	  <lb/>the west, by the government; others went directly down the
	  <lb/>river to <placeName>Arkansas</placeName>—of whom <persName>Rhea's</persName> wife was one. The order
	  <lb/>for their departure was sudden and unexpected.<anchor xml:id="a18" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n18"/> <persName>Rhea</persName>, at
	  <lb/>that time was absent from home, but returned on the same
	  <lb/>day, and learning what had happened, was almost frantic—
	  <lb/>jumped into a canoe, and soon overtook the boats. He flew to
	  <lb/>his wife, and clasped her in his arms. Neither spoke a word,
	  <lb/>but both wept bitterly. In a few moments he resumed his
	  <lb/>canoe and returned to the Bluff, and she went on. They had
	  <lb/>no children.</p>
        <p>Whether <persName>Rhea</persName> was prohibited by the treaty from accom­
	  <lb/>panying his wife, or whether he was under a prior engage­
	  <lb/>ment, none here are able to inform me—but certain it is, he is
	  <lb/>now married to a white woman.</p>
        <p>You have heard that this country consists of table and
	  <lb/>bottom land, also, of the Bluffs. These Bluffs  happen where
	  <lb/>there is no bottom land, but the table land running up to the 
	  <lb/>river forms a high precipice, called a Bluff. This is the case
	  <lb/>at <placeName>Melton's Bluff</placeName>, the highest I have seen. Here is a very
	  <lb/>large plantation of cotton and maize, worked by about sixty
	  <lb/>slaves, and owned by <persName>General Jackson</persName>, who bought the inter­
	  <lb/>est of old <persName>Melton</persName>.</p>
        <p>No language can convey an idea of the beauties of <placeName>Melton's
	    <lb/>Bluff</placeName>. It is said to be the handsomest spot in the world, off
	  <lb/>the seabord; and rich as it is beautiful. I can sit in my room
	  <lb/>and see the whole plantation; the boats gliding down the river,
	  <lb/>and the opposite shore, one mile distant. The ducks, geese,
	  <lb/>and swans, playing at the same time on the bosom of the stream,
	  <lb/>with a full view of the many islands. It is, after all, the great
	  <lb/>height of the site that pleases.</p>
        <p>I took a walk with some ladies to-day over the plantation,
	  <lb/>as we wished to hav<choice><sic/><corr>e</corr></choice> a nearer view of those snowy fields, which
	  <lb/>so sedulously present thems<choice><sic/><corr>e</corr></choice>lv<choice><sic/><corr>e</corr></choice>s to our view, together with

<mw type="pageNum">61</mw>
	  <lb/>orchards, gin houses, gardens, <persName>Melton's</persName> mansion, and a con­
	  <lb/>siderable negro town.</p>
        <p>We approached the mansion, by a broad street, running
	  <lb/>up the river bank east of the town. This street seems suspen­
	  <lb/>ded between heaven and earth, as the whole premises for two
	  <lb/>miles, all in sight, appears to be elevated above the horizon,
	  <lb/>and none above the rest. We entered the court yard, fronting
	  <lb/>the house, by a stile; and the first thing we met was a large
	  <lb/>scaffold overspread with cotton: as it was in the seed, their
	  <lb/>must have been many thousands of pounds. Being damp from
	  <lb/>dew, and often rain, it must be dried in this manner. The
	  <lb/>mansion was large, built with logs, shingled roof, and may
	  <lb/>have been built 25 or 30 years since. I recoiled at the sight
	  <lb/>of a place once the habitation of such a monster. Some of our
	  <lb/>party went in: I did not. <persName>General Jackson's</persName> overseer, who
	  <lb/>joined us here, said he lived in the lower story, the up­
	  <lb/>per being filled with cotton. The scaffold was about four feet
	  <lb/>from the ground. From this we crossed another fence, and
	  <lb/>found ourselves in a cotton field of about one hundred acres,
	  <lb/>white with cotton and alive with negroes. The centre of this
	  <lb/>field is said to be the rallying point of viewing the scenery; as
	  <lb/>it doubtless is. You can see up to <placeName>Brown's Ferry</placeName>, eight miles
	  <lb/>distant, with the naked eye—and the same distance down.—
	  <lb/>The term <mentioned>beauty</mentioned> is applied to any thing which excites pleas­
	  <lb/>ant feelings. Beauty is said to be a uniformity amidst varie­
	  <lb/>ty; a proportion of parts adapted to a whole; fitness of things
	  <lb/>to an end; quantity and simplicity. All this is realised on 
	  <lb/>the scenery of <placeName>Melton's Bluff</placeName>. Here is a noble river which
	  <lb/>combines in itself all you can conceive of grandeur and utility,
	  <lb/>adorned with islands spangled with boats, and enlivened with
	  <lb/>wild fowl. Lift your eye from the river, and lo! magnificent
	  <lb/>fields, white as snow, orchards, farms, and houses, all in view,
	  <lb/>without moving out of the spot. You may thus form some
	  <lb/>idea of this farfamed Bluff. Here the green islands look like
	  <lb/>floating meadows. Here the boatman wields his massy oar,
	  <lb/>and guides his freighted boat along. Here the wild fowl
	  <lb/>arrayed in glossy plumes, wantons as she lists. Here the dis­
	  <lb/>tant billows breaking o'er the Shoals, echo back in murmuring
<pb n="62"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="8(3)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">62</mw>
	  <lb/>sounds, and mingling sweetly with the music of the boatman's
	  <lb/>viol, swells upon the ear and softly dies away upon the breeze.
	  <lb/>To crown the whole, here the majestic swan, robed in daz­
	  <lb/>zling white, moves in all her graceful attitudes. These are
	  <lb/>beauties which may be felt but cannot be described. This
	  <lb/>combination of objects, each beautiful in itself, and so ma­
	  <lb/>terially useful, constitutes the beauty of <placeName>Melton's Bluff</placeName>. All
	  <lb/>the trade of <placeName>East Tennessee</placeName> passes by the Bluff, and halt here
	  <lb/>to take in their pilots.</p>

          <salute>Dear <persName>Matt</persName>,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p>Now comes the cotton field again. As you complain of
	  <lb/>long letters, I will please you if it can be done. This is the
	  <lb/>first cotton field I have ever been in. It appears an endless bu­
	  <lb/>siness when we cast our eye over so vast a plain of white with a
	  <lb/>production, the gathering of which is to be effected by the 
	  <lb/>application of the fingers to every individual pod; and those
	  <lb/>pods as thick as they can stand one by the side of the other.
	  <lb/>It is discouraging indeed. But these negroes have great
	  <lb/>patience, and seem to be cut out for the business. Here are
	  <lb/>from 40 to 50, who scarcely seem to move out of one place;
	  <lb/>nor can you tell which way they are going. They face about
	  <lb/>to every point. Some are erect, and others stooping, and all
	  <lb/>their hands move very fast. It is very light work; and the
	  <lb/>climate is so mild, they work out the whole winter.</p>
        <p>It requires practice to be a good picker; an expert hand 
	  <lb/>will pick about 100 weight per day. It is planted in drills from
	  <lb/>three to four feet asunder. The stem sends out branches from
	  <lb/>the bottom to the top, so dense, that you think it is sown like
	  <lb/>wheat. The branches extend from one row to the other, and
	  <lb/>so intermingle. It is worked in the same manner you do
	  <lb/><name>Indian</name> corn until it blooms, and the first frost that comes,
<pb n="63"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="8(4)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">63</mw>
	  <lb/>and even before some of the pods open, whilst others are
	  <lb/>only in bloom. As soon as it opens, the picking begins; but
	  <lb/>this requires double the hands it took in the cultivation.
	  <lb/>These go regularly over the field, and by that time, a number
	  <lb/>of pods which were not open on the first picking, are now
	  <lb/>ready, and they return to where they first began, and go over
	  <lb/>the same ground, and so on the whole winter. Large quan­
	  <lb/>tities are burnt for want of hands to get it out of the way of
	  <lb/>the plow, for the plowing must commence at the usual time;
	  <lb/>and they set fire to rid it out of the way. I asked why
	  <lb/>they did not give it gratis to the poor? without reflecting that
	  <lb/>every man, woman, and child, able to work, were engaged
	  <lb/>till the last moment. Children of twelve years of age, and
	  <lb/>often under, make 75 cents per day. The land is amazingly
	  <lb/>fertile on the Bluff. We measured one of the stalks and found
	  <lb/>it 6 feet 6 inches high. From the field we sauntered along to
	  <lb/>the cotton-gin. Every one who raises cotton, must have a gin.
	  <lb/>As we walked along, thousands of paroquets flew over us
	  <lb/>in flocks. They are very handsome, green and yellow. The
	  <lb/>squirrels were likewise chattering in the trees, shelling their
	  <lb/>nuts, whilst the friendly jay was sporting in the boughs, and
	  <lb/>the red bird, in his brilliant scarlet plumage, hopping famil­
	  <lb/>iarly before us, and his kindred songsters, were serenading us
	  <lb/>in the adjoining forest. It is like our springs, music and
	  <lb/>beauty greet you whichever way you move; and yet I am told
	  <lb/>foreigners say we have no scenery in <placeName>America</placeName>. I do not envy
	  <lb/>them their barren heaths and tottering castles. We have one
	  <lb/>here, <persName rend="slant(italic)">Melton's</persName> castle; but like their own it only serves to
	  <lb/>remind us of the rapine and bloodshed of its former owner.</p>
        <p>We found a number of boys and horses at the<choice><sic> the</sic><corr/></choice> cotton 
	  <lb/>gin, which gave variety to our amusement, particularly a
	  <lb/>considerable tree pulled round and round by a horse; this
	  <lb/>turned a screw which pressed the bales of cotton—the world
	  <lb/>and all the boys seem to be made of cotton here—that is all the
	  <lb/>description I can give of the thing. The pressing part of it is
	  <lb/>something like pressing cyder; but as to the ginning part of it,
	  <lb/>with its thousand wheels and saws

        <p>On our return home, we passed two lines of negro cabins.
	  <lb/>There were very few but children in them. We found the
	  <lb/>cabins warm and comfortable, and well stored with provisions:
	  <lb/><persName>General Jackson</persName>, to whom they belong, being one of the best of
	  <lb/>masters.</p>
        <p>As I lingered behind the party, thinking of my own negro
	  <lb/>children, the little things flocked round me, and as they were
	  <lb/>looking up in my face, eager to be carressed, I discovered the
	  <lb/>traces of tears on some of their cheeks. The sight pierced me
	  <lb/>to the heart. Oh, slavery, slavery! nothing can soften thee!
	  <lb/>thou are slavery still! Is there no hope high heaven?</p>

        <p><hi>I am</hi> here for the winter, doubtless, and shall while away
	  <lb/>the time between writing to you, viewing the country, and
	  <lb/><quote>chatting with the beaux.</quote> As you are desirous to hear a
	  <lb/>particular account of this beautiful region, I shall finish what 
	  <lb/>I began sometime back.</p>
        <p>I said the land was divided into bottom, table land, and 
	  <lb/>Bluffs. It also contains <distinct xml:id="a19" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n19">Bayous</distinct> and mountains. The bottom
	  <lb/>land is held in little estimation; for, though more fertile than
	  <lb/>the table land, it is hard to clear, being thickly covered with
	  <lb/>heavy timber, and often not only by these bayous, but often
	  <lb/>overflowed; this renders it too wet for cotton, which delights
	  <lb/>in dry soil. Those bayous are formed by the water of the
	  <lb/>river forsaking the channel, and, running off in various
	  <lb/>directions, returns to the river and unites with it again.
	  <lb/>The cotton, or table land, is separated from the bottom land, 
	  <lb/>by the Bluffs, and though they are only called Bluffs where
<pb n="65"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="9(1)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">65</mw>
	  <lb/>they meet the river, they are evidently the same elivation
	  <lb/>which divides the bottom land from the table land. The table land
	  <lb/>is not a dead level, but waving, and varies from 20 to 25 miles
	  <lb/>wide: then comes the mountain, a narrow strip of pine land,
	  <lb/>very little higher than the table land <emph>generally</emph>, and, though sto­
	  <lb/>ny, might be tilled. Then comes the table land again; next
	  <lb/>mountain. These varieties run parallel with the <placeName>Tennessee
	    <lb/>river</placeName>.</p>
        <p>Then comes the long moss, sixty miles on this side of
	  <lb/><placeName>Cahawba</placeName>, running in the same direction; and beyond it the
	  <lb/>table land appears again. In the region of this moss it is
	  <lb/>sickly, as it also is, on the rivers; but keep off the rivers and
	  <lb/>it is as healthy as any climate, or perhaps more so, than any
	  <lb/>part of the <name>Union</name>. There is no such thing as consumptions.
	  <lb/>Those families subject to it perfectly recover from it in this
	  <lb/>climate. Of this I have been an eye witness.</p>
        <p>I saw some of the moss just mentioned. It looks like hay
	  <lb/>when cured in the sun, though much finer. It has joints like
	  <lb/>timothy grass. A gentleman who brought some of it in his
	  <lb/>saddle bags to this place, informed me that it hangs loosely
	  <lb/>upon the trees, as though it were thrown on by the hand, and
	  <lb/>has no connection whatever with the branch upon which it
	  <lb/>hangs. This is most singular. He said that trees of all des­
	  <lb/>criptions were enveloped with it, from the top to the bottom,
	  <lb/>hanging down to the ground; and that cattle lived on it. I
	  <lb/>ought to have said that a narrow blade branches out from the
	  <lb/>joints of the moss. When it is soaked in water, it discharges
	  <lb/>a thin coat with which the stem is enveloped; it is then black,
	  <lb/>and resembles horse hair, and matrasses are made out of it.</p>
        <p>But to return. This land produces upon an average 1000
	  <lb/>pounds of cotton in the seed. Sweet potatoes grow very fine,
	  <lb/>and are an article of food for the negroes. Corn grows well,
	  <lb/>and, also, wheat; though the weavel destroys it almost instant­
	  <lb/>ly; consequently, as they can buy it cheaper, and turn their
	  <lb/>labor and land to better account, by raising cotton, wheat is
	  <lb/>not raised. Tobacco, also, grows well, but they prefer the
	  <lb/>cotton as more profitable.</p>
        <p>I have seen no meadows since I left <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>; and though
<mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(+2)">9</mw>
<pb n="66"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="9(1)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">66</mw>
	  <lb/>clover grows well in <placeName>Madison county</placeName>, north of the river, the
	  <lb/>soil is said to be unfavorable to grass. Vast numbers of cattle
	  <lb/>are raised here upon the cane.</p>

        <p><hi>It</hi> is now high time to introduce you to the ladies and
	  <lb/>gentlemen of this town, city, or what you please to denomi­
	  <lb/>nate it. It would be a million of pities not to do so; particu­
	  <lb/>larly a young lady, called the beauty of the Territory. There
	  <lb/>are so many pleasing objects here—the climate so mild—and
	  <lb/>such a wide and handsome prospect, that I am all delight—like
	  <lb/>a bird let out of a cage. But I shall take care not to mount
	  <lb/>my hobby, lest I might gallop off to <placeName>Cahawba</placeName>, or some other
	  <lb/>place.</p>
        <p>To begin with my landlord, <persName>Colonel Pettis</persName>. He is a 
	  <lb/>young man of handsome appearance, and very good natured—
	  <lb/>weighs about 200 weight, though not corpulent. He is a na­
	  <lb/>tive of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>; lived sometime in <placeName>Madison</placeName>, and moved here
	  <lb/>about the time I arrived. I was introduced to him in <placeName>Hunts­
	    <lb/>ville</placeName>, and knowing he was about to remove her, I was warmly
	  <lb/>recommended to him. He is a man of considerable property,
	  <lb/>and keeps a house of entertainment for the accommodation of the
	  <lb/>innumerable travellers, who, like locusts, cover the land. He
	  <lb/>amuses himself in this way, till the land sales approach, when
	  <lb/>he designs to purchase and settle himself. His wife, young,
	  <lb/>active, genteel, and sprightly, with a sparkling black eye, is a
	  <lb/>beautiful woman, and the life and soul of the Bluff, two children,
	  <lb/>boys, all they have, and two of his wife's sisters, a gay young
	  <lb/>widow and her child, with the bar-keeper, and myself, com­
	  <lb/>pose the family. But the beauty, <persName>Matt</persName>, the flower of the
	  <lb/>country, is here. She is only fourteen, but her fame extends,
<pb n="67"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="9(2)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">67</mw>
	  <lb/>and will, doubtless, cause many an aching heart. She is one
	  <lb/>of the sisters just mentioned, the handsomest piece of mortali­
	  <lb/>ty I ever met with. Her features are without fault; her eyes
	  <lb/>are unmatched in expression, as black as shoes; and her cheeks
	  <lb/>are like roses. But my pen fails me—her name is <persName>Martha
	    <lb/>Patrick</persName>. Another tavern is kept here, by <persName>Major Wyatt</persName>, one
	  <lb/>of the heroes of <name>New Orleans</name>. The Major, his wife, and his
	  <lb/>wife's sister, with his mother, compose this other family. Be­
	  <lb/>sides these, there are several tipling shows, three stores, an
	  <lb/>apothecary shop, two doctors, a hatter's shop, a ware house,
	  <lb/>and several mechanics.</p>
        <p><persName>Major Wyatt</persName> is by far the most interesting man in the
	  <lb/>town, as poor as <persName>Job</persName>, but brave and generous as a prince. At
	  <lb/>the <name>battle of New Orleans</name>, he held a captain's commission,
	  <lb/>and was taken prisoner on the night of the <date when="1814-12-23">23d December</date>.
	  <lb/>After forcing the <name>British</name> from one position to another, and
	  <lb/>dealing death wherever he appeared, deceived by the darkness
	  <lb/>of the night, he mistook the <name>British</name> for our own men, and was
	  <lb/>taken prisoner. The officer into whose hands he fell, immedi­
	  <lb/>ately disarmed him; put him under guard, and treated him
	  <lb/>very harshly. Next morning he was exchanged. The next
	  <lb/>engagement, <persName>Wyatt</persName> had the good fortune to take the same
	  <lb/>officer prisoner. The officer immediately surrendered his
	  <lb/>sword, which <persName>Wyatt</persName> received, but instantly returned it: shook
	  <lb/>him by the hand very friendly, led him to his tent, ordered
	  <lb/>refreshments, and setting a bottle of wine before him, after

	  <lb/>but she lowers upon her sweet daughter-in-law like a thunder 
	  <lb/>cloud. This widow of 70, is laced and starched stiff up to the
	  <lb/>chin; homely face, but a fine figure, ignorant and proud as
	  <lb/><persName>Lucifer</persName>, and if I am not much mistaken, would have no objec­
	  <lb/>tion to enter  into the holy bands of matrimony again. The
	  <lb/>young widow of our family, is a daughter of the wealthy <persName rend="slant(italic)">Mr.
	    <lb/>Foaly</persName>, of <placeName>Natchez</placeName>. She fell in love and married a <persName>Major
	    <lb/>Chandler</persName> against her father's consent, who not only refused
	  <lb/>to give her a dollar, but forbid her his house.</p>
        <p><persName>Chandler</persName> was a handsome, accomplished, man, but poor;
	  <lb/>and about one year after his marriage, died, and left his wife
	  <lb/>with an infant amongst strangers. <persName>Mrs. Chandler</persName> was found
	  <lb/>in this situation by <persName>Colonel Pettis</persName>, and taken to his house,
	  <lb/>where she is treated with kindness and respect. Her father,
	  <lb/>who owns about ninety slaves, has sent for her to return to
	  <lb/>him, and upon this condition he promises to divide his fortune
	  <lb/>with her, <persName>General Castleton</persName>, his son-in-law, and a son, his
	  <lb/>remaining child. But she, as yet, refuses to return to her
	  <lb/>parent. She is a very small woman, but handsome and kind
	  <lb/>hearted.</p>
        <p>To go on with the rest. One of the Doctors, <persName>Crab</persName>, of
	  <lb/><placeName>Botetourt</placeName>, <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, I knew, as well as the whole family.
	  <lb/>They were respectable, and were formerly of <placeName>Maryland</placeName>. The
	  <lb/>Doctor is a young widower, tall and slender; and pursues his
	  <lb/>profession.</p>
        <p>The other Doctor, <persName>Roussean</persName>, descended from the famous
	  <lb/>writer of that name, is also from <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, and near <placeName>Alexan­
	    <lb/>dria</placeName>. He is a man of genteel manners, young and handsome,
	  <lb/>and very sociable. One of the merchants, <persName>Mitchell</persName>, with his
	  <lb/>wife, is from <placeName>Nashville</placeName>, <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>, the first people on the
	  <lb/>Bluff, and are also very pleasant. If we except a little envy
	  <lb/>on the part of <persName>Mrs. Widow W.</persName> we have a very pleasant socie­

          <salute>Dear <persName>Matt</persName>,</salute>

        <p><hi>Good</hi> news awaits you: read on! Having collected a few 
	  <lb/>books, I was devouring <persName>Phillip's</persName> Speeches (first sight of the
	  <lb/>book) in a corner, when a loud cry, <said><persName>General Jackson</persName>,
	    <lb/><persName>General Jackson</persName> comes!</said> and, running to my window, I saw
	  <lb/>him walking slowly up the hill, between two gentlemen, his
	  <lb/>aids. He was dressed in a blue frock coat, with epaulettes, a
	  <lb/>common hat with a black cockade, and a sword by his side.
	  <lb/>He is very tall and slender. He walked on by our door to
	  <lb/><persName>Major Wyatt's</persName>, his companion in arms, where he put up for the
	  <lb/>night, though he called on us that evening and the next morn­
	  <lb/>ing. His person is finely shaped, and his features not hand­
	  <lb/>some, but strikingly bold and determined. He is very easy
	  <lb/>and affable in his manners, and loves a jest. He told one of our
	  <lb/>party, he was <quote>one of the blue hen's chickens.</quote> He appears to
	  <lb/>be about 50 years of age. There is a great deal of dignity about
	  <lb/>him. He related many hardships endured by his men, in the ar­
	  <lb/>my, but never breathed a word of his own. His language is pure
	  <lb/>and fluent, and he has the appearance of having kept the best
	  <lb/>company.</p>
        <p>You will recollect he was ordered by the government
	  <lb/>against the <name>Seminole Indians</name>. His army is on its march con­
	  <lb/>siderably ahead of him, having crossed at <placeName>Ditto's Landing</placeName>,
	  <lb/>up the river, while he came round by this place to see his
	  <lb/>plantation an<choice><sic/><corr>d</corr></choice> slaves.</p>

        <p>The hero of the south, as he is called, left us this morn­
	  <lb/>ing, at 10 o'clock, and our best wishes went with him. Upon
	  <lb/>seeing him, I called to mind the night I was roused from my
	  <lb/>sleep in <placeName>Charlestown</placeName>, about midnight, by <persName>William Quarrier</persName>, who
	  <lb/>knocked at my door and proclaimed aloud, <said><persName>General Jackson</persName><lb/>has defeated the <name>British</name> at <name>New Orleans</name>; get up, we are going
	    <lb/>to illuminate.</said> This was the night of the fire-works and rejoic­
	  <lb/>ing upon the news of the victory, which you no doubt well
	  <lb/>remember. Many other anecdotes, particularly of his human­
	  <lb/>ity to the distressed, occured to my mind.</p>
        <p>Upon my return once from <placeName>Ohio</placeName>, I put up at a <persName>Mr. Jones's</persName>,
	  <lb/>on <placeName>Kentucky river</placeName>. In the course of the conversation, I ob­
	<lb/>served, <said>that a new county had been established in <placeName>Ohio</placeName>, and
	    <lb/>was called <placeName>Jackson</placeName>; and not satisfied with this mark of respect,
	    <lb/>they called the seat of justice <placeName>Jackson</placeName>.</said> <persName>Mrs. Jones</persName> ob­
	  <lb/>served they could not have him too much; and it gave her
	  <lb/>great pleasure to hear of his hapiness and success; that he had
	  <lb/>been the means once of saving herself and her children from
	  <lb/>perishing in the wilderness. <persName>Mrs. Jones</persName>, was the daughter of
	<lb/><persName>Captain Arbuckle</persName>, of <placeName>Greenbrier City</placeName>, <placeName>Va.</placeName> with whom you
	  <lb/>must be acquainted, though you may not be with the history
	  <lb/>of his daughter, as you are too young.—Her history contains
	  <lb/>a most surprising train of incidents, and superior to any
	  <lb/>novel. The story is this: <persName>Mr. Arbuckle</persName> had several hand­
	  <lb/>some and sensible daughters. One of these was addressed by
	  <lb/>a <persName>Mr. Jones</persName>, and a mutual and deep rooted affection grew up
	  <lb/>between them: but <persName>Captain A.</persName> opposed their union, and forbid
	  <lb/><persName>Jones</persName> his house; and finally through persuasion and force compel­
	  <lb/>led his daughter to marry the son of <persName>Captain Robertson</persName>, a near
	  <lb/>neighbour of mine. Upon this, <persName>Jones</persName> abandoned the country,
	  <lb/>and I never heard of him from that day till the night of which 
	  <lb/>I am now speaking. As soon as <persName>Robertson</persName> married the girl,
	  <lb/>he removed with her to <placeName>Natchez</placeName>, and I heard no more of them.
	  <lb/>I did see a publication in the newspapers, of a female travelling
	  <lb/>through the <name>Indian</name> nation, without protection, and that she,
	  <lb/>and six children, entered the state of <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>, nearly fam­
	  <lb/>ished. <persName>Mrs. Jones</persName> was the woman! Her own narrative fol­
	  <lb/>lows: <said rend="post()">I was forced to marry <persName>Mr. Robertson</persName> and be miser­

	    <lb/>able, or marry <persName>Mr. Jones</persName>, and render my father miserable; I
	    <lb/>preferred the former. All places being alike to me, after this
	    <lb/>sacrifice, I accompanied my husband to <placeName>Natchez</placeName>. We had
	    <lb/>received a handsome beginning from both our fathers, and
	    <lb/>were, for some time prosperous. But my husband, at length,
	    <lb/>fell in with bad company, and took to gambling and drinking,
	    <lb/>and spent the whole of his property.—Meantime we had seven
	    <lb/>children, which I partly maintained by my own labour. Fi­
	    <lb/>nally, my husband took sick, and after lingering some time,
	    <lb/>died, and every thing I had was seized and sold by his credi­
	    <lb/>tors, with the exception of four horses, which I concealed,
	    <lb/>with a view of conveying my children and myself to my father
	    <lb/>in <placeName>Virginia</placeName>. I hired a man to go with me, and departed early
	    <lb/>one night, and never stopped till I got over the boundary line
	    <lb/>between the white people and the <name>Indians</name>. I had but 8 dollars
	    <lb/>and a bushel of meal for myself and children; but I was so
	    <lb/>a<choice><sic><g ref="#invertedn"/></sic><corr>n</corr></choice>xious to get out of the reach of the white people, whom I ex­
	    <lb/>pected would pursue me, that I travelled without ceasing, or
	    <lb/>rest, till the second day about 10 o'clock, when I turned out
	    <lb/>my horses to feed on the pea vine, and began to prepare bread
	    <lb/>for my children. Several of them being sick when I left
	    <lb/><placeName>Natchez</placeName>, were stretched upon the ground, while I was prepar­
	    <lb/>ing food, when, behold, three white men, whom I knew, ap­
	    <lb/>peared in sight, having pursued me. They rode towards the
	    <lb/>horses, as if to surround and take them by force, when I flew
	    <lb/>between them and the horses, and told them they should not
	    <lb/>lay hands on them. I acknowledged I owed money in <placeName>Natchez</placeName>,
	    <lb/>which I honestly intended to pay when I reached my fathers.
	    <lb/>You have deprived me of all but the horses, and without them I 
	    <lb/>cannot reach my fathers. I am out of your jurisdiction. I
	    <lb/>am on <name>Indian</name> ground, and if you levy your process on my
	    <lb/>property, you do it at your peril. You know the penalty, and
	    <lb/>so do I, and I will prosecute you at every hazard. I had
	    <lb/>been particular enough to learn by certain signs on the line,
	    <lb/>and I knew I was out of their power. They endeavored to
	    <lb/>frighten me out of the horses, but finding it vain they returned.</said></p>
        <p>
          <said rend="post()">I pursued my journey all that night, and next day, un­
	  <lb/>til evening, when coming to a deep hollow, over which there
<pb n="72"/>

<mw type="pageNum">72</mw>
	  <lb/>was a bridge, I drove the horses over, and after taking
	  <lb/>a slight supper, I lay down on the bridge, with a view of
	  <lb/>guarding the horses. The man who was with me, an old
	  <lb/>silly sort of a man, had disappeared sometime before I lay
	  <lb/>down. I lay awake, suspecting some treachery. The
	  <lb/>moon shone quite bright. The old many had doubtless betrayed
	  <lb/>me to th<choice><sic/><corr>e</corr></choice> same men whom, as I expected, pursued me. When
	  <lb/>I missed the man I concluded I was undone, and gave way to
	  <lb/>despair; for, though I saw no possibility of the horses crossing
	  <lb/>the gully, except by the bridge, I was apprehensive some
	  <lb/>place was known to my guide, or to the men. As I lay watch­
	  <lb/>ing, with an aching heart, about midnight I perceived the
	  <lb/>horses moving slowly towards the bridge, and the same men,
	  <lb/>with the traitor, pursuing them silently. When the horses
	  <lb/>drew near the bridge, I jumped up and frightened them back,
	  <lb/>and the men disappeared. They, doubtless, expected I was
	  <lb/>asleep, and never dreamed of my securing the bridge. I never
	  <lb/>saw my men afterwards. I continued my journey, now and
	  <lb/>then buying a scanty supply of provisions for ourselves and
	  <lb/>horses, from the <name>Indians</name>. These were the <name>Choctaws</name>, and were
	  <lb/>very friendly. But it was at a season of the year when pro­
	  <lb/>visions were scarce.</said>

        <p>
          <said rend="post()">I travelled but slow, as my children were all sick, ex­
	  <lb/>cept one.—One of the children was so ill that I had to carry it
	  <lb/>in my lap; and though I expected to lose some of them, I strove
	  <lb/>to get to the white settlements if possible.</said>

        <p>
          <said rend="post()">The ninth day, as I was riding slow along, I met a gentle­

	  <lb/>me, and inquired very particularly into the cause of my travel­
	  <lb/>ling in the wilderness; and asked me how much money I had?
	  <lb/>I informed him I had but two dollars, and at the same time re­
	  <lb/>peating the cause of my journey. He approved my undertak­
	  <lb/><choice><sic>k</sic><corr/></choice>ing, and pulling out his purse, gave me <emph>forty dollars</emph>! He
	  <lb/>told me to keep a good heart, and I would surmount my diffi­

<pb n="73"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="10(1)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">73</mw>
	  <lb/>I discovered a gentleman, who appeared to be sick. He had
	  <lb/>been resting awhile, and finding I was going the same way,
	  <lb/>he had his horse prepared, and went on with me. He was very
	  <lb/>feeble, and was followed by a mule, which was heavily laden
	  <lb/>with <mcr>specie</mcr>. He had been taken sick on the road. We tra­
	  <lb/>velled together, very slow, till the third day, when he inform­
	  <lb/>ed me he could go no further. As I had some knowledge of
	  <lb/>medicine, and not wishing to travel without his company, I
	    <lb/>placed him in an <name>Indian</name> cabin, and having medicine with me,
	  <lb/>left by the physicians when my husband died, I administered
	  <lb/>it to him—in three days, during which I constantly attended
	  <lb/>him, he found himself well enough to venture on; and my chil­
	  <lb/>dren, too, being better, we proceeded with much greater celerity
	  <lb/>than before. We did not make as much progress as we could
	  <lb/>have wished, owing to the want of grain for our horses. He
	  <lb/>was well armed, but was, nevertheless, timorous—nor was I
	  <lb/>less so; and the following will prove that our fears were not
	  <lb/>groundless: As we were lying down one night, all asleep but
	  <lb/>myself, (I never slept at night,) my eyes being fixed upon the
	  <lb/>road, watching both ways, I saw a person walking up the road.
	  <lb/>I turned to the tent where the gentleman slept. (I always
	  <lb/>stretched a blanket over him at night,) and wakened him; but as
	  <lb/>I crawled to him, I saw two more men in the other end of the
	  <lb/>road, also, walking towards us. Their coming in this manner,
	  <lb/>evidently showed their design, which was to rob the gentleman.
	  <lb/>He seized a pistol, and called out to the men to stand—upon
	  <lb/>this, all three ran, and he fired after them. They never ap­
	  <lb/>peared after this, although we watched for them the whole of
	  <lb/>that night.</said>

          <said rend="post()">In the course of our conversations, I mentioned the mo­

	  <lb/>give me something before we separated. Taking a fancy to
	  <lb/>one of my horses, he inquired of me if I would dispose of him—
	  <lb/>that if I would he would give me the full value, and I could
	  <lb/>send him the horse when I arrived home. I agreed to this,

        <p><hi>The</hi> remainder of <persName>Mrs. Jones'</persName> story is so interesting that
	  <lb/>I must finish it. It amounts to the following:—When she ar­
	  <lb/>rived at home, her father gave her, by way of compensation,
	  <lb/>one of those fine tracts of land on the <placeName>Kenhawa river</placeName>, below the
	  <lb/><placeName rend="pre(“)post(”)">Washington Lands.</placeName> Meantime 
	  <persName>Jones</persName>, who was still un­
	  <lb/>married, wandered about the Western frontier, furing, &amp;c.
	  <lb/>and by sundry speculations, had collected a considerable sum
	  <lb/>of money; and the <name>British</name>, on their invasion of <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>,
	  <lb/>sending word to the citizens of <placeName>Louisville</placeName>, that they would <emph>dine</emph>
	  <lb/>with them the next day! many of the inhabitants became
	  <lb/>panic struck, and sold their possessions for a mere trifle.—
	  <lb/><persName>Jones</persName> became one of the purchasers, and grew, suddenly, rich.
	  <lb/>He was offered, I think, and received, one hundred per cent,
	  <lb/>for a part of the property, next day, reserving the best for him­
	  <lb/>self.</p>
        <p>When <persName>Jones</persName> heard of <persName>Mrs. Robinson's</persName> return, and death
	  <lb/>of her husband, he hastened to seek her; and, still retaining
	  <lb/>his partiality for her, and she for him, they were married.—
	  <lb/>She had been married about two years when I was at her house,
	  <lb/>and was in the act of packing up to remove to <placeName>Louisville</placeName>, where
	  <lb/>a splendid house and every thing that heart could wish was
	  <lb/>ready to receive her. I should have been much pleased to have
	  <lb/>seen <persName>Jones</persName>, but he was absent from home. I however saw a
	  <lb/>very handsome child, better than a year old, the fruits of their
	  <lb/>union. Let any of your novel writers beat this! <persName>Mrs. Jones'</persName>

        <p>Many similar acts of kindness, as related above, are told
	  <lb/>of <persName>General Jackson</persName>. He is represented as being particularly
	  <lb/>good and kind to his soldiers. One of his men informed me
	  <lb/>he would walk through the mud for miles, and let his sick men
	  <lb/>ride his horse. He would distribute his biscuit, tea, and
	  <lb/>whatever his private stores consisted of, amongst the sick, and
	  <lb/>go to the slaughter pen, and he and his suite would broil and
	  <lb/>eat the tripe, and other offal, without bread and without salt.
	  <lb/>This man, also, stated to me, he was present at the <name>battle of
	  <lb/>the Horse Shoe</name>, and a squaw being killed by accident, her
	  <lb/>child was found alive, and at the breast of its dead mother.—
	  <lb/>The General was pierced to the heart, and taking the child
	  <lb/>in his arms, had it immediately fed and clothed, and hired a
	  <lb/>person to take it to <placeName>Huntsville</placeName>, to be nursed. He has adopted
	  <lb/>the child since, and calls it <persName rend="slant(italic)">Leneour Jackson</persName>, and both himself
	  <lb/>and <persName>Mrs. Jackson</persName> treats it with the utmost tendernes.</p>
        <p>Last fall <persName>General Jackson</persName> came to the Bluff, when every
	  <lb/>family was down with a fever, it being exceedingly sickly.
	  <lb/>Many of these were unable to give the others a drink of water.
	  <lb/>He had heard of the sickness of which his overseer had died,
	  <lb/>and of several of his slaves being confined at the same time.—
	  <lb/><persName>Mrs. Mitchell</persName>, and her husband, (the merchant before men­
	  <lb/>tioned) were lying, not able to rise, one in one bed, and the
	  <lb/>other opposite in another. She related to me, that the Gener­
	  <lb/>al and his suite would take the water buckets and go to the
	  <lb/>river for water; heat it over the fire, and take the sick in their
	  <lb/>arms, and placing their feet in the warm water, would thus
	  <lb/>support them, until they were sufficiently bathed, and then
	  <lb/>bear them back to their bed again. After this the General
	  <lb/>would administer medicine with his own hands. Thus he went
	  <lb/>the whole night, and never ceased till he had administered the
	  <lb/>necessary wants to all, both black and white, and consoling
	  <lb/>them with the most soothing language. <persName>Mrs. M.</persName> said the Ge­
	  <lb/>neral had handled her as tenderly as though she were a babe;
	  <lb/>and when he left the place, he ordered a negro woman of his
	  <lb/>own to wait on all those who were without servants. You
	  <lb/>could scarcely hear his name mentioned without the repetition of
	  <lb/>some generous act. Well may the people adore him as they
	  <lb/>do.</p>

        <p><hi>If</hi> I were not the best tempered person in the world, I
	  <lb/>should get into a pet and quit this correspondence. If it were
	  <lb/>not for some way to pass off the time, I would do so. I have
	  <lb/>not received a word from you these three weeks. What are
	  <lb/>you about? Are you sick, or sullen; or bemiring yourself and
	  <lb/>your horse by riding up and down the river through the mud;
	  <lb/>or, taking the opportunity of my absence, gone to your old
	  <lb/>tricks again? I shall be likely to hear no good of you, I sus­
	  <lb/>pect. When I return, I mean to make very particular inqui­
	  <lb/>ries about you; and there are not wanting those that will tell
	  <lb/>me the truth; and a great deal more!</p>
        <p>But I will give you only a piece of letter now, and the
	  <lb/>residue of it when I get over the fatigue I experienced in a
	  <lb/>late party of pleasure, or rather expedition, not against, but
	  <lb/>amongst, the <name>Indians</name>. But such a job, or rather such <quote>a voy­
	    <lb/>age of discovery,</quote> as it was made by our party on the river, un­
	  <lb/>der a commander or leader, who was called a good waterman,
	  <lb/>but who was more like a land-lubber, unless the character of
	  <lb/>a good waterman consists in roundly wetting and worrying all
	  <lb/>his passengers, you never witnessed, perhpas never <quote>read
	    <lb/>of.</quote> The particulars of it, however, would not be at all inter­
	  <lb/>esting, because, they would be much like ordinary frights,
	  <lb/>screams, and <quote>hair-breadth 'scapes</quote> of most large parties,
	  <lb/>composed chiefly of females crammed into one poor little canoe
	  <lb/>to navigate a great river. A more ill-looking, frightened,
	  <lb/>chagrined, fatigued, be-drabbled, and be-drowned set of miser­
	  <lb/>ables, than our party exhibited after being rocked and toss­
	  <lb/>ed about, not in <quote>the <placeName>Bay of Biscay</placeName>, O,</quote> but in the broad
	  <lb/><placeName>Tennessee</placeName> for a considerable time without making a progress
	  <lb/>of 800 yards, you never beheld in decent people, who started in
	  <lb/>high spirits and holy-day dresses. All the curls, crimps, and
	  <lb/>flourishing of gay gowns, new shoes, silk stockings, pantaloons
	  <lb/>and petticoats, shawls and other flaunting finery <emph>humbled</emph>—not
	  <lb/><quote>to the dust,</quote> but—to the water! But I will now only give
	  <lb/>you the <quote>subject of my story,</quote> and the object of this <quote>grand
	    <lb/>expedition,</quote> and proceed to the result of it in my next.</p>

          <p>Hearing eleven boats had arrived about two miles from
	    <lb/>hence, and had haulted up the river, we set off, as I said before,
	    <lb/>in a little canoe, to see the <name>Indians</name>, which are on their way
	    <lb/>to their destination beyond the <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>. Government,
	    <lb/>agreeably to their contract, having completed the boats, the
	    <lb/>news of the arrival of the <name>Indians</name> had been received with
	    <lb/>much interest; but being unable to proceed by water, we quit
	    <lb/>the canoe, and proceeded by land in our wet shoes and hose.</p>
          <p>We arrived at the <name>Indian</name> camps about eleven o'clock.
	    <lb/>There were several encampments at the distance of three hun­
	    <lb/>dred yards from each other, containing three hundred <name>Indians</name>.
	    <lb/>The camps were nothing but some forks of wood driven into
	    <lb/>the ground, and a stick laid across them, on which hung a pot
	    <lb/>in which they were boiling meat; I took it to be venison.
	    <lb/>Around these fires were seated, some on the ground, some on
	    <lb/>logs, and some on chairs, females of all ages; and all employed,
	    <lb/>except the old women. There were some very old gray-haired
	    <lb/>women, and several children at each camp. The children
	    <lb/>were very pretty; but the grown females were not. I saw
	    <lb/>but few men. I asked the interpreter where they were: he
	    <lb/>said they had gone to hunt; some of them had returned, and
	    <lb/>were skinning and others preparing their game for their jour­
	    <lb/>ney. But none of them were near the womens' department;
	    <lb/>they kept at a very respectful distance.</p>
          <p>I have heard much of the elegant figures of the <name>Indians</name>; true,
	    <lb/>some nations of <name>Indians</name> are elegantly formed, but such is not
	    <lb/>the case with the <name>Cherokees</name>. They are low in stature, and
	    <lb/>there is nothing majestic or dignified about them. They have
	    <lb/>no expression of countenance. They have a dead eye; but
	    <lb/>their feet and hands are exceedingly small and beautiful.
	    <lb/>This is all the beauty I could distinguish about them. No
	    <lb/>lady that ever I saw has a hand so small or so well turned as
	    <lb/>these <name>Indian</name> women; and the same may be said of their feet.
	    <lb/>But, after all, they are ugly lumps of things. They are thick
	    <lb/>and short. Their hair is jet black, and very coarse. It
	    <lb/>parts from the crown of the head to its termination on the
<pb n="78"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="10(3)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">78</mw>
	    <lb/>forehead, as the <name>Dutch</name> women wear theirs, and clubbed up
	    <lb/>behind with a blue or red ferret. Their colour is that of dark
	    <lb/>mulattoes. They were all well dressed; at least as well as
	    <lb/>most white women are, when engaged in their ordinary em­
	    <lb/>ployment. Some were engaged in sewing, some in cooking,
	    <lb/>and some in nursing their babies, which were the prettiest
	    <lb/>little creatures I ever beheld.</p>
          <p>Their manner of nursing is singular. They do not hold
	    <lb/>their infants in their arms, or on their laps, as our women do;
	    <lb/>but on their backs, confined in such a manner that they are
	    <lb/>in no danger of falling, or moving in any direction. This is
	    <lb/>done by means of a blanket, or a part of one, drawn tight
	    <lb/>round the infant, leaving its head and arms out. This blan­
	    <lb/>ket is fastened round the waist of the mother, and the top I
	    <lb/>do not know exactly how; but the utmost confidence seems to
	    <lb/>be reposed in its tenacity, as the mother never touches the
	    <lb/>child with her hands, or is at any more trouble with it what­
	    <lb/>ever. The little things clasp their arms round the necks of
	    <lb/>their mothers, which they never move: no crying, nor fretting,
	    <lb/>nor any apprehension of danger disturbed the serenity of these
	    <lb/>little philosophers, on our approaching them. I have been
	    <lb/>told that the mothers suckle them, where they are, by raising
	    <lb/>the breast up to the child's mouth, which is very probable.</p>
          <p>The <name>Indian</name> women appear to sustain no inconvenience
	    <lb/>from the incumbrance of their children. They went through
	    <lb/>the different vocations of pounding their corn into meal, car­
	    <lb/>rying wood and water, with the same apparent ease as those
	    <lb/>that had no children. Seeing several little girls of from ten to
	    <lb/>twelve years old, I asked the women why they did not make
	    <lb/>those little girls nurse their little ones. They answered no
	    <lb/>other way than by shaking their heads, and smiling at my ig­
	    <lb/>norance, no doubt. I went up to one of them, who was pound­
	    <lb/>ing corn, took the pestle out of her hand and helped her to
	    <lb/>pound: she laughed at my awkwardness, and took it out of my
	    <lb/>hand. She had, sitting by her on a washing-tub, a large tray
	    <lb/>full of parched corn. This it was that she was pounding into
	    <lb/>meal; and as she finished each portion, she emptied it into an­
	    <lb/>other tray. Every thing about her was neat and clean. The
<pb n="79"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="10(4)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">79</mw>
	    <lb/><name>Indian</name> corn was parched to a nice light brown, and looked
	    <lb/><quote>very interesting.</quote> The meal manufactured from this corn,
	    <lb/>is not fine, nor do they make it into bread at all, but mix it
	    <lb/>with common water and drink it. 'Tis rarely that they
	    <lb/>drink water in any other way. No one, who has never tasted
	    <lb/>it, would believe what a delicious drink it is.</p>
          <p>Having walked about and made a number of inquiries, I
	    <lb/>sat myself down and made signs to an old <name>Indian</name> woman that
	    <lb/>I wanted to smoke: she very courteously handed me her pipe.
	    <lb/>The seat I had chosen was near one of those women, whom I
	    <lb/>had observed for some time, sedulously engaged with her nee­
	    <lb/>dle. She was engaged making a family dress, in which she
	    <lb/>discovered all the skill and industry necessary to accomplish
	    <lb/>it. Their dresses were made like our ladies, and were put on.
	    <lb/>They had fine cotton shawls on their shoulders, and many of 
	    <lb/>them had men's hats on their heads; but no bonnets were seen
	    <lb/>amongst them. They all had good shoes or mockasins on
	    <lb/>their feet, and some hundreds of beads round their necks; but
	    <lb/>their broad faces and coarse hair (as coarse as a horses mane)
	    <lb/>were quite disgusting. There is one elegance, however, which
	    <lb/>they possess in a superiour degree to any civilized people that
	    <lb/>I am acquainted with; and this is not their beautiful hands and
	    <lb/>feet, already mentioned, but their walk. No lady, however
	    <lb/>skilled in the art of dancing, can walk with so much grace and
	    <lb/>dignity as these <name>Indians</name>, both men and women: and this, I am
	    <lb/>told, is peculiar to almost all <name>Indians</name>.</p>
          <p>Although there were such a number of them, so near to­
	    <lb/>gether as to be seen from one camp to the other, yet there was
	    <lb/>the greatest ardor imaginable: not the least noise to be heard.
	    <lb/>How would so many whites have managed to maintain the good
	    <lb/>order evinced by these <name>Indians</name>? Even their dogs were not
	    <lb/>permitted to bark at us. The poor dogs! I felt for them: they
	    <lb/>were nothing but skin and bone! The same word that we use
	    <lb/>to encourage our dogs to seize on any thing, or to bark, the
	    <lb/><name>Indians</name> use to control theirs, which is <mentioned>hiss</mentioned>! One of our party
	    <lb/>told me that it was <foreign xml:lang="chr">hiska</foreign>! which means <gloss>be still</gloss>. The dress
	    <lb/>of the men was equally as decent and fashionable as that of the
	    <lb/>women. Many of them had on very neat half-boots, broad<choice><sic/><corr>­</corr></choice>
<pb n="80"/>

<mw type="pageNum">80</mw>
	    <lb/>cloth coats, and good hats; though some prefer tying their
	    <lb/>heads up with a handkerchief, as being more convenient to hunt
	    <lb/>in.</p>
          <p>By all that I have said in regard to these <name>Cherokees</name>, you
	    <lb/>may perceive they are far advanced in civilized arts and man­
	    <lb/>ners. This great work was accomplished by the indefatigable
	    <lb/>labors of the <persName>Reverend Gideon Blackburn</persName>! And yet, what an
	    <lb/>aversion they manifest toward our language! I was told that
	    <lb/>nearly all those that I saw, both understood and could talk
	    <lb/>good <name>English</name>; but not one word could I get out of them, of any
	    <lb/>sort. Their inter-communications were carried on by signs.
	    <lb/>I saw many of the half-breed, as they are called, here; the off­
	    <lb/>spring of a white and an <name>Indian</name>—but they were as unsociable
	    <lb/>as the others. I was thinking that this would be a good plan
	    <lb/>to promote their civilization, but the result proves that any
	    <lb/>plan would not succeed. It is very probable, that the most
	    <lb/>effectual means have been resorted to by our government to
	    <lb/>overcome their prejudices. I mean our rifles.</p>
          <p>Please to give my best respects to <persName>Mrs. Wilson</persName> and <persName>Mrs.
	      <lb/>Dryden</persName>.</p>

	  <lb/>things you would not dream of.</p>
        <p>But as you are fond of stories, here follows one, which I 
	  <lb/>am pretty certain you never saw. It is the first time I saw it,
	  <lb/>and is said to be written by <persName>Dr. Franklin</persName> himself: <quote rend="post()">The Doc­

	    <lb/>tor left <placeName>Boston</placeName> when a boy, and came to <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, where
	    <lb/>he lived till his death. Upon the death of his father, he went
	    <lb/>to <placeName>Boston</placeName> to comfort and console his mother. He had not
	    <lb/>seen her since he left <placeName>Boston</placeName>, many years, and was sure she
	    <lb/>would not know him. When he drew near her dwelling, as he
	    <lb/>was fond of philosophical experiments, it came into his head to
	    <lb/>pass himself for a stranger, and by this, ascertain whether
	    <lb/>there was such a thing as natural affection. On a cold, chilly
	    <lb/>day, in the month of <name>January</name>, in the afternoon, the Doctor
	    <lb/>knocked at the door, and asked to see <persName>Mrs. Franklin</persName>. He
	    <lb/>found the old lady knitting, before the parlour fire, and intro­
	    <lb/>duced himself, by observing, that he had been informed she en­
	    <lb/>tertained travellers, and requested a night's lodging. She eyed
	    <lb/>him with that cold look of disapprobation, which most peo­
	    <lb/>ple assume, when they imagine themselves insulted. She as­
	    <lb/>sured him, that he had been misinformed, that she did not keep
	    <lb/>tavern, but that it was true, to oblige some members of the
	    <lb/><orgName>Legislature</orgName>, she took a number of them into her family during
	    <lb/>the session: that she then had four members of the <orgName>Council</orgName>,
	    <lb/>and six of the <orgName>House of Representatives</orgName> boarding with her;
	    <lb/>and that all her beds were full; and then betook herself to her
	    <lb/>knitting, with that intense application, which expressed as much
	    <lb/>and as forceably as actions could do—if you have done your
	    <lb/>business, the sooner you leave the better. But on the Doctor's
	    <lb/>wrapping his coat about him and observing that it was very
	    <lb/>chilly weather, she pointed to a chair and gave him permission
	    <lb/>to warm himself. The entrance of the boarders precluded all
	    <lb/>further conversation. Coffee was soon served, and the Doctor
	    <lb/>partook with the rest of the family. To the coffee succeeded
	    <lb/>pipes and a paper of <persName>McIntire's</persName> best, when the whole family
	    <lb/>formed a cheerful smoking semi-circle round the fire.</quote></p>

	    <lb/>and amusing anecdotes. Thus employed, the hours passed
	    <lb/>merrily along, until eight o'clock, when punctual to a moment,
	    <lb/><persName>Mrs. Franklin</persName> announced supper. Busied with her household
	    <lb/>affairs, she fancied the intruding stranger had quitted the house
	    <lb/>immediately after coffee, and it was with difficulty she restrain­
	    <lb/>ed resentment when she saw him without invitation seat him­
	    <lb/>self at the table with the freedom of a member of the family.
	    <lb/>Immediately after supper, she called an elderly gentleman, a
	    <lb/>member of the <orgName>Council</orgName> in whom she was accustomed to con­
	    <lb/>fide, to another room, complained bitterly of the rudeness of
	    <lb/>the stranger, told the manner of his introduction to the house,
	    <lb/>observed that he appeared like an outlandish man, and she
	    <lb/>thought he had something very suspicious in his appearance;
	    <lb/>concluding by soliciting her friend's advice with respect to the
	    <lb/>way in which she could most easily rid herself of his presence.
	    <lb/>The old gentleman assured her that the stranger was a man of 
	    <lb/>education, and to all appearances a gentleman; that being in
	    <lb/>agreeable company, he had paid no attention to the lateness of 
	    <lb/>the hour, and advised her to call him aside, and repeat to him
	    <lb/>her inability to lodge him. She accordingly sent her maid to
	    <lb/>him, and then, with as much temper as she could command,
	    <lb/>recapitulated the situation of her family, observed that it grew
	    <lb/>late, and mildly intimated, that he would do well to seek him­
	    <lb/>self a lodging. The Doctor said that with her leave he would
	    <lb/>smoke one more pipe with her boarders, and then retire. He
	    <lb/>returned to the company, filled his pipe, and with the first
	    <lb/>whiff his powers of conversation returned with redoubled force.
	    <lb/>He recounted the hardships, he extolled the piety and policy
	    <lb/>of our ancestors. A gentleman present mentioned the subject
	    <lb/>of the day's debate in the <orgName>House of Representatives</orgName>—a bill had
	    <lb/>been introduced to extend the prerogatives of the crown. The
	    <lb/>Doctor immediately entered upon the subject, separated the
	    <lb/>Colonial rights with new and forcible arguments, was familiar
	    <lb/>with the names of the influential members of the house, when
	    <lb/><persName>Dudly</persName> was Governor, recited their speeches, and applauded
	    <lb/>the noble defence of the Chamber rights.</quote>

	    <lb/>the delighted circle. Nor was it wonderful, that <persName>Mrs. Frank­
	      <lb/>lin</persName>, by this time, grew exhausted: she now entered the room,
	    <lb/>and, before the whole company, with much warmth, addressed
	    <lb/>the Doctor, told him plainly she thought herself imposed on,
	    <lb/>observed it was true she was a lone woman, but that she had
	    <lb/>friends, who would protect her, and concluded by insisting on
	    <lb/>his leaving the house. The Doctor made a slight apology and
	    <lb/>very deliberately put on his great coat and hat, took a polite
	    <lb/>leave of the company, and approached the street door, lighted
	    <lb/>by the maid and attended by the mistress. While the Doc­
	    <lb/>tor and his companions had enjoyed themselves within,
	    <lb/>a most tremendous snow had fallen without, which had
	    <lb/>filled the streets knee-deep; and when the maid lifted
	    <lb/>the latch, a roaring northwester forced open the door,
	    <lb/>extinguished the light, and almost filled the entry with drifted
	    <lb/>snow and hail. As soon as the candle was relighted, the Doc­
	    <lb/>tor cast a woful look towards the door, and thus addressed his
	    <lb/>mother: <said>My dear Madam, can you turn me out of doors in
	      <lb/>this dreadful storm? I am a stranger in this town, and shall
	      <lb/>certainly perish in the street. You look like a charitable old
	      <lb/>lady: I don't think you could turn a dog from your door on this
	      <lb/>tempestuous night.</said> Don't tell me about charity, said the of­
	    <lb/>fended matron; charity begins at home. It was your own
	    <lb/>fault, that you staid so long: to be plain with you, sir, I don't
	    <lb/>like your conduct; and I fear you have some bad design in thus
	    <lb/>intruding yourself on my family. The warmth of the parley
	    <lb/>had drawn the company from the parlour, and by their united

        <p><hi>The</hi> anecdote of <persName>Doctor Franklin</persName>, in my last, reminds
	  <lb/>me of a similar one of my mother.</p>
        <p>When I was a child, my parents removed from <placeName>Maryland</placeName>
	  <lb/>to the frontier of <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>, and settled in the woods at the
<pb n="85"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="11(3)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">85</mw>
	  <lb/>mouth of <placeName>Loyalhanah</placeName>, now in <placeName>Westmoreland County</placeName>. I can
	  <lb/>just remember passing through <placeName>Tanny Town</placeName>, and seeing a sign
	  <lb/>over a tavern door, which represented a boy sitting on a keg
	  <lb/>with a bunch of grapes in his hand. I thought they were
	  <lb/>actually grapes, and asked for some to eat. This, and seeing
	  <lb/>the trees covered with snow, as we rode along, and <persName>Isaac
	    <lb/> Fanosedelle</persName>, who travelled with us, is all I recollect of the
	  <lb/>journey. But, to the anecdote.</p>
        <p>A vast number of sugar trees grew in that region, and
	  <lb/>my mother employed herself in the spring of the year in
	  <lb/>making sugar. I was about four or five years old, when my
	  <lb/>father being on a journey, and my mother, as usual, employed
	  <lb/>at the sugar camp, had left my sister (younger than I) and 
	  <lb/>myself in the house by ourselves. The spring was far advanc­
	  <lb/>ed, and as my sister and myself were amusing ourselves
	  <lb/>catching butterflies before the cabin door, on a warm sunshine
	  <lb/>evening, we were on a sudden surprised by a gentleman on
	  <lb/>horseback, who rode up to us, and inquired <said>if he could stay
	    <lb/>all night.</said> We stood still, staring at the gentleman, not
	  <lb/>knowing what answer to make, till he inquired where our
	  <lb/>parents were, and what were the<choice><sic>re</sic><corr>ir</corr></choice> names. I was always the
	  <lb/>first to speak, and said, <said>my mama is at the sugar camp, and
	    <lb/>her name is <persName>Mary</persName>; and my papa's name is <persName>William</persName>.</said> <said>I
	    <lb/>shall stop,</said> said he, and alighted from his horse, and taking
	  <lb/>off the saddle, laid it down by the door, and asked me <said>if we
	    <lb/>had a stable to put horses in?</said> I told him I did not know what
	  <lb/>that was—but we put old <name>Bonny</name> in the pen there, pointing it
	  <lb/>out to him. <said>Have you any corn?</said> said the gentleman. <said>Yes,
	    <lb/>sir, we have corn in the crib.</said> <said>You are a fi<choice><sic><g ref="#invertedn"/></sic><corr>n</corr></choice>e girl; come
	    <lb/>and show me the crib,</said> said he, smiling: and after turning
	  <lb/>his horse in the pen, I ran to show him the crib, communicat­
	  <lb/>ing every incident within my memory to him, without reserve,
	  <lb/>at which he laughed heartily, and chatted with me in turn.—
	  <lb/>But a violent dispute succeeded to this. I told him he took
	  <lb/>too much corn for his horse; he must not take more than
	  <lb/>twelve <mcr>ears</mcr>, that was all we gave to <name>Bonny</name>. He gave the best
	  <lb/>of reasons why his horse should have more than <name>Bonny</name>; but
<pb n="86"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="11(3)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">86</mw>
	  <lb/>he argued to the wind. Our parents had laid down certain
	  <lb/>rules for us to go by, and these were as firm and steadfast as
	  <lb/>the laws of the <name>Medes</name> and <name>Persians</name>. I did not grudge him the
	  <lb/>corn, but thought he was a novice in the art of feeding a horse;
	  <lb/>and, finally,  he was forced to let me have my own way.</p>
        <p>Our cabin, or camp rather, was very small—not more
	  <lb/>than 8 or 10 feet. This contained one bed, four wooden stools,
	  <lb/>with legs stuck in them through augur holes, half a dozen tin
	  <lb/>cups, and the like number of pewter plates, knives, forks, and
	  <lb/>spoons, though my sister (very mischievous) had lost one of 
	  <lb/>the knives, (for which I was chastised,) broke one of the spoons,
	  <lb/>and seriously damaged one of the plates. Besides these we
	  <lb/>had a tray and frying pan, a camp-kettle, and a pot; and our
	  <lb/>cabin was considered the best furnished on the frontier.<anchor xml:id="a21" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n21"/> Be­
	  <lb/>sides this, we had a table made of puncheon, (a tree split in
	  <lb/>half,) and like the other furniture, was graced with four sub­
	  <lb/>stantial legs of rough hewed white oak. I think we had a 
	  <lb/>towel, but as for table-cloth, I had never seen one to my know­
	  <lb/>ledge; and neither trunk nor box incommoded us. There was
	  <lb/>a few skins upon which those reposed who thought proper to 
	  <lb/>share them. Sometimes we had bread, and always a plenty of
	  <lb/>meal.</p>
        <p>The gentleman upon entering the hut, asked <said>if we had
	    <lb/>any thing to eat? I am very hungry; I have eat nothing since
	    <lb/>morning.</said> <said>We have plenty of jerk (dried venison) in the
	    <lb/>chimney,</said> I replied. He soon had a piece in his hand; and
	  <lb/>hearing a hen at the door, he asked if we had any eggs? My 
	  <lb/>sister upon the inquiry ran out to a nest, hard by, and brought
	  <lb/>four eggs in, and gave them to him. He made a hole in the
	  <lb/>ashes, and covered up the eggs, and having salt and biscuit
	  <lb/>with him, he made a hearty meal. He gave us a cake each.</p>
        <p>It was now near night, and after taking a walk to look at
	  <lb/>his horse, the gentleman being weary, said he would lie down.
	  <lb/>He had travelled that day from <placeName>Pittsburg</placeName>. I offered him the
	  <lb/>only bed in the house, saying <emph>we</emph> could sleep on the floor; we
<pb n="87"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="11(4)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">87</mw>
	  <lb/>had done so many a time. He declined the offer, and throw­
	  <lb/><choice><sic/><corr>ing</corr></choice> a bear skin, said, <said>that would do very well. I am used to
	    <lb/>camping out; this will be delightful,</said> and threw himself on the 
	  <lb/>floor. I ran and brought two or three more, and seeing I was
	    <lb/>hardly able to drag them along, he laughed, and took them
	    <lb/>from me. He put his saddle under his head, and I took a 
	  <lb/>spare quilt and threw it over him. In a very few minutes he
	  <lb/>was fast asleep, and still my mother came not, though it was
	  <lb/>quite dark; I put my sister to bed, as she grew sleepy, and sat
	  <lb/>up alone.</p>
        <p>My mother having a fine day for her business, did not ar­
	  <lb/>rive till, perhaps, an hour after dark, and one of the next neigh­
	  <lb/>bors, a female (the only one we had except the <persName>Peery's</persName> came
	  <lb/>with her, as she frequently did, when my mother was alone:
	  <lb/>and, in turn, my mother would take us children, when their
	  <lb/>husbands were absent, and spend the night with her. I had
	  <lb/>heard their approach, and opening the door, ran to meet them
	  <lb/>with the news I had to impart. I expected to receive the ap­
	  <lb/>plause of the two; but what was to my astonishment to find they
	  <lb/>were not only displeased, but alarmed. It was just at the com­
	  <lb/>mencement of hostilities with the <name>Indians</name>, and several white
	  <lb/>men were recently detected as spies. <said>He is a spy, I'll wager,</said>
	  <lb/>said aunt <persName>Molly</persName>, (as we called her.) <said>I'll be bound!</said> said
	  <lb/>my mother, <said>or some robber come to murder us. You ought
	    <lb/>not to have let him in the house,</said> said she sharply; <said>never
	    <lb/>do the like again.</said> Finding I had done wrong in my mother's 
	  <lb/>estimation, I sneaked into the house, and set myself down,
	  <lb/>leaving the matrons holding a counsel in the yard. At length
	  <lb/>they entered, on tiptoe, and lighting a lamp, took a peep at
	  <lb/>the stranger, who was snoring aloud. They drew near the
	  <lb/>fire, after this, and aunt <persName>Molly Carrahan</persName> said, <said>I don't like
	    <lb/>his looks.</said> <said>Nor I neither,</said> said my mother. <said>He looks
	    <lb/>for all the world,</said> said the former, <said>like <persName>Paddy Dunahan</persName>,
	    <lb/>that was hung in <placeName>Limerick</placeName>, for killing of <persName>Dennis O'Shaan</persName>.</said>
	  <lb/>My mother said she had a great mind to take her children,
	  <lb/>and go to <persName>Mr. Blane's</persName> to-night. <said>Not a foot will ye stir,</said>
	  <lb/>said aunt <persName>Molly</persName>. <said>I'll tell you what we'll do, <persName>Mary</persName>. I'll just
	    <lb/>put on the camp-kettle and have it boiling in a giffey, and
<pb n="88"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="11(4)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">88</mw>
	    <lb/>if he offers to stir, I'll scald his eyes out the first thing. He's 
	    <lb/>just one of the them <name>English</name>, I'll warrant, come to spy out the
	    <lb/>land; but if he offers for to go to molest us, I'll put him past
	    <lb/>spying.</said></p>
        <p>The camp-kettle was put on, and a brisk fire made under
	  <lb/>it; and for my part, in no apprehension from the stranger, I
	  <lb/>laid myself down, and soon fell asleep. The first thing I saw
	  <lb/>in the morning, was the gentleman pulling on his boots, and
	  <lb/>my mother, (who doubtless sat up the whole night,) with a
	  <lb/>smile, bid him good morning; and aunt <persName>Molly</persName>, and <name>Irish</name> woman,
	  <lb/><said>hoped he had had pleasant dreams.</said> The gentleman apolo­
	  <lb/>gized, said he had been very fortunate in lighting upon a
	  <lb/>house; that he had travelled the preceding day through the
	  <lb/>wilderness without meeting with one, and praised me no little
	  <lb/>for a fine girl; and told the story to my mother about the horse
	  <lb/>feed. The two ladies were highly delighted, and breakfast
	  <lb/>was prepared for him before he set out; his horse fed; and, at
	  <lb/>his departure he gave me a silver dollar, the first I ever saw.
	  <lb/>And whom do you think was the gentleman? No less than the
	  <lb/>amiable <persName>Mr. Findley</persName>, long a member of <orgName>Congress</orgName> from <placeName>Penn­
	    <lb/>sylvania</placeName>, distinguished for his republican principles, and one
	  <lb/>of the ablest men in the state. He used to be called <quote>the
	    <lb/>walking library,</quote> from his knowledge of books; and one of the
	  <lb/>finest <emph>looking</emph> men in the world.</p>

	  <lb/><persName>Philips'</persName> Speeches, and <persName>Lady Morgan's</persName> <placeName>France</placeName>; all new to me.
	  <lb/>I never saw them before. They are very interesting. Standing
	  <lb/>in a store one day, I saw a book lying amongst some rubbish, and
	  <lb/>requesting the clerk to hand it to me, after brushing the dust
	  <lb/>from it, I found it to be <title>Salmagundi,</title> a humorous and well
	  <lb/>written work, by <persName>Paulding</persName> and <persName>Irving</persName>, of <placeName>New York</placeName>, so it is
	  <lb/>said. <said>Oh,</said> said the boy, <said>that is not a <emph>good</emph> book. If you
	    <lb/>want a book to read, here is a <emph>good</emph> book,</said> and handed <persName>Rus­
	    <lb/>sell's</persName> Severi Sermons. He put me in mind of old <persName>Mrs. W—</persName>,
	  <lb/>whom you must have known. She came to our house one
	  <lb/><name>Sunday</name>; (she hardly missed a <name>Sunday</name>:) I was reading <persName>Buffon</persName>,
	  <lb/>and laying the book on a chair to attend to something about
	  <lb/>the house, the woman picked it up, and turning the leaves
	  <lb/>over, exclaimed, <said>La, do you read such books to-day?</said>
	  <lb/><said>Why! what is the matter with it?</said> <said>Why it an't a <emph>good</emph>
	    <lb/>book. I would not read such a book on the <name>Sabbath</name>.</said> Now, 
	  <lb/>this woman would pick whortleberries, and even wash her
	  <lb/>clothes on <name>Sunday</name>. The young man was, doubtless, of the
	  <lb/>same stamp.</p>
        <p>Have you seen <persName>Lady Morgan's</persName> <placeName>France</placeName>? You will be
	  <lb/>pleased with it. For a woman she is a fine writer. This
	  <lb/>work will long remain a standing evidence of that towering
	  <lb/>genius which knows no sex. Her delineation of men and
	  <lb/>manners are well drawn. Her style is classical, nervous,
	  <lb/>glowing, and pure, and discovers a perfect knowledge of man­
	  <lb/>kind. She is the best portrayer I have met with, except <persName>Vol­
	    <lb/>taire</persName>. She descends to the bottom, and searches the lowest
	  <lb/>depths of society. She re-ascends amongst the nobility and
	  <lb/>gentry, and unlocks the cabinets of kings and ministers. She
	  <lb/>examines for herself. She bursts the chains of prejudice, and
	  <lb/>comes forth arrayed in honors all her own. This female, an
	  <lb/>honor to her sex, and the brightest ornament of literature, was
	  <lb/>once, it seems, an actress, and on the stage.</p>
        <p>I have seen several <emph>new</emph> novels, which, with the excep­
	  <lb/>tion of <persName>Walter Scott's</persName>, I do not read. Insipid, frothy, nauseous
	  <lb/>stuff, I cannot endure them,—they are so stuffed with un­
	  <lb/>meaning words. Now what do you say to <quote>playfulness, fas­
	    <lb/>tidious, witchery;</quote> how silly in sound and signification; it

	  <lb/>makes one sick, and serves no purpose but to entangle the
	  <lb/>subject and obscure the sense. And, by the way, these silly
	  <lb/>novel writers must show their learning. Profound philoso­
	  <lb/>phers! deeply read in history! abundance of things irrelevant
	  <lb/>to the subject. Simpletons, we suppose every one know these
	  <lb/>things. But, as some one has said, <quote>let blockheads read
	    <lb/>what blockheads write.</quote> But I find these novels corrupt the
	  <lb/>morals of our females, and engender hardness of heart to real
	  <lb/>distress. Those most pleased with fictitious distress, have
	  <lb/>hearts as hard as iron. If they are pleased with one who re­
	  <lb/>lieves fictitious distress, the reality ought to please much more,
	  <lb/>and every one may be a <emph>real</emph> hero, or heroine, with less trouble
	  <lb/>than writing or reading a romance. Let them just step into
	  <lb/>the streets, the highways, or the hovel of the widow or orphan,
	  <lb/>heaven knows they may find enough there; they need not look
	  <lb/>in books for distress. I have seen pictures of real distress,
	  <lb/>which greatly exceeded the pen of any novel writers; and yet
	  <lb/>none heeds it. Relieving these would be Godlike, and would
	  <lb/>impart a heaven upon earth. But you like short letters.</p>

        <p><hi>I am</hi> never better pleased, than when seated alone by a
	  <lb/>bright fire, a clean swept hearth, a lighted candle, and a pair
	  <lb/>of snuffers. I have a snuffer-tray too, but one who was rais­
	  <lb/>ed in the woods, you know, can easily dispense with a snuffer-
	  <lb/>tray; but I confess, I abominate the practice of snuffing the
	  <lb/>candle with your fingers. I was going on, however, to say,
	  <lb/>that nothing gives me more pleasure than to seize my pen at
	  <lb/>night, sitting comfortably, as I just observed, and talking to
	  <lb/>you on paper; and here follows another catalogue of every day
	  <lb/>incidents, appalling ones indeed, but you <emph>will</emph> have them.</p>
        <p>It is one hand asserted, that human nature is the same
<pb n="91"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="12(2)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">91</mw>
	  <lb/>in all ages, and in all countries, on our globe. This is denied
	  <lb/>by others, who say <quote>as the twig is bent, the tree's inclined.</quote>
	  <lb/>That there is a difference in mankind, is certain, and I am
	  <lb/>forced to believe this difference is the effect of education.—
	  <lb/>Mankind, say some, are all alike. Alike, in what? This
	  <lb/>vague conclusion is a violation of justice and truth. If it be
	  <lb/>meant that mankind are alike in shape—true; but that they
	  <lb/>are alike in actions, I deny! Else how comes it, that one man
	  <lb/>will cooly, wantonly, and deliberate<choice><sic/><corr>l</corr></choice>y spill the blood of his fel­
	  <lb/>low man; whilst another affectionately relieves his sufferings?
	  <lb/>Whether the cause of this difference lies in nature, or educa­
	  <lb/>tion, I am unable, or rather unwilling, to say. But I am in­
	  <lb/>clined to think it the effect of education. We have a conclu­
	  <lb/>sive evidence in the two <mcr>puppies</mcr> of <persName>Lycurgus</persName>. One of these
	  <lb/>was purposely trained to the chase, and the other left to pursue
	  <lb/>the dictates of nature. <persName>Lycurgus</persName>, you will recollect, to con­
	  <lb/>vince the <name>Spartans</name> of the power and influence of education on
	  <lb/>children, brought the two dogs, both of the same litter, into the
	  <lb/>school room, and setting a dish of victuals in the centre of the
	  <lb/>room, also a live hare, let loose the two dogs; and what was
	  <lb/>the consequence? the dog trained to the chase took after the
	  <lb/>hare, and the other ran to the dish of victuals.</p>
        <p>It is, however, well known, that the brute, in a state of
	  <lb/>nature, is superior to the human race; for instance, dog will
	  <lb/>not eat dog; cat will not eat cat; nor will any of the brute crea­
	  <lb/>tion feed on its own species. But man will eat man! This
	  <lb/>fact cannot be denied; and though we have line upon line, and
	  <lb/>precept upon precept; and teachers from A, B, C, to the ma­
	  <lb/>thematics for these 1818 years, yet we have cannibals still.—
	  <lb/>This proves that something is wrong in our system of educa­
	  <lb/>tion; or while it evidently improves our nature in o<choice><sic><g ref="#invertedn"/></sic><corr>n</corr></choice>e place,
	  <lb/>why does it not improve the whole—and while it has been able
	  <lb/>to cure one vice, why has it not cured all? It is clear, educa­
	  <lb/>tion improves mankind, and makes them happier, why then
	  <lb/>does it progress so slow? The system must be wrong. But
	  <lb/>what I was going to remark, we have great encouragement
	  <lb/>to press forward in the arts of improvement, and since we have
	  <lb/>been able to overcome the shocking practice of feeding upon

	  <lb/>the flesh of our fellow man, we may in time, perchance 1818
	  <lb/>years hence, be able to arrive to such a height of refinement,
	  <lb/>as to cease from the practice of killing him; which I think is
	  <lb/>a much worse crime than eating him after he is dead. It does
	  <lb/>the dead no harm to eat him; and yet what an outcry against
	  <lb/>cannibals. It is not the eating a man after he is dead, that con­
	  <lb/>stitutes crime; it is the taking away of his life. A lady told
	  <lb/>be once she would kill an hundred men before she would eat
	  <lb/>one. She was a christian and not a cannibal. I hope, however,
	  <lb/>to see the day that we may cease to kill men, since we have
	  <lb/>ceased to eat them. In the one case we have so far overcome
	  <lb/>nature, and I hope we will not stop till murder is rooted out
	  <lb/>from amongst mankind.</p>
        <p>I was led to these reflections, by various incidents of
	  <lb/>recent occurrence, in this region; but no matter, wherever I
	  <lb/>go, wherever I turn, I see ignorance the most besetting crime,
	  <lb/>of the blackest die, and vice the most glaring. Amusing
	  <lb/>myself this evening with a spy-glass, viewing the gambols of
	  <lb/>a large flock of swans, whilst I had the glass up to my eye, I
	  <lb/>saw a boat gliding swiftly down the river. It drew near to
	  <lb/>the shore, on the opposite side, and a solitary man leaped out,
	  <lb/>and fastening the boat, hastily disappeared in the woods. I
	  <lb/>sat musing upon the strange appearance of seeing but one man
	  <lb/>in the boat, when I was called to supper, where I found sever­
	  <lb/>al strangers, who had just arrived. In the course of the con­
	  <lb/>versation I mentioned the circumstance; when one of the
	  <lb/>strangers, who was from <placeName>East Tennessee</placeName>, inquired the dress,
	  <lb/>and height of the man, and observed, <said>that is the man we are
	    <lb/>in pursuit of.</said> He then added, <said>that this man had committed
	    <lb/>two murders in <placeName>East Tennessee</placeName>, one in the summer, and one
	    <lb/>in the fall; and that he was so desperate, people were afraid to
	    <lb/>risk their lives in apprehending him; and he went at large.</said>
	  <lb/>He has a sister over the river, three miles from here, where I
	  <lb/>suspect he has gone to night. His sister lives at <placeName>Fort Hamp­
	    <lb/>ton</placeName>, and is a very fine looking woman. I breakfasted at her
	  <lb/>house on my way from <placeName>Huntsville</placeName>. The gentleman endeavor­
	  <lb/>ed to collect men to go and take him that night: but no one was
	  <lb/>wil<choice><sic>i</sic><corr>l</corr></choice>ing to join in the enterprize, and we heard no more of him.

	  <lb/>But the following circumstance would seem to confound the
	  <lb/><choice><sic>the</sic><corr/></choice> idea advanced in the commencement of this letter, and
	  <lb/>seems to decide in favor of man, in a state of nature; so you
	  <lb/>may see, that by giving both sides of the question, I am free
	  <lb/>from prejudice at least. About a year since, a widow lady,
	  <lb/>who lived in <placeName>East Tennessee</placeName>, having received several invita­
	  <lb/>tions to go to reside with a brother who lived in the lower part
	  <lb/>of this territory, accordingly, disposing of her property, ex­
	  <lb/>cepting two beds, a negro girl, a favorite white cow, and three
	  <lb/>horses upon which she and a daughter, (who was a woman
	  <lb/>grown,) her beds, &amp;c. were to be conveyed. She took passage
	  <lb/>by water, in <placeName>East Tennessee</placeName>, with other persons, (who were
	  <lb/>removing,) to this place, intending to pursue the residue of
	  <lb/>her journey by land. She remained here at the Bluffs, a few
	  <lb/>days, endeavoring to procure a man to accompany her, both as
	  <lb/>guide and protector, her way lying through the <name>Choctaw
	    <lb/>Indian</name> nation. A man, with whom she had been formerly ac­
	  <lb/>quainted, and who had followed the business of navigating the
	  <lb/><placeName>Tennessee</placeName>, (or boating down the river, as it is called,) happened
	  <lb/>to come to the Bluff; she hired this man, and set forward on
	  <lb/>her journey. The first day after leaving the Bluff, they over­
	  <lb/>took two <name>Indians</name> who were travelling the same way. They all
	  <lb/>proceeded together, until the next night. Some hours, how­
	  <lb/>ever, before night, the young lady complained of being sick,
	  <lb/>and wanted water. The <name>Indians</name> informed her, that there was
	  <lb/>a fine spring, a few miles before them, at which they would 
	  <lb/>arrive about camp time. The young woman being very thirs­
	  <lb/>ty, asked if there was no water nearer. They replied that
	  <lb/>there was a little creek about half way. They travelled on to
	  <lb/>this creek, when the white man said he would stop for the
	  <lb/>night. The <name>Indians</name> tried to dissuade him from his purpose,
	  <lb/>but in vain—he would stay there—the <name>Indians</name> would go on to 
	  <lb/>the spring.</p>
        <p>In the night the negro girl was awakened by the screams
	  <lb/>of her young mistress, and beheld her old mistress weltering
	  <lb/>in blood, and in the last struggles of death; and the wretch,
	  <lb/>their guide, in the act of raising an axe to split out the brains
	  <lb/>of the young lady, which he instantly did, although she begged
<pb n="94"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="12(3)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">94</mw>
	  <lb/>her life of him on her knees! He then ran to the negro girl,
	  <lb/>and commanded her to <emph>hush</emph> instantly, or he would split out her
	  <lb/>brains also; but that, if she would be a good girl, and report
	  <lb/>(if any inquiries were ever made for the women) that they were
	  <lb/>killed by the <name>Indians</name>, she would not be hurt. He then took
	  <lb/>the two dead bodies, one at a time, and dragged them by the
	  <lb/>heels, as the girl states, and threw them on an island in the
	  <lb/>aforesaid creek. The next morning he set out with all the
	  <lb/>property, changing his course a little from that which the <name>In­
	    <lb/>dians</name> had taken. To the first white inhabitant, whose house
	  <lb/>he reached, he sold the murdered woman's beds, her wearing
	  <lb/>apparel, and the cow. When questioned about the blood on
	  <lb/>the beds, he said his wife was travelling with him; that she
	  <lb/>took sick and died; that she had been bled, and in that way ac­
	  <lb/>counted for the blood on the bed. He then proceeded towards
	  <lb/>the <name>Spanish</name> dominions, taking the negro girl and horses with
	  <lb/>him. In the course of two months, the same two <name>Indians</name> re­
	  <lb/>turned, and happened to call at the same house where the white
	  <lb/>man sold the clothing and white cow. Seeing the cow in the
	  <lb/>yard, they knew her instantly, and asked what was become of
	  <lb/>the two women who owned that cow. The man replied, that
	  <lb/>he had bought the cow of a travelling <emph>man</emph>, not a woman. To
	  <lb/>repeated inquiries made by the <name>Indians</name> they discovered it must
	  <lb/>be the same man. The horses, the negro girl, &amp;c. corroborat­
	  <lb/>ed so exactly, that the <name>Indians</name> immediately suspected the man
	  <lb/>of murdering the women. They stated every circumstance of
	  <lb/>the young lady's wanting water, the creek, and the spring;
	  <lb/>and proposed that this man should go with them and they
	  <lb/>would, probably, find the dead bodies. Accordingly, the man
	  <lb/>went with the <name>Indians</name>, and found <emph>their</emph> camp by the spring,
	  <lb/>as they had stated, and the other by the creek, exactly as the
	  <lb/><name>Indians</name> had reported; and upon searching the spot sometime,
	  <lb/>they found the dead bodies in the creek, and round the waist of
	  <lb/>the young woman, they found specie and bank notes to a large 
	  <lb/>amount!!!</p>
        <p>The man who purchased the property, said he would have
	  <lb/>the murderer at the hazard of his life and fortune.—He pur­
	  <lb/>sued him, and in the lower country found him, and, securing
<pb n="95"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="12(4)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">95</mw>
	  <lb/>him in jail, returned home. The murderer broke jail and re­
	  <lb/>turned to <placeName>East Tennessee</placeName>. The man who first took him, hear­
	  <lb/>ing this, proceed to <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>, retook him, and placed him in
	  <lb/>jail, which he again broke, and has not been heard of since.
	  <lb/>The gentleman who had so often interfered, in endeavoring to
	  <lb/>bring this murderer to punishment, was heard to say <said>he would
	    <lb/>pursue the murderer to the end of the world, but he would find
	    <lb/>him.</said><anchor xml:id="a22" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n22"/></p>

          <salute>Dear <persName>Matt</persName>,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p><hi>I laid</hi> over the other part of my subject (ignorance) for
	  <lb/>another letter. You may remember the little <placeName>Natchez</placeName> widow,
	  <lb/>our guest; also the proud, haughty, next neighbor. Since
	  <lb/>that, <emph>another</emph> widow has arrived, different from both these.
	  <lb/>She is learned, sensible, and gay, though rather satirical. The
	  <lb/>little widow is very captious, and pronounces <said>dis, dat, and
	    <lb/>torra,</said> the comon dialect I am told of the country she came 
	  <lb/>from. She does not want sense, however, but is little skilled
	  <lb/>in the affairs of the world. Old <persName>Mrs. Starchy</persName> and her can
	  <lb/>never agree, and the other widow amuses herself at their ex­
	  <lb/>pense, and often has them almost by the ears. But I am ramb­
	  <lb/>ling again. Several gentlemen, on a visit to this country to
	  <lb/>purchase land, spent a few days at the Bluff. They were gen­
	  <lb/>tlemen of intelligence, learning, and politeness. While here,
	  <lb/>they had frequent opportunities of conversing with the ladies,
	  <lb/>of which they availed themselves with that taste, and good
	  <lb/>sense which ever distinguish well bred people. But, alas! then
<pb n="96"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="12(4)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">96</mw>
	  <lb/>it was I discovered the disadvantage a female labors under,
	  <lb/>when destitute of education; and this is still more apparent
	  <lb/>when contrasted by one of their own sex. It is well for them
	  <lb/>their ignorance effectually screens them from all knowledge of
	  <lb/>the ridiculous figure they make. If they were sensible of the 
	  <lb/>pain they inflict upon those who are so unfortunate as to hear
	  <lb/>them blundering from one thing to another; miscalling some
	  <lb/>words, and misapplying others; and the no small pains they
	  <lb/>take to expose their ignorance, shame and mortification would
	  <lb/>drive them mad.</p>
        <p>One evening, when all our females were present, (I have
	  <lb/>always heard widows were jealous of each other, but this time
	  <lb/>I had occular proof of the fact,) our newly arrived widow put
	  <lb/>her rivals to shame, and gained a complete victory. This she
	  <lb/>was enabled to do, without violating those rules of politeness,
	  <lb/>which dispose the well bred modesty to concede their talents,
	  <lb/>rather than wound the feelings of the company. The conver­
	  <lb/>sation, at first, general, soon turned upon the victory of <name>New
	    <lb/>Orleans</name>, and its consequences to the <name>British</name> government; the
	  <lb/>accumulation of their national debt; and the expenditures of
	  <lb/>their navy in times of peace. This last was stated by a friend
	  <lb/>of the lady; in doing which, he inadvertently committed him­
	  <lb/>self. The lady had paid deep attention to the subject, and
	  <lb/>seemed to participate in it like one thoroughly acquainted with
	  <lb/>the subject; and the moment the gentleman mistated the amount
	  <lb/>of the expenditures, she smiled, and set him right. He bowed
	  <lb/>to her, as much as to say, go on, I yield to you. She took up the
	  <lb/>subject where he left off, and went into a complete investigation
	  <lb/>of the <name>British</name> policy; the measures of their ministers; and their
	  <lb/>effects upon the people at large. She introduced many origin­
	  <lb/>al remarks of her own, upon their system of finance, with the
	  <lb/>probable effects that may result, or grow out of the contemplated
	  <lb/>change. Imagine the surprise of the company, who regarded
	  <lb/>her with deep attention. The ladies turned their eyes upon
	  <lb/>her in astonishment, and stared at her for some time; but, at
	  <lb/>length, they began to whisper, and carry on a conversation
	  <lb/>amongst themselves, with no friendly aspect. I heard one of 
	  <lb/>them say, <said>Some folks ar very fond o' talkin wiht men—I
<pb n="97"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="13(1)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">97</mw>
	    <lb/>never liked men.</said> <said>Nor I neither,</said> said another lady, in a 
	  <lb/>negro dialect; <said>it's a bad sign to see some folks so fond o'
	    <lb/>men.</said> <said>I never, for my part,</said> said old <persName>Starchy</persName>, <said>liked men
	    <lb/>so well.</said> When I hear a woman say she does not like men,
	  <lb/>I have the same opinion of her that I have of a man who praises
	  <lb/>his honesty; or a parson who boasts of his religion. There is
	  <lb/>a striking analogy between these three descriptions of people,
	  <lb/>and one conclusion may apply to the whole of them.</p>
        <p>On the next morning our guests departed, and a friend of
	  <lb/>ours took occasion to call on the lady who expressed such a 
	  <lb/>dislike to <emph>men</emph>. He carelessly observed, that he felt quite lone­
	  <lb/>some upon the departure of the strangers. She bridled up,
	  <lb/>and said, <said>Where is Mrs.――; she is very good company I
	    <lb/>'spose?</said> <said>Yes,</said> said the gentleman, <said>she is very agreeable;
	    <lb/>she has very few equals.</said> <said>I 'spose she's a great scholar;
	    <lb/>and I dare say she's very rich. For my part, I don't know
	    <lb/>what she is, nur I don't care, that's more. She's a mighty
	    <lb/>game-making sort of woman, for one thing, I know. If I was
	    <lb/>Mrs――, I would tell her a piece of my mind, I know—that I
	    <lb/>would. She's a mighty <emph>comicle</emph> sort of a somebody anyhow,
	    <lb/>oh!</said> She ended, and shook her head.</p>
        <p>A lady asked me one day <said>What state <placeName>Virginia</placeName> was in?</said>
	  <lb/>Another asked <said>If <placeName>Canada</placeName> was not in <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>?</said> and, ano­
	  <lb/>ther <said>Supposed Joe Graphy was very hard to learn.</said></p>
        <p>Hence arises all our mistakes in religion, morals, and po­
	  <lb/>litics. When our reason is cultivated and our minds enlighten­
	  <lb/>ed by education, we are enabled to strip off that disguise
	  <lb/>which knavery, bigotry, and superstition wears. It rectifies
	  <lb/>our judgements, holds the reins of our passions, in short, en­
	  <lb/>ables us to discover whatever tends to promote our present
	  <lb/>and eternal welfare. I was reading a newspaper to-day in
	  <lb/>which was something respecting <placeName>Ireland</placeName>; a genteel, well dress­
	  <lb/>ed looking man was standing by, and asked me if <placeName>Ireland</placeName> was
	  <lb/>not in <placeName>South America</placeName>! He lives in this place; he is worth not
	  <lb/>less than twenty thousand dollars; is a candidate for the office
	  <lb/>of sheriff, in this county, which is the next wealthiest in the 
	  <lb/>state; he has eight or nine competitors, and the misfortune is,
	  <lb/>that the electors, or a majority of them, and his rivals, are

<pb n="98"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="13(1)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">98</mw>
	  <lb/>equally ignorant! Now, what sort of an administration of public
	  <lb/>affairs are we to expect when it is wielded by such men as
	  <lb/>these? This is to be the downfall of our country some day!—
	  <lb/>All republics have fallen from the same cause. We learn, when
	  <lb/>the republic of <placeName>Rome</placeName> was overturned, it was done by the ignor­
	  <lb/>ant vulgar. We find that all the men of learning and polite
	  <lb/>manners, rallied on the side of liberty, while <persName>Cæsar</persName> was wor­
	  <lb/>shipped by the common people—as a frie<choice><sic/><corr>n</corr></choice>d of mine once said,
	  <lb/><said>all the common people want rope enough.</said> This ignorance
	  <lb/>is not confined to any one part of the Union; it is universal. I
	  <lb/>happened to be in court once in a respectable county in <placeName>Vir­
	    <lb/>ginia</placeName>. The court was just commencing, the judge ordered
	  <lb/>the sheriff to <said>command silence until he gave the charge to
	    <lb/>the <orgName>Grand Jury</orgName>.</said> The sheriff replied, that <said>he would thank
	    <lb/>him (the judge) to do it himself, as he was a new hand at the
	    <lb/>business.</said> This was the high sheriff of the county. Why, a
	  <lb/>person who is reputed to know any thing of geography, philo­
	  <lb/>sophy, or astronomy, is looked upon with as much abhorrence
	  <lb/>by the great mass of the people, as if he were in league with
	  <lb/>the devil. They are jealous of the rich and great. Why then,
	  <lb/>do they grovel in the dark? Why don't they seek to have their
	  <lb/>minds enlightened, which is their only security against the
	  <lb/>oppression and encroachments of the wealthy? In a country
	  <lb/>like this, where the freedom of elections bestows public honors
	  <lb/>and public offices on every man alike, how can he discharge
	  <lb/>the duties of his office with honor to himself, or benefit to his
	  <lb/>country, who is ignorant of the principles of the very founda­
	  <lb/>tion of his government? or how can he tell when the govern­
	  <lb/>ment is administered correctly by others, when he is destitute
	  <lb/>of the knowledge by which he is to ascertain the fact? Ever
	  <lb/>since I can remember, this has been the case: the great mass
	  <lb/>of the people are just the same; not one step do they advance
	  <lb/>in knowledge. Is there not something wrong in our system
	  <lb/>of education? If there be, where does the defect lie? I have
	  <lb/>seen many evils, much sorrow, much oppression, much wicked­
	  <lb/>ness of all descriptions and degrees, indeed I see nothing else.
	  <lb/>I have taken much pains to trace these evils to their source,
	  <lb/>and find its origin in ignorance. I have pursued them through
<pb n="99"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="13(2)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">99</mw>
	  <lb/>all those labyrinths, and they all stop here. But to apply a re­
	  <lb/>medy, or to dictate one, would exceed, <choice><sic><g ref="#invertedp"/></sic><corr>p</corr></choice>erhaps, the powers of
	  <lb/>any one man or woman. If I were to speak from experience
	  <lb/>upon this desultory view of the subject, I would say, in the
	  <lb/>first place, that man is a reasonable being, reason is improved
	  <lb/>by observation and study, and, as we see, hear, and under­
	  <lb/>stand from the cradle to the grave, we are learning from the
	  <lb/>first dawn of understanding. Man's education, therefore, be­
	  <lb/>gins with his life, and ends at his death. But first impressions
	  <lb/>are the most permanent, because they find the mind empty and
	  <lb/>prepared to take in a greater share than it is ever able to do
	  <lb/>thereafter; and because the mind is soft and blank, as a sheet
	  <lb/>of white paper receives the type, so it receives the impression
	  <lb/>of images which are never effaced, and although he still is im­
	  <lb/>proving by observation, yet the original impressions are the
	  <lb/>strongest and accompanies us to the end of our lives. How
	  <lb/>necessary is it then to impress the young mind with justice and
	  <lb/>humanity. How necessary to enforce them, both by precept
	  <lb/>and example, since these impressions are to influence them all
	  <lb/>their lives afterwards. But when parents are ignorant them­
	  <lb/>selves, deplorable indeed must be the state of their offspring.
	  <lb/>Destitute of learning himself, a man sees not the necessity of
	  <lb/>cultivating the reason of his child, who, thrown on the world
	  <lb/>like a vessel on the ocean, without sail or rudder, no wonder
	  <lb/>he is shipwrecked on the rocks of superstition and credulity.—
	  <lb/>But here lies the misfortune, and here I fear it is long to rest:
	  <lb/>most parents not only being ignorant but are highly prejudiced
	  <lb/>against learning. I shall dismiss the subject by a remark on 
	  <lb/>myself, upon the strength and force of early impressions.</p>
        <p>When I was yet a very small child, being a <emph>terrible</emph> great
	  <lb/>scholar, and a <emph>cruel</emph> good reader, my mother, proud of her first
	  <lb/>born, procured scores of <emph>little histories</emph> for me to read—such as
	  <lb/>the <title>Seven Wise Masters,</title> <title><persName>Moll Flanders</persName>,</title> <title>Paddy from
	    <lb/>Cork,</title> &amp;c. and many a weary hour did I pour over these <emph>little
	    <lb/>histories</emph>. I knew they were stories, that is, falsehoods; and what
	  <lb/>was the consequence—when I came to read real history, I had
	  <lb/>no more idea that it was reality than I had that <persName>Aladdin</persName> and his
	  <lb/>Lamp, were true. The very name, <emph>history</emph>, of all others, bore
<pb n="100"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="13(2)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">100</mw>
	  <lb/>the impression of falsehood, and it was long before I could be­
	  <lb/>lieve that history was a narrative of facts; and had I not for­
	  <lb/>tunately fell in with a person of learning, I should always have
	  <lb/>delved at <emph>little histories</emph>.</p>
        <p>Every country have their little histories. Since I have
	  <lb/>been here, numbers have asked me to loan them a <emph>little history</emph>:
	  <lb/>all have the <emph>little</emph>. From not mixing with the common people,
	  <lb/>not one in a thousand is aware of this state of society. One
	  <lb/>would think that it would be the first and only object with men
	  <lb/>of letters, to set on foot some method to enlighten the great
	  <lb/>mass of the people, as they must, inevitably, and that before
	  <lb/>long, have the management of matters in their own hands!—
	  <lb/>And many a one, at this moment, are in office, by the instru­
	  <lb/>mentality of a vote purchased for half a pint of whiskey! But
	  <lb/>says one, <quote>there always have been degrees of knowledge,
	    <lb/>and always will be distinctions in society;—nor was it intend­
	    <lb/>ed all men should be upon an equality.</quote> That there has al­
	  <lb/>ways existed degrees in knowledge, I admit, but that ignor­
	  <lb/>ance is a necessary consequence, is most false. There is an­

        <p><hi>Now</hi> we have it from real life. If this does not cure you
	  <lb/>of the <emph>blues</emph>, nothing that I can give you will. You have heard
	  <lb/>of electioneering, and have seen it too. But your elections
	  <lb/>bear no comparison to those here.</p>
        <p>This country exhibits man in all his varieties, and in all
	  <lb/>his gradations, from the country boor, to the most polished
	  <lb/>gentleman—There is something truly amusing in contemplat­
	  <lb/>ing the progress of society. To see man slowly emerging
	  <lb/>from a state of nature, to take his stand in civilized life—to
	  <lb/>behold him in defiance of rules and maxims thrusting himself

	  <lb/>forward, his means small, and at most, precarious—his under­
	  <lb/>standing limited—his heart ingenuous, exposing him to the
	  <lb/>subtleties of his designing neighbor—to consider man in this
	  <lb/>point of view, is a luxury to a thinking mind.</p>
        <p>This morning, while we were sitting at breakfast, a 
	  <lb/>stranger stepped in, who proved to be one of the neighbors.
	  <lb/>He was rather coarsely dressed, but had a pleasing aspect.
	  <lb/><said>Well, old fellow,</said> said the Colonel, <said>how goes it;</said> shaking
	  <lb/>hands cordially. <said>How do you do? Come, Sir, sit down,
	    <lb/>and take some breakfast with us—[<persName>Maria</persName> bring a plate, and
	    <lb/>knife and fork]—Come, Sir, take a dram first—[Hand a glass
	    <lb/><persName>Maria</persName>.</said>] The stranger took a dram, and then seated himself
	  <lb/>at the table; and the Colonel and him carried on a kind of
	  <lb/>dialogue, for some time. <said>How is your family, Sir?</said> <said>Why
	    <lb/>I'm 'bliged to you, Colonel, the'r all about, but <persName>Mary</persName>: She's
	    <lb/>got her ager yet. How's it wi' yourself?</said> <said>We are all well
	    <lb/>thank you, Sir. Let me help you to another piece of steak.
	    <lb/>Have some of the gravy, Sir. Well, lets hear the news: who
	    <lb/>do the people talk of voting for—[take some butter, Sir]—in
	    <lb/>your part? What do they talk about?</said> <said>Why, some on'em 
	    <lb/>is mighty feard, see, of losin their land; and some on'em agin
	    <lb/>is 'mind to stand 'em a pull. I tell you what, Colonel</said>—[<persName>Sam</persName>
	  <lb/>put more wood on the fire]—<said>its hard upon a poor man, after
	    <lb/>all, after clearin on himself a smart patch o' ground, and put­
	    <lb/>tin it under a good fence.</said>—[Pour out some more coffee, <persName>Ma­
	    <lb/>ria</persName>]—<said>see, and buildin on him a snug cabin, and then for a
	    <lb/>rich man like you, Colonel, because he rebounds in most money,
	    <lb/>to come to buy it from over his head, see t'll 'e what, it's little
	    <lb/>sort o' hard. But I reviewed it so from the first. I saw how
	    <lb/>it was a goin and sold out. If they fool me they have but one
	    <lb/>more to fool.</said> <said>Well, but tell me, old fellow, who do the peo­
	    <lb/>ple talk of voting for on <placeName>Flint</placeName>?</said> <said>Why, to tell the truth,
	    <lb/>Colonel, they'r purty much divided. Some on 'em talks a run­
	    <lb/>nin <persName>Doctor Crab</persName>—[<persName>Maria</persName> set that decanter on the table]—
	    <lb/>and some on 'em agin talk o' votin for <persName>Lawyer L.</persName></said> [Take 
	  <lb/>some whiskey, Sir.]—<said>But tell me, who do you intend to vote
	    <lb/>for?</said> <said>Well, I was jist goin to say, I don't hold with sendin
	    <lb/>none of these here doctors, and lawyers, and 'losophers.—I

	    <lb/>look upon it, see, that these here men of larnin jist lay the'r
	    <lb/>heads together, and cologue, and jist make laws to 'press the
	    <lb/>poor. I'm for 'sportin a plain farmer, like myself, Colonel,
	    <lb/>that will act upon nomical principles—an't I right?</said> <said>But tell
	    <lb/>us, <distinct xml:id="a23" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n23">old fellow</distinct>, have you any corn to sell up your way?</said> 
	  <said>Why,
	    <lb/>it's purty tol'able sca'ce. I raised a fine chance this year,
	    <lb/>and my wife had the finest passel of <mcr>truck</mcr>—I da'e say, she had
	    <lb/>greens enough to a 'splied the whole neigborhood; but <persName>Jim
	      <lb/>Wilson's</persName> critters broke in and most 'stroyed the whole affair:
	    <lb/>so it is, I shall have to buy. The neighbors told me, if it had
	    <lb/>abin them, as it was me, they would a shot the critters. But
	    <lb/>that would abin too sneakin. But an't you comin to the bar­
	    <lb/>bacue, next <name>Friday</name>? <persName>Doctor Crab</persName> is goin to have a great bar­
	    <lb/>bacue,  and goin to make a stump speech; and there's to be the
	    <lb/>greatest doins that ever was heard on. He's sent up two bar­
	    <lb/>rels of whiskey, and—</said> <said>Where is it to be?</said>—<said>Why it's to
	    <lb/>be at <name>Ellum's Mill</name>; and old <persName>Molly's</persName> goin to do her best, I dare
	    <lb/>say sh'll make her own out on 'em. She's one of your most in­
	    <lb/>active women folks in all my knowin, and she has plenty to
	    <lb/>go upon. Come up, <name>Thursday</name>, to my house, and bring your
	    <lb/>gun, and we'll take the hounds and have a hunt. Thank God,
	    <lb/>I have plenty to go upon, enough to eat and drink, and plenty
	    <lb/>to feed your critter. We'll knock up a fat chicken or two, and
	    <lb/>my wife is first rate at a cup of coffee. Stay all night, and
	    <lb/>we'll take a hunt in the mornin!</said> <said>Well, Sir, I believe I
	    <lb/>will.</said> <said>That's clever: I shall look for you.</said> <said>So, some of
	    <lb/>your neighbors are a mind to contest the public sales?</said> <said>They
	    <lb/>say so. <persName>Tom Towns</persName> says he has a friend that will help him
	    <lb/>out. But you know how it was the first land sales; every poor
	    <lb/>fellow as <emph>fout</emph> for his country, was forgotton, see, and kicked
	    <lb/>off, and thought nothin of—Don't tell me about <emph>premptions</emph>; oh!
	    <lb/>I seed enough! <persName>Colonel Donalson</persName> said it was a diabolical
	    <lb/>business.</said> Though I was unable to discover the Colonel's
	  <lb/>candidate, I was pleased with the blunt honesty of the country­
	  <lb/>man, who was now interrupted by the entrance of another
	  <lb/>countryman.</p>
        <p>The ladies withdrew, but I was spell-bound to the spot.—

        <p>The second guest was alike known to the Colonel and the

	    <lb/>in at <persName>Merchant's</persName> last <name>Friday</name>, before breakfast, when who
	    <lb/>should come along, ridin of a 
	    <distinct xml:id="a24" rend="post(*)slant(upright)" corresp="#n24">critter</distinct>, but <persName>Bill</persName>. 
	    I seed he
	    <lb/>had skins tied behind him; so he hitches his critter, and comes
	    <lb/>in, and after talkin awhile, and takin a dram, he axed to look
	    <lb/>at some cloth, and told <persName>Marchant</persName> to cut off four yards, and
	    <lb/>takes out a 100 dollar note, and pays for the cloth, and puts
	    <lb/>the change in his pocket, and axed <persName>Marchant</persName> if he didn't want
	    <lb/>to trade for some <distinct>coonskins</distinct>. <persName>Marchant</persName> said he didn't care if 
	    <lb/>he did, if they were good. So <persName>Bill</persName> goes out and brings in the
	    <lb/>coonskins. <persName>Marchant</persName> looks at them—very good skins—count­
	    <lb/>ed the tails, and axed what for trade he'd make? So, <persName>Bill</persName> said
	    <lb/>he'd take same he'd always gave, and would take it in domes­
	    <lb/>tic cotton; and the other agreed to it, and the skins lay on the
<pb n="104"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="13(4)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">104</mw>
	    <lb/>counter. So, after awhile <persName>Bill</persName> went off, and I went off home,
	    <lb/>too, and never heard any more of it till yesterday; I was at the
	    <lb/>store, and <persName>Marchant</persName>, says to me, says he, <said>do you think that 
	      <lb/>r—l <persName>Cheatum</persName> didn't cheat me that day, give me a counterfeit
	      <lb/>note—and didn't you see how slick he sarved me about the
	      <lb/>coonskins. Didn't you see the coonskins, and didn't you see
	      <lb/>the note?</said> <said>Yes, says I, I saw the coonskins, and the
	      <lb/>note, too.</said> <said>Nothing in the world but possom skins, coon­
	      <lb/>tails tied to them, and only bare two coons<choice><sic>h</sic><corr>k</corr></choice>ins in the whole,
	      <lb/>one at top and one at bottom.</said> With that he showed me the
	    <lb/>skins; and sure enough nothing but possum skins, and the note
	    <lb/>not worth one cent. It's as fair cheatin says I, as ever I seed in
	    <lb/>my life; and you can make him smoke for it. Yes, says <persName>Mar­
	      <lb/>chant</persName>, but catching's before hanging—the villain's cleared out.</said>
        </p>
        <p>Thus the Colonel and his guests talked and laughed at the
	  <lb/><distinct>coonskins</distinct>—drank whiskey, electioneered, and finally settled
	  <lb/>the affairs of the nation among themselves.</p>

        <p><hi>A merry</hi> <name>Christmas</name> to you; and a merrier one than we
	  <lb/>have, you need not. I cannot hold the pen for laughing.
	  <lb/>Such another comic farce was never played on any stage as
	  <lb/>was played here last night. But first, without meeting or
	  <lb/>seeing your brother, I arrived, on my way from <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, at the
	  <lb/>Bluff, last night. I met with the Colonel at <placeName>Limestone Court</placeName>,
	  <lb/>and the evening being fine, and our company lively and jovial,
	  <lb/>we concluded to proceed all the way to the Bluff, where we
	  <lb/>arrived about 10 o'clock, and found the company still up.
	  <lb/>For though they had no expectation of seeing me, till I enter­
	  <lb/>ed the house, they were looking for the Colonel, who, by pro­
	  <lb/>mise, was to be home that night.</p>
        <pb n="105"/>
        <milestone unit="sig" n="14(1)r"/>
        <mw type="pageNum">105</mw>
        <p>The Colonel has been appointed to marry people since I
	  <lb/>left the Bluff; and, late as the hour was, he had to marry a
	  <lb/>couple, who had been waiting for him from an early hour in 
	  <lb/>the day. The clerk of the county, who boards with the Co­
	  <lb/>lonel, and who had issued the license, came in to apprise him,
	  <lb/>and the Colonel forthwith sent for the couple. Imagine our
	  <lb/>surprise, at seeing an old man of about sixty, and the bride
	  <lb/>little under. The Colonel, being a man of humour, blends sun­
	  <lb/>dry ceremonies with the marriage contract, suited to his fancy
	  <lb/>and the persons he marries.</p>
        <p>In the first place he told the couple to stand forth, asked
	  <lb/>them several ludicrous questions—made them repeat the Lord's
	  <lb/>prayer—and when the ceremony was ended, (being put up to
	  <lb/>it by the young men who boarded with him) directed them to a
	  <lb/>room of his own house, to spend the night. We then separat­
	  <lb/>ed, and retired to rest, and this morning we were thrown into
	  <lb/>convulsions with laughter, at the merry dance the lovers were
	  <lb/>led after they left us. During my absence from the Bluff, se­
	  <lb/>veral young doctors and lawyers have arrived, and have their
	  <lb/>residence here. Being young, wild, and frolicksome, they are
	  <lb/>always devising some means of amusement, and the old couple
	  <lb/>were selected as a subject of sport, upon whom it appeared they
	  <lb/>played sundry mischievous pranks, in the course of the night.
	  <lb/>For this purpose they laid their plan during the day, selecting
	  <lb/>a room for the purpose. They went so far, in the first place,
	  <lb/>to persuade a merry old soul of a bar-keeper to marry the cou­
	  <lb/>ple during the day; and they were in the act of setting off to
	  <lb/>their home, when the bar-keeper told them he <said>was not the
	    <lb/>Colonel; that he was only an apprentice, and married them by
	    <lb/>way of getting his hand in.</said> But the party contrived to keep
	  <lb/>them, knowing the Colonel would certainly be at home.—
	  <lb/>Meantime they had removed every thing out of the room which
	  <lb/>might serve as weapons of defence, and carefully disposed some
	  <lb/>plank in a corner of the room, and was at no small pains to 
	  <lb/>dress up one of the part like a ghost, and esconsed him be­
	  <lb/>hind the plank.</p>
        <p>The houses at the Bluff are nothing but rude cabins built 
	  <lb/>of logs, with cracks between the logs, so that any one without
<mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(+2)">14</mw>
<pb n="106"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="14(1)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">106</mw>
	  <lb/>can see what passes within. These mischievous wags, had
	  <lb/>fixed the bed upon a lilt, which by pulling a rope fastened to
	  <lb/>it, would fall down. This rope they drew through, in the
	  <lb/>outside, between the logs. They had also provided them­
	  <lb/>selves with a number of canes, of different sizes—the cane be­
	  <lb/>ing hollow, served as bugles, and make a hollow, doleful sound,
	  <lb/>when blown through with the mouth. Some of the canes
	  <lb/>were large, and others small, so as to have <mcr>treble</mcr>, <mcr>tenour</mcr>, <mcr>bass</mcr>.
	  <lb/>Thus, the bride and bridegroom were no sooner beded, and a
	  <lb/>bright fire in the hearth, than the ghost, upwards of six feet in
	  <lb/>height, stalked forth with a white sheet round it, and advanc­
	  <lb/>ed towards the lovers, with a slow grave step. Those without
	  <lb/>began to blow their bugles, at the same time. The bride
	  <lb/>shrieked out, and covered her head—not so the bridegroom—
	  <lb/>being an old soldier, it would have taken more ghosts than one
	  <lb/>to have frightened him. Finding the ghost continued to ad­
	  <lb/>vance, he sprang out of bed, and looked about for some wea­
	  <lb/>pon for defence; finding nothing but a box of nails, which from
	  <lb/>its weight he was unable to wield, he flew round the room for
	  <lb/>something else. Meanwhile the ghost slipped out of doors.—
	  <lb/>The hero finding he had fled, exclaimed, <said>Ah, d—n you, if
	    <lb/>you had only waited a moment longer, I'd a tore your long
	    <lb/>trappings for you.</said> <said>Oh, my dear,</said> said the bride, <said>what
	    <lb/>was that? Listen—only hear—Oh, mercy, we'll be carried
	    <lb/>away—we'll be murdered—help me up—I always heard old
	    <lb/><persName>Melton</persName> haunted the Bluff.</said> <said>Haunt the d—l; its them fel­
	    <lb/>lows, I tell you, makin their fun—lie still. Oh, blow away
	    <lb/>and be d—d,</said> said the old man. <said>But you don't come in here
	    <lb/>again,</said> and pushed the door too; but finding neither bolt nor
	  <lb/>latch, he placed one of the planks against it, and betook him­
	  <lb/>self to bed again. The imps watching him through the cracks
	  <lb/>all the while, he no sooner drew the clothes over him than down
	  <lb/>came the bed and all, with a sudden crash! Report says, in­
	  <lb/>stead of praying for his enemies, like a good christian, he ut­
	  <lb/>tered many hard names: and running out of doors, swore ven­
	  <lb/>gence against every <distinct>shoe-boot</distinct> gentleman on the Bluff. He flew
	  <lb/>round the cabin with the agility of a youth of fifteen; and the
	  <lb/>gentlemen took to flight. <said>Where are you,</said> cried the enrag­

	  <lb/>ed lover; <said>I dare you to show your faces; I'll whip the best 
	    <lb/>of you; I'll take you one by one, and whip the whole of
	    <lb/>you. Pretty gentlemen with your high crowned hats, and
	    <lb/>shoe-boots, a screaking.</said> It was to no purpose he drove his
	  <lb/>enemies from one position to another; he would no sooner re­
	  <lb/>turn to bed, than his tormentors renewed the music of canes—
	  <lb/>sometimes putting them through the cracks of the house, near
	  <lb/>to the ear of the bride: the old man losing all patience, left
	  <lb/>the place, with his bride, before day, and it is supposed with­
	  <lb/>out sleep!—This was really cruel! In these, as well as all
	  <lb/>other cases, we ought to fulfil the golden rule.</p>
        <p>This place looks precisely as it did when I arrived last
	  <lb/>year, and my absence seems only a dream. The ducks and
	  <lb/>geese, and swans, seem to be playing where I left them. There
	  <lb/>are great doings going on here. The population has greatly
	  <lb/>increased, and the whole country round is one scene of acti­
	  <lb/>vity.</p>

        <p><hi>Since</hi> the weather became mild, I frequently ride out
	  <lb/>through this beautiful country, and find no little to admire and
	  <lb/>amuse. This town is in the centre of <placeName>Lawrence county</placeName>, and

	  <lb/>off, and the country around it is as rich as heart can wish. I

	  <placeName rend="slant(italic)">Wataga</placeName>, a creek that empties

<mw type="pageNum">108</mw>
	  <lb/>into the <placeName>Holston</placeName>. His name was <persName>Burlison</persName>, a native of <placeName>New Jer­
	    <lb/>sey</placeName>, and moved from thence to <placeName>North Carolina</placeName>, and finally to <placeName>Wa­
	    <lb/>taga</placeName>. He was allured, in the first place by the prospect of game,
	  <lb/>and, in the second place, by good land, and was soon followed by
	  <lb/>others; and by their united efforts successfully disputed the
	  <lb/>hunting grounds with the <name>Indians</name>. The timid deer, assailed
	  <lb/>on all sides by deadly foes, fled before the white man for shel­
	  <lb/>ter amongst the <name>Indians</name>. The adventurous white man pur­
	  <lb/>sued the game, but in doing so, he was fiercely opposed by the
	  <lb/><name>Indians</name>, who disputed every inch of ground with him, at the
	  <lb/>mouths of their rifles, until they were fairly compelled to
	  <lb/>yield. Thus was <placeName>Tennessee</placeName> settled. This settlement was
	  <lb/>made about the year <date when="1774">1774</date> or <date when="1775">1775</date>.</p>
        <p><persName>Mr. Burlison</persName> was so young at this time, that he recol­
	  <lb/>lects nothing of the enterprize. He lost his father at twelve
	  <lb/>years of age, and from that day, to the end of the <name>Creek</name> war,
	  <lb/>he has been almost constantly with arms in his hands!—He is
	  <lb/>a stout man, about 50 years of age—is honest, affable, and gen­
	  <lb/>erous as a prince; has experienced every vicissitude of fortune,
	  <lb/>and endured every species of suffering! Peace and war, sick­
	  <lb/>ness and health, poverty and plenty, has at different times
	  <lb/>been his lot.—He is at this time possessed of an independent
	  <lb/>fortune, and yet this man, with the manners of a courtier,
	  <lb/>cannot write his own name! though he reads very well.</p>
        <p>This gentleman, for such he is, losing his father at the
	  <lb/>early age he did, with eight more children, the widow had to
	  <lb/>struggle with the <name>Indians</name> on one side, and the tories on the other.
	  <lb/>Most of the children were boys, and their father left property
	  <lb/>sufficient to educate them, and left strict injunctions to that
	  <lb/>amount; but the revolutionary war coming on, the widow,
	  <lb/>between the tories and the <name>Indians</name>, was stripped of every thing
	  <lb/>she had, excepting a valuable brood mare! In order to save
	  <lb/>this last of her property, she was forced to keep it in the
	  <lb/>house where she slept every night! But those lawless ruffians,
	  <lb/>the tories, gaining intelligence of the fact, proceeded to the 
	  <lb/>house, and forcing the door, took her off. This was the last
	  <lb/>thing she had. Her situation was now at the highest pitch of
	  <lb/>human misery. Without a friend, without provision; the

<mw type="pageNum">109</mw>
	  <lb/><name>Indians</name> in alliance with the <name>British</name>, killing all that fell in
	  <lb/>their way, she dared not flee in that direction. The tories,
	  <lb/>burning and murdering all before them, on the other side, it
	  <lb/>was but death, and she resolved to meet it in the woods where
	  <lb/>she was! Meantime her oldest son, not 14, and <persName>Joseph</persName>, (of
	  <lb/>whom I learned the story,) about 12 years old, would sally
	  <lb/>forth with gun on shoulder, sometimes alone, but often with
	  <lb/>others of their own age, to watch the motions of the <name>Indians</name>;
	  <lb/>and whenever they saw them approach, would hasten to ap­
	  <lb/>prize their parents. These little heroes would pass whole
	  <lb/>days in the woods, at all seasons, almost naked, and without
	  <lb/>tasting food; for though they saw plenty of game, they were 
	  <lb/>afraid to shoot lest the report of the gun might betray them to
	  <lb/>the <name>Indians</name>. The two oldest brothers would sometimes take
	  <lb/>their next eldest brother with them. On this occasion they
	  <lb/>would wander farther into the forest than usual, and once
	  <lb/>became so bewildered they lost their course, and wandered
	  <lb/>about till they were quite spent with fatigue and hunger. The
	  <lb/>youngest was carrying one of his brother's guns, having none
	  <lb/>of his own, and seeing a deer jump before him, he levelled the piece
	  <lb/>at the deer, and killed it; saying, <said><name>Indians</name>, or no <name>Indians</name>, he
	    <lb/>would have something to eat—he might as well die one way as an­
	    <lb/>other.</said> The eldest one being alarmed, forced him away, and 
	  <lb/>they concealed themselves in the brushwood to await the result,
	  <lb/>concluding the <name>Indians</name>, if within hearing, would soon appear.
	  <lb/>As they lay concealed, the little one who had done the mis­
	  <lb/>chief, would often rise up to take a peep at his meat. At
	  <lb/>length he saw a wolf marching up to it, and pointing it out to
	  <lb/>his brothers, they bid him be still; but finding he could not 
	  <lb/>be restrained, they all ran together and frightened off the 
	  <lb/>wolf. They then skinned the deer, and kindling a fire, broiled
	  <lb/>a part of it and swallowed it hastily; and taking what they
	  <lb/>could carry, once more sought their way home, entirely igno­
	  <lb/>rant of the course. At length night overtook them, and, losing
	  <lb/>heart, they threw away their venison, and still wandered on,
	  <lb/>without seeing a human face, and without knowing whither
	  <lb/>they were going. Late in the night they were overtaken by a
	  <lb/>hunter, who conducted them home to no small joy of their
<pb n="110"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="14(3)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">110</mw>
	  <lb/>mother, who concluded they were killed by the <name>Indians</name>. She
	  <lb/>had been running through the forest, from the time it grew dark,
	  <lb/>in a state of distraction. Thus <persName>Mr. Burlison</persName>, and his broth­
	  <lb/>ers, spent nine years, guarding the settlements in this perilous
	  <lb/>manner, suffering every species of misery. He was three
	  <lb/>years of the time without shoes, and no sort of clothing, but a
	  <lb/>shirt made of buckskin!</p>
        <p>He states that he had become so inured to cold, hunger,
	  <lb/>danger, and fatigue, that he was a stranger to their opposites.
	  <lb/>Meantime their settlement advanced by degrees. Those who
	  <lb/>survived the fire and sword of the <name>British</name> and the tories,
	  <lb/>sought their brothers in the wilderness. Their highborn souls
	  <lb/>fired by their wrongs, glowing with resentment, and inspired
	  <lb/>by the example of their companions in the wilderness, took
	  <lb/>courage from despair. Having nothing left but their lives,
	  <lb/>and disdaining alike <name>British</name> gold and <name>British</name> chains, united
	  <lb/>with their friends for the common safety. Thus they nurtured
	  <lb/>a germ, which, in time, hurled destructio<choice><sic><g ref="#invertedn"/></sic><corr>n</corr></choice> on their proud op­
	  <lb/>pressors. Many of these lived to overwhelm their imperious
	  <lb/>foewith a complete vengeance. Little did the impolitic <name>Briton</name>
	  <lb/>think those outcasts, those little victims of his wanton barbari­
	  <lb/>ty, would ever dare to face him, much less that he would teach
	  <lb/>him such a lesson in the art of war, as he never learned be­
	  <lb/>fore. If it be asked in time to come, how so potent an army
	  <lb/>of vetrans came to be slaughtered by an inferior force, it may
	  <lb/>be answered, these were the men, and the sons of those men,
	  <lb/>who, thirty-three years back, nobly resolved never to submit
	  <lb/>to the <name>British</name> yoke. These were the highminded few, who,
	  <lb/>in the tender years of childhood, indignant at their wrongs,
	  <lb/>rushed into the woods, destitute of every comfort; but in their
	  <lb/>youthful breasts they carried a spark which they cherished at
	  <lb/>the hazard of their lives; this spark it was, that, bursting into
	  <lb/>a flame, at <name>New Orleans</name>, laid their daring foe at their feet!—
	  <lb/>The astonished <name>Britons</name> will long remember, too, that it was
	  <lb/>his ill judged policy, and inhuman cruelty, that paved the way
	  <lb/>to it.</p>
        <p><persName>Mr. Burlison</persName> related many anecdotes of those enterpriz­
	  <lb/>ing men. As they increased in numbers, they extended their
<pb n="111"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="14(4)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">111</mw>
	  <lb/>settlements, always keeping a party of choice spirits watching
	  <lb/>the enemy—of these he was one. In one of their excursions
	  <lb/>they discovered the fertile plains on <placeName>Cumberland river</placeName>; now
	  <lb/><placeName>West Tennessee</placeName>. In one of those exploring expeditions he
	  <lb/>made two narrow escapes. Coming suddenly upon the <name>In­
	    <lb/>dians</name> one day, he instantly threw himself flat on the ground,
	  <lb/>in some brush wood, and the <name>Indians</name> passed within a few steps
	  <lb/>of him. At another time, he and his companions came near
	  <lb/>perishing with cold. They had travelled several days in a 
	  <lb/>succession of snow and rain; one night, however, when they
	  <lb/>went to strike their camp, they found their powder wet, and
	  <lb/>they had to remain in their wet clothes all night, wet to the
	  <lb/>skin, the snow deep, and the night cold and freezing. Thus
	  <lb/>was <placeName>Tennessee</placeName> settled; and by such men.</p>
        <p>It has been said that <placeName>Tennessee</placeName> was an asylum for outlaws
	  <lb/>and horse thieves. That <placeName>Tennessee</placeName> should be exempt from an
	  <lb/>evil, common to the settling of all our States, I should be hap­
	  <lb/>py to know. I would recommend to horse thieves in particular
	  <lb/>to choose some other asylum in future, as there is not a state
	  <lb/>in the Union in which they receive less hospitality.<anchor xml:id="a25" rend="post(*)" corresp="#n25"/></p>

        <p><hi>I spend</hi> much of my time with the <name>Tennesseean</name>. He has
	  <lb/>a fund of anecdote, and the most retentive memory of any per­
	  <lb/>son I ever conversed with. As I have nothing better to amuse
	  <lb/>you with, I send you more of his history. I was reading this
	  <lb/>evening of the treachery of <persName>Lord <placeName>Dunmore</placeName></persName>. <persName>Mr. Burlison</persName>
	  <lb/>(or Captain, as he is,) listened to me some time, but at last ex­
	  <lb/>claimed, <said>Blast him—don't read any more about him. It
	    <lb/>makes my blood boil whenever I hear the name of a <name>Briton</name>.</said>
	  <lb/>See how deep rooted their enmity to the <name>British</name>. They are all

	  <lb/>so! In the course of the conversation that followed, I asked
	  <lb/>him <said>if he ever felt the effects of fear; that is, did he ever
	    <lb/>know what fear was?</said> <said>Never but once,</said> he replied, <said>and
	    <lb/>that was during the <distinct>shakes</distinct>;</said> meaning the earthquakes on the
	  <lb/>borders of the <placeName>Ohio</placeName> and <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>, some years back. You
	  <lb/>recollect them, though they were nothing with us in compari­
	  <lb/>son to those further west.</p>
        <p>Taking offence at the general government, <persName>Mr. Burlison</persName>
	  <lb/>quit the country, and removed over the <placeName>Ohio river</placeName>, not far
	  <lb/>from <placeName>New Madrid</placeName>, in <date when="1811">1811</date>. The first shock happened in the
	  <lb/>night, when he and his family were all in bed asleep. All on a 
	  <lb/>sudden, they were alarmed by the shaking of the beds; he
	  <lb/>sprung out of bed, between sleep and awake, but from the reel­
	  <lb/>ing of the house he was unable to keep his feet. The hens
	  <lb/>croaked, and the dogs barked. He could not conceive what it
	  <lb/>could be. He never thought of an earthquake; but concluded
	  <lb/>that either the house was haunted, or the end of the world was 
	  <lb/>at hand. The terror of the family was beyond description.
	  <lb/>They all gave themselves up for lost. He thought he ought to
	  <lb/>pray, but could not think of any thing proper to say. After
	  <lb/>the first shock was over, he determined, if he lived till morning,
	  <lb/>to go to his nearest neighbor and ascertain whether it was the
	  <lb/>end of the world, or whether the house was haunted. When 
	  <lb/>the morning came, while he was considering what to do, he was
	  <lb/>surprised with another shock, worse than the first. As this
	  <lb/>happened in the day time, he thought, within himself, it could
	  <lb/>not be spirits, as he never heard of their doing mischief in the
	  <lb/>day time, therefore it must be the end of the world! He was
	  <lb/>very wicked himself; his children were wicked, and the neigh­
	  <lb/>borhood was very wicked, and he concluded they were about to
	  <lb/>receive the chastisement of heaven. He had a very fleet horse
	  <lb/>in the stable, but not wishing to leave his family, and being un­
	  <lb/>well, he desired his son, a man grown, to gallop over to neigh­
	  <lb/>bor――, and see how it was there, and if it were the same, he
	  <lb/>would leave the place instantly. The young man, <persName>John</persName>, set
	  <lb/>off to the stable, while the earth, the trees and stable, were
	  <lb/>swinging  backwards and forwards, to such a degree, that it was 
	  <lb/>with difficulty he reached it. He at length brought out the
<pb n="113"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="15(1)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">113</mw>
	  <lb/>horse, and, mounting him, flew over the rocking plain. But
	  <lb/>it was just as bad there, said <persName>Mr. Burlison</persName>, and I now bethought
	  <lb/>myself it must be an earthquake. But let it be what it might,
	  <lb/>I saw we were all doomed to destruction; for, upon going to the
	  <lb/>door, I saw the earth sinking, and the trees falling. The great
	  <lb/>road passed by my door; this road was alive with men, women,
	  <lb/>and children, shrieking and crying, and some of them almost
	  <lb/>without clothes, as they had escaped from their beds, and
	  <lb/>nearly frozen with cold. Some were without hats or shoes—
	  <lb/>some running one way, some another, in a state of distraction.</p>
        <p><persName>Mr. Burlison</persName> had heard of a neighborhood, not far off,
	  <lb/>where the people were professors of religion. I thought if I
	  <lb/>could live to get there, they would teach me how to prepare for
	  <lb/>death. My family, were, many of them, sick. I had a new
	  <lb/>wagon, and a fine team of horses, and several good saddle
	  <lb/>horses besides. I harnessed up my team without delay, and
	  <lb/>put the sick ones in the wagon, and the well ones on horses,
	  <lb/>and set off for the religious neighborhood.</p>
        <p>My wife had been sick a long time, and had eat nothing
	  <lb/>for some days. As we drew near the neigborhood, we espied
	  <lb/>a woman sitting in a door, as it were, eating mush and milk.
	  <lb/>My wife's appetite revived at the moment, and she expressed
	  <lb/>an eager desire to have some of the mush and milk. We ap­
	  <lb/>proached the door and stopped the wagon, and made our busi­
	  <lb/>ness known to the woman. She had none to spare. She had but
	  <lb/>little meal in the house—had a great way to go to mill, and
	  <lb/>could not tell when she could get more. But my wife is sick, and
	  <lb/>has eat nothing for several days, and as she fancies she can
	  <lb/>eat the mush and milk, I will give you any price you may ask.
	  <lb/>I took out a silver dollar, at the same time, and held it out to
	  <lb/>her. She then handed my wife a tin cup about half full of
	  <lb/>mush and milk, for which I paid her half a dollar! I now be­
	  <lb/>gan to think I had made a bad exchange, for the people I had
	  <lb/>left, though wicked, were kind.</p>
        <p>When I arrived at the house I had been directed to, the
	  <lb/>man informed me I could have a house, but it was very small,
	  <lb/>without a floor, and full of corn: but if I would be at the trou­
<mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(+2)">15</mw>
<pb n="114"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="15(1)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">114</mw>
	  <lb/>ble of emptying it of the corn, and put it in a crib, I might have
	  <lb/>the house, or pen rather, for so much—ten times the worth of
	  <lb/>it. I had no choice, and feeble as myself and family were, we
	  <lb/>joined too and soon dislodged the corn; and my family, (nine
	  <lb/>children,) my wife, and myself, crowded in this miserable hole.
	  <lb/>I was little concerned about worldly affairs, however, as I ex­
	  <lb/>pected an end of all things; for there was no alteration for the
	  <lb/>better in the <distinct>shakes</distinct>; indeed they were rather wo<choice><sic/><corr>r</corr></choice>se; all I want­
	  <lb/>ed, or cared for, was to be amongst Godly people, that they
	  <lb/>might instruct me how to prepare for my doom. In short, I
	  <lb/>cared nothing about the things of this world. But such was
	  <lb/>not the case with my religious friends. Some admired my fine
	  <lb/>wagon; some admired my horses; and others admired my fine
	  <lb/>new saddles and bridles; and some one thing, and some ano­
	  <lb/>ther, and they must have this, and they must have that. I car­
	  <lb/>ed nothing about property provided they would pray for me,
	  <lb/>and preach for me! They plied me with enough of both! But
	  <lb/>I soon discovered there were wicked people here too, and, inur­
	  <lb/>ed to the <distinct>shakes</distinct>, they resumed their old practices. Some
	  <lb/>horse-raced it; some played cards, and some preached, whilst
	  <lb/>others were cheating their neighbors! I saw some running
	  <lb/>races, some playing cards, some preaching, and the earth
	  <lb/>shaking, all at the same instant. No wonder, I thought, these
	  <lb/>people have called down the judgment of heaven. I thought
	  <lb/>I had seen all strange sights that were to be seen in the world,
	  <lb/>but never saw the equal of this.</p>
        <p>By degre<choice><sic>s</sic><corr>e</corr></choice>s I grew familiar to the <distinct>shakes</distinct> myself; but in
	  <lb/>the meantime these religious people had cheated me out of all
	  <lb/>my property, and I thought it high time to quit the country;
	  <lb/>and, from that day to this, I put no faith in religious people.
	  <lb/>My fine wagon and team; all my horses and all my money,
	  <lb/>1,500 dollars in silver, and a fine drove of cattle, gone. I mus­
	  <lb/>tered up enough to buy a couple of little ponies for my wife
	  <lb/>and the two youngest children, to ride, and returned to <placeName>Ten­
	    <lb/>nessee</placeName> worse than nothing, and had to begin the world again.
	  <lb/>I now left my wife and children to shift for themselves, and
	  <lb/>went into the army, and acting as Commissary under <persName>General

        <p><hi>I can</hi> find nothing better to amuse you than the anecdotes
	  <lb/>and history of the old <name>Tennesseean</name>, particularly as I know
	  <lb/>you to be partial to them. <persName>Mr. Burlison</persName> is equal to the best
	  <lb/>library; and, in fact, no library contains a greater variety of
	  <lb/>amusement. He can commence at the beginning of his life,
	  <lb/>and relate every incident, not only of himself, but of the times.
	  <lb/>But chiefly I love to hear his anecdotes of <persName>General Jackson's</persName>
	  <lb/>struggles and difficulties in his various campaigns, and the
	  <lb/>incidents of those brave men who suffered with him.</p>
        <p>There is now, I am told, in press, a well written book,
	  <lb/>which gives a detail of the southern army, and the principal
	  <lb/>incidents of <persName>General Jackson's</persName> life. Such a book is much
	  <lb/>wanted, and must be very gratifying to the friends and admi­
	  <lb/>rers of this great man. The smallest incident of his compan­
	  <lb/>ions, and his unequalled courage, is devoured with avidity.
	  <lb/>The settlers of this new country love him to idolatry; and my
	  <lb/><placeName>Tennessee</placeName> friend is not amongst the least. He was with the
	  <lb/>General during the whole of the war—as also two of his sons,
	  <lb/>and a son-in-law. The hardships and privations endured
	  <lb/>by the General, and his men, are almost incredible. <persName>Mr.
	    <lb/>Burlison</persName>, as well as his brother, and a son of each, held a
	  <lb/>captain's commission in the <name>Creek</name> war; and he gives the
	  <lb/>clearest description of it I have ever heard. He says the army
	  <lb/>suffered almost to starvation for want of provisions; and as
	  <lb/>they were principally militia, it required all the General's
<pb n="116"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="15(2)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">116</mw>
	  <lb/>skill and address to keep the army together; sometimes, how­
	  <lb/>ever, a mutinous spirit would appear, in spite of him, and once
	  <lb/>in particular, their sufferings were so great, that all the appeals
	  <lb/>of the General to their patriotism, failed; and though, like a
	  <lb/>common soldier, he shared all their wants and hardships, it
	  <lb/>would not do, they determined to leave him. His appeals were
	  <lb/>so pathetic on this occasion as to draw tears from the bystan­
	  <lb/>ders. After he thought they were reconciled, he rode out
	  <lb/>alone, one day, and was astonished to find the whole brigade
	  <lb/>in the act of marching to <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>. He instantly snatched a
	  <lb/>gun from one of the men, and his left arm being useless from a 
	  <lb/>wound, he rested the gun between his horses ears, and placing
	  <lb/>himself in front of the column, swore <said>the first man that
	    <lb/>moved one step forward, was a dead man.</said> His gun was
	  <lb/>cocked, ready to fire, and at this critical moment his friends,
	  <lb/>having missed him, flew to his side. Thus each party stood
	  <lb/>some minutes; at length the men turned back to camp. <said>I
	    <lb/>thought I had seen courage and boldness before,</said> said <persName>Mr.
	    <lb/>Burlison</persName>, <said>but there is not such a man in the world—for one
	    <lb/>man with one arm to stop a whole brigade! He is the most
	    <lb/>undaunted being in creation.</said> <persName>Mr. Burlison</persName> was one of those
	  <lb/>who adhered to <persName>General Jackson</persName>.</p>
        <p>That inimitable writer, <persName>Voltaire</persName>, observes, <quote>that to con­
	    <lb/>vey a just idea of the characteristics of men, you must strictly
	    <lb/>observe the expressions which accompany their actions.</quote>
	  <lb/>This was fully illustrated by the expression of <persName>General Jackson</persName>
	  <lb/>as he was steadying the gun between his horses ears. This
	  <lb/>act, and the expression that accompanied it, conveys a better
	  <lb/>idea of the man than volumes elaborately written.</p>
        <p>At another of those mutinies, he threw himself before
	  <lb/>them, and told them they should not succeed but by passing
	  <lb/>over his dead body. <said>In opposing you I am only doing my
	    <lb/>duty, and I will die where I stand, before I will dishonor my
	    <lb/>country. What! will you have it said, you abandoned your
	    <lb/>General?</said></p>
        <p>On another occasion, he addressed them in a speech of
	  <lb/>some length, and thus concluded: <said>I know you are anxious to
	    <lb/>see your families—and so am I—yet, <emph>do</emph> stay a little longer!—

	    <lb/>Go with me—the enemy is near—we will conquer him—and
	    <lb/>then go to our homes!</said> Again, he told them, <said>the heart of 
	    <lb/>your General has been pierced! The first object of his affec­
	    <lb/>tions, and the first glory of his life, were the volunteers of
	    <lb/><placeName>Tennessee</placeName>. The very name recalls to my mind a thousand
	    <lb/>tender recollections. Oh, then, my brothers in arms, do not,
	    <lb/>do not leave me.</said> You see how much he bore rather than
	  <lb/>resort to cruel measures towards those he loved dear as his
	  <lb/>own soul. He humoured and carressed his men to such a 
	  <lb/>degree, <persName>Mr. Burlison</persName> says, that they were like spoiled chil­
	  <lb/>dren—the camp exhibited nothing but a scene of uproar—
	  <lb/>singing songs, laughing, and loud talking. This laxity of
	  <lb/>manners led them to frequent mutinies, till the General was
	  <lb/>exhausted, and he was compelled to make an example of one
	  <lb/>of the ringleaders, though it wrung his heart with the bitterest
	  <lb/>sorrow. After this, he had no trouble with the army. <persName>Mr.
	    <lb/>Burlison</persName>, who was present at the execution, said he had seen
	  <lb/>many fall in battle—he had seem many wounded—and had
	  <lb/>witnessed distress and death in all its shapes, but never saw
	  <lb/>any thing so awful, or that shocked him more, than this ex­
	  <lb/>ecution. The army was drawn out on parade—the criminal
	  <lb/>seated in the centre on a stool—his eyes tied with a handker­
	  <lb/>chief, and eight men, with never failing rifles, standing round
	  <lb/>him. <persName>Mr. Burlison's</persName> brother was one, but neither <persName>Mr. Bur­
	    <lb/>lison</persName>, his brother, nor a single man in the army, least of all,
	  <lb/>the crim<choice><sic/><corr>i</corr></choice>nal, expected he would be shot, till the word <quote>fire;</quote>
	  <lb/>and eight bullets pierced him at once! It was expected he
	  <lb/>would be pardoned, as many had been before. That night not
	  <lb/>a word was heard in the camp. They were all as silent as death.
	  <lb/>What an effect! <persName>General Jackson</persName> had no more plague with 
	  <lb/>mutinies.</p>
        <p>The men, for want of roads, were compelled to take the
	  <lb/>horses from the wagons, and carry them up the mountains
	  <lb/>themselves. On these occasions, the General would throw off
	  <lb/>his coat and aid the men.</p>
        <p>At one time he overtook the baggage wagons at <placeName>Tennnes­
	    <lb/>see River</placeName>, and the landing being steep, the men were in the
	  <lb/>act of pushing the wheels up the bank; the general, as usual,
<pb n="118"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="15(3)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">118</mw>
	  <lb/>threw off his coat, and laid hold of the wheels, but seeing one
	  <lb/>man idle, <said>friend,</said> said the General, <said>why do you not assist
	    <lb/>your companions?</said> <said>I am a <emph>corporall</emph>, Sir.</said> <said>Ah! and what 
	    <lb/>of that; I am a <emph>Generall</emph>.</said> Some one by this time discovered
	  <lb/>who the stranger was, and informed the corporal. It is
	  <lb/>hardly necessary to add that the corporal soon put his shoul­
	  <lb/>der to the wheel.</p>
        <p><persName>General Jackson</persName>, however true it be, is, nevertheless,
	  <lb/>charged with partiality to his friends; and who is not? But it
	  <lb/>is said, by those who would lose their lives for him, that he
	  <lb/>advances his friends or intimates, in preference to others,
	  <lb/>equally capable. How did he know this? He preferred his
	  <lb/>friends, because his long acquaintance with their integrity
	  <lb/>and honor justified the choice! He is, also, accused of being
	  <lb/>arbitrary. Whether the charge be just or unjust, the result
	  <lb/>proves he has few equals in the art of war.</p>
        <p>To judge accurately of any subject it requires a thorough
	  <lb/>knowledge of the thing submitted. War is an art, if it be not
	  <lb/>a science, which above all others, requires genius to conceive,
	  <lb/>skill to concert, wisdom to conduct, judgment to determine,
	  <lb/>promptness to execute, ability to command, fortitude to en­
	  <lb/>dure; patriotism, energy, firmness, decision, perseverance and
	  <lb/>courage. That <persName>General Jackson</persName>, possesses all these, in an
	  <lb/>eminent degree, his enemies admit. But, independently of
	  <lb/>these, he possesses magnanimity, candour, humanity—a knowl­
	  <lb/>edge of the world—a liberal education. He is just, he is boun­
	  <lb/>tiful, and beyond, far beyond example, compassionate. This
	  <lb/>is his character. Now, where will you find a man, at once
	  <lb/>competent to judge of all these qualities! Not one in an hun­
	  <lb/>dred, to say the least. He must possess a competent knowl­
	  <lb/>edge of them in the first place; and, in the next place, he must
	  <lb/>be divested of prejudice. The first requires a mind highly
	  <lb/>improved by observation and study—and, as for prejudice, it
	  <lb/>is without remedy, if it be not in education. It requires men
	  <lb/>of the first science to judge accurately of a single blade of
	  <lb/>grass—but for an illiterate man to judge accurately on the
	  <lb/>qualities of a general, is out of the question; because, it
	  <lb/>would be to know what he does not, which is impossible! And,
<pb n="119"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="15(4)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">119</mw>
	  <lb/>because, he does not understand the subject submitted, he has
	  <lb/>no idea within himself to correspond with it, and both are
	  <lb/>necessary to pass sentence of judgment. A man <emph>may</emph> be
	  <lb/>competent to decide upon the qualities in question; yet, he may
	  <lb/>err from prejudice, and all reasoning, founded on error, is false.
	  <lb/>Of prejudice there are several—Prejudices arising from <emph>things</emph>,
	  <lb/>from <emph>words</emph>, from <emph>ourselves</emph>, from <emph>others</emph>; but none of these are
	  <lb/>so apt to lead us astray, as self. This is beautifully illus­
	  <lb/>trated by the judge who reversed his own judgment, in the
	  <lb/>case of the ox; and envy in a few individuals has, doubtless,
	  <lb/>led them to instil it into the minds of others, who are unable
	  <lb/>to judge for themselves. In all countries there are not wanting
	  <lb/>something to keep envy and malice alive. It is prone in the
	  <lb/>human species. <persName>General Jackson</persName> has fewer enemies, perhaps,
	  <lb/>than any man of his notoriety. Yet he has some.</p>
        <p>With respect to <persName>General Jackson's</persName> conduct at <name>New Or­
	    <lb/>leans</name>, it reminds one of <persName>Columbus</persName> and the egg. He had un­
	  <lb/>dertaken to defend his country against fearful odds. It was
	  <lb/>an enterprize deep with hazard. It was a desperate case, and
	  <lb/>required a desperate remedy. His mind was equal to the en­
	  <lb/>terprize, and every act of the man's life proves, that love of
	  <lb/>country is his ruling passion. What a curse this passion of
	  <lb/>envy is. One would think that an <name>American</name> did not exist
	  <lb/>who did not admire <persName>General Jackson</persName>.</p>
        <p>It would seem that the God of Nature has annexed to this 
	  <lb/>unnatural passion of envy, its own punishment, whilst the ob­
	  <lb/>jects of it sustain no injury. Wherever envy prevails, all is
	  <lb/>misery. It not only destroys all relish for those things we ac­
	  <lb/>tually possess, but sinks us into contemptible wretches.</p>
        <p>Wealth is another great cause of envy in the human fami­
	  <lb/>ly; and while I am on the subject, I will give you an anecdote
	  <lb/>of yesterday: <persName>Tom Envy</persName> came into my parlor, while he was 
	  <lb/>under the influence of an affront put upon him by his rich neigh­
	  <lb/>bor. <said>D—n him,</said> said <persName>Tom</persName>; <said>I remember the time when
	    <lb/>he had to borrow twenty-five cents from me to pay for his
	    <lb/>breakfast; and do you think he had not like to have drove
	    <lb/>over me, just now! I saw him, driving along in his carriage.
	    <lb/>I was on foot. I knew his waiter. I stood still till he came
<pb n="120"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="15(4)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">120</mw>
	    <lb/>up to me, and I bowed to him: <said>drive on,</said> said he, and went
	    <lb/>by me like fury.</said> <said>Well, friend,</said> said I, <said>let him do so.—
	    <lb/>He only degrades himself, while you are just as you were be­
	    <lb/>fore. When he treats you ungratefully, he is guilty of the
	    <lb/>blackest crime, while you sustain no injury, except in your
	    <lb/>own imagination. But are you sure, friend, you would not act
	    <lb/>as he did, were you to change places with him? Wealth, you
	    <lb/>say, has had this effect upon him, and the same cause always
	    <lb/>produces the same effect. In that case you would act the part
	    <lb/>you now condemn.</said> <persName>Tom</persName> was struck by the force of the ar­
	  <lb/>gument, and after rolling up a fresh quid of tobacco, and
	  <lb/>thrusting it in his mouth, he said I was right, he believed;
	  <lb/><said>but, for all that, I would like to be rich, if it were only to
	    <lb/>mortify that upstart neighbor.</said> <said>There, now, you are wrong
	    <lb/>again. If you wish to punish him, only be more wise and vir­
	    <lb/>tuous, and the fame of your good name will mortify him much
	    <lb/>more than wealth. But if this does not satisfy you, you
	    <lb/>have only to go to work. If you wish to be a rich man, in­
	    <lb/>dustry and economy will soon do the business. You have the
	    <lb/>example of your rich neighbor before you; tread in his steps.</said>
	  <lb/><persName>Tom</persName> scratched his head, and said, he believed it was dinner
	  <lb/>time, and departed.

        <p>I strolled out with a friend to see a neighbor yesterday,
	  <lb/>who lives on the skirts of the town, merely for the sake of
	  <lb/>amusement. If you wish to ascertain the dialect of a country,
	  <lb/>you must seek for it amongst the common, or in other words, the
	  <lb/>lower order of the people, as well bred people speak alike.
	  <lb/>But the children of both classes are good specimens of dialect,
	  <lb/>as the better sort, in this country, particularly, consign their
	  <lb/>children to the care of negroes. You see I am for another
	  <lb/>dish of philosophy. But to go on. Those who have black
	  <lb/>nurses, and those who have illiterate white nurses to attend
	  <lb/>children, are at much pains and cost for teachers to unlearn
	  <lb/>them what they need never have learned, had they kept illiter­
	  <lb/>ate people from them at first. This is not the case with the
	  <lb/>poorer class of people, as their children are nursed by them­
	  <lb/>selves, and speak <emph>their</emph> language.</p>
        <p>While we were chatting with our neighbor, a number of
	  <lb/>people rode up to the door, and we went out to see what was
	  <lb/>the matter. It appeared they were on their return from a bar­
	  <lb/>bacue, and had heard a stump speech. Some of these were
	  <lb/>mere children, and some were grown persons. Our neighbor,
	  <lb/>who was aware of their business, asked <said>What news from
	    <lb/>the barbacue?</said> <said>Oh there was a proper sight of people—Oh,
	    <lb/>my! but there was—You never seed the like! And a heap of
	    <lb/>'em had on ruffled shirts, and shoeboots, and was so proud,
	    <lb/>stepin about; and there was some monstrous purty gals there,
	    <lb/>and some dinged ugly ones, too; and such a powerful chance of
	    <lb/>apples and cyder, and ginger cakes. I tell ye what, they were
	    <lb/>prime; and they made such a fuss, and <distinct>covaulted</distinct>, and was go­
	    <lb/>ing to fight; you never saw the like in all the days of your life.
	    <lb/>Then these fellows that lives on <placeName>Flint</placeName>, had liked to abin whip­
	    <lb/>ped, steppin about. I tell you what, them fellows is monstrous
	    <lb/>proud; and old <persName>F――</persName>, was there, too, and got the maddest, he
	    <lb/>fairly snorted. Oh, he was rearin. And them fellows from
	    <lb/><name>Elum's Mill</name>, turned in with old <persName>F――</persName>, and snorted and co­
	    <lb/>vaulted, and dared them ruffle-shirt fellows to turn out. Oh,
	    <lb/>they got the maddest! And <persName>Mr. E――</persName> made a stump speech.
	    <lb/>He said if we voted for that there 'tother man, I forgot his

	    <lb/>name, that government would come and take away our land,
	    <lb/>and we would have to pay taxes and all that.</said> These were
	  <lb/>mostly <name>Tennesseeans</name> and <name>North Carolinians</name>.</p>
        <p>I saw a piece in the papers not long since, which went to
	  <lb/>satirize the <placeName>Tennessee</placeName> dialect. I would advise such people to
	  <lb/>look at home. Those who live in glass houses, ought not to
	  <lb/>throw stones. Let us compare this with the dialect of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>.
	  <lb/>You remember the bear hunting party from <placeName>Bedford</placeName>. I will
	  <lb/>stake them against the whole <placeName>United States</placeName>. One of them call­
	  <lb/>ed at our house on his return, and entertained us with the fol­
	  <lb/>lowing account of his adventures: <said>You know da is heap of
	    <lb/>baw (bear) on da <placeName>Kenhawa</placeName>; so I and <persName>Bill Prout</persName>, <persName>Jess Passin</persName>,
	    <lb/>and <persName>Zack Miller</persName>, are all goin to <placeName>Kenhawa</placeName> to hunt baw—
	    <lb/><placeName>Kenhawa</placeName> mighty far—so we walk—we walk—last we come
	    <lb/>to da <placeName>Kenhawa</placeName>—<placeName>Kenhawa</placeName> b—i—g river, for true—Tell
	    <lb/>you what, it skears me—well, I goes out into de woods—I hear
	    <lb/>noise—I look up tree, and see a baw!—I went to da root o' da
	    <lb/>tree—I bark like any dog—presently da baw come husslin
	    <lb/>down—Ah, boy!—I took to my keels, and did book it.</said>—Now
	  <lb/>for the <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> dialect: <said><persName>Jim</persName>, where are you and <persName>Sam</persName>;
	    <lb/>why but ye's pit (put) you cow in the pester, (pasture;) 'am
	    <lb/>sure a towled ye's the mornin.—Ye's cruel bad children—and
	    <lb/>there a fine job ye's done to leave you gears out by.</said> The
	  <lb/><name>Yankee</name>: <said><persName>Flora</persName> you want (ought) to wash them clothes right
	    <lb/>away. You hadn't ought to left 'em so.</said> <said>What say?</said></p>
        <p><mentioned>Covault</mentioned> is of <placeName>Tennessee</placeName> birth, and not unaptly applied in
	  <lb/>the sense they use it. It signifies an unruly or ungovernable
	  <lb/>man; also an untame horse, or any thing that cannot be con­
	  <lb/>trouled. It is quite a classical word, and I hope to see it 
	  <lb/>admitted into the <name>English</name> language. It appears to be a com­
	  <lb/>pound of co and vault, which are both very significant. For
	  <lb/>the rest I find the <name>Tennesseeans</name> are a very plain people, and
	  <lb/>have a very high sense of honor. Their houses and equipage
	  <lb/>are void of ostentation: The <name>North Carolinians</name> next; the
	  <lb/><name>South Carolians</name> and <name>Georgians</name>, next: and the <name>Virginians</name> the
	  <lb/><choice><sic>the</sic><corr/></choice> most ostentatious of any. But the preaching; you must
	  <lb/>hear that. This country is run mad after preaching.—Here
	  <lb/>is a new sect called <name>Cumberland</name> presbyterians; and between
<pb n="123"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="16(2)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">123</mw>
	  <lb/>these, the baptists, methodists, the woods resound. As they
	  <lb/>have no churches they preach out of doors mostly. I have
	  <lb/>just returned from preaching, where I remained about two
	  <lb/>hours, and the parson, when I left him appeared to be only
	  <lb/>about midway through his sermon. He ought to have a patent-
	  <lb/>right, for he certainly has the strongest voice in the state.</p>
        <p>I have met with several excellent orators since I have
	  <lb/>been in the country; the best I ever heard. <persName>Parson Burress</persName> ,
	  <lb/>formerly of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, is, doubtless, the finest public speaker
	  <lb/>in the Union. I have seen no parallel for him. The <persName>Revere<choice><sic><g ref="#invertedn"/></sic><corr>n</corr></choice>d
	    <lb/>Mr. Butler</persName> and <persName>McMahon</persName>, the latter of 
	  <placeName>Nashville</placeName>, <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>,
	  <lb/>are, also, men of handsome delivery. These are methodists.
	  <lb/>I was truly astonished at this, as I never saw one of the 
	  <lb/>sect, before, hardly worth hearing. The baptists, and the
	  <lb/><name>Cumberland</name> presbyterians, are continually preaching and
	  <lb/><distinct>covaulting</distinct>. <persName>Mr. Porter</persName>, a most amiable man; also a <persName>Mr.
	    <lb/>Madden</persName>, preached in <persName>Mr. B's</persName> house since I was here, and
	  <lb/>that busybody, <persName>Mr. <emph>They say</emph></persName>, reported <persName>Mr. B.</persName> was to preach
	  <lb/>here to day, that is, out at the stand in the woods. I observed,
	  <lb/><said>I will go and hear <persName>Mr. Porter</persName>.</said> <said>Oh,</said> said a bystander,
	  <lb/><said>it is another preacher than <persName>Mr. Porter</persName> that preaches to­
	    <lb/>day—there is not such another preacher i<choice><sic>t</sic><corr>n</corr></choice> the known world—
	    <lb/>he's a monstrous fine preacher.</said> As I had heard some fine
	  <lb/>preaching, for the oratory I went to hear this none such.
	  <lb/>But never was I so disappointed. I placed myself in front of 
	  <lb/>the preacher, (a great rough looking man,) and the congrega­
	  <lb/>tion sat some on fallen timber, some on benches carried there
	  <lb/>for the purpose—some sat flat on the ground, and many stood
	  <lb/>up—about 500 in all. His text was, <quote>He that hath ears to 
	    <lb/>hear, let him hear.</quote> The people must have been deaf indeed
	  <lb/>that could not have heard him. He neither made division nor
	  <lb/>subdivision. He is one of the <name>Cumberland</name> presbyterians.
	  <lb/>They are <name>Calvinists</name>, it is said, but do not deem education a ne­
	  <lb/>cessary qualification to preach the Gospel. But to the sermon:
	  <lb/>He began low but soon bawled to deafening. He spit in his hands,
	  <lb/>rubbed them against each other, and then would smite them to­
	  <lb/>gether, till he made the woods ring. The people now began to co­
	  <lb/>vault, and dance, and shout, till they fairly drowned the speaker.
<pb n="124"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="16(2)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">124</mw>
	  <lb/>Many of the people, however, burst out into a laugh. Seeing this
	  <lb/>the preacher cried out, pointing to them with his finger,
	  <lb/><said>Now look at them sinners there—You'll see how they will
	    <lb/>come tumbling down presently—I'll bring them down.</said> He
	  <lb/>now redoubled his strength; spit in his hands and smote them 
	  <lb/>together, till he made the forest resound, and took a fresh
	  <lb/>start; and sure enough the sinners came tumbling down. The
	  <lb/>scene that succeeded baffles description. Principally confined
	  <lb/>to women and children, the young women had carefully taken
	  <lb/>out their combs, from their hair, and laid them and their bon­
	  <lb/>nets in a place of safety, as though they were going to set in
	  <lb/>for a fight; and it was much like a battle. After tumbling on 
	  <lb/>the ground, and kicking sometime, the old women were em­
	  <lb/>ployed in keeping their clothes civil, and the young men (never
	  <lb/>saw an old man go near them) would help them up, and taking
	  <lb/>them by each hand, by <emph>their</emph> assistance, and their own agility,
	  <lb/>they would spring nearly a yard from the ground at every
	  <lb/>jump, one jump after another, crying out, glory, glory, as loud
	  <lb/>as their strength would admit; others would be singing a live­
	  <lb/>ly tune to which they kept time—hundreds might be seen and
	  <lb/>heard going on in this manner at once. Others, again, ex­
	  <lb/>hausted by this jumping, would fall down, and here they lay
	  <lb/>cross and pile, heads and points, yelling and screaming like
	  <lb/>wild beasts of the forest, rolling on the ground, like hogs in a
	  <lb/>mire,—very much like they do at camp meetings in our country,
	  <lb/>but more shameless; their clothes were the color of the dirt;
	  <lb/>and like those who attend the camp meetings, they were all of
	  <lb/>the lower class of the people. I saw no genteel person among
	  <lb/>them. Are not people of education answerable for this degra­
	  <lb/>dation of society? It appears to me, since I have had oppor­
	  <lb/>tunities of mixing with the world, that there are a certain
	  <lb/>class of citizens, whose interest it is to keep their fellow men
	  <lb/>in ignorance. I am very sure, half a dozen words of com­
	  <lb/>mon sense, well applied, would convince those infatuated young
	  <lb/>women that they were acting like fools. In fact a fool is more
	  <lb/>rational. Not one of those but would think it a crying sin to 
	  <lb/>dance.</p>
        <p>The noise of the preacher was effectually drowned at
<pb n="125"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="16(3)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">125</mw>
	  <lb/>length, and a universal uproar succeeded louder than ever.—
	  <lb/>Whilst this was going on, I observed an old woman near me,
	  <lb/>snivelling and turning up the whites of her eyes, (she was a
	  <lb/>widow—all the widows, old and young, covaulted,) and often
	  <lb/>applying her handkerchief to her eyes, and throwing herself
	  <lb/>into contortions, but it would not do, she could not raise the
	  <lb/>steam.</p>
        <p>I pointed to one young woman, with a red scarf, who had
	  <lb/>tired down several young men, and was still covaulting, and
	  <lb/>seeing she jumped higher than the rest, I asked <said>who she
	    <lb/>might be?</said> One of the gentlemen, a <persName>Mr. Gallagher</persName>, who was
	  <lb/>standing near, gave such an account of her (men know these
	  <lb/>things) as would shock a modest ear. <said>D—n her, she gets
	    <lb/>converted every meeting she goes to.</said> How much better had
	  <lb/>she been at a ball, (if they must dance,) where they would be
	  <lb/>obliged to behave decent, and where vile characters dare not
	  <lb/>appear.</p>
        <p>Shortly after they began to rear and covault, a daughter
	  <lb/>of <persName>Mr. B's</persName> began too. He walked up to her, and led her off
	  <lb/>some distance, and sat her down at the root of a tree. When 
	  <lb/>he returned, I inquired <said>if she was sick?</said> <said>No,</said> he an­
	  <lb/>swered, <said>but she was beginning to go on as the rest, and I 
	    <lb/>told her if she wished to worship God, to do it there, and not
	    <lb/>to expose herself before faces.</said></p>
        <p>The preacher having spent all his ammunition, made a
	  <lb/>pause, and then called upon all the sinners to approach, and be
	  <lb/>prayed for. Numbers went forward, all women and children,
	  <lb/>(children of ten years old get religion!) and the priest began to
	  <lb/>pray; when a decent looking young man approached the stand, and
	  <lb/>took a female by the arm, and led her away. As he walked
	  <lb/>along, the preacher pointed to him, and said, <said>God, strike
	    <lb/>that sinner down!</said> The man turned around, and in an angry
	  <lb/>tone said, <said>God has more sense than to mind such a d—d fool
	    <lb/>as you are!</said> and resumed his course. He was one of the brave
	  <lb/><name>Tennesseeans</name>; and the lady was his wife.</p>
        <p>Being tired of such an abominable scene, I proposed re­
	  <lb/>turning home, and, taking a near cut through a slip of wood­
	  <lb/>land, we surprized the red scarf lady in a manner that gave us
	  <lb/>no favorable opinion of her piety.</p>

        <p>Meeting has broke up, and several are coming to our
	  <lb/>house to dine. I wish to have some conversation with them,
	  <lb/>and shall finish my letter afterwards.</p>
        <p>I took  my seat at the table, by a stout, jolly looking lady,
	  <lb/>who, in replying to some of the party, observed <said>a great ma­
	  <lb/>ny had got religion that day.</said> Now was my time—<said>And
	    <lb/>pray, Madam,</said> said I, <said>what religion did they get?</said> <said>Why,
	    <lb/>that is a queer question—there is but one religion, every body
	    <lb/>knows.</said> <said>There you are a little mistaken, Madam; there
	    <lb/>are various religions. There is the Christian religion; the 
	    <lb/>Jewish religion; the Mahometan religion, &amp;c. &amp;c.; which of
	    <lb/>those religions was it you spoke of?</said> <said>I never heard of them
	    <lb/>before!</said> and stared at me in astonishment. <said>And what reli­
	    <lb/>gion are you of?</said> said the lady. I told her my religion was
	  <lb/>piety. <said>Never heard of it before;</said> and doubtless she told the
	  <lb/>truth. <said>And what sort of a religion is piety?</said> <said>Why, Ma­
	    <lb/>dam, it is simply to love God and my neighbor.</said> <said>It is a
	    <lb/>queer name, and it's the first I ever heard of it. Is there ma­
	    <lb/>ny of the pieties where you come from?</said> <said>Not many.</said> <persName>Mr.
	    <lb/>G.</persName> and several at the table could scarcely suppress a laugh.
	  <lb/><said>And pray, Madam, since we have made up our acquaintance,
	    <lb/>may I take the liberty of asking which of these religions you
	    <lb/>profess?</said> <said>Ne're one,</said> said the lady; <said>I'm a <name>Cumberland</name>
	    <lb/>presbyterian.</said> The company could no longer retain them­
	  <lb/>selves; they roared; whilst the subject of it had not the least
	  <lb/>idea of the cause.</p>
        <p>Now, this woman, take her or any other subject, was a 
	  <lb/>reasonable and intelligent woman. Thoroughly acquainted
	  <lb/>with the ordinary business of life. She was from the interior
	  <lb/>of <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>; and had attended preaching for twenty years!
	  <lb/>and yet is ignorant, not only of the duties, but of the very 
	  <lb/>name of a christian! Whose fault is this? The fault of the
	  <lb/>priest! So they can draw the women (they do not seem par­
	  <lb/>tial to men) after them, they care for nothing else. If there is
	  <lb/>a hell, there will be more priests in it than any other descrip­
	  <lb/>tion of people.</p>

          <salute>Dear <persName>Matt</persName>,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p><hi>In</hi> answer to yours—This place is growing. The county
	  <lb/>seat of justice is fixed here, ever since the state was admitted
	  <lb/>in the Union. It contains several genteel families, mostly mer­
	  <lb/>chants, lawyers, and doctors. When I first came here there
	  <lb/>were but four cabins: It is now a considerable town. I dare say
	  <lb/>you will be pleased with it. It has no navigation, but it is
	  <lb/>healthy. This is the richest county, in land, in the state,
	  <lb/>and contains many planters of great wealth. But the society is
	  <lb/>the best this side of <placeName>Huntsville</placeName>, and the flower of it boards at
	  <lb/>our house.</p>
        <p>In the first place we have two <name>Irish</name> <emph>gentlemen</emph>, <persName>Mr. Gal­
	    <lb/>legher</persName>, and <persName>Mr. Maden</persName>, and <persName>Doctor Baker</persName>, the latter of <placeName>North
	    <lb/>Carolina</placeName>. <persName>Mr. Gallegher</persName> is a man of highly accomplished
	  <lb/>manners, very sprightly and gay, and tells a good story. <persName>Mr.
	    <lb/>Maden</persName> is also good company, and sings, and plays well on the
	  <lb/>flute. The Doctor is the best singer I ever heard. He sings
	  <lb/>the <title>Turban'd <name>Turk</name>,</title> <title>Blithe <persName>Sandy</persName>,</title> and <title>Poll, and my
	    <lb/>partner <persName>Joe</persName>,</title> with much taste. These are all young men, and
	  <lb/>full of mirth and fun. <persName>Mr. B.</persName> himself, is not a bad hand at a 
	  <lb/>story; and  <persName>Mrs. Burlison</persName> is one of the most amiable of her sex.
	  <lb/>These, and <persName>Miss Burlison</persName>, a great beauty, form the society at
	  <lb/><persName>Mr. B's</persName>, besides a great number of travellers; of course I spend
	  <lb/>my time pleasant enough.</p>
        <p>We had had a shower of rain after dinner, and being late,
	  <lb/><persName>Mr. G.</persName> (who is a merchant) declined going to the store; the
	  <lb/>strangers had proceeded to their respective homes, and the air
	  <lb/>being cooled by the rain, rendered it necessary to have a fire.
	  <lb/>A fire has something cheering and social in its aspect, and al­
	  <lb/>ways inspires pleasure and converse.</p>
        <p>We all drew our chairs round the hearth, which was
	  <lb/>neatly swept, and amused ourselves on the incidents of the day;
	  <lb/>and I gained no small credit for my ingenuity in taking the
	  <lb/>lady in at dinner. <persName>Mr. B.</persName> said it was the best preaching he
	  <lb/>ever heard—that the woman insisted she was <quote>not a chris­
	    <lb/>tian.</quote> <persName>Mrs. B.</persName> who would do honor to any church, is a bap­

	  <lb/>tist, and dislikes this tumbling about, and said she <said>did not
	    <lb/>think there was any good in it.</said> All had something to say,
	  <lb/>and the whole of it was very justly turned into ridicule. Now,
	  <lb/>what astonished me was, that when <persName>Mr. Porter</persName> preached here,
	  <lb/>he did not excite the least noise—but to-day, when this babbler
	  <lb/>preached, you could not hear your neighbors speak. You
	  <lb/>may judge of his qualifications to teach the ignorant—In speak­
	  <lb/>ing of the children of <name>Israel</name>, he said, <said>they were conveyed
	    <lb/>captive to <placeName>Babylon</placeName> by the <name>Romans</name>!</said> With such leaders, no
	  <lb/>wonder they both fall into the ditch. But I am going to ap­
	  <lb/>prise you of <choice><sic>of</sic><corr/></choice> a singular occurrence which has excited much
	  <lb/>interest in the country round. The house being thronged a
	  <lb/>few evenings since, o<choice><sic><g ref="#invertedn"/></sic><corr>n</corr></choice> account of the court which is sitting, I
	  <lb/>arose from the table when I had supped, to make roo<choice><sic>n</sic><corr>m</corr></choice> for those
	  <lb/>who were waiting, and walked to the door. While I was
	  <lb/>standing at the door with a glas of water in my hand, it being
	  <lb/>now quite dark, a ragged old looking man, with a heavy pack
	  <lb/>on his back, followed by a little boy, approached, and asked me
	  <lb/><said>if he could stay all night,</said> supposing me to be the woman of
	  <lb/>the house. I spoke to <persName>Mr. B.</persName> who went to the door and told
	  <lb/>the man to come in. He came in, and taking his pack from 
	  <lb/>his back, (which was a skin with the hair on,) laid it down on
	  <lb/>the floor, and, seeming weary, sat down. He was all in tat­
	  <lb/>ters; a small man, and about 60 years of age. The son, for it
	  <lb/>was his son, was about 12 years, and something better dressed.
	  <lb/>When the rest had supped, he and the boy, also sat down to
	  <lb/>supper; and while he was eating, some of the party asked him
	  <lb/>how far he had travelled, and what course he came. He
	  <lb/>said <said>from toward <placeName>Tuscaloosy</placeName>;</said> and made no other reply.
	  <lb/>When he went to bed, which was in another house, he left his
	  <lb/>pack where he first laid it down. Next morning he walked
	  <lb/>about the town, and was out most of the day: sometimes his
	  <lb/>boy was with him, and sometimes he loitered about the door—
	  <lb/>the pack still lying in the same place. But when <persName>Mrs. B.</persName>
	  <lb/>went to sweep the dining room, she gave the pack a kick with
	  <lb/>her foot, to move it out of her way, thinking it was nothing
	  <lb/>but clothing. <said>Hump!</said> said she, <said>you are heavy;</said> and ap­
	  <lb/>plying her hands to it, was not able to lift it, but with difficulty
<pb n="129"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="17(1)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">129</mw>
	  <lb/>rolled it over out of her way; and no more was said about it.
	  <lb/>Towards evening, the man came in, and said he would be going,
	  <lb/>and asked <persName>Mrs. B.</persName> what was to pay? She told him, nothing;
	  <lb/>supposing him to be very poor, from his appearance; though
	  <lb/>she said she saw him with money in his hand, when he asked
	  <lb/><said>what was to pay.</said></p>
        <p>Sometime after dark he returned, and to our astonish­
	  <lb/>ment, said he had been robbed of 1500 dollars in silver! Every
	  <lb/>one was amazed, that a man with so much money, should dress
	  <lb/>as he did, and walk on foot; he was in his shirt sleeves, and they
	  <lb/>were hanging in ribbands. <persName>Mrs. B.</persName> now repeated the weight
	  <lb/>of the pack; and various were the opinions on the subject.
	  <lb/>Some thought his story correct, and that he dressed in that 
	  <lb/>manner to avoid suspicion; and others gave him no credit, as
	  <lb/>he was so careless about the pack.</p>
        <p>He stated, that drawing near a house about three miles
	  <lb/>distant from the town, where he intended to stay all night,
	  <lb/>he saw several men standing in the yard drinking. When he
	  <lb/>came up to them he did not like their looks, and laying his
	  <lb/>pack on the fence, to rest himself, made some inquiry about
	  <lb/>the distance to the next house. The men cursed and swore,
	  <lb/>and turned him into ridicule, instead of giving him satisfaction;
	  <lb/>pressed him to drink with them; which he refused. But while
	  <lb/>he was considering what to do, one of the men went to the
	  <lb/>pack, and felt it. Finally, he resolved to return; and putting
	  <lb/>on his pack, said he would go back to town. As he said this,
	  <lb/>one of the men sat off from the house, nearly in the same di­
	  <lb/>rection, but did not keep the road. He left the house and pro­
	  <lb/>ceeded back the same road he came; and another man, he
	  <lb/>said, followed. When he had proceeded some distance from
	  <lb/>the house, the first man jumped out of the bushes, with a large
	  <lb/>club, and threatened his life, if he did not immediately stop
	  <lb/>and deliver his pack. By this time the other man appeared,
	  <lb/>and by them he was robbed of every dollar!</p>
        <p>The men he spoke of, were immediately taken, and proved
	  <lb/>to be men of bad character, one in particular; but no money
	  <lb/>was found with them. As court was sitting, they were imme­
	  <lb/>diately brought to trial, before his Honor, <persName>C. C. Clay</persName>, and

	  <lb/><persName>Mrs. B.</persName> and myself were called on by both parties successive­
	  <lb/>ly. The <name>Commonwealth</name> summoned us the first day, and the
	  <lb/>prisoners the next, when and where we stated the substance
	  <lb/>which has been related. A number of witnesses were sum­
	  <lb/>moned, and the boy was examined apart from his father, and
	  <lb/>agreed nearly with him; and always told the same story,
	  <lb/>which was not a very probable one; but neither would tell how
	  <lb/>they obtained the money, except that they made it by trading
	  <lb/>in furs, towards the <placeName>Rocky Mountains</placeName>, and were absent seven
	  <lb/>years; and were amongst the <name>Pawnee Indians</name>, and at the lead
	  <lb/>mines. But his appearance, and his coming such a circuitous
	  <lb/>route, induced the most people to think he did not tell truth;
	  <lb/>and though a few of the witnesses seemed to corroborate, with
	  <lb/>his testimony, as to the weight of the bundle, not one ever saw
	  <lb/>the money. The men accused were acquitted. I never was
	  <lb/>more staggered in my opinion, as was also the judge, and
	  <lb/>almost every one, so much so, that the smallest particle would
	  <lb/>have turned the scale one way or the other. Some said it
	  <lb/>must have been lead; others said it might have been silver oar<choice><sic>,</sic><corr>.</corr></choice>
	  <lb/>For the honor of <persName>Judge Clay</persName>, he gave the old man every
	  <lb/>opportunity to establish the fact; sending off, to a great dis­
	  <lb/>tance, for witnesses; protracting the trial, and seemed anxious
	  <lb/>to do the old man justice.</p>
        <p>The Judge did not put up at our house, but very politely
	  <lb/>called several times. <persName>Judge Clay</persName> is a very you<choice><sic/><corr>n</corr></choice>g man, of
	  <lb/>pleasing manners, handsome person, and said to be a man of
	  <lb/>the first talents in the state. Though this is a new country, I
	  <lb/>have witnessed very few judges who might rank with <persName>Judge
	    <lb/>Clay</persName> in elegance of manners.</p>
        <p>Thus ended the mighty matter, which excited much
	  <lb/>interest, and is still a cause of wonder in the neighborhood.
	  <lb/>The old man seems quite chop-fallen, and still hangs about the
	  <lb/>house.</p>
        <p>Another strange occurrence has, for some time, thrown
	  <lb/>the whole neighborhood into confusion and surprize. A woman,
	  <lb/>a few miles hence, was taken strangely ill, and said she was
	  <lb/>bewitched! She threw up knots of pins, and other things
	  <lb/>equally unaccountable; was racked with excruciating pains, so
<pb n="131"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="17(2)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">131</mw>
	  <lb/>that she had no rest night or day. She laid this upon one of
	  <lb/>the neighboring women, whom she pointed out by name! Her
	  <lb/>neighbors attended her, and was often present when she threw
	  <lb/>up the pins, knots of hair, and other unaccountable substances.
	  <lb/>The matter ran o<choice><sic><g ref="#invertedn"/></sic><corr>n</corr></choice> for several weeks, during which she
	  <lb/>contrived to inspire a large portion of the neighbors with the 
	  <lb/>belief that she was actually bewitched. Even respectable
	  <lb/>physicians were imposed upon, and were ready, and actually
	  <lb/>did testify that she was afflicted with some supernatural dis­
	  <lb/>ease, over which medicine had no controul. Finally, they
	  <lb/>carried on the farce so far, as to have the supposed witch
	  <lb/>apprehended and brought before the magistrate, and hundreds
	  <lb/>(likewise bewitched) attended to hear the trial. But the magis­
	  <lb/>trate happened not to be bewitched, and the woman, produc­
	  <lb/>ing proof of a fair character, was acquitted. The patient now
	  <lb/>became worse than ever, and the neighbors said it was a shame
	  <lb/>that the witch should have been acquitted; and the whole 
	  <lb/>neighborhood seemed to combine in a dangerous conspiracy,
	  <lb/>and the phrenzy of witchcraft at length alarmed the thinking
	  <lb/>part of the comunity, and three or four gentlemen took
	  <lb/>horses and rode to the house of the bewitched, with a view of
	  <lb/>putting an end to the cheat. It appeared that the husband of
	  <lb/>the bewitched woman, had traded for a barrel of brandy, to
	  <lb/>speculate on, and this barrel was in the house where the wo­
	  <lb/>man lay. The gentlemen having made this discovery, together
	  <lb/>with certain symptoms of the afflicted woman, kept a close
	  <lb/>watch, and at length discovered the real witch, which was the
	  <lb/>brandy barrel, having detected the lady drawing the brandy.
	  <lb/>They immediately made this known, and told the husband
	  <lb/>(who was deeply concerned for his wife) to send the barrel of
	  <lb/>brandy away, and his wife would soon be well. The neigh­
	  <lb/>bors now turned against the woman, and the husband of the
	  <lb/>lady who was persecuted, brought an action for slander, and
	  <lb/>finally, the bewitched lady, and her worse bewitched husband,
	  <lb/>became so obnoxious, they were compelled to leave the country.
	  <lb/>So much for ignorance.</p>

        </opener>
        <p><hi>I am</hi> fertile in anecdotes, and I send you the following,
	  <lb/>not quite three days old: Three evenings since, as I stood in
	  <lb/>our door, a genteel looking man rode up, and dismounting,
	  <lb/>asked <said>if he could be entertained?</said> I replied in the affir­
	  <lb/>mative: he passed by me into the house, as though he felt little
	  <lb/>concern for my reply. I still remained in the door, and <persName>Mr.
	    <lb/>Burlison</persName>, who had been at his plantation, appeared, walking
	  <lb/>slowly towards the door, with his eyes fixed on the stranger's
	  <lb/>horse; and when he came up, slapped his hands on it and said,
	  <lb/><said>this is my horse; who rode it?</said> I replied, a stranger. He
	  <lb/>stepped in the house, and I turned from the door at the same
	  <lb/>time to look at the gentleman, who had taken a seat, and found
	  <lb/>him smiling at <persName>Mr. Burlison</persName>, as he heard him claim the horse.
	  <lb/>This was a mere joke, it appeared, got up for amusement, be­
	  <lb/>tween the stranger and a nephew of the Captain's, who had
	  <lb/>also arrived from <placeName>East Tennessee</placeName>. <persName>Mr. Burlison</persName> had loaned
	  <lb/>the horse to his nephew some time back, to ride home to <placeName>Ten­
	    <lb/>nessee</placeName>; and when they arrived in <placeName>Moulton</placeName>, the young man
	  <lb/>stopped up in town, with the stranger's horse, and sent the
	  <lb/>stranger forward with the borrowed horse. As it turned out,
	  <lb/>however, it was quite a flat joke, and is merely referred to as
	  <lb/>a preface to something more interesting.</p>
        <p>The gentleman, like all those who visit the country, was
	  <lb/>endless in his praises, and entertained us until a late hour with
	  <lb/>his travels, and the incidents of the journey, which was sever­
	  <lb/>al hundred miles, namely, from <placeName>Salem</placeName>, <placeName>Virginia</placeName>—though he
	  <lb/>was now, he said, near the end of his journey—but never
	  <lb/>dropped a hint of his business. Thus the evening passed away,
	  <lb/>and every one was pleased with the stranger, and all seemed anx­
	  <lb/>ious to know his business in this part of the country; and no one,
	  <lb/>for a wonder, asked his name. He was well dressed; by no
	  <lb/>means foppish; rather spare, and rode a first rate horse, fol­
	  <lb/>lowed by another equally valuable. Some of us thought, most
	  <lb/>of us, indeed, were certain, he came to purchase land, as no­
<pb n="133"/>

<mw type="pageNum">133</mw>
	  <lb/>thing else brings people to this country. Not a syllable of pur­
	  <lb/>chasing, or a word, on the object of his journey escaped him.
	  <lb/>This was provoking, particularly to us females.</p>
        <p>The stranger retired to his bed, and next morning chatted
	  <lb/>till after breakfast, and seemed in no hurry to leave the house,
	  <lb/>and we concluded he was going to spend the day with us. We
	  <lb/>retired to dress and was absent some time; when returning to
	  <lb/>the parlor, we found the gentleman still sitting there, fami­
	  <lb/>liarly engaged in conversation, and seemed to win much upon
	  <lb/>the respect and esteem of the company. At length, about 10
	  <lb/>o'clock, he took out his pocket book, and taking a paper from
	  <lb/>thence, asked <persName>Mr. Burlison</persName> how far it was to a <persName>Mr. King's</persName>.
	  <lb/>As there are several of that name, the question remained un­
	  <lb/>answered, until he, the stranger, named the distance he lived
	  <lb/>from a particular Mill, which was down, as the river runs,
	  <lb/>about seven miles distant from <placeName>Moulton</placeName>. This being ascer­
	  <lb/>tained, the stranger sat musing sometime with the paper in his
	  <lb/>hand, and his eyes bent on the floor, absorbed in thought.—
	  <lb/>At length, he said, <said>I have a sister at this <persName>Mr. King's</persName>, if she
	    <lb/>still be living!</said> We women held our breath, and a painful
	  <lb/>silence reigned throughout the company. The stranger, after
	  <lb/>a pause, during which he labored under strong emotions, pro­
	  <lb/>ceeded: <said>I am full of hopes and fears, respecting my sister.—
	    <lb/>She wrote to us six months since, but her letter never reached
	    <lb/>us until about a few hours before I sat out on this journey, and
	    <lb/>I have not seen her for nearly four years.</said> As I lived in the 
	  <lb/>same county  some years, from which he was, though unac­
	  <lb/>quainted with the family, I became rather more interested than
	  <lb/>the company, and inquired, <said>by what means his sister hap­
	    <lb/>pened to be so far from her friends?</said> He replied, <said>it was a 
	    <lb/>long and rather a melancholy story, but he would relate it as
	    <lb/>briefly as possible. About four years ago, a <name>French</name> Doctor,
	    <lb/>as he called himself, came to our town and spent several months.
	    <lb/>During the time, he called often at my father's, and before we
	    <lb/>were aware, he succeeded in gaining the affections of one of
	    <lb/>my sisters, and made proposals of marriage. This was op­
	    <lb/>posed by all the family, as the man was a total stranger,
	    <lb/>and was forbid the house, and my sister forbid his com­
<pb n="134"/>

<mw type="pageNum">134</mw>
	    <lb/>pany—here we thought the matter at an end. Meanwhile
	    <lb/>my younger brother and him meeting by accident, quarrel­
	    <lb/>led and fought a duel. During the time, however, he procur­
	    <lb/>ed letters from <placeName>New York</placeName>, and <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, from various
	    <lb/>persons, whether genuine or forged, I do not know; but
	    <lb/>these letters represented him to be a man of the highest re­
	    <lb/>spectability, and a man of fortune, which lay principally in
	    <lb/>the <name>Spanish</name> dominions, near <placeName>P<choice><sic/><corr>e</corr></choice>nsacola</placeName>. He contrived to
	    <lb/>have these letters shown to my father; but it had no effect;
	    <lb/>and the matter seemed (as we thought) to have died away.
	    <lb/>But my sister, whom it appears, kept up a correspondence
	    <lb/>with him, declared she would never be happy if she did not
	    <lb/>marry <persName>Doctor Gennee</persName>, and that she would have him if she
	    <lb/>were forced to run away with him. Thus she teased us all,
	    <lb/>night and day, and finally prevailed, though against the
	    <lb/>wishes of every friend she had. The Doctor, after his mar­
	    <lb/>riage, was anxious to go on to his possessions in <placeName>Florida</placeName>; and
	    <lb/>to induce him to treat my sister well, my father gave him 1000
	    <lb/>dollars in cash, and bought a first rate wagon, entirely new,
	    <lb/>filled it with every species of best furniture, for house keeping,
	    <lb/>put a fine team of horses in it, with a slave to drive it, and
	    <lb/>with a saddle horse for my sister. They took leave, and we
	    <lb/>heard no more of them, till we received a letter from my sister
	    <lb/>dated about six months since, which filled us with astonishment
	    <lb/>and distress. I have the letter here now,</said> he added, <said>and
	    <lb/>will read it.</said> It was a long letter, and the young man was
	  <lb/>so overpowered by his feelings, that he was forced to pause
	  <lb/>several times, often the tear stealing down his cheek. The
	  <lb/>amount of the letter was:—That they arrived in safety in
	  <lb/><placeName>Florida</placeName>; but her husband had no property there, and left her of­
	  <lb/>ten without money to help herself, and went off she could not tell 
	  <lb/>where, a long time; that he was very cross and ill natured to
	  <lb/>her from the time she left her father's, and at last he sold eve­
	  <lb/>ry thing they had, and went off no one knew wither, leaving
	  <lb/>her without one cent in the world, or a particle of property.
	  <lb/>She was ashamed to apprize her father and brothers, as they
	  <lb/>had opposed her marriage; that she struggled to sustain life,
	  <lb/>though at the same time she prayed for death. At length,
<pb n="135"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="17(4)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">135</mw>
	  <lb/>growing calm, she thought of returning to her friends, if she
	  <lb/>had to beg her way, which she would certainly have to do.—
	  <lb/>Finally, her wrongs and her sufferings excited the compassion
	  <lb/>of some humane individuals, who furnished her with a pony,
	  <lb/>and a few dollars. She set forward alone, steering towards
	  <lb/><placeName>Nashville</placeName>, pursuing <name>Coffee's Trace</name>. This was an appaling un­
	  <lb/>dertaking for a female, through an uninhabited country of
	  <lb/>swamps and cane-breaks. She often lost her way, and wan­
	  <lb/>dered about for days and for nights without food, and often 
	  <lb/>without water. At length she gave out, and could travel no
	  <lb/>farther. She had been for some time aiming to reach a settle­
	  <lb/>ment, she had had in view from the first, and intended to stop
	  <lb/>there and write to her friends. This is the settlement (princi­
	  <lb/>pally religious people) where she now is. The first house she
	  <lb/>called at, the people refused even to let her come in, much
	  <lb/>less would they give her food to eat. What are you travelling
	  <lb/>alone for? It is a bad sign—you must be a bad woman. She
	  <lb/>went to another, and another house, but was turned away from
	  <lb/>all, with more than brutal cruelty. She now lost all hope, and
	  <lb/>sat down on the road side! While she was sitting there, this
	  <lb/><persName>Mr. King</persName> was passing by, and telling him her story, he took
	  <lb/>her to his house and treated her with great kindness. In a
	  <lb/>few days she wrote the letter mentioned, but by some means it
	  <lb/>did not reach its destination for six months.</p>
        <p>The letter contained a pathetic appeal to her father and
	  <lb/>brothers for forgiveness, and if they thought her worthy to be
	  <lb/>received into the family again, to send for her; if not, she would
	  <lb/>remain with her kind friend.</p>
        <p>Shortly after the letter arrived, this young man, who kept
	  <lb/>a Latin School in the neighborhood, came home, and his fa­
	  <lb/>ther requested him to get ready and go for her as quick as
	  <lb/>possible.</p>
        <p>After relating the story, he ordered his horses, and set
	  <lb/>out; and this day (the 2d) he passed by here, about one o'clock,
	  <lb/>P. M., with his sister, a very fine looking woman; but they
	  <lb/>were in a great hurry, and we only saw her on horseback.—
	  <lb/>While they were yet in sight, some of the neighbors of <persName>Mr.
	    <lb/>King</persName>, who were at the house when the brother called, and
<pb n="136"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="17(4)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">136</mw>
	  <lb/>who had rode up with them part of the way, stopped at our
	  <lb/>house, and related a most pathetic scene between the brother
	  <lb/>and sister. They flew into each others arms, and were for
	  <lb/>many minutes unable to speak. The sister at length burst into
	  <lb/>a flood of tears, and the brother likewise wept. But this was
	  <lb/>a trifle to the scene that followed. This lady had never been
	  <lb/>taught to work, and by way of amusement, she had induced
	  <lb/><persName>Mrs. King</persName> to teach her how to work, such as spinning, card­
	  <lb/>ing, &amp;c. She soon became very expert, and by way of remu­
	  <lb/>nerating her friends for their kindness in saving her life, work­
	  <lb/>ed late and early, thinking she could never do enough for them.
	  <lb/>But when the people who had turned her out of doors found
	  <lb/>she was a decent woman, and was industrious, they had the
	  <lb/>effrontry to come to <persName>King's</persName> to seduce her away. <said>His house,
	    <lb/>(being a poor man) was not fit for her to stay at; come to our
	    <lb/>house,</said> was their language. The lady refused their invitation
	  <lb/>with disdain, and remained with her friends; and so strong
	  <lb/>was her attachment to <persName>Mrs. King</persName>, and <persName>Mrs. King</persName> for her, that 
	  <lb/>when they came to take leave, it was difficult to tear them
	  <lb/>asunder. Thus ends the story.</p>
        <p>What think you, <persName>Matt</persName>, of the christian religion? Be­
	  <lb/>tween you and I, and the bed post, I begin to think it is all a
	  <lb/>plot of the priests. I have ever marked those professors,
	  <lb/>whenever humanity demanded their attention, the veriest
	  <lb/>savages under the sun. Now, this <persName>King</persName> made no pretensions
	  <lb/>to religion, and though this is, as you say, a <name>Jay's treaty</name>, I 
	  <lb/>must add another instance of their brutality—it happened when
	  <lb/>I was very young, and made an impression on me which I
	  <lb/>shall never forget. A presbyterian Elder, (and to this day I
	  <lb/>do not know the meaning of the word,) who prayed a long
	  <lb/>prayer, night and morning, owned a ferry. A poor woman,
	  <lb/>as I supposed then, (as she was on foot,) stopped at his door,
	  <lb/>and inquired what the ferryage was, saying she wanted to
	  <lb/>cross. She looked tired, hungry, miserable. The wretch
	  <lb/>asked her how much money she had? She showed him some
	  <lb/>in an old rag, and taking up a <distinct>bit</distinct>, I think it was, asked
	  <lb/>him <said>if that was enough?</said>—<said>No.</said> She took a <measure xml:id="a27" corresp="#n27" rend="post(*)">half bit</measure>
<pb n="137"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="18(1)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">137</mw>
	  <lb/>up, and holding them in her hand, asked <said>if that would do?</said>
	  <lb/>He shook his head. She had but one more <distinct>bit</distinct>, which she said
	  <lb/>was all she had. He would not touch it. She said, <said>I must
	    <lb/>cross; for God's sake take all, and put me over.</said> No; he turned
	  <lb/>off and was going into the house. The woman wiped the
	  <lb/>tears from her eyes with her sleeve, and pulling off a blue and 
	  <lb/>white checked handkerchief, which she wore round her neck,
	  <lb/>called him back, and told him <said>she must cross the river if she
	    <lb/>had to go without a handkerchief;</said> and the wretch took it and
	  <lb/>the money too!!! One of these hypocrites told me once <said>I
	    <lb/>ought not to judge <emph>all</emph> by <emph>one</emph>.</said> No! But I judge <emph>all</emph> by <emph>all</emph>, for
	  <lb/>they are all the same.</p>

          <salute>Dear <persName>Matt</persName>,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p><hi>My</hi> old acquaintance, the Colonel, has moved from the
	  <lb/>Bluff (or <placeName>Marathon</placeName>) to this place, which, though now a consi­
	  <lb/>derable town, consisting of fine brick houses, was a cornfield
	  <lb/>18 months ago, and the corn furrows are still visible in many
	  <lb/>parts of the town. The Colonel, and all the citizens, however,
	  <lb/>are much disappointed that they did not obtain the seat of
	  <lb/>justice here; and the Colonel particularly takes it much to
	  <lb/>heart, as he purchased lots under that view. But he is forced
	  <lb/>to submit. <mentioned>Courtland</mentioned>, (you see they counted their chickens
	  <lb/>before they were hatched) being eight miles from the river,
	  <lb/>the boundary of the country, <placeName>Courtland</placeName> was too far from the 
	  <lb/>centre.</p>
        <p>And the great beauty is married! At a few months over
	  <lb/>14 years of age! She married a <name>South Carolinian</name>, by the 
	  <lb/>name of <persName>Daniel Wright</persName>, Esq. a very genteel, amiable man,
	  <lb/>and clerk of the court. He was a member of the convention

	    <lb/>that framed the Constitution for the state, and is a man of
	    <lb/>princely manners. The lady had a considerable fortune, and
	    <lb/>they will doubtless do well. So you have missed it again.</p>
        <p>This is the region of the <placeName>Carolina</placeName> pink and Colomba root.
	  <lb/>Wagon loads of the latter may be gathered any where in the
	  <lb/>woods; it, and the pink, cover the ground. The pink grows
	  <lb/>much like the garden pink, and the flower is similar in size
	  <lb/>and figure, but is of a scarlet. I am sure I have seen it in
	  <lb/>some part of the Union before, but cannot tell where. The
	  <lb/>woods are alive with it here, and a profusion of other beautiful
	  <lb/>flowers. It is quite a treat to ride through the woods. The
	  <lb/>Colomba root has several broad leaves near the ground, in the
	  <lb/>shape like the hound's tongue, of a yellowish green—the leaf
	  <lb/>thick and fuzzy—and a stem runs up from these from one to
	  <lb/>two feet in height, without leaves, and has a flower near the
	  <lb/>top—but it is not now in bloom.</p>
        <p>The greatest curiosity here, is the sensitive brier. It is
	  <lb/>in its nature, (but not in shape,) like the sensitive plant, though
	  <lb/>with this difference, only <emph>that</emph> part of the plant shrinks which
	  <lb/>you touch. For instance, if you touch <emph>one</emph> leaf, it draws up
	  <lb/>instantly, but this does not affect the other leaves—not so the
	  <lb/>brier: It grows like the raspberry brier, long, and still more
	  <lb/>slender, with narrow leaves; if you touch the stem at one end,
	  <lb/>the leaves instantly pucker themselves up from one end of the
	  <lb/>brier to the other, the most astonishing phenomenon I have
	  <lb/>witnessed in the vegetable kingdom. The brier grows spon­
	  <lb/>taneously. Those I saw were from one to five feet high, and
	  <lb/>about the thickness of a wheat straw. The leaves are very
	  <lb/>small, narrow, and notched, not larger than the smallest pink
	  <lb/>leaf. I amused myself sometime in tormenting these little
	  <lb/>whimsical rogues.</p>
        <p>Since I have began with the curious, we have, another
	  <lb/>great curiosity here, viz: the jointed snake, which, if struck
	  <lb/>with a stick flies to pieces with a jingling noise. No blood is
	  <lb/>emitted from the broken parts, and it is said the pieces unite
	  <lb/>again. This I was told was a fact, though I did not see the
	  <lb/>snake. The Camelion is also a native of this place. They
	  <lb/>are found every where; but the prairies abound with them.—
<pb n="139"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="18(2)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">139</mw>
	  <lb/>They are called the <quote>Green Lizard,</quote> by the inhabitants.—
	  <lb/><persName>Mrs. Burlison</persName> informed me, that its general color was green,
	  <lb/>but if provoked, it changed to a grayish color, and the throat,
	  <lb/>which swells to a great size, when it is made angry, changes
	  <lb/>to a pale crimson. I did not happen to see one, as you may
	  <lb/>ride for days through the prairies without being able to dis­
	  <lb/>tinguish them from the grass, of which color they are. Speak­
	  <lb/>ing of prairies—these <mcr>prairies</mcr> are too damp for cotton, but
	  <lb/>corn grows well on them, and in the season for st<choice><sic/><corr>r</corr></choice>awberries,
	  <lb/>you may gather wagon loads of them; and these are a su­
	  <lb/>perior flavor to any in our part of the country. You cannot
	  <lb/><emph>walk</emph> through a prairie in st<choice><sic/><corr>r</corr></choice>awberry time, they take you up to
	  <lb/>the ankle.</p>
        <p>Another curiosity—Tobacco grows spontaneously in this
	  <lb/>state! It grows in <placeName>Madison county</placeName> in the forest, and attains
	  <lb/>the same height as when cultivated—but the leaves are thin,
	  <lb/>and unfit for use. It is also found in <placeName>West Tennessee</placeName>. It was
	  <lb/>found in <placeName>Madison</placeName>, by the first white people who visited the
	  <lb/>country, nor can the oldest <name>Indian</name> account for its origin.—
	  <lb/>Some think it is a native, and others, again, suppose it possi­
	  <lb/>ble the seed might have been scattered by some adventurous 
	  <lb/>traveller.</p>
        <p>This, and the adjoining states, on the <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>, is be­
	  <lb/>yond doubt to become the wealthiest part of the <placeName>United States</placeName>.
	  <lb/>In fact, it is so now. The inhabitants of this state, however,
	  <lb/>not contented with the overflowing productions of their thrice
	  <lb/>happy soil, have vainly attempted to introduce the sugar
	  <lb/>cane—but, doubtless, it will fail. By covering the roots it
	  <lb/>lives through the winter, and grows to a considerable height.
	  <lb/>Though it is now in perfection of two year's growth, the win­
	  <lb/>ters are evidently too cold for the plant.</p>
        <p>Upland rice grows here with success. It looks like oats,
	  <lb/>is sown in drills, and plowed and hoed like corn. It is of a 
	  <lb/>reddish color when cooked. Every planter rears enough for
	  <lb/>his own use.</p>
        <p>I fell in with a traveller of intelligence, from whom I ga­
	  <lb/>thered a few particulars of those new Southern States, and
	  <lb/>taking the whole together, it is beyond doubt the most desirable
<pb n="140"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="18(2)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">140</mw>
	  <lb/>country on earth. The gentleman is from the <placeName>Red River</placeName> last:
	  <lb/>His information amounts to the following:</p>
        <p>He has been several years in that country, and assisted in
	  <lb/>surveying and running the boundary lines, both of <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>
	  <lb/>and <placeName>Louisiana</placeName>. <said rend="post()">The lands (he says) on the 
	    <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>, on both
	    <lb/>sides, far exceeds this in fertility, and producing two thousand
	    <lb/>weight of cotton to the acre: whereas fifteen hundred is the most
	    <lb/>that is calculated on here. Indigo, tobacco, and rice grow there
	    <lb/>in great abundance. <name>Indian</name> corn grows with such rapidity, that
	    <lb/>two crops can be raised in one year, below thirty two or thirty
	    <lb/>one degrees of North latitude. From one to two hundred
	    <lb/>bushels of <name>Indian</name> corn are produced to the acre. Sugar and
	    <lb/>oranges grow in the same latitude, but neither will grow to
	    <lb/>any degree of perfection above thirty-two. Cotton and sugar
	    <lb/>are the staples of <placeName>Louisiana</placeName> and <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>; and people amass
	    <lb/>great wealth there in a short time, from the culture of those
	    <lb/>articles. Even poor men, that go there, and attend to large
	    <lb/>stocks of cattle that run on great natural meadows, which 
	    <lb/>abound in <placeName>Louisiana</placeName>, for which they get a certain part, soon
	    <lb/>become rich. Sugar is cultivated by laying the stalks in fur­
	    <lb/>rows once in three years, and from the joints new stems 
	    <lb/>arise.</said></p>
        <p><said rend="post()">The best cotton grows on <placeName>Red River</placeName>. All, who have
	    <lb/>visited that country, agree on this point. The stalks grow to
	    <lb/>such thickness and strength there, that they are strong enough
	    <lb/>to bear a man's weight.</said> [I have heard this asserted by many.] <said rend="pre()post()"><lb/><placeName>Red River</placeName> falls into the <placeName>Mississippi</placeName> from the West side below
	    <lb/><placeName>Natchez</placeName>, in about the thirty-first degree of latitude. Beyond
	    <lb/><placeName>Louisiana</placeName>, that is, west of it, there is another vast region equal­
	    <lb/>ly as productive, and almost without inhabitants: I mean
	    <lb/><placeName>Texas</placeName>—though it belongs to the <name>Spanish</name> government.—The
	    <lb/><name>Spaniard</name> offer a considerable bounty in land to all persons,
	    <lb/>who will go and settle it. The Southern part of <placeName>Louisiana</placeName>
	    <lb/>extends from the East side of the <placeName>Mississippi river</placeName>, which 
	    <lb/>bounds it East, to the <placeName>Saline river</placeName>, which bounds it on the
	    <lb/>West, and divides it from <placeName>Texas</placeName>. There is no difference in
	    <lb/>the soil or productions of the states of <placeName>Louisiana</placeName> and <placeName>Missis­
	      <lb/>sippi</placeName>; but the former is more liable to be everflowed by the
<pb n="141"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="18(3)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">141</mw>
	    <lb/>rivers that flow through the former, and much more of it is
	    <lb/>covered with swamps—but there is enough to reward industry
	    <lb/>and enterprise, exclusive of the swamps.</said></p>

          <p>The <placeName>Mississippi</placeName> state extends from the river of the same

	    <lb/>point where the Southern boundary line of the state of <placeName>Ten­
	      <lb/>nessee</placeName> strikes the said river; thence East along the said boun­
	    <lb/>dary line to the <placeName>Tennessee river</placeName>; thence up the same to the
	    <lb/>mouth of <placeName>Bear creek</placeName>; thence, by a direct line to the Northwest
	    <lb/>corner of the county of <placeName>Washington</placeName>, in <placeName>Alabama</placeName>; thence due
	    <lb/>South to the <placeName>Gulf of Mexico</placeName>; thence Westwardly, including all
	    <lb/>the Islands within six leagues of the shore, to the most Eastern
	    <lb/>junction of <placeName>Pearl river</placeName> with <placeName>Lake Borgne</placeName>; thence up said river
	    <lb/>to the thirty-first degree of North latitude; thence west along
	    <lb/>the said degree of latitude to the <placeName>Mississippi river</placeName>; and thence
	    <lb/>up the same to the beginning. <placeName>Mississippi</placeName> is watered by the

	    <lb/>tensive on the east side of <placeName>Mississippi river</placeName>, yet they are equal­
	    <lb/>ly as fertile, producing cotton, &amp;c. in abundance. There are
	    <lb/>three distinct species of land, both in this state and <placeName>Alabama</placeName>:
	    <lb/>The bottom, the bluff, (or high, dry, rich cotton land,) and
	    <lb/>pine land. Take it all in all, it is not exceeded in fertility by
	    <lb/>any in the world: Neither is it so sickly as is represented.—
	    <lb/>Consumptions, which sweep so many of our Northern people
	    <lb/>to the grave, are unknown here. I have seen a gentleman,
	    <lb/>that was far gone with that complaint, who tells me that he has
	    <lb/>entirely recovered. The moschitoes, however, are trouble­
	    <lb/>some; but the small expense they are at, to secure themselves
	    <lb/>from them, is amply remunerated by the soil's overflowing pro­
	    <lb/>ductiveness.</p>

        <p>There is a country for you, <persName>Matt</persName>: and am I not a good

	  <lb/>of turning author some of these days, for though I know you
	    <lb/>are only indulging your irony, (you saucy rogue, is that the

        <p>The people have elected <persName>C. C.</persName> Was there ever such fools?
	  <lb/>They must have been intoxicated. Can <placeName>America</placeName> stand? Can
	  <lb/>she preserve her liberty thus? She cannot; she ought not!
	  <lb/>They are prodigal of their sovereignty, indeed. It appears to
	  <lb/>be painful to them. To elect the greatest <emph>fool</emph>, by odds the
	  <lb/>greatest fool in the country. You know he always has <persName>Lord
	    <lb/>Hale</persName> in his mouth. In my husband's lifetime, this <persName>Lord Hale</persName>
	  <lb/>came to our house and spent a day. You knew my husband's
	  <lb/>hospitality. He entertained all alike. Court was sitting at
	  <lb/>this time, at the <placeName>Sweet Springs</placeName>, and this booby, (how he came
	  <lb/>to be licensed a lawyer, is strange,) while at the dinner table,
	  <lb/>began to repeat part of a defence, it appeared he made for a
	  <lb/>criminal; in doing which, he referred to <quote><persName>Lord Hale's</persName> Pleas
	    <lb/>of the Crown.</quote> Finding we were all silent, he took it for
	  <lb/>granted, we were delighted, and launched out in the praise of
	  <lb/><persName rend="slant(italic)">Demosthenes</persName> and 
	  <persName rend="slant(italic)">Cicero</persName>. My husband, who had remained si­
	  <lb/>lent, and was weary of the fool, at length, asked who this <persName>Demos­
	    <lb/>thenes</persName> was, <said>as I am very ignorant in these things.</said> <said>You
	    <lb/>don't know who <persName>Demosthenes</persName> was? Why he was a great Ro­
	      <lb/>man Emperor; and <persName>Cicero</persName> was another great Emperor; and
	    <lb/><persName>Cato</persName> was another. There are very few things come amiss to
	    <lb/>me.</said> Thus he went on till he swept away all the great men of 
	  <lb/>antiquity; whilst I suffered the ordeal, as being at my own ta­
	  <lb/>ble, I dare not laugh. My husband never laughed at any
	  <lb/>thing; but he did something much better this day. He al­
	  <lb/>ways sat sometime after the cloth was removed, and had a
	  <lb/>fashion of leaning forward, when displeased, upon his arms,
	  <lb/>which were usually crossed, and at the same time biting his
	  <lb/>thumb. I always trembled when I saw this; nor dare I rise
	  <lb/>from the table till he made a signal; and though our house was
	  <lb/>usually full, we happened to have no one this day, but <persName>Lord
	    <lb/>Hale</persName>. At length, my husband, addressing his Lordship, said,

	  <lb/><said>Now, what a d—d fool you are; this is the way you ex­
	    <lb/>pose yourself; do you know you are a laughing stock for the
	    <lb/>whole country? My dog, <name rend="slant(italic)">Citizen</name>, (a favorite pointer,) has
	    <lb/>more sense. Just go home, and go to plow, for if my dog
	    <lb/>could speak, he would make a better lawyer.</said> He took it in
	  <lb/>good part, and said it was the best lesson he ever had heard.
	  <lb/>It was lost upon such a fool. Strange, that whatever side he
	  <lb/>took at the bar, was sure to be victorious; as, true to their
	  <lb/>nature, the people, or rabble, rather always think the greatest
	  <lb/>fool the wisest man. They have proved it in this instance, by
	  <lb/>their selecting him to make laws for them. Alas, for my

	  <lb/>lest he might be charged with what he is innocent of, did not,

        <p><placeName>Florence</placeName> is one of the new towns of this beautiful and ra­
	  <lb/>pid rising state. It is happily situated for commerce at the
	  <lb/>head of steamboat navigation, on the north side of <placeName>Tennessee
	    <lb/>river</placeName>, in the country of <placeName>Lauderdale</placeName>, five miles below the port of
	  <lb/>the <placeName>Muscle Shoals</placeName>, and ten miles from the line of the state of
	  <lb/><placeName>Tennessee</placeName>.</p>
        <p><placeName>Florence</placeName> is to be the great emporium of the northern part
	  <lb/>of this state. I do not see why it should not; it has a great ca­
	  <lb/>pital and is patronized by the wealthiest gentlemen in the
	  <lb/>state. It has a great state at its back; another in front, and a
	  <lb/>noble river on all sides, the steamboats pouring every necessa­
	  <lb/>ry and every luxury into its lap. Its citizens, bold, enterpris­
	  <lb/>ing, and industrious—much more so than any I have seen in
	  <lb/>the state.</p>
        <p>Many large and elegant brick buildings are already built
	  <lb/>here, (although it was sold out, but two years since,) and frame
	  <lb/>houses are putting up daily. It is not uncommon to see a
	  <lb/>framed building begun in the morning and finished by night.</p>

        <p>Several respectable mercantile houses are established here,
	  <lb/>and much business is done on commission also. The site of
	  <lb/>the town is beautifully situated on an eminence, commanding
	  <lb/>an extensive view of the surrounding country, and <placeName>Tennessee
	    <lb/>river</placeName>, from which it is three quarters of a mile distant.—It has
	  <lb/>two springs of excellent and never failing water. <placeName>Florence</placeName>
	  <lb/>has communication by water with <placeName rend="slant(italic)">Mississippi</placeName>,

	  <lb/>The great Military road that leads from <placeName>Nashville</placeName> to <placeName>New Or­
	    <lb/>leans</placeName>, by way of <placeName>Lake Ponchartrain</placeName>, passes through this town,
	  <lb/>and the number of people who travel through it, and the nume­
	  <lb/>rous droves of horses for the lower country, for market, are
	  <lb/>incredible. <placeName>Florence</placeName> contains one printing press, and publish­
	    <lb/>es a paper weekly called the <name>Florence Gazette</name>; it is ably pa­
	    <lb/>tronized, and edited by one of our first men, and said to be the
	    <lb/>best paper in the state. <placeName>Florence</placeName> is inhabited by people from
	    <lb/>almost all parts of <placeName>Europe</placeName> and the <placeName>United States</placeName>; here are
	    <lb/><name>English</name>, <name>Irish</name>, <name>Welch</name>, <name>Scotch</name>, <name>French</name>, <name>Dutch</name>, 
	  <name>Germans</name>, and
	    <lb/><name rend="slant(italic)">Grecians</name>. The first <name>Greek</name> I ever saw was in this town. I
	    <lb/>conversed with him on the subject of his country, but found
	    <lb/>him grossly ignorant. He butchers for the town, and has
	    <lb/>taken to his arms a mullatto woman for a wife. He very of­
	    <lb/>ten takes an airing on horseback of a <name>Sunday</name> afternoon, with
	    <lb/>his wife riding by his side, and both arrayed in shining cos­
	    <lb/>tume.</p>
        <p>The river at <placeName>Florence</placeName> is upwards of five-hundred yards
	  <lb/>wide; it is ferried in a large boat worked by four horses, and
	  <lb/>crosses in a few minutes.</p>
        <p>There are two large and well kept Taverns in <placeName>Florence</placeName>,
	  <lb/>and several <distinct>Doggeries</distinct>. A Doggery is a place where spirituous
	  <lb/>liquors are sold; and where men get drunk, quarrel, and fight,
	  <lb/>as often as they choose, but where there is nothing to eat for
	  <lb/>man or beast. Did you ever hear any thing better named.
	  <lb/><said>I <emph>sware</emph>!</said> said a <name>Yankee</name> pedlar, one day, with both his eyes
	  <lb/>banged up, <said>that are Doggery, be rightly named. Never seed

	    <lb/>catch me in these here parts. Awfullest place one could be
	    <lb/>at.</said> It appeared the inmates of the Doggery enticed him un­
	  <lb/>der pretence of buying his wares, and forced him to drink; and
	  <lb/>then forced him to fight; but the poor little <name>Yankee</name> was sadly
	  <lb/>beaten. Not content with blacking up his eyes, they over­
	  <lb/>turned his tin-cart, and scattered his tins to the four winds;
	  <lb/>frightened his horse, and tormented his very soul out about
	  <lb/><distinct>lasses</distinct>, &amp;c. He was a laughable object—but to hear his dialect
	  <lb/>in laying off the law, was a complete farce, particularly when
	  <lb/><persName>Pat</persName> came to invite him into the same Doggery to drink
	  <lb/>friends—<said>I ben't a dog to go into that are dog house.</said></p>
        <p>The people, you see, <emph>know</emph> a <emph>thing</emph> or two, here; they call
	  <lb/>things by their right names. But to proceed—there may be
	  <lb/>about one hundred dwelling houses and stores, a court house,
	  <lb/>and several ware houses in <placeName>Florence</placeName>. The latter are however
	  <lb/>on the river. One of the longest buildings I ever saw, is in
	  <lb/><placeName>Florence</placeName>. It was built by a company of gentlemen, and is
	  <lb/>said to have cost $90,000, and is not yet finished. The pro­
	  <lb/>prietors, being of this place, are men of immense wealth, and
	  <lb/>are pushing their capital with great foresight and activity.
	  <lb/>For industry and activity, <placeName>Florence</placeName> outstrips all the northern
	  <lb/>towns in the state. More people travel this road than all our
	  <lb/>western roads put together. I was just going to conclude,
	  <lb/>when an old <name>German</name> passing through my room from that of
	  <lb/>my landlady's, made me laugh, in reply to something uttered
	  <lb/>by the lady, he said <said>poverty was no crime, when we came

        <p><hi>More</hi> of <placeName>Florence</placeName>. I observed in my last, the surprizing
	  <lb/>wealth of this place. The principal gentlemen of wealth are
	  <lb/><persName>General Coffee</persName>, <persName>James Jackson</persName>, Esq., 
	  <persName xml:id="a29" corresp="#n29" rend="post(*)">Major McKinley</persName>, and

<milestone unit="sig" n="19(2)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">147</mw>
	  <lb/><persName>Messrs. Simpson</persName> and <persName>Gaither</persName>. Of these <persName>J. Jackson</persName> is said to 
	  <lb/>be not only wealthy, but the wealthiest man in the state.—
	  <lb/>There are, however, many others quite easy in their circum­
	  <lb/>stances. <persName>General Coffee</persName>, and <persName>J. Jackson</persName> live out of town. <persName>Ma­
	    <lb/>jor McKinley</persName> lives in <placeName>Florence</placeName>, and is reputed to be the first
	  <lb/>lawyer in the three states. He is a stout, fine looking man; of
	  <lb/>easy manners, as all gentlemen are; and his dwelling con­
	  <lb/>tains more taste and splendor, by one half, than I ever
	  <lb/>saw in my whole life put together. But this is nothing.—
	  <lb/><persName>Mrs. McKinley</persName>, the elegance of her manners, and the
	  <lb/>sweetness of her conversation, joined with her interesting
	  <lb/>children, completely disconcerted me. Every thing in the
	  <lb/>house had, to me, the appearance of enchantment. I never
	  <lb/>was in such a paradise before. <persName>Mrs. McKinley</persName> looked as
	  <lb/>though she had dropped from above. I never was more con­
	  <lb/>founded. And the children! They are truly a pattern! The
	  <lb/>dear little things were in the nursery, and hearing there was
	  <lb/>a stranger in the parlour, prevailed on the nurse to open the
	  <lb/>door a few inches, that they might see who was there—but they
	  <lb/>were instantly upbraided by their mother. Make these a pat­
	  <lb/>tern for your children, if you should have any. I begged ad­
	  <lb/>mission for the dear creatures, and they were admitted upon
	  <lb/>condition of good behavior. They were the handsomest children
	  <lb/>I ever beheld, and I was so completely fa<choice><sic/><corr>s</corr></choice>cinated by their man­
	  <lb/>ners, I forgot everything else. <persName>Mrs. McKinley</persName> informed me
	  <lb/>she was from <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, and was acquainted with <persName>Mrs. 
	    <lb/>Doctor Charles Lewis</persName>.</p>
        <p>All the ladies of <placeName>Florence</placeName> excel in the domestic virtues.
	  <lb/>No gadding abroad. They demean themselves with that mo­
	  <lb/>desty and attention to their domestic affairs, beyond any la­
	  <lb/>dies I have seen in the state. <persName>Mrs. Coffee</persName> (a niece of <persName>Mrs.
	    <lb/>General Jackson</persName>,) comes to preaching in a plain bonnet and
	  <lb/>calico dress. <persName>General Coffee</persName> was here since I arrived, and ap­
	  <lb/>pears to be much reduced since I saw him in <placeName>Huntsville</placeName>. His
	  <lb/>constitution was much injured by the hardships he suffered
	  <lb/>in the army. I was never within speaking of <persName>James Jackson</persName>.
	  <lb/>It is said he is a native of <placeName>Ireland</placeName>. <persName>Mrs. Ward</persName>, <persName>Mrs. Gibson</persName>,
	  <lb/>and <persName>Mrs. Southworth</persName>, the printer's wife, and several others,
<pb n="148"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="19(2)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">148</mw>
	  <lb/>are charming women. <persName>Captain Gibson</persName>, a son of the brave
	  <lb/><persName>Colonel Gibson</persName>, of <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>, is one of the most amiable men
	  <lb/>on earth.</p>
        <p>It is unaccountable why such a number of physicians
	  <lb/>should flock to this country. Every town is flooded with them.
	  <lb/>They are strung along the roads like so many blacksmith's
	  <lb/>shops. You can neither walk nor ride, but you have a physi­
	  <lb/>cian on each side, one in front, and one in rear. Here are se­
	  <lb/>ven in <placeName>Florence</placeName>—seven more went away, for want of room.
	  <lb/>There are also, here, <emph>six</emph> lawyers. I left <emph>thirteen</emph> doctors in
	  <lb/><placeName rend="slant(italic)">Courtland</placeName>, a much smaller place. One hundred passed through
	  <lb/>the latter, south, unable to get in. You cannot, as I stated
	  <lb/>before, travel a mile on any great road, without meeting with
	  <lb/>a Doctor's shop. But this is not all. Almost every practis­
	  <lb/>ing doctor has three or four students. I have known mechanics
	  <lb/>quit their trade and commence the study of medicine. This
	  <lb/>would lead one to think the country was sickly. No such
	  <lb/>thing. It is a much healthier country than ours. It appears
	  <lb/>that the first doctors, who came here, made great fortunes,
	  <lb/>and every young man studied medicine, so that mankind has,
	  <lb/>indeed, given themselves up to the guidance of folly. They
	  <lb/>remind one of <persName>Erasmus'</persName> drunken man attempting to mount
	  <lb/>his horse; if you help him up on one side, he falls over on the
	  <lb/>other. Many of these physicians, however, are becoming
	  <lb/>planters, by which they will doubtless make their bread. They
	  <lb/>add, however, much to society, and help to pass off the time.
	  <lb/>They are all life a<choice><sic><g ref="#invertedn"/></sic><corr>n</corr></choice>d gaiety, and are constantly playing pranks
	  <lb/>on each other, for want of other employment. A most laugh­
	  <lb/>able scene occurred here the other day, which, for ingenuity
	  <lb/>of plot, and fertility of humor, might challenge the author of
	  <lb/><title rend="pre()post()"><persName>Don Quixotte</persName></title>.</p>
        <p>The first we heard of it was the voice of a female entering

	  <lb/>guage.) She smote her fists together violently, and (passing
	  <lb/>over about ninety-nine oaths, at least) declared vengeance

	  <lb/>the secret, began to laugh; others laughed for company; but
	  <lb/>the most of the people were astonished. <said>Twenty-four miles
	    <lb/>here I've walked, and torn myself to pieces with thorns, and
	    <lb/>bruises; look at my arms d—n you; look at my clothes; yes,
	    <lb/>laugh, laugh; see m<choice><sic>p</sic><corr>y</corr></choice> shoes and stockings, wading all the
	    <lb/>creeks, you sons of b—s. Oh, yes, you're the ones.</said> Her
	  <lb/>face was as red as scarlet, from the heat and rage together.—
	  <lb/>Briefly—a number of boats are generally lying at the landing,
	  <lb/>and it appears that the young men in <placeName>Florence</placeName> are no better
	  <lb/>than the young men of other towns, or what I would say,
	  <lb/>rather, that all young men are alike. This is an undeniable
	  <lb/>fact, and has been the case since the world began, if history
	  <lb/>be true, and will doubtless continue to the end of it. Whether
	  <lb/>this be the effect of preaching, or the want of it, I pretend not to
	  <lb/>say. All I have to say, is, that the priests have been preach­
	  <lb/>ing these 1821 years, and yet young men, and young women,
	  <lb/>too, are still the same, and may be, a little worse. This may,
	  <lb/>however, be a part of the religion they preach, as I always
	  <lb/>find most of it where there is most preaching. The sensible
	  <lb/>reader will understand me as wishing to check the evil of swear­
	  <lb/>ing, and without any desire to wound the delicacy or any fair
	  <lb/>sisters, though, like myself, they never ceased until they un­
	  <lb/>ravelled the mystery; and with no other view than to guard
	  <lb/>them against temptations and the cunning of young men. It
	  <lb/>was ascertained, that parties of both sexes, for want of house
	  <lb/>room, doubtless, had often spent the night in these boats. It is
	  <lb/>said that people live in boats in <placeName>China</placeName>; probably this gave rise
	  <lb/>to the idea in this country. Let this be a<choice><sic>t</sic><corr>s</corr></choice> it may, a very de­
	  <lb/>cent and respectable young man was seen leading a lady in the
	  <lb/>dusk of the evening into one of these boats; and sometime in the
	  <lb/>night, somebody untied the cable of the boat, and down the river
	  <lb/>she sailed of her own accord. There are shoals in <placeName>Tennessee
	    <lb/>river</placeName>, about 20 or 24 miles below <placeName>Florence</placeName>, and the first intel­
	  <lb/>ligence the inmates of the boat had of being under way, was
	  <lb/>the noise of the Shoals, which awakened them from a sound
	  <lb/>sleep! The woman waked first, and being alarmed at the noise,
	  <lb/>roused the young man, no other person happening to be on 
	  <lb/>board. Upon looking out, and rubbing his eyes, the truth
<pb n="150"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="19(3)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">150</mw>
	  <lb/>burst upon him; but there was no remedy, and their fears
	  <lb/>were no little, lest the boat might hang or break upon a rock.
	  <lb/>Fortunately the boat lodged against an island, fair and softly—
	  <lb/>and there the gentleman and his companion had to remain, till
	  <lb/>fortune might send a boat for their relief, either up or down
	  <lb/>the river, which, by chance, happened sometime the ensuing
	  <lb/>day. But it appears the gentleman proved rather ungallant,
	  <lb/>in the end, as he left the lady to shift for herself, the moment
	  <lb/>he set foot on shore; and turning back to back, he went down
	  <lb/>the river, and she came up to <placeName>Florence</placeName>. It is supposed he had
	  <lb/>two reasons for this: First—he did not wish to be seen walking
	  <lb/>side by side with the lady into <placeName>Florence</placeName>, which would have
	  <lb/>subjected him to the ridicule of his friends. Secondly—within
	  <lb/>six or seven miles below <quote>Lover's Landing,</quote> as it has since
	  <lb/>been called, there was a small town, where he wished to re­
	  <lb/>fresh himself, and procure a horse, to ride back, being clerk
	  <lb/>of the court, his absence could not well be dispensed with.</p>
        <p>These incidents we learned partly from the woman,
	  <lb/>partly from observation, and partly from the contrivers of the
	  <lb/>plot. The woman said <said>it was very unkind,</said> or in words to
	  <lb/>that amount, to go off, and leave her to come home through
	  <lb/>the swamps, by herself, without a road. And all the ladies
	  <lb/>thought so too: but they spoke differently, for they said she
	  <lb/>deserved it all, and a great deal more. They did not in my
	  <lb/>hearing cast the smallest reflection upon the young man.
	  <lb/>He returned the next day, and in a very ill humour; and with­
	  <lb/>out adverting to his misfortunes, examined the countenance of 
	  <lb/>every and each of his friends, with a view of detecting the
	  <lb/>party concerned. Being a man of spirit, he would have cer­
	  <lb/>tainly walked the man or men out; but this part of the farce
	  <lb/>will never be known; and he is very silent himself, for ob­
	  <lb/>vious reasons. This incident has afforded much amusement.</p>
        <p>I ought to have mentioned <persName xml:id="a30" corresp="#n30" rend="post(*)">Mr. Mayers</persName>, your old ac­
	  <lb/>quaintance. He lives in <placeName>Franklin county</placeName>, over the river from
	  <lb/>hence. I dined at his house on my way to <placeName>Florence</placeName>. He is
	  <lb/>delighted with the country, owns a valuable plantation, and is
	  <lb/>up to the eyes rearing cotton. But he lacks one very essential
<pb n="151"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="19(4)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">151</mw>
	  <lb/>comfort, which is water; having to haul it about two miles.—
	  <lb/>He has been at great expense digging for water on his land,
	  <lb/>but has failed. <persName>Miss Ann</persName>, looks as charming as ever, and is
	  <lb/>often a visiter at the house of my friend, <persName>Judge Ellis</persName>, one of
	  <lb/>the most interesting families in <placeName>Alabama</placeName>. I never, though
	  <lb/>long acquainted with <persName>Mr. Mayers</persName>, and <persName>Miss M.</persName> saw <persName>Mrs.
	    <lb/>Mayers</persName> before. She is one of the finest women I have seen in 
	  <lb/>this or any other country. They are all highly pleased with
	  <lb/>the change; and <persName>Mr. Mayers</persName> has a number of very promising
	  <lb/>children. But he talks of removing to <placeName>Tuscaloosa</placeName>, if he can
	  <lb/>sell out to advantage.</p>
        <p>In noting all the fine things of <placeName>Florence</placeName>, I overlooked a
	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Fulton</persName>, an eminent lawyer, and a gentleman of first rate
	  <lb/>talents. He is from <placeName>Maryland</placeName>, and one of the ornaments of
	  <lb/>society. I was just now called on for a toast, and gave an old
	  <lb/>one which is <emph>said</emph> to have been given extempore by one of my

        <p>I should have no objection to realize one line of the toast.

	  <lb/>this, unless I am to join in the opinion with <persName>Tom Envy</persName>, men­
	  <lb/>tioned in a former letter, viz: that wealth changes the man­

	  <lb/>cur. But I should think, my friends would have sent some
	  <lb/>message at least. Grant me patience, good heavens!</p>
        <p><placeName>Huntsville</placeName>, has greatly increased since my first visit; and
	  <lb/>notwithstanding the check it has received, in the great number
	  <lb/>of new towns on the river, it will always be a place of wealth
	  <lb/>and business. Its capital is considerable, and the proprietors
	  <lb/>are thoroughgoing business men. It has now a population of
	  <lb/>1300 inhabitants. Two churches have been built since I have
	  <lb/>been here; a theatre, (now burnt,) and a number of dwelling
	  <lb/>houses. It has now two printing offices—each publish a paper;
	  <lb/>sixteen stores; several commission merchants; auctioneer; a
	  <lb/>land office; and various other public offices, which draw num­
	  <lb/>bers of people from the country. They have a very fine fire en­
	  <lb/>gine, and a well regulated company. There are two acade­
	  <lb/>mies for young ladies; one for gentlemen, and several
	  <lb/>common schools. Great encouragement is given to the en­
	  <lb/>couragement of learning throughout the state. Every sixteenth
	  <lb/>section of land is set apart for the benefit of education,<anchor xml:id="a31" corresp="#n31" rend="post(*)"/> and
	  <lb/>provision is made by law for a university, which is soon to go
	  <lb/>into operation. There's your chance <persName>Mr. Black-Coats</persName>! They
	  <lb/>have a tolerable library; fine taverns; several Doggeries; twen­
	  <lb/>ty-one lawyers! and eight practising physicians!</p>
        <p>I mentioned to you the <placeName>Huntsville Spring</placeName>. The citizens
	  <lb/>of <placeName>Huntsville</placeName> are now employed in collecting the water which
	  <lb/>flows from it into a canal; this canal is to have five locks, and
	  <lb/>to communicate with <placeName>Indian Creek</placeName>, which is navigable to the
	  <lb/>river.</p>
        <p>Few places combine more blessings than <placeName>Huntsville</placeName>; and
	  <lb/>not a town in the world, perhaps, in proportion to its popula­
	  <lb/>tion, except <placeName>Florence</placeName>, has more wealth, more talent, more
	  <lb/>taste, more hospitality, mirth and gaiety, than <placeName>Huntsville</placeName>. The
	  <lb/>ladies of <placeName>Huntsville</placeName>, distance every thing in costliness of
	  <lb/>their dress; nor do I like their manners so well as I do the
	  <lb/>manners of the <placeName>Florence</placeName> ladies. They are always in the streets.
	  <lb/>But they are beautiful women, and very familiar. The young
	  <lb/>gentlemen are rather better informed; are gay and lively;
<pb n="153"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="20(1)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">153</mw>
	  <lb/>play and sing well. They often go out serenading, and have
	  <lb/>a <name>Thespian</name> society, who entertain the citizens at stated peri­
	  <lb/>ods; to these are added balls and cotillion parties. I shall 
	  <lb/>remain here till I hear from <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, and shall then pay a
	  <lb/>visit to <placeName>Blakely</placeName>, to see <persName>Mrs. Biern</persName>, formerly <persName>Kitty Davis</persName>, 
	  <lb/>whom I partly raised. You recollect her—<persName>Mr. Caperton</persName> is
	  <lb/>dead, and she is married to a <persName>Mr. Biern</persName>, and doing well.</p>
        <p>Respecting your last letter, you say, and very plausibly
	  <lb/>too, <said>No wonder the ignorant are prejudiced against learn­
	    <lb/>ing, when they see learned men inflicting every evil, cheating,
	    <lb/>defrauding, and oppressing the poor.</said> Aware of these objec­
	  <lb/>tions made, acted and done, to use your law phrases, I am
	  <lb/>ready to enter my rejoinder. The very reason you adduce to
	  <lb/>excuse the ignorant, is the reason I would advance against
	  <lb/>them. If their minds were improved, they would not become
	  <lb/>the dupes and victims of their learned neighbors. They
	  <lb/>would then be able to cope with him. If men of the best
	  <lb/>learning and parts often fall a sacrifice to the artful disguise
	  <lb/>which hypocracy and knavery put on, how then are the igno­
	  <lb/>rant to escape? If education was better attended to, it would
	  <lb/>greatly alleviate the evils of fraud and oppression. If a few,
	  <lb/>now and then, emerge from the night and ignorance, the great
	  <lb/>mass of the people are still the same. And this ignorance is to
	  <lb/>be our downfall. It strikes at the vitals of our liberty. It
	  <lb/>affects morally and politically, and the <emph>few</emph> are soon to rule the
	  <lb/><emph>many</emph>, instead of the many ruling the few. I would not,
	  <lb/>as some one said, have them all philosophers; but I would
	  <lb/>have them raised a little above the brute creation. I would
	  <lb/>have them know they were endowed with <emph>reason</emph>. I would
	  <lb/>have them know, this reason was bestowed on them as a guide
	  <lb/>to enable them to distinguish right from wrong—truth from
	  <lb/>falsehood—good from evil. I would have them know, that it is
	  <lb/>the cultivation of this reason alone that can secure to them its
	  <lb/>advantages. As a fertile field, without cultivation, produces
	  <lb/>nothing but noxious weeds, so our reason, without cultivation,
	  <lb/>is no more advantage to us in transacting the commom con­
	  <lb/>cerns of life, than if it were destitute of this glory of human

        </opener>
        <p><hi>This</hi> day, the anniversary of our beloved <persName>Washington</persName>,
	  <lb/>was ushered in with all manner of rejoicing. The star span­
	  <lb/>gled banner is now waving on the cupola, before my window,
	  <lb/>and an elegant ball is to conclude the day.</p>
        <p>While I sat in my window, with my eye on the flag, my
	  <lb/>mind was thrown back to the <name>Revolutionary War</name>; and whilst
	  <lb/>I gazed on this emblem of our liberty, I thought on the day that
	  <lb/>I first saw the colors of the then conflicting states: the occasion
	  <lb/>nor the date I do not now remember. But I well remember
	  <lb/>the brilliant striped flag. I was then a child, and lived in 
	  <lb/><placeName>Hannah's Town</placeName>, not far from <placeName>Pittsburg</placeName>. I was standing in
	  <lb/>the street one morning, with other little children, and happen­
	  <lb/>ing to turn my eyes in the direction of <placeName>Pittsburg</placeName>, I caught a 
	  <lb/>view of soldiers marching into the Town, their colours flying,
	  <lb/>and drums beating. I remember the order of the march—I re­
	  <lb/>member, too, that there were several women: but I am sorry
	  <lb/>I cannot tell how they came to visit <placeName>Hannah's Town</placeName>, or to pass
	  <lb/>through it, which they did. I never saw the <placeName>United States'</placeName> 
	  <lb/>colors since, that it does not recall that day! and the whole re­
	  <lb/>passes again before me, and with it all the sufferings of those
	  <lb/>trying times. I suffered all that human nature could bear,
	  <lb/>both with cold and hunger. Oh, ye wealthy of those times,
	  <lb/>little idea had ye of what the poor frontier settlers suffered.
	  <lb/>Often running for our lives to the forts, the <name>Indians</name> pursuing
	  <lb/>and shooting at us. At other times lying concealed in brush­
	  <lb/>wood, exposed to rain and snakes, for days and nights without
	  <lb/>food, and almost without clothes! We were one half of the 
<pb n="155"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="20(2)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">155</mw>
	  <lb/>time without salt or bread! pinned our scanty clothing with
	  <lb/>thorns; lived on nuts, bear's meat, and dried venison! All these
	  <lb/>things revive in my mind, and I love to dwell on them.</p>
        <p>The company are now marching before me, under arms,
	  <lb/>in a handsome uniform; they step light and graceful, and are
	  <lb/>tall fine looking men. Their captain, <persName>Howard</persName>, boards with
	  <lb/>me; I mean at the same house. He is just six feet in height,
	  <lb/>and one of the finest figures of them all, and has a martial
	  <lb/>look. He is a great favorite among the ladies, and is, doubt­
	  <lb/>less, to open the ball this evening with some of the fairest of 
	  <lb/>the fair.</p>
        <p>I board with <persName>Major Rose</persName>, the merry old veteran mention­
	  <lb/>ed some time back. He has met with a dreadful reverse of for­
	  <lb/>tune since I first saw him. He was then one of the first mer­
	  <lb/>chants in the place, but was overwhelmed in the general wreck,
	  <lb/>which prostrated so many of our merchants. But the Major
	  <lb/>is as merry as ever; keeps a tavern and boarding house; amuses
	  <lb/>himself with a pet crow; and sings <quote><persName>Jerry</persName> go Nimble.</quote> <persName>Mrs.
	    <lb/>Rose</persName>, too, bears her misfortunes like a philosopher. She is a
	  <lb/>mild, sensible woman, and the most benevolent of her sex.—
	  <lb/><persName>Captain Luke Howard</persName>, just mentioned, <persName>Mr. Tharp</persName>, and <persName>Mr.
	    <lb/>Wooldridge</persName>, and two <name>Italians</name>, are the only new acquaintance
	  <lb/>I have made. <persName>Captain Howard</persName>, is an <name>Irish</name> gentleman, highly
	  <lb/>polished, and breathes the very soul of philanthropy and feel­
	  <lb/>ing. Nature has showered her bounties on him liberally, and
	  <lb/>these are cultivated with great care and taste. He is the soul
	  <lb/>of music—performs well on the flute—sings a good song—is
	  <lb/>lively and facetious, which, united with a general knowledge
	  <lb/>of the world, renders him a most desirable companion. It ap­
	  <lb/>pears to me, that all the <name>Irish</name> who visit this country, are very
	  <lb/>different from any I ever saw with us. They have none of
	  <lb/>those habits of drinking, common to all I knew in other states.
	  <lb/>These are perfect gentlemen and men of business. <persName>Mr. Tharp</persName>
	  <lb/>is a neat, pleasant young man, with the sweetest temper in the
	  <lb/>world; though he conceives he is <emph>mighty</emph> ill sometimes, and it
	  <lb/>is amusing enough to hear <persName>Mr. Howard</persName> quizzing, and advising
	  <lb/>him to make his will. I sometimes advise him to marry, and
	  <lb/>this seems to agree with his malady, better than <persName>Howard's</persName>

	  <lb/>prescription. I think he will take my advice. <persName>Mr. Wool­
	    <lb/>dridge</persName> is a lawyer, next door, retiring, learned and modest.—
	  <lb/>He is little known in <placeName>Huntsville</placeName>. He is a man of reading,
	  <lb/>taste and abilities, and one of the most amiable and polite.—
	  <lb/>But the <name rend="slant(italic)">Italians</name>—they are brothers, and seem to belong to a
	  <lb/>different species of the human race. They have fine full fea­
	  <lb/>tures, round faces, and dark complexions. Their eyes and
	  <lb/>hair are jet black. But such eyes belong to no other nation—
	  <lb/>they sparkle like diamonds. Their manners and dispositions,
	  <lb/>likewise, differ from those of any people, or nation, I have seen.
	  <lb/>They are men of rich imaginations, very gay and lively in con­
	  <lb/>versation, and philanthropy itself. Their company is court­
	  <lb/>ed by all.</p>

	  <lb/>You have heard and read of tornadoes.  We had the most
	  <lb/>dreadful tornado, last week, that was ever<choice><sic>y</sic><corr/></choice> known in this
	  <lb/>country. The ravages of this dreadful calamity was confined
	  <lb/>to a ridge of high poor land, the nearest part of which, is about
	  <lb/>three miles from hence, though we had a severe gale here, the
	  <lb/>hardest by far I ever witnessed. It prostrated every thing be­
	  <lb/>fore it in its career, trees, houses, fences, all raised to the
	  <lb/>foundation. Trees were said to be carried fifteen miles, twist­
	  <lb/>ed and split to atoms, and though strange, no lives were lost;
	  <lb/>most of the people were bruised and mangled, and lying on the
	  <lb/>ground, unable to disengage themselves from the fallen trees
	  <lb/>and houses; some with broken legs, some with broken arms,
	  <lb/>and all more or less injured, excepting one man and a few
	  <lb/>children. There they lay, and the rain pouring on them in
	  <lb/>torrents, and as dark as <placeName>Egypt</placeName>. It happened a little before

	  <lb/>midnight. By daylight, next morning, their situation being

	  <lb/>horseback came into <placeName>Huntsville</placeName>, for surgeons, doctors, and
	  <lb/>assistance of every sort, as their clothing, and every atom they
	  <lb/>had in their houses were blown off, and never seen afterwards.
	  <lb/>Numbers jumped on their horses, doctors and all, and fled with
	  <lb/>the utmost speed to the sufferers; and amongst the foremost of
	  <lb/>these were the <persName>Sonano's</persName>, the Italian gentlemen. But in their
	  <lb/>haste they did not forget to take clothes, money, wine, biscuit,
	  <lb/>coffee, sugar, and tea; and these are <name>Roman Catholics</name>, who
	  <lb/>have been stigmatized as worse than the d—l. You will ex­
	  <lb/>pect to hear that the christian went, I mean those professing
	  <lb/>religion. No such thing. <persName>Howard</persName> was sick, but he sent them
	  <lb/>money and food, and he is another <name>Roman Catholic</name>. But you 
	  <lb/>have not heard the worst of it yet. Word was soon brought
	  <lb/>in, that there were twenty-one persons in all wounded, with­
	  <lb/>out food and clothing, and houseless—many of them widows
	  <lb/>and orphans<anchor xml:id="a32" corresp="#n32" rend="post(*)"/>—a subscription was instantly set on foot, for
	  <lb/>their relief, and a paper carried round. Now, you would sup­
	  <lb/>pose that a <name>Turk</name> would not refuse relief in such a case; and
	  <lb/>you would suppose right: but do not imagine the professors
	  <lb/>subscribed—with the exception of one or two. When the pa­
	  <lb/>per was handed to them, they said <said>There were so many,
	    <lb/>they could not help all; and it was not adviseable to help any
	    <lb/>unless they gave all some!!!</said> One of these, a wealthy mer­
	  <lb/>chant, was the most abominable iron souled man in the world—
	  <lb/>a presbyterian elder, by the name, I think, of 
	  <persName xml:id="a33" corresp="#n33" rend="post(†)">Hilton</persName>, and used
	  <lb/>to make long prayers. What do you think of this sample of
	  <lb/>professors, as they are called?</p>
        <p>I conversed with one of these sufferers, and inquired what
	  <lb/>were her sensations during the storm; and how she felt when
	  <lb/>carried away before it. She replied, that the storm was very
	  <lb/>sudden, and from the noise of crashing timber, thunder, and
	  <lb/>the dreadful roaring, she concluded she was to meet instant
	  <lb/>death. She had three children, and covering the two eldest in

	  <lb/>the bed, as she thought, for the last time, she took her babe in
	  <lb/>her arms, and crept under the bed, and resigned herself to the
	  <lb/>will of her maker. This is the last thing she remembered.—
	  <lb/>Upon regaining her senses, she was over an hundred yards
	  <lb/>from the place where the house had stood, with one of the logs
	  <lb/>of the house lying on her, and her leg broke. Her babe was
	  <lb/>lying near her, with a log across its neck, but did not touch the
	  <lb/>child, as it rested on the other timber. Her other two children
	  <lb/>were within a few steps of her, unhurt. She heard them talk­
	  <lb/>ing to each other, and could see them very plain by the flash­
	  <lb/>es of lightning. One man, an overseer, was very commodious­
	  <lb/>ly carried off in his bed, bedstead, and all, just as he lay, and
	  <lb/>put down about fifty yars off, and the first he knew of it was
	  <lb/>the rain pouring on him. He was in an upper story, which
	  <lb/>alone was blown off. These tornadoes must be more terrible
	  <lb/>than any storm at sea.</p>
        <p>I have been told by those who have witnessed them by
	  <lb/>daylight, that the sky suddenly becomes black, after a still
	  <lb/>clear atmosphere—the winds then follow so quick, it is impos­
	  <lb/>sible to escape. Their ravages are generally confined to a
	  <lb/>narrow straight line, of different lengths. The one above de­
	  <lb/>scribed, was about 50 miles long, and not exceeding one quar­
	  <lb/>ter or one half a mile in breadth. No one can give a clear
	  <lb/>description of these sweeping desolations, for the darkness,
	  <lb/>dust, &amp;c. they occasion, and, above all, the total absense of
	  <lb/>the senses. I did not go to see the one above, but I saw the
	  <lb/>effects of one in <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>, which must have been moderate, as
	  <lb/>it was not more than five or six hundred yards wide; but it
	  <lb/>levelled every tree to the earth. Some of these trees were the
	  <lb/>largest of the forest, and uniformly lay with their tops one way.
	  <lb/>I should suppose the noise alone would <emph>stun</emph> any one to death,
	  <lb/>as it must exceed the united artillery of heaven and earth! And
	  <lb/>here follows another of the wonders.</p>
        <p>In this county (<placeName>Madison</placeName>) there is a stone, called the mad­
	  <lb/>dog stone, which effectually cures the bite of a mad dog, and
	  <lb/>all poisonous snakes. It is said to be about the size of a wal­
	  <lb/>nut, and porus, like a honey comb. This stone is applied to
	  <lb/>the wound, where it sticks fast, until the pores become full,	  
<pb n="159"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="20(4)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">159</mw>
	  <lb/>when it drops off of itself. It is then washed in warm milk and
	  <lb/>water, and again applied to the wound, when it sticks, as at
	  <lb/>first, and so on, until the poison is extracted, when it will
	  <lb/>stick no longer. The man who owns it, lives about twenty
	  <lb/>miles from hence, and receives no compensation for the use of
	  <lb/>the stone; nor will he sell it. I have not been able to trace its
	  <lb/>history, thought I saw several who have been cured by it. I
	  <lb/>am told there is one similar to it in <placeName>East Virginia</placeName>. I should
	  <lb/>think them of more value than the most costly diamonds.</p>
        <p>But I have still stranger news for you. I have never
	  <lb/>heard a word on the subject of politics, or tea parties, since I 
	  <lb/>have been in this country! I mean the two great parties, <name>Fe­
	    <lb/>deral</name> and <name>Republican</name>—for this good substantial reason—there
	  <lb/>are no parties here—they are all <name>Republicans</name>. The country
	  <lb/>people, and very few of the city, know the meaning of the word
	  <lb/><name rend="slant(italic)">Federalist</name>! Nor have I heard of a tea party, in the whole coun­
	  <lb/>try. No such thing, as <quote>will you come and spend the even­
	    <lb/>ing?</quote> They visit each other without ceremony, morning, noon,
	  <lb/>and night, and are invited to await breakfast, dinner, and
	  <lb/>supper; but no such thing as that bane of society, a <quote>Tea
	    <lb/>party.</quote></p>
        <p>As some amends for the terrible, (to make a <name>Jay's treaty</name>
	  <lb/>of it,) in the first of this letter, I must relate an amusing an­
	  <lb/>ecdote, at which I have laughed enough. During the <name>Creek</name>
	  <lb/>war, (not long since,) some mischievous ill disposed man, re­
	  <lb/>ported that there was a large body of <name>Indians</name> within a day's
	  <lb/>march of <placeName>Huntsville</placeName>, coming to take the town. The citizens
	  <lb/>of <placeName>Huntsville</placeName>, and the whole of <placeName>Madison county</placeName>, were instantly
	  <lb/>panic struck, and immediately flew towards <placeName>Nashville</placeName>. Some
	  <lb/>left their calves fastened up in the pens, and some their horses
	  <lb/>in the stable, some their horses in the plow; most of them tak­
	  <lb/>ing their flight on foot. Others, again, mounted their horses,
	  <lb/>without saddles or bridles. Of these were four young ladies
	  <lb/>on one horse, riding like gentlemen, without saddle or bridle,
	  <lb/>and making good speed by applying their heels to the horses
	  <lb/>sides!!! One man took another man's child, and left his own.
	  <lb/>In one place would be seen ladies on foot, running with their
	  <lb/>night caps on, and no bonnet; and in another, husbands riding,
<pb n="160"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="20(4)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">160</mw>
	  <lb/>and wives walking. Some of the women mistook other men
	  <lb/>for their husbands, and some husbands mistook other men's
	  <lb/>wives for theirs. One stout fat woman, though she had horses
	  <lb/>and slaves in abundance, picked up her youngest child, and
	  <lb/>taking it in her arms, on foot outstripped every man and horse
	  <lb/>in company! Indeed, it is said a gentleman even left his
	  <lb/>sweetheart! He could not have been a <name>Kentuckian</name> or a <name>Ten­
	    <lb/>nesseean</name>, as they never desert the ladies. The fat lady, how­
	  <lb/>ever, walked twenty-five miles, without halting, when one of
	  <lb/>her slaves overtook her, having outran his fellow servants—
	  <lb/>They were now near <placeName>Fayetteville</placeName>. The lady inquired <said>what
	    <lb/>news?</said> <said>Oh, bad news enough, Missee.</said> <said>Are the <name>Indians</name>
	    <lb/>coming?</said> <said>Oh, yes, Missee! When I got 'pon top dat big
	    <lb/>hill you see da, Missee, I look back, and see most hundred
	    <lb/>comin long, wid da guns.</said> The lady gave him the child, and
	  <lb/>mended her pace. Not long after this, as she trudged through
	  <lb/>the mud, with petticoats tucked up, the negro cried out,
	  <lb/><said>Yonder da comes now, Missee!</said> Her face which was scar­
	  <lb/>let red, now became deadly pale; but she was afraid to take
	  <lb/>time to look at her foes, as she supposed them to be. At
	  <lb/>length, five or six of her own <emph>neighbors</emph> hailed her, and told
	  <lb/>her the whole was a false alarm.</p>
        <p>About a thousand people were on the road to <placeName>Nashville</placeName>,
	  <lb/>and were within a day's journey of that place before they were
	  <lb/>undeceived. Only two families remained in <placeName>Huntsville</placeName>.—
	  <lb/>These barricaded the door of the <name>Court House</name>, which served
	  <lb/>them for a fort; and old <persName>Captain Wyatt</persName>, the father of <persName>Major
	    <lb/>Wyatt</persName>, of <placeName>Melton's Bluff</placeName>, assumed the command. He had
	  <lb/>but two guns, but being well charged with whiskey and cour­
	  <lb/>age, he kept up a constant fire, crying out, <said>by two's, fire!</said>
	  <lb/>Spang, spang, went the two guns; and being instantly reload­
	  <lb/>ed, he would raise his voice to the highest pitch again, and
	  <lb/>give the word, <said>by two's, fire!</said> Thus he went on till day­
	  <lb/>light; and at the same time there was not an hostile <name>Indian</name>
	  <lb/>within an hundred miles.</p>

        <p><hi>Well</hi>, <persName>Matt</persName>, what shall I give you now? It is so long
	  <lb/>since I wrote to you, that I forgot what I last said. If I re­
	  <lb/>collect right, I have, upon the whole, entertained you with a
	  <lb/>little of every thing, except love; and I confess I do not know
	  <lb/>how to write upon that subject; and yet, how easy it appears to 
	  <lb/>be to most people. But I can give you a little upon hatred.</p>
        <p>I have often mentioned the great wealth of this place.—
	  <lb/>Here are <persName>Colonel Leroy Pope</persName>, <persName>General Brayhan</persName>, <persName>Doctor
	    <lb/>Fern</persName>, <persName>Doctor Chambers</persName>, <persName>Doctor Manning</persName>, 
	  <persName>Thomas Bibb</persName>, Esq.
	  <lb/>and a score or two besides, that are rich as princes, and are
	  <lb/>stigmatized, by a few of the vicious, by the appellation of no­
	  <lb/>bility! If by this designation, they mean the performance
	  <lb/>of noble actions, which is really the origin of the word, they
	  <lb/>could not better apply the term. But I am inclined to think,
	  <lb/>in the present instance, it is used by way of contempt. But
	  <lb/>let envy alone. Only because these people, by their own fore­
	  <lb/>sight and industry, laid out their money in the right time,
	  <lb/>and at the right place, instead of spending it in taverns and
	  <lb/>gambling houses, they have drawn down upon them the envy
	  <lb/>of little minds, who never did a generous act in their lives.—
	  <lb/>But what do you think of <persName>Doctor Manning</persName>, the greatest plan­
	  <lb/>ter in the state, but one—and him I know nothing of: he living
	  <lb/>in <placeName>Laurence county</placeName>, over the river. <persName>Doctor Manning</persName>, this
	  <lb/>year, has <emph>seven hundred and sixty acres</emph> in cultivation; and
	  <lb/><persName>Doctor Chambers</persName>, and a dozen others, very little behind
	  <lb/>him!</p>
        <p>The merchants, in other states, hold the farmers in vassal­
	  <lb/>age—but, here, the merchant is held in subjection by the plan­
	  <lb/>ter. The planter does not ship his own cotton: this is done
	  <lb/>by the merchant, and at his own risk. The planter delivers
	  <lb/>it at the gin, and has no more to do with it. The merchant
	  <lb/>is glad to get it at the planter's own price, as he has no other
	  <lb/>way to pay for his goods, in <placeName>New York</placeName>, where the money of
	  <lb/>this country will not pass.</p>

        <mw type="pageNum">162</mw>
        <p>The merchant goes to market but once a year. The usu­
	  <lb/>al mode of transportation for goods is to wagon them to <placeName>Pitts­
	    <lb/>burg</placeName>, and thence down the <placeName>Ohio</placeName>, and up the <placeName>Cumberland</placeName> and 
	  <lb/><placeName>Tennessee rivers</placeName>. Groceries are laid in at <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>.</p>
        <p>It is in contemplation, I am told, to establish a mercantile
	  <lb/>house at <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>, or some point in these states, to im­
	  <lb/>port direct from <placeName>Liverpool</placeName>.</p>
        <p>Through the politeness of <persName>Colonel Pope</persName>, I obtained the fol­
	  <lb/>lowing intelligence, which I send as I received it in a let­
	  <lb/>ter:</p>

                  <p rend="pre(“)post()">I beg leave to apologize to you for not answering your let­
		    <lb/>ter sooner, which I had the pleasure of receiving some days ago.
		    <lb/>My absence from home was the cause of this neglect. I re­
		    <lb/>gret much that it is not in my power to furnish you such infor­
		    <lb/>mation, on all your inquiries, as would be of interest to your­
		    <lb/>self, or others. On such of your inquiries as I am able to an­
		    <lb/>swer with any degree of correctness, I will do with pleasure.
		    <lb/>Your first question—The quantity of cotton raised in <placeName>Madison</placeName>,
		    <lb/>the last three years? From the best information that I have
		    <lb/>been able to obtain, and which I think is pretty correct, there
		    <lb/>has been raised about fourteen thousand bales, annually, the
		    <lb/>last three years, being in the total weight, about fourteen mil­
		    <lb/>lions two hundred thousand pounds; the average price I con­
		    <lb/>ceive may be fairly said to have been twelve and an half cents
		    <lb/>per pound, making the total sum, annually, in this article ship­
		    <lb/>ped from the county of <placeName>Madison</placeName>, five hundred and twenty-five
		    <lb/>thousand dollars. The quantity of land cultivated in this arti­
		    <lb/>cle is about sixteen thousand eight hundred acres, which pro­
		    <lb/>duces upon an average, one thousand pounds of seed cotton
		    <lb/>per acre, and from five to six acres cultivated to the hand.—
		    <lb/>The use made of the cotton seed after it is ginned, is various:
		    <lb/>some make manure of them, for which they answer a good
		    <lb/>purpose; some feed horned cattle, and if properly prepared, it
		    <lb/>is excellent food for stock of that description; and sheep will
		    <lb/>eat them freely. The carriage from here to <placeName>Tuscaloosa</placeName> varies,
		    <lb/>it is from two to four dollars per hundred weight. With re­

        <p>Since this communication, I have received the receipts of
	  <lb/>shipments of cotton for this year, which amounts to upwards
	  <lb/>of two millions of dollars, from all the counties bordering on 
	  <lb/>the <placeName>Tennessee river</placeName>!!!</p>
        <p>There is a country for you. All, except <placeName>Madison</placeName>, was in
	  <lb/>woods two years ago. I have known cotton to bring <emph>twenty
	    <lb/>five cents</emph>; but <persName>Colonel Pope</persName> gives the average. Would you
	  <lb/>believe it? The people are leaving this beautiful country, and
	  <lb/>going, some to <placeName>Texas</placeName>, some to <placeName>Missouri</placeName>, and some to <placeName>Red
	    <lb/>River</placeName>, and others, the plague knows where. But if they find a
	  <lb/>handsomer, or richer country, I am much mistaken.</p>
        <p>The rapid growth of vegetables would astonish you. Go
	  <lb/>into a garden one day, and the next you would scarcely know
	  <lb/>the same. I have never been more surprized at this rapid
	  <lb/>growth.</p>
        <p>In the common way we had strawberries and peas the last
	  <lb/>week in <name>April</name>. <name>Irish</name> potatoes and snaps, first week in <name>May</name>.
	  <lb/>Early York's, and cucumbers the last day of <name>May</name>; and on the
	  <lb/>same day, a summer turnip that measured seven and an half 
	  <lb/>inches round. This being near the northern boundary, I am
	  <lb/>told they are two weeks earlier to the south. But no country
	  <lb/>can excel in fruit. You may sit down in one place in the
	  <lb/>gardens, and gather half a bushel of strawberries. The wild
	  <lb/>fruit, such as plumbs, &amp;c. are as delicious as our tame fruits.
	  <lb/>The woods and pra<choice><sic/><corr>i</corr></choice>ries abound with all sorts of fruit, and
	  <lb/>they have, it is said, the true Muscodine grape: I have
	  <lb/>seen and eat them. They are larger than our Fox grapes,
	  <lb/>and of a greenish color. They grow in profusion on all the
	  <lb/>rivers, upon a large vine, which runs to the top of the tallest
	  <lb/>trees. Ten bushels at the least might be gathered from one
	  <lb/>tree; and were it not for the overflowing abundance of other
	  <lb/>good things, I am certain, though I never heard it mentioned,
	  <lb/>these grapes would make good wine.</p>

        <p>You have often heard said, <said>Oh, that <placeName>Alabama</placeName>, is so hot,
	    <lb/>I could not live there; and it is so sickly, too.</said> What abom­
	  <lb/>inable fools. It is much warmer there (<placeName>West Virginia</placeName>) than 
	  <lb/>here, in summer; and why? Because our days here are much 
	  <lb/>shorter—Even a goose knows this. Again, we have a pleas­
	  <lb/>ant breeze through summer here, which sets in a little after
	  <lb/>sunrise, every fair day, and blows till sundown. Our nights
	  <lb/>in summer are long, in proportion as the days are short; it is
	  <lb/>therefore cool and pleasant. It is, however, sultry in cloudy
	  <lb/>weather, as there is then no breeze. But I have never seen
	  <lb/>the Thermometer, in summer, here, as high as it is where you
	  <lb/>live.</p>
        <p>You recollect your old school mate, <persName>Doctor Erskine</persName>: he
	  <lb/>lives here, and has become wealthy. He married, sometime
	  <lb/>since, the beautiful <persName>Miss Russel</persName>, and has one child. The
	  <lb/>Doctor is highly respected in <placeName>Huntsville</placeName>, both as a gentleman
	  <lb/>and a physician; and has handsome practice. He rides in his
	  <lb/>carriage, and ranks with the first men in the place. Almost
	  <lb/>every one rides in carriages here—very few are ever seen on
	  <lb/>horseback.</p>
        <p>With all these blessings, however, we have a few curses;
	  <lb/>and one of them is slavery! Not that the slaves are treated
	  <lb/>bad. If we except the total neglect, on the part of their owners,
	  <lb/>to enlighten their minds, they live as well as their masters; and
	  <lb/>are by no means hard tasked. But they are the most immoral
	  <lb/>and cruel brutes in the world. One shrinks with horror at
	  <lb/>their barbarity to poor innocent brutes. I never have looked
	  <lb/>into the streets, since I have been here, but I see those brutal
	  <lb/>negroes torturing and wounding poor innocent cats, dogs,
	  <lb/>hogs, or oxen, and no one interferes to prevent it. The white
	  <lb/>people do not see it, as they are seasoned to it by habit, and
	  <lb/>appear as callous as the brutes themselves. I have (but it is
	  <lb/>almost too shocking to relate) seen cats lying with their backs
	  <lb/>broke, for two days at a time, in the street, and when I en­
	  <lb/>treated these ruffians to kill them, to put them out of their misery,
	  <lb/>they burst into a laugh in my face. A curse must fall on a land
	  <lb/>so lost to feeling. Those innocent creatures were given to us
	  <lb/>for our use, and not to glut a worse than savage disposition.

	  <lb/>And yet, these negroes are very pious. They have two church­
	  <lb/>es, and prayer meetings every night. There were seven fights
	  <lb/>here, between negroes, near the doors of their churches.</p>
        <p>We went to hear a Missionary preach the other night,
	  <lb/>and he collected a large sum, several hundred dollars, to con­
	  <lb/>vert the Heathen.<anchor xml:id="a34" corresp="#n34" rend="post(*)"/> What a burlesque. Where are greater
	  <lb/>Heathens to be found, than these negroes. There is a great
	  <lb/>deal of preaching here; and a great many ill natured remarks
	  <lb/>pass between the presbyterians and methodists; but whether it
	  <lb/>be to determine which shall save most souls, or receive most
	  <lb/>money, I am too ignorant to discover. I hope that the one or
	  <lb/>the other may take those in hand. They need not go far for

        <p>From what I have heard, it appears the methodists have
	  <lb/>braved every danger, and preached to the people gratis, in the
	  <lb/>settling of the country; and now that there is no danger, and
	  <lb/>the people have become wealthy, those sly fellows, the presby­
	  <lb/>terians, are creeping in to reap the harvest. But the metho­
	  <lb/>dists have a great advantage, in point of talent, many of them
	  <lb/>being the best orators in the country. But they all draw too
	  <lb/>many women after them, in my humble opinion.</p>

        <head type="sub">Inauguration of <persName>President Jackson</persName>.</head>
        <p><hi>While</hi> I was yet in <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>, various were the re­
	  <lb/>ports of <persName>General Jackson</persName>. Some said he was coming this way,
	  <lb/>and some that. One paper stated that a splendid carriage and
	  <lb/>four white horses, sent by the state of <placeName>New York</placeName>, was to meet
	  <lb/>him at <placeName>Wheeling</placeName>. And, again, that the horses and driver, (as
	  <lb/>horses I presume would not go of their own accord,) and fine
	  <lb/>carriage, were to be furnished by <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>; and some again
	  <lb/>by <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>. At length, however, the General arrived in his
	  <lb/>own plain carriage, and reached <placeName>Gadsby's</placeName> before any one was
	  <lb/>aware of his presence in the District.</p>
        <p>It is said that several big guns were stationed on the
	  <lb/>heights of <placeName>George Town</placeName>, to welcome his arrival; and notwith­
	  <lb/>standing they were well manned, by staunch <placeName>Bladensburg</placeName>-men,
	  <lb/>they suffered him to pass without saluting him. It appears he
	  <lb/>came <emph>in</emph> an hour or two earlier than was expected. As soon 
	  <lb/>as it was known he had arrived, hundreds flocked to welcome
	  <lb/>him, with stout hearts, insted of stout guns; and so great was
	  <lb/>the throng, that the passage to his door was completely block­
	  <lb/>ed up. Excepting the arrival of <persName>General La Fayette</persName>, perhaps
	  <lb/>no occasion ever drew more people together, than the arrival 
	  <lb/>of <persName>General Jackson</persName>, at this period. Thus it continued while
	  <lb/>he remained at the tavern. It is said he was fatigued nearly
	  <lb/>to death, in receiving and returning the salutations of his
	  <lb/>friends.</p>
        <p>I had seen <persName>General Jackson</persName> in <placeName>Alabama</placeName>, and in this
	  <lb/>country, and though an admirer and well wisher of his, I did

<mw type="pageNum">170</mw>
	  <lb/>not intrude upon him. <said>Have you not been to see the Gene­
	    <lb/>ral, yet? You ought to go.</said> Another would say, <said>Why, is
	    <lb/>it possible, you have not been to see the General?</said> Such was
	  <lb/>the fever, and thus it continued, old and young, rich and poor,
	  <lb/>all crowded round him, leaving him scarcely time for repose
	  <lb/>or refreshment.</p>
        <p>At length the <date when="--03-04" rend="slant(italic)">Fourth of <name>March</name></date> arrived: and to grace the
	  <lb/>occasion, I purchased a new dress, at the aggregate of two dol­
	  <lb/>lars, and walked to the Capitol, at an early hour, as it was
	  <lb/>presumed seats would be scarce.</p>
        <p>It being a fair day, to gratify the people who had been
	  <lb/>literally pouring into the City for several days, to witness the
	  <lb/>Inauguration, the <orgName>Committee of Arrangements</orgName> had resolved the
	  <lb/>ceremony should take place in the <name>East Portico</name> of the Capitol,
	  <lb/>so that the crowd, which no building could hold, might be
	  <lb/>gratified. This arrangement was made, that those within the
	  <lb/>Capitol, as well as those without, might have an equal chance
	  <lb/>to see and hear. This was the calculation. But, doubtless, no
	  <lb/>arrangement was more completely defeated. Excepting a par­
	  <lb/>cel of boys, black people, and those who had the good fortune
	  <lb/>to mix with them, and stand up on the square in front of the 
	  <lb/>Capitol, the Inauguration was a perfect blank.</p>
        <p>When I arrived at the Capitol, which was long before
	  <lb/>the hour, I stepped out on the platform to see the preparations,
	  <lb/>and found my friend, <persName>Senator Smith</persName>, of <placeName>Maryland</placeName>, giving di­
	  <lb/>rections to the men who were spreading carpets, and placing
	  <lb/>chairs and settees for the Judges of the <name>Supreme Court</name>. Fo­
	  <lb/>reign Ministers, and other high and mighty characters. As
	  <lb/>I considered myself one of the latter, and was taking notes, I
	  <lb/>merely asked my friend <persName>Smith</persName> where the President was to
	  <lb/>stand. <said>Oh, go away <persName>Mrs. R.</persName>; don't interrupt us; don't you
	    <lb/>see I have been appointed by the <orgName>Senate</orgName> to make the arrange­
	    <lb/>ments.</said> I saw it, to-be-sure, but I was not prepared to see he
	  <lb/>had studied his part so well. But I did not take it ill in my
	  <lb/>friend <persName>Smith</persName>, as he was a friend to me in the hour of need, and
	  <lb/>I shall never forget him; and so I put it in my notes.</p>
        <p>Looking up, I beheld <persName>Colonel Towson</persName> at the other end,
	  <lb/>directing the men also in placing the seats, he, also, being one
<pb n="171"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="22(2)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">171</mw>
	  <lb/>of the <name>Committee of Arrangements</name>. The Colonel saluted me
	  <lb/>with great gallantry, and took me under his protection, but
	  <lb/>a hundred Colonels would have found it impossible to protect
	  <lb/>my toes that day against hostile feet, which in the end was
	  <lb/>verified.</p>
        <p><persName>President Adams</persName> has called a session of the new <orgName>Senate</orgName>,
	  <lb/>upon his retiring from office, to enable his successor to appoint
	  <lb/>his cabinet, and perform other Executive business. The new
	  <lb/><orgName>Senate</orgName> met about 11 o'clock, in the <name>Senate Chamber</name>, to be sworn
	  <lb/>in. I had selected a seat convenient to the door, behind the
	  <lb/>bar of the <orgName>Senate</orgName>, so that I could step at once into the portico.</p>
        <p>The lobby round the bar, was exclusively reserved for 
	  <lb/>the ladies and such Members of <orgName>Congress</orgName> as might choose to
	  <lb/>attend. The gallery, which has been made entirely new,
	  <lb/>during the summer, was also filled with ladies. All this
	  <lb/>being understood, I amused myself in conversing with my
	  <lb/>friends, awaiting the arrival of <persName>General Jackson</persName>, the Judges,
	  <lb/>and the Foreign Ministers, for all of whom <persName>General Smith</persName>,
	  <lb/>and his colleagues had prepared seats, on the right and left of
	  <lb/>the chair. At length, the Foreign Ministers were announced,
	  <lb/>and <persName>General Smith</persName> met them at the door and conducted them
	  <lb/>to their seats, to the left of the chair, and very near my <name>Royal</name>
	  <lb/>self. Next came the Judges, and took their seats on the right
	  <lb/>of the chair; and, lastly, the President elect. The Ministers
	  <lb/>were covered with gold lace, I suspect;<anchor xml:id="a35" corresp="#n35" rend="post(*)"/> the Judges were
	  <lb/>dressed in black silk gowns—and <persName>General Jackson</persName> was
	  <lb/>the plainest dressed man in the Chamber. He was dressed in
	  <lb/>a suit of black, and with a cane in his hand he entered the
	  <lb/>Chamber. After taking off his hat, he bowed respectfully,
	  <lb/>and was conducted by <persName>General Smith</persName> to a seat in front of the
	  <lb/>chair, at the foot of the Foreign Ministers. He was thin and
	  <lb/>pale, and his hair, which was black when I first saw him, was
	  <lb/>now, almost white, and his countenance was melancholy. He
	  <lb/>showed no embarrassment, however, but surveyed the compa­
	  <lb/>ny with a mild and friendly aspect: sometimes resting upon
<pb n="172"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="22(2)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">172</mw>
	  <lb/>his cane, while every eye was bent upon him. Shortly after
	  <lb/>he entered, the new Senators, two or three at a time, stepped
	  <lb/>up to the chair, where the usual oath was administered, and
	  <lb/>they then resumed their seats. It yet wanted several minutes
	  <lb/>of twelve, and every one watched the clock, which is always
	  <lb/>kept in the <name>Senate Chamber</name>, with deep attention. Within a
	  <lb/>minute or two of the time, I arose and walked out to select an
	  <lb/>eligible place to witness the Inauguration. I did reach the
	  <lb/>door by hard squeezing; but such another sight baffles descrip­
	  <lb/>tion. Not only every seat, but every inch of the platform was
	  <lb/>crowded, by men, women and children. These had forced
	  <lb/>the guards, and taken possession. This was bad management,
	  <lb/>with all deference to the Honorable <name>Committee of Arrange­
	  <lb/>ments</name>. I was shoved and pushed from one place to another,
	  <lb/>squeezed, and betrampled; and at length wedged up, about an
	  <lb/>inch from the door: but as for moving backwards or forwards,
	  <lb/>it was out of the question. How the President, the Judges,
	  <lb/>Foreign Ministers, and Senators, &amp;c. got out of the <name>Senate
	    <lb/>Chamber</name>, I am at a loss to divine; for I saw nothing of the
	  <lb/>President, but the top of his head. The chairs, intended for
	  <lb/>the Honorables, were filled with women, standing on them, and 
	  <lb/>the whole appeared one mass of solid people. One half of
	  <lb/>those in the <name>Senate Chamber</name> were unable to get out.</p>
        <p>I had been watching an opportunity, and one offering, I
	  <lb/>squeezed my way back; nor did I hear one word of the Presi­
	  <lb/>dent's address; much less did I hear him take the oath.</p>
        <p>My only chance now, was to witness the procession on its
	  <lb/>return, and <persName>Senator Rowan</persName> advised me to go to the Library;
	  <lb/>but that, and all the rooms were fast locked. After wandering
	  <lb/>about, I found a messenger who unlocked a lower room, and
	  <lb/>I sat in the window, but was under promise to let no one else
	  <lb/>in, and to keep the door locked. The firing of the cannon,
	  <lb/>and the shouting of the multitude, soon proclaimed the new
	  <lb/>President; and shortly after this the crowd came thundering
	  <lb/>down the steps, and <persName>President Jackson</persName> appeared bare headed,
	  <lb/>leaning upon two gentlemen, one on each side, while he was
	  <lb/>followed by a dense crowd, who rent the air with shouts. The
	  <lb/>earth was literally, covered with people, who maintained
<pb n="173"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="22(3)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">173</mw>
	  <lb/>neither order nor regularity. Some ran, some walked, and
	  <lb/>some jumped the walls. The square, the Avenue, all was now
	  <lb/>all motion; and to have a better view, I ran up stairs to look
	  <lb/>out of some of the upper windows; and here I found a colored
	  <lb/>man in a violent passion. It appears he had been locked up.
	  <lb/><said>I was always for <persName>Jackson</persName>,</said> said 
	  <persName>Sambo</persName>, <said>but if this is the
	    <lb/>way, I wish <persName>Adams</persName> was President again. It's a great deal
	    <lb/>worser than when <persName>Adams</persName> was President. Here I have been
	    <lb/>locked up, and can neither see nor hear the naugaration. Ah!
	    <lb/>I am done with the <persName>Jackson</persName> people. It's fair tyranny—no
	    <lb/>freedom in this!</said> Being in nearly the same situation, I could
	  <lb/>not help feeling for <persName>Blackey</persName>; and after viewing the crowd some
	  <lb/>minutes, I stepped into the <name>Senate Chamber</name>, where <persName>Judge
	    <lb/>Story</persName> was reading the Inauguration Speech, which, I having
	  <lb/>listened to, I sought my way home, which was but a few steps
	  <lb/>distant; and if ever I am caught in such another crowd, while
	  <lb/>I live, it will be an accident.</p>
        <p>It would have been infinitely better to have had it in <name>Con­
	    <lb/>gress Hall</name>, for though it could not have contained the multi­
	  <lb/>tude; those who could have attended would have met with some
	  <lb/>satisfaction. As it was, there was none. So ended the Inaugu­
	  <lb/>ration.</p>
        <p>Not wishing to interrupt the nar<choice><sic/><corr>r</corr></choice>ative, I observed that the
	  <lb/>lobby around the bar was reserved for none but the ladies, and
	  <lb/>such Members of <orgName>Congress</orgName> as might find room. Whilst lean­
	  <lb/>ing over the bar, talking with some of the Senators, I happen­
	  <lb/>ed to look behind me, and who should have placed himself ex­
	  <lb/>actly in front of my seat, but <persName xml:id="a36" rend="slant(italic)post(*)" corresp="#n36">Boss Brown</persName>. Though the
	  <lb/>Members of <orgName>Congress</orgName> had the privilege of setting below, they
	  <lb/>generously resigned the seats round the bar to the ladies.—
	  <lb/>What then was my astonishment to find this insolent <name>Scotch</name>
	  <lb/>stone-cutter in possession of my seat!!! I ordered him away!
	  <lb/>I complained to the Senators in his hearing, upon which he
	  <lb/>condescended to move one side, with an insolent grin! And
	  <lb/>who is <persName>Boss Brown</persName>? Neither more nor less than a low, inso­
	  <lb/>lent, <name>Scotch</name> <name>presbyterian</name> stone-cutter, placed over the work­
	  <lb/>men, at the Capitol, by the Prince Regent, <persName>Elgar</persName>, and who
<pb n="174"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="22(3)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">174</mw>
	  <lb/>turns away every poor <name>American</name>, and employs insolent drunk­
	  <lb/>en foreigners; a rabble of insolent tories like himself, whilst
	  <lb/>the honest <name>American</name> is discarded. Thus <persName>Mr. Elgar</persName> rewards
	  <lb/>his country, for paying him 2,000 dollars per annum, and for
	  <lb/>lying down on his soft hair sofa, from day to day. I cannot
	  <lb/>tell how many sofas he has worn out, as they, with the chairs
	  <lb/>in ever part of the Capitol, all disappear when a little worn.<anchor xml:id="a37" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n37"/>
	  <lb/>Thus these foreign traitors are nurtured by our <emph>own</emph> traitors.
	  <lb/>Can <placeName>America</placeName> stand long upon such a foundation? Certainly
	  <lb/>not.</p>

        <p><hi>This</hi> subject, in order of time, ought to have preceeded 
	  <lb/>the Inauguration; but I shall be pardoned for paying that re­
	  <lb/>spect to the instalment of the President, which it deserves.—
	  <lb/>A slave to the public, as I am, it is impossible to do justice to
	  <lb/>any one subject, where the public are anticipating a little of
	  <lb/>every thing: nor will it give me time to look up from my pen,
	  <lb/>or partake of those amusements which are enjoyed by the
	  <lb/>meanest slave.</p>
        <p>One of the greatest sacrifices I am compelled to make, is
	  <lb/>the pleasure of attending the Debates of <orgName>Congress</orgName>, as no sub­
	  <lb/>ject on earth has afforded me more pleasure than public speak­
	  <lb/>ing.</p>
        <p>I snatched a few minutes, however, to look at the Mem­
	  <lb/>bers, having recovered from my lameness. I visited the gal­
	  <lb/>lery of the <orgName>Senate</orgName> first.</p>
        <p>The old gallery has been torn down, and replaced by ano­
	  <lb/>ther, more beautiful, and infinitely more convenient. I found
	  <lb/>the gallery much crowded by ladies and gentlemen—the latter,
	  <lb/>with most of the ladies, however, gave way, and finally depart­
	  <lb/>ed—but others were coming and going all the while.</p>

        <p>It is astonishing to witness the variety of character who
	  <lb/>crowd the Capitol, during the sessions. It is laughable to see
	  <lb/>awkward scrubs, running breathless into the Capitol, with as
	  <lb/>much anxiety painted on their countenances, as if their lives
	  <lb/>were at stake, or kingdoms to be won. Our ingenuous poet,
	  <lb/>(I am sorry I do not know him,) who has so often amused us
	  <lb/>with his inimitable pen, on the subject of <persName>Jonathan's</persName> visits,
	  <lb/>might inquire, <said>Did you ever go into the gallery?</said> They
	  <lb/>are always in a hurry. Come running into the Rotundo, with
	  <lb/>their muddy club shoes, first this way, and then that way, as
	  <lb/>though they were chaced by a bear. They salute the first one
	  <lb/>they meet, with <said>Mister, which is the gallery where people
	    <lb/>comes to hear the 'bates?</said> After obtaining an answer, off
	  <lb/>they run, up the stairs, puffing and blowing: and after looking
	  <lb/>down a minute or two, and tramping upon ladies fine dresses,
	  <lb/>and overthrowing their fine feathers, off they run, down the
	  <lb/>stairs, and through the Rotundo. <said>Where's that 'tother place,
	    <lb/>whar people comes? Oh, see them there pictures; an't they
	    <lb/>very queer, <persName>Jim</persName>? See, if there an't horses, and swords, and
	    <lb/>people. My stars! Mister, show us 'tother place;</said> meaning
	  <lb/>the gallery of the <orgName>House of Representatives</orgName>. One would think
	  <lb/>they would be satisfied by running a dozen times from one gal­
	  <lb/>lery to the other, in as many minutes, as though they were
	  <lb/>looking for something they had lost. But they keep it up, and
	  <lb/>go away, as it were, sadly disappointed. This is the case eve­
	  <lb/>ry day in the session; and <persName>Jock</persName> always carries his wagon whip
	  <lb/>in his hand, doubtless as capable of receiving amusement as
	  <lb/>himself. What a pity he could not drive his team and horses
	  <lb/>in too.</p>
        <p>But to return. The first thing that met my eye, was <persName>Mrs.
	    <lb/>Senator <hi rend="case(mixed)slant(italic)">Woodbury</hi></persName>, and her sister, both sisters of 
	  <persName>William Clap</persName>,
	  <lb/>Esquire, of <placeName>Portland</placeName>, <placeName>Maine</placeName>. Much gratified to see them, I
	  <lb/>took a seat by their side, to observe the Members, some of
	  <lb/>whom I noted in the Third volume of the <title>Black Book.</title>
	  <lb/>They were by no means so much appaled as upon my first vi­
	  <lb/>sit; as they viewed me from their seats as though I were a hu­
	  <lb/>man being, instead of having seven heads and ten horns—and
	  <lb/>to convince them of the fact, I began to handle my pencil.</p>

        <p>The first countenance I caught, was <persName>Senator

        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">S. A. Foot</hi></persName>, is quite a agreeable looking

	  <lb/>blue, and his countenance mild and steady. He is pleasant in
	  <lb/>his manners, and loses nothing by comparison with any mem­
	  <lb/>ber of the <orgName>Senate</orgName>. I was much pleased with the conversation
	  <lb/>of <persName>Mr. Ruggles</persName>—a pleasure I rarely have an opportunity to

	  <lb/>of talents and education. He certainly has a very sensible,

	  <lb/>opinion of him from his state. He has a large full face, a good
	  <lb/>set of features, and blue eyes. He is free and easy in his con­
	  <lb/>versation, and clear of the blues, so prevalent in <placeName>Vermont</placeName>.</p>
        <p><persName>Senator <hi rend="case(mixed)slant(italic)">Horatio Seymour</hi></persName>, also of 
	  <placeName>Vermont</placeName>, is a small man,
	  <lb/>likewise of middle age, round face, and dark complexion. His
	  <lb/>countenance is open and benevolent, and his manners friendly
	  <lb/>and pleasing. He is an uncle of my friend <persName>Captain Seymour</persName>,
	  <lb/>of <placeName>Vergennes</placeName>, <placeName>Vermont</placeName>. I should say 
	  <placeName>Vermont</placeName> was respecta­

        <p><persName>Senator <hi rend="case(mixed)slant(italic)">John Rowan</hi></persName>, of 
	  <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>, stands high in the es­
	  <lb/>teem of his country, not only as a statesman, but as a lawyer
	  <lb/>and a gentleman. I was long familiar with the celebrity of
	  <lb/><persName>Judge Rowan</persName>, and am proud to number him amongst my own
	  <lb/>countrymen of the West, though I never had the pleasure of
	  <lb/>seeing him before. The Judge is rather advanced in years,
	  <lb/>but has the remains of a fine manly person. He is a stout fi­
	  <lb/>gure, and must have been, indeed is now, one of the finest
	  <lb/>looking men of his day. His features, and countenance, at
	  <lb/>this day, are magnificently fine. His large full eye is shaded
	  <lb/>by a strong arched brow, and his manners are distinguished
	  <lb/>by an easy affability alike graceful and dignified. I am told
	  <lb/>(for I was intimate with his friends) he has the most amiable
	  <lb/>family of children in the western country. I once knew a
	  <lb/>daughter of <persName>Judge Rowan's</persName>, the pride of the western states;
	  <lb/>this was <persName>Mrs. Steel</persName>, whom I lament to learn is no more.</p>
        <p><persName>Senator <hi rend="case(mixed)slant(italic)">Samuel Bell</hi></persName>, of 
	  <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName>, like 
	  <persName>Judge Row­

	  <lb/>the <orgName>Senate</orgName>—has a fine showy person, and a perfect <name>Chester
	    <lb/>field</name> in his manners and dress. He is a tall and majestic figure,
	  <lb/>with a Grecian fair face, a bright gray eye, and keen counte­

        <p><persName>Senator <hi rend="case(mixed)slant(italic)">O. Prince</hi></persName>, of

        <p><persName>Senator <hi rend="case(mixed)slant(italic)">Henry H. Ridgely</hi></persName>, of 
	  <placeName>Delaware</placeName>, is also a man of
	  <lb/>princely manners, and elegant appearance. He is of middle
	  <lb/>age and a little gray. His face is fair and full, with a noble
	  <lb/>black eye, and great expression of countenance. I regret to 
	  <lb/>find this gentleman is not in the Twenty-first <orgName>Congress</orgName>. I
	  <lb/>trust they have not sent a missionary in his stead. <persName>Mr. Ridg­
	    <lb/><choice><sic>le</sic><corr>el</corr></choice>y</persName> was accompanied by his daughter, when I had the pleasure
	  <lb/>to see him. She is at once beautiful and accomplished—and

        <p><persName>Senator <hi rend="case(mixed)slant(italic)">Chambers</hi></persName>, likewise from 
	  <placeName>Maryland</placeName>—my country­
	  <lb/>man—I am sorry I cannot praise him. He is as gloomy as a
	  <lb/>Monk, or a missionary. And now I think of it, he is, doubt­
	  <lb/>less, a missionary. But I will try to keep out of his reach. I
	  <lb/>do not like his <quote><distinct>solemncholly</distinct></quote> countenance, as the girl said.
	  <lb/>He has a slim person, a slim face, a slim nose, and if I were to
	  <lb/>spend my opinion on him, I should pronounce him to have a 
	  <lb/>slim soul. Shocking! What a country I sprang from. I am
	  <lb/>ashamed of it. I rejoice I was carried out of it when I was
	  <lb/>young, or I should have had <quote>a slim chance,</quote> too.</p>
        <p><persName>Senator <hi rend="case(mixed)slant(italic)">Bouligny</hi></persName>, of 
	  <placeName>Louisiana</placeName>, was rather far off to dis­
	  <lb/>tinguish him minutely. I saw enough, however, to warrant
	  <lb/>the assertion, that <persName>Mr. Bouligny</persName> is beyond doubt one of the 
	  <lb/>most noble and majestic looking men in <orgName>Congress</orgName>. His visage
	  <lb/>and countenance, for intelligence and manly appearance, is
	  <lb/>certainly unrivalled.</p>
        <p><persName>Senator <hi rend="case(mixed)slant(italic)">Tyler</hi></persName>, of 
	  <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, is a fine looking man. He is
	  <lb/>very fair, with a high retreating forehead, Roman nose, and
	  <lb/>features of the best Grecian model. His eye is pearly blue,
	  <lb/>and his countenance is one of incomparable sweetness. If I
	  <lb/>was pleased with the appearance of Mr. Tyler, I was charmed
<pb n="179"/><milestone unit="sig" n="23(2)r"/><mw type="pageNum">179</mw><lb/>with that of <persName>Mrs.</persName> and <persName>Miss Tyler</persName>, particularly the latter. The
	  <lb/>little sylph, she stood behind me, when taking notes, the last
	  <lb/>day of the session, and in her own smoothe fascinating way,
	  <lb/>fairly beguiled me of my senses. Besides her, and <persName>Mrs. Tyler</persName>,
	  <lb/>there were one or two other ladies in the party, all of whom,
	  <lb/>for beauty of persons, and elegance of manners, greatly exceed
	  <lb/>any females I met with in <placeName>Washington</placeName>.</p>
        <p><persName>Senator <hi rend="case(mixed)slant(italic)">Tazewell</hi></persName>, of 
	  <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, I have mentioned in First
	  <lb/>volume of <title>Black Book.</title> He is denominated a great states­
	  <lb/>man, and one of the ablest members of the <orgName>Senate</orgName>. He certain­
	  <lb/>ly has a countenance indicative of wisdom and deep thinking.
	  <lb/>He is staid and stu<choice><sic/><corr>r</corr></choice>dy, and has the most profound look of any
	  <lb/>member present.</p>
        <p>When I first went to the <name>Senate Chamber</name>, I laid a few co­
	  <lb/>pies of the Third volume of the <title>Black Book,</title> on the desks
	  <lb/>of some of my friends. <persName>Mr. Secretary Lowrie</persName> picked up one,
	  <lb/>and slunk behind one of the columns. He opened the book ve­
	  <lb/>ry eagerly, but casting an eye towards me, he instantly laid it
	  <lb/>down—his soul not being equal to seventy-five cents.</p>
        <p>I had nearly forgot a rencounter with some upstart Fop,
	  <lb/>as I walked through the small Rotundo, fronting the <name>Senate
	    <lb/>Chamber</name>. <persName>Mr. Cravat</persName> was accompanied by a few <persName>Miss Os­
	    <lb/>trich Feathers</persName>; and although they saw I was old and lame,
	  <lb/>they kept the way; and the consequence was, that I ran against
	  <lb/>one of their Featherships. <said>Take care, Mam,</said> said <persName>Mr.
	    <lb/>Cravat</persName>, <said>Do you know these are ladies?</said> <said>I should think
	    <lb/>not; and I never give the way to Fops,</said> I replied. He look­
	  <lb/>ed back on me with great astonishment. It is lamentable to
	  <lb/>see the vast number of gaudy dressed women, who crowd the
	  <lb/>galleries, and even intrude upon the Members. It is enough
	  <lb/>to derange the ideas of the sedate white headed <persName>Tazewell</persName>.—
	  <lb/>Well might my friend <persName>John</persName> express his unwillingness to be
	  <lb/>under petticoat government. It is very evident these women
	  <lb/>only come to show themselves, or show their finery rather, as
	  <lb/>no woman of sense or taste would dress as they do. I find they
	  <lb/>are very unpopular with men of sense. They are a great hin­
	  <lb/>drance to public business too. Not satisfied with the galleries,
	  <lb/>they take possession of the floors, and are constantly getting

	  <lb/>up and sitting down; going out, and returning; and disturb
	  <lb/>the proceedings exceedingly. It is surprizing the <orgName>Senate</orgName> par­
	  <lb/>ticularly, do not resort to some measures to secure their quiet.
	  <lb/>With all their sense and wisdom, the <orgName>Senate</orgName> is often perplexed
	  <lb/>with deep and intricate discussions, and it is cruel to molest
	  <lb/>them. As for the <orgName>House of Representatives</orgName> as they are young­
	  <lb/>er men, they must be excused for a little gallantry towards the
	  <lb/>ladies—and were it any were else but a <name>Legislative Hall</name>, I 
	  <lb/>would excuse them myself. Of all places, except <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>
	  <lb/>and <placeName>Richmond</placeName>, the females of <placeName>Washington</placeName> dress the most
	  <lb/>abominable; the effect of tracts and preaching, doubtless, as
	  <lb/>there is an overflowing of both: And their gaudiness is only
	  <lb/>equalled by their ignorance.</p>

        <p><hi>Ah</hi>! here I am again! But, excepting the blue skins, some
	  <lb/>of whom pulled their hats over their faces, and others ran out,
	  <lb/>they are a fine looking set of men, and hailed me with pleasure.
	  <lb/>I had just published the Third volume of the <title>Black Book;</title><lb/>and as they were to rise in a few days, I laid the books on a 
	  <lb/>few of their desks. Most of them took them,<anchor xml:id="a40" corresp="#n40" rend="post(*)"/> and the balance
	  <lb/>were pilfered by the rabble, which infest the Hall, as messen­
	  <lb/>gers, &amp;c. I have at various times noticed several of the Mem­
	  <lb/>bers, but now, as always, I labored under great disadvantage,
	  <lb/>from distance and want of light.</p>
        <p>The first who caught my eye, was the <persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Charles
	    <lb/>A. Wickliffe</hi></persName>, of <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>, quite a young man, with a stout
	  <lb/>goodly person. His face is fair and handsome, with a fine gray
	  <lb/>eye, and easy elegant manners. He is a good speaker, and
	  <lb/>said to be an industrious attentive member.</p>

        <p><persName>Governor <hi rend="case(mixed)slant(italic)">Clark</hi></persName>, likewise a representative from 
	  <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>,
	  <lb/>is a pretty fine figure, large face, and manly generous counte­
	  <lb/>nance. This is the gentleman, who, with <persName>Captain Meriwether
	    <lb/>Lewis</persName>, explored the Western Country. I was much gratified
	  <lb/>to see <persName>Mr. Clark</persName>, having been familiar with his character, and
	  <lb/>was likewise acquainted with his wife. <persName>Mrs. Clark</persName> was the
	  <lb/>daughter of <persName>Colonel Hancock</persName>, of <placeName>Botetourt county</placeName>, <placeName>Virginia</placeName>,
	  <lb/>who was long a Member of <orgName>Congress</orgName>, and amongst the most
	  <lb/>amiable of men. I was acquainted with <persName>Colonel Hancock</persName> thir­
	  <lb/>ty years. <persName>Mrs. Clark</persName> was also unequalled in mind and man­
	  <lb/>ners; but is long since deceased. Her death almost drove <persName>Go­
	    <lb/>vernor Clark</persName> beside himself. Peace to her shade; she has left
	  <lb/>few equals behind her. I have never understood whether the
	  <lb/>governor married a second time.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Innis Green</hi></persName>, of <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>, is of middle size
	  <lb/>and age, with round comely features. He is rather dark com­
	  <lb/>plected, but his countenance is bright, with great expression.
	  <lb/>I could not distinguish him minutely from the great distance
	  <lb/>between us.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Daniel L. Barringer</hi></persName>, of <placeName>North Carolina</placeName>, is a
	  <lb/>young looking man, of good height and manly figure, neither
	  <lb/>spare nor robust; his complexion is fair, with fine features, and
	  <lb/>an insinuating blue eye. His countenance is diffused alike
	  <lb/>with smiles and genius; and his manners are frank, gay and
	  <lb/>genteel. He partakes largely of that warm-hearted benevo­
	  <lb/>lence, without the hauteur of the South.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Mr. Williams</hi></persName>. I find this gentleman described
	  <lb/>as follows; but as I find there were two of the name, in <orgName>Con­
	    <lb/>gress</orgName>, I cannot tell, from my note, whether he is from <placeName>Missis­
	    <lb/>sippi</placeName> or <placeName>North Carolina</placeName>. He appears to be a strong featured
	  <lb/>man, with an oval face, full dark eye, and easy manners.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Joseph Richardson</hi></persName>, of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, is a gen­
	  <lb/>tleman of very striking appearance: His face is round, full,
	  <lb/>and handsome, with a fine intelligent eye, and much expression
	  <lb/>of countenance. His manners are very engaging and refined.
	  <lb/>But his colleague, one <persName rend="slant(italic)">John Locke</persName>, I think is the most savage
	  <lb/>looking man, of all the representatives. A gloomy blood-spil­
	  <lb/>ling missionary, doubtless. Strange how this abominable

	  <lb/>rible.</p>
        <p>The <persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Chittenden Lyon</hi></persName>, of <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>, I find next.
	  <lb/>He is rightly named. He, and one <persName>Mr. Ellis</persName>, of <placeName>New Haven</placeName>,
	    <lb/><placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, who was in the City, resembled so nearly, that
	  <lb/>the one was usually taken for the other. It was amusing to
	  <lb/>hear persons addressing the former, with <said>how do you do, <persName>Mr.
	      <lb/>Ellis</persName>?</said> and presently meeting <persName>Mr. Ellis</persName>, <said>how do you do,
	    <lb/><persName>Mr. Lyon</persName>?</said> Some distinguished them by the names of the
	  <lb/><persName>Lyon</persName> and the <persName>Elephant</persName>, both being very large men. The
	  <lb/><persName>Honorable Chittenden Lyon</persName>, is a tall and very heavy made man,
	  <lb/>but not very fierce. His face is round and well featured, with
	  <lb/>a pleasing black eye, and dark complexion. His countenance
	  <lb/>and manners are open, gay and good natured. He is the gen­
	  <lb/>tlest Lyon I ever met with. But, doubtless, like all his coun­
	  <lb/>trymen, it will be dangerous to rouse him. All thes<choice><sic/><corr>e</corr></choice> <name>Kentucky­
	    <lb/>ans</name>, or rather <emph>all</emph> these Western Members have a very deter­
	  <lb/>mined, but very noble look.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Joel Fancey</hi></persName>, also of <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>, is of middle
	  <lb/>size, and age, with an oval, thin, dark visage, and steady
	  <lb/>grave countenance. He has every mark of a sensible man,
	  <lb/>and polite, though distant, in his manners.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Henry Daniel</hi></persName>, likewise of <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>, is a stout
	  <lb/>man, of young appearance, fair and well featured, with a staid

	  <lb/>an easy untiring perseverance.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Joseph Lecompte</hi></persName>, of <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>: I lost the note I

	  <lb/>tleman of singular fine appearance, and handsome address.
	  <lb/>His aspect is mild and insinuating: his eye and countenance

        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">James <choice><sic>K</sic><corr>R</corr></choice>.

        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Thomas R. Mitchell</hi></persName>, of <placeName>South Carolina</placeName>, has

	  <lb/>man, and very young, for a member. Like all the <name>Tennes­
	    <lb/>seeans</name>, he has great dignity and independence of countenance.
	  <lb/>He has an oval thin face, and dark gray eyes, with a steady
<pb n="185"/><milestone unit="sig" n="24(1)r"/><mw type="pageNum">185</mw><lb/>countenance of much expression. His manners are frank and
	  <lb/>gentlemanly, and I would suppose he was a man of talents and
	  <lb/>information, in whatever light he may be considered.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable General <hi rend="slant(italic)">Robert Desha</hi></persName>, in personal appearance
	  <lb/>has few equals; and the same may be said of his mind and
	  <lb/>manners. He is a tall neat formed figure, with very hand­
	  <lb/>some features; a complexion of clear white and red, and a
	  <lb/><emph>speaking</emph> black eye.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Prior Lea</hi></persName>, is a tall, thin, young looking man,
	  <lb/>with an oval studious fa<choice><sic>s</sic><corr>c</corr></choice>e. His countenance is grave and very
	  <lb/>dignified. He is quite a gentleman in appearance. All these
	  <lb/><name>Tennesseeans</name> resemble in make and appearance.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">John Bell</hi></persName>, from the same state, is likewise a
	  <lb/>young, tall, spare, elegant figure; very fair, with handsome
	  <lb/>features, and great dignity and intelligence of countenance.
	  <lb/>I have often observed the <name>Tennesseeans</name> differ from the people
	  <lb/>of every other state. There is a native silent, manly, and
	  <lb/>commanding dignity in their manner, peculiarly their own.
	  <lb/>They neither smile nor frown, but are always steady and col­
	  <lb/>lected; and no state is more ably represented.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Oliver H. Smith</hi></persName>, of <placeName>Indiana</placeName>, is a stout, portly
	  <lb/>young man, with rather good features, oval face, and middling
	  <lb/>complexion. His visage is full and ruddy; his hair profuse, and
	  <lb/>very black; with a strong full blue eye. The lineaments of his
	  <lb/>face are strongly marked, and indicate study. His countenance
	  <lb/>is serene, and his manners free and polite.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Joseph Duncan</hi></persName>, from <placeName>Illinois</placeName>, is a man of hand­
	  <lb/>some size, and a fine large bright black eye. He is extremely

        <p><persName>Honorable Delegate <hi rend="slant(italic)">Ambrose H. Sevier</hi></persName>, from <placeName>Arkansas</placeName>,
	  <lb/>is a perfect <persName>Adonis</persName>. Young, genteel, handsome, and spright­

	  <lb/>about him.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Thomas H. Blake</hi></persName>, of <placeName>Indiana</placeName>, is also a man of
	  <lb/>good personal appearance. He is tall and comely, with very
	  <lb/>fine handsome features, and an eye and countenance of great
	  <lb/>brilliancy and meaning. His manners are very pleasing.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Richard H. Wilde</hi></persName>, of <placeName>Georgia</placeName>, is one of the
<mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(+2)">24</mw><pb n="186"/><milestone unit="sig" n="24(1)v"/><mw type="pageNum">186</mw><lb/>most noble looking men in the House. A tall manly figure,
	  <lb/>and very black hair. I could distinguish no more.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Edward Bates</hi></persName>, of <placeName>Missouri</placeName>, is also a very in­
	  <lb/>teresting man in appearance. He is of middling age; thin
	  <lb/>round fair face, and fine hazle eyes, though they are rather
	  <lb/>weak. His manners are genteel and friendly.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Mr. Mitchell</hi></persName>, of <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>, I did not see. He

        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">L. Brent</hi></persName>, of 
	  <placeName>Louisiana</placeName>, like all the <name>Brents</name>, is
	  <lb/>a man of great size and affable gentlemanly manners. He is
	  <lb/>of middle age, and rather handsome in appearance, and possess­
	  <lb/>ed of uncommon ease and ability.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Joseph Vance</hi></persName>, was all I was able to see of the
	  <lb/><placeName>Ohio</placeName> delegation. This was their fault, not mine. <persName>Mr. Vance</persName>
	  <lb/>is a stout fine looking man, with a pleasing countenance, good
	  <lb/>face, and <emph>very</emph> gentlemanly manners.</p>
        <p xml:id="a42" corresp="#n42" rend="post(*)">Honorable <persName rend="slant(italic)">William C. Rives</persName>, of 
	  <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, is a most
	  <lb/>charming man. His manners are showy and genteel; his
	  <lb/>figure light, and his countenance has great expression. Ge­
	  <lb/>nius is stamped on every feature in his face, and he is entire­
	  <lb/>ly void of that ridiculous pride common to his state. He is
	  <lb/>one of our first men.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Thomas Newton</hi></persName>, likewise of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, is said
	  <lb/>to be the oldest member in the <orgName>House of Representatives</orgName>. He
	  <lb/>is, however, not an old looking man, and appears not to be
	  <lb/>over fifty years of age, though he has been in <orgName>Congress</orgName> since
	  <lb/><date when="1801">1801</date>. <persName>Mr. Newton</persName> is a keen, rather light, active man, with
	  <lb/>a thin, fair sensible face, soft blue eye, and bright lively
	  <lb/>countenance. His manners have great ease and dignity, and
	  <lb/>he is said to be an able and experienced statesman.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">A. Smyth</hi></persName>, I have noticed before. He is also an
	  <lb/>old member, and a consummate statesman. He is advanced in
<pb n="187"/><milestone unit="sig" n="24(2)r"/><mw type="pageNum">187</mw><lb/>years, but is still a man of handsome appearance, and most
	  <lb/>pleasing address.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">John Randolph</hi></persName>, has been in <orgName>Congress</orgName> since
	  <lb/><date when="1809">1809</date>, and is deservedly reckoned the finest orator in the
	  <lb/>House. His voice is loud, shrill, and melodious, and his ges­
	  <lb/>tures pertinent and graceful: never at a loss, his language is
	  <lb/>flowing, refined, and classical, and his remarks brief and cut­
	  <lb/>ting. He seems to be of no party, though severe against the
	  <lb/><name>Yankees</name>. <persName>Mr. Randolph</persName> is rather tall, but straight and very
	  <lb/>slender. His face is like no other man's, if we except the
	  <lb/><name>Lords of the Forest</name>, from whom he <choice><sic>he</sic><corr/></choice> is descended. It in­
	  <lb/>clines to oval, with a high square jutting forehead—his com­
	  <lb/>plexion is sallow, and his features are neither handsome, nor
	  <lb/>the contrary. But such an eye does not exist, if we except the
	  <lb/>piercing eye of <persName>Red Jacket</persName>. His eye is terrible in debate, and
	  <lb/>gives tone to his words and gestures. It is black, without
	  <lb/>scarcely any white. It is not jet black, but rather a shade
	  <lb/>removed—large and piercing, and when excited, glistens with
	  <lb/>a never-to-be-forgotten fierceness. His countenance is stern
	  <lb/>and immoveable. I never saw him smile—and his manners
	  <lb/>are distant and lofty, unlike the pomposity, however, of his
	  <lb/>fellow <name>Virginians</name>, but are nevertheless, gentlemanly. In size,
	  <lb/>he is tall enough, but very light. He is said to be immensely
	  <lb/>rich, but not charitable. A fig for wealth and genius, when
	  <lb/>the possessor has no heart. The plodding ploughman, or the
	  <lb/>rattling tar, who puts a coat on the shivering limbs of his fel­
	  <lb/>low creature; who gives a piece of bread to the hungry, and
	  <lb/>wipes the tear from the widow's eye, is a prince, compared to
	  <lb/>the man whose heart is steeled against the sufferings of his
	  <lb/>fellow man.</p>
        <p>In justice to <persName>Mr. Randolph</persName>, though he never put his hand
	  <lb/>to his purse to relieve me, when I first entered the <placeName>City of
	    <lb/>Washington</placeName>, without the means of procuring a single meal's
	  <lb/>victuals, he attended to me with more condescension, perhaps,
	  <lb/>than he ever did before or since, and wrote me a very polite
	  <lb/>note; which note proved of infinite more service to me than if
	  <lb/>he had given me an hundred dollar bank note. <seg xml:id="a43" corresp="#n43" rend="post(*)">I kept the note

<mw type="pageNum">188</mw>
	  <lb/>carefully for two or three years, as a treasure;</seg> and notwith­
	  <lb/>standing I had a letter from <persName>General La Fayette</persName>, <persName>Mr. Ran­
	    <lb/>dolph's</persName> letter was sought after, and read with much more ea­
	  <lb/>gerness. It was almost worn out. He never did, however,
	  <lb/>patronise my writings; and I would suppose he is not only un­
	  <lb/>friendly to literature, but no friend to genius, or the encour­
	  <lb/>agement of the arts and sciences. Many ludicrous stories are
	  <lb/>told of <persName>Mr. Randolph</persName>, which are evidently false. I shall in­
	  <lb/>stance but one only. Every one recollects a piece in the pa­
	  <lb/>pers, when <persName>Mr. Randolph</persName> was a Senator in <orgName>Congress</orgName>, repre­
	  <lb/>senting him as addressing the doorkeeper every other word,
	  <lb/>while speaking, for <emph>porter</emph>. <said><persName>Tims</persName> give me some porter—
	    <lb/><persName>Tims</persName> give me some porter.</said> I thought it very extraordinary,
	  <lb/>as I never heard of <persName>Mr. Randolph's</persName> drinking any thing—and
	  <lb/>upon inquiry, found it to be untrue. This was fabricated by
	  <lb/>the <name>Yankees</name>. No wonder <persName>Mr. Randolph</persName> will not let his horse
	  <lb/>eat hay raised North of the <placeName>Potomac</placeName>.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">John Floyd</hi></persName>, though like myself, from the back­
	  <lb/>woods, I never saw before. Every one is aware that <persName>Mr.
	    <lb/>Floyd</persName> is a man of gigantic talents, and has much weight in
	  <lb/><orgName>Congress</orgName>. He is a stout man advanced in life, with a splendid
	  <lb/>set of features, and the keenest eye in nature, next to <persName>Mr.
	    <lb/>Randolphs</persName>. It is fearless as the eye of the <persName>Lyon</persName>. His com­
	  <lb/>plexion is very dark, so much so, that he might easily be tak­
	  <lb/>en for an <name>Indian</name>, which he strongly resembles. He is about
	  <lb/>the color of a <name>Spaniard</name>. I knew <persName>Mrs. Floyd</persName> when she was a 
	  <lb/>girl. She was a <persName>Miss Preston</persName>, and one of the most sensible
	  <lb/>women in <placeName>Virginia</placeName>. She was one of many brothers and sis­
	  <lb/>ters of the great <name>Preston</name> family. The women were all remark­
	  <lb/>able for good sense; and the men, it was said, were very silly.
	  <lb/><persName>General Floyd</persName> has some of the finest children, beyond doubt, 
	  <lb/>in the Union.</p>
        <p>Whilst speaking of the <placeName>Virginia</placeName> Members, or <name>Virginians</name>
	  <lb/>generally, the Eastern and Western population differ as wide­
	  <lb/>ly, as though they occupied different states. The Western,
	  <lb/>are steady, mild, independent, and natural in their manners.

	  <lb/>They are kind, frank, and familiar, entirely void of ostenta­
	  <lb/>tion; whilst, with the exception of one, perhaps, in a thousand,
	  <lb/>the <name>Eastern Virginian</name> swells himself up and looks big; is ve­
	  <lb/>ry lofty and pompous; all of which no one cares for, as <quote>that

        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Mark Alexander</hi></persName>, was all of the <placeName>Virginia</placeName> Mem­
	  <lb/>bers I was able to distinguish, with the exception of those I 
	  <lb/>have mentioned. He is a man of fine appearance at a distance;
	  <lb/>and said to be a man of talents, and a good speaker. He does
	  <lb/>not carry quite as much sail as many of his brethren.</p>
        <p>We must now, as heretofore, (oh, fie!) step over <placeName>Mary­
	    <lb/>land</placeName>, (cold hearted mother—unn<choice><sic>n</sic><corr/></choice>atural parent,) to <placeName>Pennsyl­
	    <lb/>vania</placeName>, noble generous state! They are princes compared to the
	  <lb/>Members of the former. I have already mentioned most of
	  <lb/>them in the Third volume of the <title>Black Book.</title> I have
	  <lb/>since seen the following of the Twentieth <orgName>Congress</orgName>, viz:</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Robert Orr, Jr.</hi></persName> a tall, well looking, rather un­
	  <lb/>der aged, man. He is delicate and slender, with tolerable fea­
	  <lb/>tures, weak eyes, and pleasant open countenance. He is gen­
	  <lb/>teel, though rather distant in his manners. This is, however,
	  <lb/>no evidence that he is so; as <persName>Major Noah</persName> says the most people
	  <lb/>are afraid of me. <persName>Mr. Orr</persName> is, however, a very pleasant man,
	  <lb/>and descended from one of the first families of the state.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">James Wilson</hi></persName>, is a stout tall man, and rather
	  <lb/>rough featured. He is of middle age, fair face, and of pleas­
	  <lb/>ing, friendly, but very plain manners.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Samuel McKean</hi></persName>, is a man of very handsome
	  <lb/>appearance; of fine size, and courtly manners. He is a very
	  <lb/>engaging man on every account, which is all I recollect, hav­
	  <lb/>ing lost my notes of him.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Andrew Stewart</hi></persName>, is a man of good size and ap­
	  <lb/>pearance; dark regular features, with an undaunted black eye.
	  <lb/>He has much expression, but I was not near him.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Joseph Laurence</hi></persName>, of the blue stocking county,
	  <lb/><placeName>Washington</placeName>, <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>, is a tall good figure; but thin face,
	  <lb/>and swarthy complexion. His countenance is close and for­
	  <lb/>bidding, though he is lively and gay in his manners. I bore
	  <lb/>rather hard upon him for presenting a petition to stop the mail
<pb n="190"/>

<mw type="pageNum">190</mw>
	  <lb/>on <name>Sundays</name>: but he got out of the scrape with much pleasan­
	  <lb/>try. <persName>Mr. Laurence</persName> is quite a young man.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Mr. Mitchell</hi></persName>, is a poor <distinct>chance</distinct>, as we say in the
	  <lb/>West. He had a letter for me, and after keeping it a long
	  <lb/>time, refused to see me, and carefully kept his back towards
	  <lb/>me. I see he is left out. I hope <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> will not send 
	  <lb/>him again.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Stephen Barlow</hi></persName>, is a stout, tall, amiable look­
	  <lb/>ing man, and of very plain address. Whoever has seen his
	  <lb/>mild black eye once, can never forget it.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">George Kremer</hi></persName>, is <quote>little and auld,</quote> as the
	  <lb/><name>Irishman</name> said of his horse. His face is round, and looks as
	  <lb/>though it were tanned, and is considerably wrinckled. His
	  <lb/>hair is of a handsome golden hue, and is the best part about
	  <lb/>him, if he were to keep it combed. But from its appearance,
	  <lb/>I would suppose it not to have been combed for six months, not
	  <lb/>even with a three legged stool. He is very small; very plain­
	  <lb/>ly dressed; and wears a big brimmed hat. He is continually
	  <lb/>poking about in every hole and corner, and from one part of
	  <lb/>the Hall to the other, lying down on the sofas, behind the bar,
	  <lb/>getting up, and strolling every where. He is not deficient,
	  <lb/>however, and is said to be a <emph>great</emph> admirer of the ladies. When
	  <lb/>he speaks, he sets the House in a roar, which seems to be his 
	  <lb/>sole aim. His dialect is between <name>English</name> and <name>German</name>; but
	  <lb/>he always puts on plenty of <name>German</name> to draw attention. I was
	  <lb/>in the gallery when he got up to reply to <persName>Mr. Wright</persName>, of <placeName>Ohio</placeName>.
	  <lb/>He said that <persName>Mr. Wright</persName> reminded him of an old hen in his
	  <lb/>(<persName>Kremer's</persName>) barn yard; <said>she was always cackling, and cack­
	    <lb/>ling, and cackling, and never laid an egg!</said> These expres­
	  <lb/>sions, so appropriate, has immortalized the name of <persName>Kremer</persName>.
	  <lb/>It was in vain for the Speaker to maintain order, as he was
	  <lb/>himself convulsed with laughter. <persName>Mr. Kremer's</persName> gestures are
	  <lb/>inimitably comic.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Samuel D. Ingham</hi></persName>, is a thin, middle aged man,
	  <lb/>with a round, very thin furrowed face, and mild countenance.
	  <lb/>His manners are distant and unsocial. He is said to be a man
	  <lb/>of talents, but his countenance by no means confirms the re­
	  <lb/>port.</p>

        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Joseph Fry, Jr.</hi></persName>, also of <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>, is rather
	  <lb/>a small man of middle age, and round pleasing German face,
	  <lb/>somewhat fair. He is a plain farmer looking man. His black
	  <lb/>hair hangs round his neck and face, in thick clusters, and his
	  <lb/>countenance is remarkably placid and innocent.</p>
        <p>In the whole state of <placeName>New Jersey</placeName>, with the exception of
	  <lb/>the Honorables <persName>Mr. Dickerson</persName> and <persName>Mr. Tucker</persName>, mentioned
	  <lb/>before, I find <emph>none</emph> but the <persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Samuel Swan</hi></persName>, who drew
	  <lb/>near me. <persName>Mr. Swan</persName> is a modest, unassuming man, of very
	  <lb/>pleasing, steady manners, and rather young looking, with a 
	  <lb/>handsome fair face, fair hair, and soft blue eyes. He is quite
	  <lb/>a handsome man.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">John De Graff</hi></persName>, of <placeName>New York</placeName>, is a princely
	  <lb/>looking man, of delightful manners. He is a large middle
	  <lb/>aged man, rather gray for his years. His face is round, and

	  <lb/>man, with a blue eye, bald head, and vacant countenance.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">P. Tracy</hi></persName>, is another mean looking man. I 
	  <lb/>find there is no middle ground in <placeName>New York</placeName>, whether public
	  <lb/>or private; they, the people, are either all dross, or pure metal.
	  <lb/>One part seems to be the chaff, and the other the wheat.—
	  <lb/>There is, certainly, some of the most awkward, rough-hewn,
	  <lb/>thick-headed, simple men, in the <placeName>New York</placeName> delegation, that
	  <lb/>ever formed a representation of any people—and some, again,
	  <lb/>are amongst the best looking. What can the people mean by
	  <lb/>sending such boobies to <orgName>Congress</orgName>, only to be laughed and
	  <lb/>pointed at. It would seem they looked for the <emph>worst</emph>, instead
	  <lb/>of the best men. I have travelled through the whole state, and
	  <lb/>found good looking men every where, barring the blacklegs.
	  <lb/>If they cannot find better men at home, I would advise them to
	  <lb/>import some; for I can assure them as a friend, their Members,
	  <lb/>at least many of them, cut a very shabby figure in <name>Congress
	    <lb/>Hall</name>, even by the side of the remotest West.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Aaron Ward</hi></persName>, from <placeName>New York</placeName>, is a fine looking
	  <lb/>man, (I shall pick out the best,) rather of young appearance,
<pb n="192"/><milestone unit="sig" n="24(4)v"/><mw type="pageNum">192</mw><lb/>and middling height. His face is oval, with a handsome set of
	  <lb/>features, and adorned with a most beautiful dark gray eye.
	  <lb/>His manners are affable and genteel.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Jeromus Johnson</hi></persName> I mentioned before, but did
	  <lb/>him injustice. He is much taller than I thought. His face

        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">S. Hobbie</hi></persName>, is mentioned further back. They

        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Samuel Chace</hi></persName>, of <placeName>New York</placeName>, is a young look­

	  <lb/>engaging figure, with fine features, and a most alluring soft­

	  <lb/>and though <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, like her sister, <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, is of­

        <p>I overlooked the <persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">William Armstrong</hi></persName>, from

	  <lb/>avoid me, which made me only the more anxious to find him
	  <lb/>out. And whom should it prove to be but <persName rend="slant(italic)">Captain Patridge</persName>.
	  <lb/>He wants more money. I hope <orgName>Congress</orgName> has more sense than 
	  <lb/>to be gulled by every sharper. Thank fortune, <persName>Captain Pat­

	    <lb/>Academy at Middletown,</name> is at an end, and the people have got
	  <lb/>well of the <persName>Patridge</persName> fever. I hope they will continue the <mcr>bark</mcr>
	  <lb/>to prevent a relapse. Here I also became acquainted with <persName rend="slant(italic)">Mr.
	    <lb/>Smith</persName>, of the <name>United States' Gazette</name>; a most interesting man.
	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Smith</persName> is tall and finely shaped, with a fair interesting
	  <lb/>face and eye. He is easy and very graceful in his manners.</p>
        <p>I was teased to death here, by an impertinent little fop,
	  <lb/>who kept company with my friend <persName rend="slant(italic)">Norton</persName>, of 
	  <placeName>Hartford</placeName>. His
	  <lb/>brass led him in company with every one. He was very
	  <lb/>young, and very impudent, and had the halter painted in his
	  <lb/>countenance. He had either stole a coat from somebody, or the
	  <lb/>money to purchase one, and was screwed in the middle, to bring
	  <lb/>himself within the limits of a scanty vest, which he had out­
	  <lb/>grown. He reminded me of a wasp. He certainly had the
	  <lb/>most hateful and suspicious look of his species. <persName>Norton</persName> refus­
	  <lb/>ed to tell me his name and residence, which, and his intimacy
	  <lb/>with the fellow, gave me, for the first, a bad opinion of him,
	  <lb/>though once a decent and friendly man.</p>
        <p>Of all schemes or plans, of hairbrained man, the Capitol
	  <lb/>of the <placeName>United States</placeName> is the greatest humbug. Here is a Hall
	  <lb/>that has cost the people thousands of dollars, where you can
	  <lb/>neither see nor hear; and I am pretty certain it is mere guess
	  <lb/>work with the reporters. The windows are about as large as
	  <lb/>the barn windows in <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>. The dome is too small
	  <lb/>to give sufficient light—and from the misguided plan of
	  <lb/>the building, there is windows only on the segment. The 
	  <lb/>whole is a dark labyrinth of useless cut up passages, which
	  <lb/>would disgrace a common court house; in fact, no court house
	  <lb/>is so illy contrived, if we except the Library and the Rotundo.
	  <lb/>Nor is there a place in this pile of stone, for it is nothing else,
	  <lb/>for those to sit in who have business with <orgName>Congress</orgName>. They
	  <lb/>have to stand up in a dark, narrow dirty passage, amongst ne­
	  <lb/>groes and other rubbish; more like a hogs-sty than any thing else

	  <lb/>—dirt knee deep. It has a fair outside, to-be-sure; but a more
	  <lb/>gloomy, dismal, filthy place, does not exist, than the inside of
	  <lb/>this costly building. One would think a small parlor, or car­
	  <lb/>peted sitting room, at least, might be offered, for those who
	  <lb/>paid for it, to sit in when they come to <placeName>Washington</placeName> on business,
	  <lb/>where they would be secure from the rabble and pickpockets,
	  <lb/>which infest the building. Why there are not seats in the
	  <lb/>Rotundo, where the weary might rest themselves. I cannot
	  <lb/>conceive: so, that after paying such vast sums, those who come
	  <lb/>hundreds of miles, on important business, have not a comfor­
	  <lb/>table place to sit or stand in. Truly, we are <quote>the most
	    <lb/>enlightened nation on earth.</quote> I wish the national represen­
	  <lb/>tatives would condescend to dispense a little of their light in
	  <lb/>the dark rooms of the Capitol. If <emph>tracts</emph> constitute this super­
	  <lb/>lative eminence, then, I confess, we are the most enlightened
	  <lb/>nation on earth.</p>
        <p>I mention the situation of <name>Congress Hall</name>, by way of apo­
	  <lb/>logy for the imperfect portraits of the Members. A few of
	  <lb/>them very politely came up and saluted me, and those who did
	  <lb/>not, have only themselves to blame, should I have misrepresent­
	  <lb/>ed them.</p>
        <p>I amused myself no little in chasing the Missionaries out
	  <lb/>of the gallery. One in particular, when I drove him off, re­
	  <lb/>turned after a while, and stole (not the first time I dare say)
	  <lb/>softly into the further end of the gallery. The moment he seat­
	  <lb/>ed himself, I laid down my pencil and paper, and walked round
	  <lb/>to him. Upon asking his long-facedship what business he had
	  <lb/>there, he got up, without speaking, and walked further on. I
	  <lb/>followed him up, and finding I pursued him, he darted through
	  <lb/>the end door, and away he went—and I returned in triumph.
	  <lb/>Strange how well these missionaries are acquainted with holes
	  <lb/>and corners. Now, I have been in the Capitol, <emph>off</emph> and <emph>on</emph>, for
	  <lb/>five years, and never knew there was an outlet at the end of
	  <lb/>the gallery, till this <persName>Blue Beard</persName> opened the door.</p>
        <p>Upon returning to my seat, a gentleman, who had been
	  <lb/>amusing himself at the terror of <persName>Captain Patridge</persName>, and the 
	  <lb/>missionaries, showed me a newspaper, containing an advertise­
	  <lb/>ment, purporting that <persName>Captain Patridge</persName> would deliver Lectures

	      <lb/>ton</placeName>? I always attend there to report. I never had the plea­
	    <lb/>sure to see you there, yet. We set under the <name>Senate Cham­
	      <lb/>ber</name>, at <placeName>Washington City</placeName>, during the Winter—Why do you not
	    <lb/>come down; you will find something for your pen?</said> Sure
	  <lb/>enough, I never thought of the <name>Supreme Court</name>, and moreover,
	  <lb/>never have had time. When relieved from examining proof
	  <lb/>sheets, however, I stole one day, and went to the Court Room,
	  <lb/>which, like the rest of the Capitol, is dark, damp, and gloomy,
	  <lb/>and almost chilled me to death. It is equal to going out into
	  <lb/>a shower of rain. This place is worse than the Hall, as re­
	  <lb/>spects a view of the Judges. They sit in a line with their
	  <lb/>backs to the only windows there are, and this throws their
	  <lb/>faces in the shade, and visiters sitting opposite, the light com­
	  <lb/>ing in contact with their eyes, completely blinds them. By
	  <lb/>moving a little to the left, however, though you have not a
	  <lb/>better view of the Judges, you have a very good view of the
	  <lb/>Attorneys, or Counsellors I should say.</p>
        <p>The Court was just going in Session, and several of the

<mw type="pageNum">197</mw>
	  <lb/>came up, and saluted me very politely, but <persName>Counsellor Ogden</persName>
	  <lb/>slunk off to the other end of the lobby, car<choice><sic/><corr>e</corr></choice>fully turning his
	  <lb/>back. I followed him up to get a better view of<choice><sic>f</sic><corr/></choice> him, but he,
	  <lb/>and a brother clown of his, picked up a newspaper, and hold­
	  <lb/>ing it before thei<choice><sic>s</sic><corr>r</corr></choice> faces, fell to reading intensely. They were
	  <lb/>both great overgrown awkward men, with as little of the gen­
	  <lb/>tleman about them as any other two I have ever seen.</p>
        <p>Meantime the Judges arrived, and taking their seats,
	  <lb/>Court was proclaimed open, by the cryer, and I walked round
	  <lb/>to take my seat in front of the Judges.</p>
        <p>It was laughable enough to see the panic and dismay of
	  <lb/>those who had taken their seats in the lobby, not to attend to
	  <lb/>the pleadings, but to show their long feathers, silk pelisses, &amp;c.
	  <lb/><said><persName>Mrs. Royall</persName>, <persName>Mrs. Royall</persName>, my G—d! I'll not stay here!</said>—
	  <lb/>The whisper ran from one end of the bench to the other, in a 
	  <lb/>truce. The women wrapped their veils round their faces, and
	  <lb/>the men held their hats up to theirs, and off they scampered.
	  <lb/>If the plague, a mad dog, or any ferocious wild beast had been
	  <lb/>let loose, in the Court Room, their flight could not have been
	  <lb/>more precipitate. Now, if these fools had sat still, I should
	  <lb/>have had a much better opinion of them; as it was, the reverse
	  <lb/>was the effect. They always commit themselves by taking to
	  <lb/>flight. In a very short time another drove entered the Court
	  <lb/>Room—the ladies with flaming bonnets and ribbands—but,
	  <lb/>oh, tortures! these, like the first, began to whisper and hide
	  <lb/>their faces, and they decamped: and so they continued while
	  <lb/>I staid there. Towards the last, three very genteel women
	  <lb/>came in, in plain black bonnets. I was told one was <persName>Mrs.
	    <lb/>Edward Livingston</persName>—One was a very beautiful young lady.—
	  <lb/>These, of course, <emph>were ladies</emph>. They were attended also, by
	  <lb/><emph>gentlemen</emph>. <said><persName>Mrs. Royall</persName>,</said> said a gentleman, who sat near
	  <lb/>me, <said>how can you distinguish people so quick?</said> Any one
	  <lb/>might distinguish, when they see women dressed so gaudy,
	  <lb/>and attended by shabby scrubs and bits of boys. Seeing the
	  <lb/>intensity with which I viewed one of these <persName>Miss Ostrich fea­
	    <lb/>thers</persName>, her beau, (she had three,) who happened to know me,
	  <lb/>and guessing my thoughts, plucked up courage enough to draw 
	  <lb/>near, and said, <said>that young lady is not what you take her to
<pb n="198"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="25(3)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">198</mw>
	    <lb/>be, she is one of the first ladies in the City</said>—in his opinion,
	  <lb/>he meant. All I have to say, her beau was a long way from
	  <lb/>being the first gentleman in the City.</p>
        <p>It could create nothing but a smile to see those who re­
	  <lb/>mained in the Court Room, studiously keeping their backs to­
	  <lb/>wards me. Amongst the visiters, however, there were sundry
	  <lb/>country people, who were very interesting. These were dis­
	  <lb/>tinguished by their plainness and modesty, and drew the eyes
	  <lb/>of every one present. There were, likewise, a few genteel men;
	  <lb/>but these were, probably, attorneys. The young woman—lady
	  <lb/>I mean—the <quote>most respectable in the City!</quote> sat it out, in de­
	  <lb/>fiance of pens and pencil, and laughed herself almost into the
	  <lb/>hysterics, whilst her beau, one on each side, and one at her
	  <lb/>blue bonnet back, were continually billing and cooing to her.
	  <lb/>I could not commend her taste in the choice of her beaux, one
	  <lb/>in particular: he looked as though he had been under the effect
	  <lb/>of a strong cathartic.</p>
        <p>Besides these there were a number of pick-pockets to top
	  <lb/>off with. Such was the <name>Supreme Court</name>. I fondly hoped, how­
	  <lb/>ever, to be indemnified by the fine pleadings; but here I was
	  <lb/>unfortunate again—I ought to have went the preceding day,
	  <lb/>when I should have heard the great <persName>Webster</persName>. Instead of this,
	  <lb/>I was bored with <persName>Counsellor Ogden</persName>. <persName rend="slant(italic)">Ogden</persName> looks well enough
	  <lb/>in a newspaper, but you ought to see him when he is pleading.
	  <lb/>If you can imagine an ox standing on his hinder legs, you may
	  <lb/>form an apt opinion of <persName>Counsellor Ogden</persName>, though I was <emph>told</emph>
	  <lb/>the latter was without horns. For my part I cannot vouch for
	  <lb/>his front, as his back was turned towards me, and was suffi­
	  <lb/>ciently amusing. He is tall and lusty; leans forward, and
	  <lb/>never moves his hand or his body—and his voice!—His plead­
	  <lb/>ing was nothing but one sing song monotony. It was dot and
	  <lb/>go one, the whole time. He kept one hand behind his back,
	  <lb/>as carefully as though it were held by a neuse. He griped his
	  <lb/>spectacles in the hand behind his back; and I was naughty
	  <lb/>enough to propose to some of my friends to slip them out, that
	  <lb/>the opposite Counsel might gain victory; for doubtless,
	  <lb/>his pleading would have been at an end, had the spectacles
	  <lb/>been <mcr>overruled</mcr>. Such another pair of paws is at issue with

	  <lb/>bench and bar; and though he kept his body stiff as a stake, his
	  <lb/>body was continually bobbing up and down, like <persName>Diggory</persName> in
	  <lb/>the play.</p>
        <p>There sat my friend <persName rend="slant(italic)">Wirt</persName>, the Attorney General, and

	  were likewise in Court;
	  <lb/>but I had not the pleasure of hearing them speak.</p>
        <p>The Judges were so much in the shade, it was impossible
	  <lb/>to distinguish them with any accuracy, and I merely had a
	  <lb/>glance at them when they adjourned. But all of them, except
	  <lb/><persName>Judge <hi rend="case(mixed)slant(italic)">Thompson</hi></persName>, and <persName>Judge 
	    <hi rend="case(mixed)slant(italic)">Story</hi></persName>, departed with such expedi­
	  <lb/>tion that it was impossible to venture a description of them.
	  <lb/>They looked very solemn the whole time—not a smile marked
	  <lb/>their countenances. <persName>Judge <hi rend="case(mixed)slant(italic)">Duvall</hi></persName> has the most singular face
	  <lb/>in the world, every line of which is marked with wisdom.
	  <lb/>His face is of great length, with an uncommon high square fore­
	  <lb/>head. <persName>Judge <hi rend="case(mixed)slant(italic)">Washington</hi></persName> has a face of uncommon placidness.
	  <lb/>He is quite a small man, with a round small face, and very
	  <lb/>delicate features. He, and <persName>Judge <hi rend="case(mixed)slant(italic)">Marshall</hi></persName>, mentioned before,
	  <lb/>and <persName>Judge Duvall</persName>, are about the same age. <persName>Judges Story</persName>,
	  <lb/><persName>Thompson</persName>, (I did not see <persName>Trimble</persName>,) and <persName>Johnson</persName>, are much
	  <lb/>younger looking men. <persName>Judge Thompson</persName> and <persName>Story</persName> very
	  <lb/>politely dropped behind, and chatted with me sometime. I
	  <lb/>had often seen <persName>Judge Story</persName> before: he is from <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>,
	  <lb/>and a most amiable and worthy man.—And <persName>Judge Thompson</persName>

        <p><hi>Only</hi> four or five were <soCalled>reformed</soCalled> out of the <orgName>Department

	  <lb/>tary appointed a panther, or any other wild beast, it would
	  <lb/>have been full as agreeable to the people. Many a poor man
	  <lb/>spends his last cent, before he can have an interview with him,
	  <lb/>whilst his ferocious aspect puts them in terror of their lives.
	  <lb/>After snarling sometime, he finds fault with this, and with
	  <lb/>that—<said>the writings are not well done—he can't receive them.</said>
	  <lb/>The big mouthed <name>Irishman</name>. These are pretexts to throw mo­
	  <lb/>ney into the hands of another catchpenny foreigner, whilst the
	  <lb/>heart-worn stranger, perhaps, after spending his last cent in
	  <lb/>travelling hundreds of miles to reach <placeName>Washington</placeName>, has either
	  <lb/>to borrow <emph>five dollars</emph>, to pay these rapacious monsters, or re­
	  <lb/>turn without his patent right. This is an evil that calls loudly
	  <lb/>for a remedy, and a clerk ought to be furnished by the De­
	  <lb/>partment, to do the writing, if necessary. In many instances,
	  <lb/>however, I am satisfied, this is a fraud. It is worse than fraud
	  <lb/>to keep <persName>McIntire</persName> in. The new clerk, <persName rend="slant(italic)">Mr. Temple</persName>, is a very
	  <lb/>decent looking man.</p>
        <p><persName>Mr. Van Buren</persName>, however, deserves much credit for a few

	  <lb/>to her house and she would give him something. She arrived
	  <lb/>at the house sometime before the beggar, and ordering a bowl
	  <lb/>of rich soup, was comfortably regaling herself upon it, by the
	  <lb/>fire, when the beggar came in: <said>Oh,</said> said she, <said>the day has
	    <lb/>moderated very much, you may go about your business.</said> So
	  <lb/>it is with the <orgName>Cabinet</orgName>; they have tasted the sweets of office,
	  <lb/>and are no longer mindful of those friends who helped them to
	  <lb/>these offices, and good things. But the time may come round

        <p>The prince of the new appointments is <persName>Auditor <hi rend="case(mixed)slant(italic)">Lewis</hi></persName>.
	  <lb/>Without the searching keenness, perhaps, of <persName>Amos Kendall</persName>,
	  <lb/>he certainly is one of the best men in the government. Gene­
	  <lb/>rous, open, and candid, he is, at the same time cool and firm
	  <lb/>as a rock. <persName>Mr. Lewis</persName> is a stout young looking man, of plain
	  <lb/>dignified manners. His face is fair and round; his eye a
	  <lb/>soft gray; his countenance firm and tranquil; yet, all the
	  <lb/>rival graces revel in his manly face; and while his tongue
	  <lb/>says nothing, his looks say every thing. I would suppose,
	  <lb/>from the little I have witnessed of <persName rend="slant(italic)">Mr. Auditor Lewis</persName>, it would
	  <lb/>be as easy to overturn the <placeName>Andes</placeName>, as to shake his integrity.
	  <lb/>He is lively, facetious, and witty, and one of the most pleasant
	  <lb/>companions in the world. At the sound of distress, humanity
	  <lb/>springs to his eye. I have seen but very few men like him.
	  <lb/>I am much pleased with this pride of <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>, and that he
	  <lb/>still retains <persName rend="slant(italic)">Mr. Eakin</persName> in office; a most worthy man. Besides
	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Eakin</persName>, he has twelve clerks, at salaries, amounting in the
	  <lb/>gross, to 13,200 dollars, per annum. Had <persName>Auditor Lewis</persName>
	  <lb/>conferred this sum upon his friends, instead of still retaining
	  <lb/>his enemies in office, which he has, he would have rendered
	  <lb/>his name dear to the American people, by complying with
	  <lb/>their wishes. What right have these people to monopolize places
	  <lb/>of profit, to the exclusion of others? What rights have they
	  <lb/>that others have not? Upon what grounds do these men claim,
	  <lb/>and still usurp, emoluments, equally the right of other men?
	  <lb/>This is the case—nearly the case in all the offices at <placeName>Wash­
	    <lb/>ington</placeName>. <said>They abuse us so in the papers,</said> says one man.
	  <lb/>And what of that? Better bear the discontent of the unjust,
	  <lb/>than the displeasure of an indignant, disappointed, and injured
	  <lb/>people. What is it that they say in the papers? What can they
	  <lb/>say, compared with the just displeasure of the people. They

	    <lb/>ness such an occurrence in this country. It evinces a disre­
	    <lb/>gard for independence and manly pride, and presents to view,
	    <lb/>minds lost to patriotic feelings. We are indeed sorry for this
	    <lb/>occurrence. It proves to us that the vices of the old world,
	    <lb/>have began to take root in the new.</p>
        </said>
        <p>Doubtless this must have been <persName>Uncle Toby</persName>. He is so

        <said>
          <p>One year hence we shall know whether they are really
	    <lb/>more deserving of public confidence than their predecessors;
	    <lb/>and whether <persName>Messrs Hill</persName> and <persName>Kendall</persName>, who, it seems take the
	    <lb/>lead, for a <emph>radical reform</emph>, are more honest, disinterested, and
	    <lb/>patriotic, than <persName>Messrs. Cutts</persName> and <persName>Watkins</persName>.</p>
        </said>
        <p>This is fine stuff to frighten honest men from fulfilling
	  <lb/>their engagements with the people; and proves that their pusa­
	  <lb/>lanimity alone drew it upon them. And again: <said><persName>Mr. Sweeny</persName>,
	    <lb/>a very honest man, has been <emph>in</emph> the <orgName>Post Office</orgName> twenty years.</said>
	  <lb/>Then it was time for <persName>Mr. Somebody else</persName>, who had been <emph>out</emph> of
	  <lb/>the <orgName>Post Office</orgName> twenty years, to take his place. So, of all these
	  <lb/>twenty years' men, our people, so far as they have failed in
	  <lb/>turning out these old incumbents, have proved themselves un­
	  <lb/>worthy of the trust reposed in them—and though they are all
	  <lb/>my particular friends, (except <persName>Mr. Ingham</persName>,) and from my own
	  <lb/>country, I am by no means disposed to connive at, or hide their
	  <lb/>faults. I must say that <persName>Mr. Hill</persName> and <persName>Mr. Kendall</persName>, have acted
	  <lb/>more like true <name>Americans</name>, than any men in the four great
	  <lb/>Departments. And, by the way, there is something like an
	  <lb/>unmanly compromise in the matter, which I do not understand.
	  <lb/>It is said by outcriers, that the President, and his friends,
	  <lb/>turn out <said>all who were opposed to his election.</said> This is not
	  <lb/>true by a great deal. But no wonder this slander. Men na­
	  <lb/>turally become insolent, in proportion as those they have to
	  <lb/>deal with become cowardly. But to go on.</p>
        <p>The Third Auditor, <persName rend="slant(italic)">Peter Hagner</persName>—How many have been
	  <lb/>turned out here? Only one I believe: and excepting <persName rend="slant(italic)">Mr. James
	    <lb/>Thompson</persName>, the chief clerk, every one, fourteen in all, ought to
	  <lb/>go out, with <persName>Peter Hagner</persName> himself. If I had any vote I would

        <p>In <persName>Comptroller <hi rend="case(mixed)slant(italic)">Anderson's</hi></persName> office, out of fifteen clerks, on­

	  <lb/>ought to be left. Likewise <persName>Auditor <hi rend="case(mixed)slant(italic)">Harrison's</hi></persName> office is filled
	  <lb/>with paupers and blue skins.</p>
        <p>Fourth Auditor, <persName rend="slant(italic)">Kendall</persName>. Here we find the removals have
	  <lb/>been judicious. <persName rend="slant(italic)">Mr. Gillis</persName>, the chief clerk, has been retained,
	  <lb/>and doubtless will be, so long as he continues upright. The
	  <lb/>new clerks here are fine young men. <persName>Mr. Kendall</persName> did not
	  <lb/>hunt up the paupers and copper heads of <placeName>Washington</placeName>, and
	  <lb/>cheat the people, as the rest are doing, by keeping paupers in
	  <lb/>office. The new clerks are, <persName rend="slant(italic)">Major B. Buckner</persName>, of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>,
	  <lb/><persName rend="slant(italic)">H. C. Williams</persName> and <persName rend="slant(italic)">William Garrett</persName>, of 
	  <placeName>Ten<choice><sic/><corr>n</corr></choice>essee</placeName>, and one
	  <lb/>or two others. For the sake of modest merit, I should like to
	  <lb/>see <persName>Mr. H. C. Williams</persName> promoted from the pittiful sum of 800
	  <lb/>dollars, to something more worthy his inestimable character;
	  <lb/>he being, beyond doubt, one of the most amiable in the govern­
	  <lb/>ment. I hope <persName>Mr. Kendall</persName> will bestow particular attention to
	  <lb/>this young man, whose worth is beyond price; and the more so,
	  <lb/>as he still has a few of the old clerks in. <persName>Mr. Kendall</persName>, how­
	  <lb/>ever, deserves eternal praise for driving off the blue skin <persName rend="slant(italic)">Mac­
	    <lb/>daniels</persName>.</p>
        <p>Fifth Auditor, <persName rend="slant(italic)">Stephen Pleasonton</persName>. We are pleased he is
	  <lb/>retained. He is an amiable man. In his office are ten clerks,
	  <lb/>and, with the exception of <persName rend="slant(italic)">Messrs. Barry</persName> and 
	  <persName rend="slant(italic)">Houston</persName>, the
	  <lb/>whole ought to be <soCalled>reformed out</soCalled>. There is <persName rend="slant(italic)">Thaw</persName> and 
	  <persName rend="slant(italic)">Mustin</persName>,
	  <lb/>two of the rankest copperheads in <placeName>Washington</placeName>—twenty years'
	  <lb/>men. It is downright conspiracy to keep men in the bosom of
	  <lb/>our government, who have openly avowed themselves hostile
	  <lb/>to our liberties, as these men both have done, in their unwea­
	  <lb/>ried efforts under a pretext to keep the <name>Sabbath</name>. The Presi­
	  <lb/>dent of the <placeName>United States</placeName> either knows this, or he does not
	  <lb/>know it; if the former, he is not true to the people—if the latter,
	  <lb/>he is unfit for the trust. <said>But he is the President of the <emph>peo­

        <p>The Treasurer, <persName rend="slant(italic)">Mr. Campbell</persName>. Here again I disagree
	  <lb/>with our government for turning out <persName>Mr. Clark</persName>. It seems
	  <lb/>this was done at the instance of <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>. This sounds

	  <lb/>a soft gray, with every indication of a man of talents. He
	  <lb/>combines more ease, grace, and dignity, in his manners, than
	  <lb/>any man I have met with in the government. He has the ap­

	  <lb/>Captain. I sought the boy who decoyed me into the room, and

	  <lb/>Wishing to hand him in a book, the other day, for which he
	  <lb/>subscribed, I was stopped in the passage by a vagabond, in the

	  <lb/>solicit his protection. <persName>Mr. Hill</persName> would scarcely believe me;

	  <lb/>eye a mild blue, and lively benevolent countenance, which also

	  <lb/>soft, and his manners winning and engaging. I did hope he
	  <lb/>would have retained the <name rend="slant(italic)">Messrs. Bradleys</name> in office, and was ne­
	  <lb/>ver more surprized than when I heard they were turned out;
	  <lb/>for, after what he stated to me himself, in their favor, I was
	  <lb/>certain he did not act without good reasons—and so it has prov­

	  <lb/>and poverty of <persName rend="slant(italic)">A. Bradley</persName> was urged in his favor. As to this
	  <lb/>I cannot say; but certain it is, a number of fine houses have
	  <lb/>recently started up in <placeName>Washington</placeName>, belonging to the <name>Bradleys</name>.
	  <lb/>Also, several lines of splendid coaches; and <persName rend="slant(italic)">William A. Brad­
	    <lb/>ley</persName>, of the <orgName>Patriotic Bank</orgName>, rides in a fine carriage. Whatever
	  <lb/>may be my obligations to the father, which are certainly con­
	  <lb/>siderable, it is doing the father no injustice, to say I am under
	  <lb/>very little to his son. He is charged with asserting, that

	  <lb/>ed for food, unknown to the Directresses, and dare not complain.
	  <lb/>Whether this be true or not, I cannot say, though I saw cold

	  <lb/><persName>Clarke</persName>. He is hardly middle aged; tall and spare, with a thin
	  <lb/>fair face, of great expression; with a penetrating blue eye; to

	  <lb/><name>Sunday</name> mail, and the other anti-masonic. <persName rend="slant(italic)">Powers</persName> is a 
	  <lb/>long, showey looking man, with a blood-spilling countenance,
	  <lb/>from <placeName>Auburn</placeName>, the blue skin den, and would terrify <persName>Satan</persName> him­
	  <lb/>self. It is said he is to have the hanging of all the <emph>heretics</emph>.
	  <lb/>He certainly has the most detestable look in the world, whilst,
	  <lb/>on the other hand, <persName rend="slant(italic)">Mr. Rose</persName>, is one of the best looking, and one
	  <lb/>of the best men in <orgName>Congress</orgName>. As for <persName rend="slant(italic)">Messrs. Martindale</persName>, 
	  <persName rend="slant(italic)">Tracy</persName>,
	  <lb/>and <persName rend="slant(italic)">Norton</persName>, the people of 
	  <placeName>New York</placeName> need not send <emph>them</emph> to
	  <lb/><placeName>Washington</placeName> to expose their ignorance. We are perfectly
	  <lb/>aware of it without this sample. If they wish to put down ma­
	  <lb/>sonry, they must send wiser men. The whole of these anti­
	  <lb/>masonic men, are a laughing stock for <orgName>Congress</orgName>. The fools
	  <lb/>are not aware, that it is to masonry they owe the blessings of
	  <lb/>civil and religious liberty.</p>
        <p>The <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> Members, cap the climax, and are still
	  <lb/>more ridiculous, with the exception of <persName rend="slant(italic)">Mr. Ingersall</persName>, whom
	  <lb/>it is said will not serve any longer with such ignoramuses.—
	  <lb/>All for stopping the <name>Sunday</name> mail. May their breaths be stop­
	  <lb/>ped first.</p>
        <p><placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> holds her own.</p>
        <p><placeName>Vermont</placeName> is like <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, gone to the dogs, excepting
	  <lb/><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Jonathan Hunt</hi></persName>. <persName>Mr. H.</persName> is a keen sensible man, of
	  <lb/>high attainments, and a perfect gentleman in his manners.—
	  <lb/>But the good, the gentle, and once polite <persName>E. H.</persName> has been bribed
	  <lb/>either by the <name>Sunday</name> mail <emph>or</emph> the anti-masonic men. It ap­

	  <lb/>more guilty.</p>
        <p><placeName>New Hampshire</placeName> and <placeName>Maine</placeName> are well represented. They
	  <lb/>swept the whole in <placeName>New Hampshire</placeName>, except <persName rend="slant(italic)">Mr. Harvey</persName>. I 
	  <lb/>saw, however, none but the <persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">John W. Weeks</hi></persName>, one of
	  <lb/>the finest men in the House. He is a stout, lofty figure, mid­
	  <lb/>dle age, and round full face; rather dark, with a noble black
	  <lb/>eye, and most engaging countenance and manners.</p>
        <p>From <placeName>Ohio</placeName>, we have the honorable <persName rend="slant(italic)">William Kennon</persName> with
	  <lb/>a blushing face, and intelligent countenance.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">William Creighton</hi></persName>, from same state, is likewise

	  <lb/>fore, is an amiable man. This gentleman is enough to redeem
	  <lb/>the character and conduct of the <placeName>Virginia</placeName> delegation. And
	  <lb/>the <persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">J. S. Barbour</hi></persName>, too,—I met with him at the Presi­
	  <lb/>dent's, and was struck with the elegance of his person, and his
	  <lb/>fascinating manners. We parted with the most cordial friend­
	  <lb/>ship.</p>
        <p>From <placeName>Kentucky</placeName> there are three new Members. I only saw
	  <lb/>the <persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Dr. N. Gaither</hi></persName>. He is a tall, majestic figure,
	  <lb/>quite young; with an intelligent oval face, fine blue eye, and
	  <lb/>dignified manners. He is said to be a man of general informa­
	  <lb/>tion and amiable character.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">General John Thomson</hi></persName>, of <placeName>Ohio</placeName>, overlooked
	  <lb/>in his place, is now a Major General. He is a fine, tall, manly
	  <lb/>figure, rather young looking, with an oval thin face, and keen
	  <lb/>blue eye. His countenance is firm, cool, and dignified; and
	  <lb/>displays a highly cultivated mind. His manners are stately,
	  <lb/>and rather distant.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">John Test</hi></persName>, of <name>Indiana</name>, in place of my friend
	  <lb/><persName>Smith</persName>, is a middle aged sallow looking man, with a keen sen­
	  <lb/>sible look, and reflects much honor on this young and ris­
	  <lb/>ing state.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">Edward D. White</hi></persName>, of <placeName>Louisiana</placeName>, like his name­
	  <lb/>sakes from <placeName>Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName>Florida</placeName>, is a respectable Member,
	  <lb/>of plain, but dignified manners; and his countenance is intelli­
	  <lb/>gent and pleasing.</p>
        <p><persName>Honorable <hi rend="slant(italic)">John Biddle</hi></persName>, of <placeName>Michigan Territory</placeName>, completes
	  <lb/>all I was able to <emph>see</emph> of the new Members. <persName>Mr. Biddle</persName> is a
	  <lb/>young, sensible man, rather distant. His person is very en­
	  <lb/>gaging, and his manners gentlemanly and polite.</p>
        <p>Many important matters are postponed, for no other cause
	  <lb/>than want of room. It is impossible to put the whole world in
	  <lb/>one book. I am confidant my friends will rely upon me for the
