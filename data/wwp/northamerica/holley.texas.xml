has
<lb/>been, literally, a terra incognita. That such a
<lb/>region existed, has, indeed, been known; but in
<lb/>respect to its geography and natural resources,
<lb/>clouds and darkness have rested upon it. This
<lb/>is the more remarkable, lying as it does, contigu­
<lb/>ous to two enlightened nations, the <placeName>United States</placeName>,
<lb/>on the one side, and <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, on the other, being,
<lb/>moreover, very easy of access, both by land and
<lb/>sea. While <name>Britons</name>, impelled by a daring spirit
<lb/>of enterprise, have penetrated to the ice-bound
<lb/>region of <placeName>Melville's Island</placeName>, and our <name>New
<lb/>Englanders</name> have encountered all the hardships
<lb/>and hazards of the western desert, the <placeName>Rocky
<lb/>Mountains</placeName> and hostile <name>Indians</name>, to find a home at
<lb/>the mouth of <placeName>Columbia river</placeName>, this most inviting
<lb/>region, lying just at their doors, has been alto­
<lb/>gether overlooked. Quite unexpectedly, as it
<lb/>were, a report has reached the public ear, that
<mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(2)">1*</mw>

<pb n="6"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="1(3)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">6</mw>
<lb/>the country lying west of the <placeName>Sabine river</placeName>, is a
<lb/>tract of surpassing beauty, exceeding even our
<lb/>best western lands in productiveness, with a
<lb/>climate perfectly salubrious, and of a tempera­
<lb/>ture, at all seasons of the year, most delightful.
<lb/>The admirers of this new country, speaking from
<lb/>actual knowledge, and a personal inspection, are
<lb/>not content, in their descriptions of it, to make
<lb/>use of ordinary terms of commendation. They
<lb/>hestitate not to call it a <emph>splendid</emph> country—an en­
<lb/>chanting spot. It would seem as if enchantment
<lb/>had, indeed, thrown its spell over their minds,
<lb/>for, with very few exceptions, all who return
<lb/>from this fairy land, are perfect enthusiasts in
<lb/>their admiration of it. Whatever qualifications
<lb/>to its excellence, the most cautious of them are
<lb/>disposed to make, have reference to those incon­
<lb/>veniences, which unavoidably pertain to every
<lb/>country in the incipient stages of its settlement.</p>
        <p>So apparently extravagant have been the re­
<lb/>presentations of the natural beauty and resources 
<lb/>of this country, that many persons are incredu­
<lb/>lous, and attribute them to the schemes of inter­
<lb/>ested contractors, eager to allure the unwary
<lb/>emigrant, by deceptive statements. Such a mo­
<lb/>tive, if it really actuates the conduct of any one,

<pb n="7"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="1(4)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">7</mw>
<lb/>cannot be, too severely, condemned. A design
<lb/>more criminal and disgraceful cannot be, easily,
<lb/>conceived of, and ought not to be lightly insinu­
<lb/>ated against respectable men. What design more
<lb/>cruel, than that of deliberately seducing, not the
<lb/>confiding emigrant alone, but, with him, his wife
<lb/>and children, to become the certain victims of
<lb/>privation, disappointment and ultimate ruin, in
<lb/>the wilderness. The character and respectability
<lb/>of the witnesses above referred to, at once, repel
<lb/>an insinuation so atrocious.</p>
        <p>While listening, for the first time, to the
<lb/>favourable reports of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, it must be confessed,
<lb/>a suspicion is very apt to arise in the mind, that
<lb/>so much imputed excellence if it really existed,
<lb/>could not have been so long concealed from the
<lb/>view of the world; and we are prone to ask, how
<lb/>has it happened, that a territory, possessing such
<lb/>uncommon advantage of climate and soil, has not
<lb/>been explored and appropriated before. To this
<lb/>very natural inquiry, a satisfactory answer is at
<lb/>hand.</p>
        <p>Two causes seem to have operated to prevent
<lb/>the earlier settlement of the province of <placeName>Texas</placeName>,
<lb/>and to retard the development of its resources.
<lb/>In the first place, the jealous policy of the old

<pb n="8"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="1(4)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">8</mw>
<lb/>Spanish government, uniformly discouraged all
<lb/>attempts to penetrate into the country. It was
<lb/>the policy of the government, that completely
<lb/>locked up <placeName>Texas</placeName>, and all the Spanish American
<lb/>possessions, and excluded even visiters and travel­
<lb/>lers. It was a favourite saying of the Spanish
<lb/>Captain General of the internal provinces, <persName>Don
<lb/>Nemisio Salcedo</persName>, that he would stop the birds
<lb/>from flying over the boundary line between <placeName>Texas</placeName>
<lb/>and the <placeName>United States</placeName>, if it were in his power.
<lb/>This rigid policy prevented any one from at­
<lb/>tempting to explore the country by land, for
<lb/>perpetual imprisonment was the inevitable result
<lb/>of detection and capture.</p>
        <p>In the second place, the <name>Carancahua Indians</name>,
<lb/>who inhabited the coast, were represented to be
<lb/>of a character, uncommonly ferocious. They
<lb/>were, popularly, believed to be cannibals, and
<lb/>many tales of most frightful import, were told,
<lb/>of them; such as, if true, it must be acknowledg­
<lb/>ed, were sufficiently appaling to check the enter­
<lb/>prise, and damp the ardour of the most eager ad­
<lb/>venturer. These representations of the charac­
<lb/>ter of the <name>Carancahuas</name>, though, in a measure
<lb/>true, were, greatly, exaggerated; and it is be­
<lb/>lieved by many, that they were either fabricated

<pb n="9"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="1(5)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">9</mw>
<lb/>or at least countenanced, by the Spanish authori­
<lb/>ties, to prevent intercourse with the Province,
<lb/>which it was not easy to guard by a military
<lb/>force. Thus, the whole of this country remain­
<lb/>ed for ages unknown to the world, and instead
<lb/>of being converted into an abode of industrious
<lb/>and happy freemen, as it might have been, it was
<lb/>doomed by the selfishness of men, to continue a 
<lb/>howling wilderness. No maps, charts or geo­
<lb/>graphical notices, were ever allowed by the 
<lb/><name>Spaniards</name> to be taken of it. The map, compiled
<lb/>by <persName>Col. Austin</persName>, and published by <persName>Tanner</persName>, is the
<lb/>first and only correct geographical information of 
<lb/>the country, that has been ever published. The
<lb/>persons who were engaged in the expeditions
<lb/>under <persName>Generals Bernardo</persName>, <persName>Guitierrez</persName> and <persName>Toledo</persName>, 
<lb/>in <date from="1812" to="1813">1812-13</date>, knew nothing of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, except 
<lb/>along and near, the road they travelled, for they
<lb/>were too much occupied, by the war, during the
<lb/>short time, they had possession, to explore the
<lb/>country. It is uncertain how long this extensive
<lb/>and valuable country would have remained un­
<lb/>known and unsettled, had not the bold enterprise
<lb/>and perseverance of the <name>Austins</name>, torn away the
<lb/>veil that hid it from the view of the world, and
<lb/>redeemed it from the wilderness, by the settle­

<pb n="10"/>

<lb/>ment of a flourishing colony of <name>North Americans</name>,
	  <lb/>on the <placeName>Brazos</placeName> and <placeName>Colorado rivers</placeName>. With the
<lb/>settlement of this colony, a new era has dawned
	  <lb/>upon <placeName>Texas</placeName>. The natural riches of this beauti­
	  <lb/>ful Province have begun to be unfolded, and its
<lb/>charms displayed, to the eyes of admiring adven­
<lb/>turers. A new island, as it were, has been dis­
<lb/>covered, in these latter days, at our very doors,
<lb/>apparently fresh from the hands of its Maker,
<lb/>and adapted, beyond most lands, both to delight
<lb/>the senses, and enrich the pockets, of those, who
<lb/>are disposed to accept of its bounties.</p>
        <p>Without any assistance from the government,
<lb/>or fostering care of any sort, but simply under a
<lb/>permission to enter, some thousands of industrious
<lb/>farmers and mechanics, with their families, have
<lb/>already located themselves here. Their numbers
<lb/>are rapidly increasing, and there cannot be a 
	  <lb/>doubt, that, in a few years, <placeName>Texas</placeName> will become
<lb/>one of the most thriving, if not the most popu­
<lb/>lous, of the <placeName>Mexican States</placeName>.</p>
        <p>Of the numerous contracts for purposes of
<lb/>colonization, made by the Mexican Government
<lb/>with individuals and companies, few of those of
<lb/>early date, for causes, which it is not necessary
<lb/>now to mention, have proved successful, while

	  <lb/>that of <persName>Col. Austin</persName>, to which the following letters
<lb/>have especial reference, has been eminently so.
<lb/>The author of these letters, made a visit of ob­
<lb/>servation to this colony, in the autumn of <date when="1831">1831</date>,
<lb/>with a view to the ultimate settlement of herself
<lb/>and family. Many of her friends did not hesitate
<lb/>to condemn the enterprise as romantic, and too
<lb/>adventurous for a female. Allured however, by
<lb/>the flattering representations of the country,
<lb/>made to her, by persons in whose judgment she
<lb/>placed implicit confidence, and tempted by the
<lb/>very liberal terms of settlement proposed by the
<lb/>colonization laws; but, above all, impelled by a
<lb/>desire, which every widowed mother will know
<lb/>how to appreciate, of making some provision for
<lb/>an only son, a provision, which, if not immediate­
<lb/>ly available, cannot fail to be ample, at some
<lb/>future day; favoured, also, by a previous personal
<lb/>acquaintance with <persName>Col. Austin</persName> himself, and en­
<lb/>couraged by a brother already established in the
<lb/>country, she resolved to go. But previous to a 
<lb/>final removal from her native land, prudence dic­
<lb/>tated, that she should first cast an eye of obser­
<lb/>vation over the ground, the probable scene of
<lb/>her future weal or woe.</p>

        <p>The result of her expedition was, a decided
<lb/>purpose of removal, as soon as domestic arrange­
<lb/>ments would permit. Her most sanguine im­
<lb/>pressions of the natural advantages of the country,
<lb/>both with regard to the salubrity of the climate,
<lb/>the fertility of the soil, and the facility with which 
<lb/>the lands can be brought under cultivation, were
<lb/>confirmed, and, without further hesitation, she
<lb/>determined to choose this spot for her home.</p>
        <p>To the enterprising public, especially to emi­
<lb/>grants, the following letters, in the hope of being 
<lb/>useful, are respectfully presented.</p>
        <p>The publication of them was suggested, by
<lb/>the notice of some queries, by the <orgName>London Geo­
<lb/>graphical Society</orgName>, regarding the localities, the
<lb/>moral and physical capabilities and prospects of
	  <lb/><placeName>Texas</placeName>, with a view to emigration, to which que­
<lb/>ries a distinct, and it is believed, satisfactory re­
<lb/>ply, will be found, in the subsequent pages. The
<lb/>commands of numerous friends, to whom a visit
	  <lb/>to <placeName>Texas</placeName> seemed little less marvellous, than the
	  <lb/>wanderings of <persName>Dante</persName> on the other side of the <placeName>Styx</placeName>,
<lb/>enjoined upon her, <emph>to observe and tell them all about 
<lb/>the country</emph>, and to assure them, whether it were,
	  <lb/>or were not, a <emph>fabulous land</emph>.</p>

        <p>The public mind, seemed to require, more
<lb/>just, more distinct, and detailed information, than
<lb/>had, hitherto, been given: many persons, disposed
<lb/>to emigrate to this fair portion of the earth, need­
<lb/>ed assurance, that the natives do not <emph>kill and eat
<lb/>people</emph> there, nor always insult and rob them. It
<lb/>has been thought, that an exact representation of
<lb/>things, <emph>just as they are</emph>, in this beautiful and fertile
<lb/>country, where the greatest abundance of all valu­
<lb/>able and substantial possessions, are the easy and
<lb/>certain reward of industry and perseverance,
<lb/>would be acceptable.</p>
        <p>Emigration is, often, undertaken with expec­
<lb/>tations so vague and preposterous, that, disap­
<lb/>pointment, if not ruin, is the inevitable conse­
<lb/>quence. Not more unreasonable were the emi­
	  <lb/>grants of the early history of <placeName>America</placeName>, who ex­
<lb/>pected to find streets, paved with gold, because
	  <lb/>that metal abounds in the mines of <placeName>Mexico</placeName> and
	  <lb/><placeName>Peru</placeName>, than are those individuals of the present
<lb/>day, who, escaping from confinement and pover­
	  <lb/>ty in the northern cities of <placeName>America</placeName>, or from the
<lb/>slavery and wretchedness of the crowded and op­
	  <lb/>pressed communities of <placeName>Europe</placeName>, complain of their
	  <lb/>disappointments in <placeName>Texas</placeName>, because, forsooth, they
	  <lb/>do not find in <placeName>Brazoria</placeName> and <placeName>San Felipe</placeName>, the <placeName>Phi­

<lb/>ladelphia</placeName> market and streets lighted with gas.
<lb/>Such persons would do well to ask themselves, in
<lb/>what part of the world, they can get land for
<lb/>nothing?—where obtain so many enjoyments, with
<lb/>so little labor? What region combines every
<lb/>good?</p>
        <p>The idle and the vicious, as it happens every
	  <lb/>where, will be sure to be disappointed in <placeName>Texas</placeName>.
	  <lb/>Like the hero of <persName>Milton</persName>, such characters carry
<lb/>their discontent with them.</p>
        <p>A soil, that yields the fruits of nearly every 
<lb/>latitude, almost spontaneously, with a climate of
<lb/>perpetual summer, must, like that of other coun­
<lb/>tries, have a seed-time and a harvest. Though
<lb/>the land be , literally flowing with milk and ho­
<lb/>ney, yet, the cows must be milked, and the honey
<lb/>must be gathered. Houses must be built and
<lb/>enclosures made. The deer must be hunted, and
<lb/>the fish must be caught. From the primeval
<lb/>curse, that, in the sweat of his brow, man shall
<lb/>eat bread, though its severity be mollified, there
<lb/>is no exemption, even here. The emigrant should
<lb/>bear in mind, that in a new community, <emph>labour</emph> is
<lb/>the most valuable commodity. He sees about 
<lb/>him, all the means for supplying, not only the
<lb/>necessaries, but also, the comforts and luxuries of

<pb n="15"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2(2)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">15</mw>
<lb/>life. It is his part, to apply them to his use. He
<lb/>is, abundantly, furnished, with the raw materials;
<lb/>but his hands must mould them into the forms of
<lb/>art.</p>
        <p>With a view to emigrant mothers, on whom
<lb/>the comfort of every family, and the general well-
<lb/>being of the infant colony, so much depends, it
<lb/>has been thought that, a journal in detail, of one
<lb/>of themselves, would furnish more hints for the
<lb/>judicious arrangements of the voyage and the in­
<lb/>dispensable attentions to the comfort and economy
<lb/>of an infant establishment, than could be gathered
<lb/>from the more abstract and general views of gen­
<lb/>tleman travellers. Many trivial circumstances
<lb/>are, therefore, introduced, not with a view to 
	  <lb/><emph>amuse</emph>, but to be applied to some useful end.
<lb/>Much incident, calculated to interest the general
<lb/>reader, is not to be expected. But the author
<lb/>having ample means of information, may, without
<lb/>vanity, indulge one hope, as she professes but one
<lb/>aim—utility.</p>

	<lb/>of my movements during my visit to <placeName>Texas</placeName>. I 
<lb/>shall first give you an account of my voyage; you

<lb/>too short to admit of much incident or observation.
<lb/>As for that matter, I might have travelled farther
<lb/>and learned less. What useful knowledge was to

<lb/>be gathered by traversing the unbroken wilder­
<lb/>ness, or gazing upon the boundless prairie? I
	<lb/>might have seen more trees, more <name>Indians</name>, and
<lb/>more wild beasts. I consider myself most fortu­
<lb/>nate, indeed, in having met, so soon after my
<lb/>arrival in the colony, with the very persons, who,
<lb/>doubtless, are more competent, than any other 
<lb/>individuals living, to give the information I de­
<lb/>sired; men who had, personally, inspected the 
<lb/>land, in its length and breadth, had explored its
<lb/>rivers, and surveyed its coast; men who were
<lb/>perfectly familiar with its whole history from the
<lb/>beginning, and were the best judges that could
<lb/>be, of its present capabilities, and future prospects.
<lb/>I need not say, that one of these gentlemen, was
	  <lb/><persName>Col. Austin</persName> himself. But, I will not anticipate,
<lb/>so, to begin with my voyage.</p>
        <p>I took passage, for the Colony, in the schoon­
	<lb/>er <name>Spica</name>, sixty tons, <persName>captain D――</persName>. A larger
<lb/>vessel would not answer for the navigation of the
	<lb/><placeName>Brazos</placeName>, on account of a troublesome bar, at the
<lb/>mouth of the river. I was, therefore, obliged to
<lb/>content myself, with small accommodations.
<lb/>They were, however, neat and comfortable.
<lb/>The cabin, appropriated to the ladies, had but
<lb/>two berths, which had been taken by two of my

<pb n="19"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2(4)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">19</mw>
<lb/>fellow travellers, one of which had several chil­
<lb/>dren. A lodging place, was, therefore, arranged
<lb/>for me, on the transom, far more comfortable, 
<lb/>and with a better circulation of air, than the
<lb/>berths afforded. Another lady joined us, after­
<lb/>wards, and our little cabin, as you may well sup­
<lb/>pose, was completely filled, with ourselves and
<lb/>baggage.</p>
        <p>The captain was a <name>Bostonian</name>, polite and
<lb/>agreeable, and what was yet more to the pur­
<lb/>pose in hand, an excellent seaman. He had
	<lb/>been in the <placeName>India</placeName> and <placeName>Mediterranean</placeName> trade, and in
<lb/>the service of the <placeName>United States</placeName> as commander
<lb/>of a <name>Revenue Cutter</name>. He had been recently
<lb/><soCalled rend="slant(italic)">reformed out of office</soCalled>, as the phrase is. But
<lb/>having known many honest citizens in the same 
<lb/>predicament, we were not the more distrustful
<lb/>of him on that acount. It  was a satisfaction to 
<lb/>know that he had seen service, and was a seaman
<lb/>of experience, for our voyage, though short, is,
<lb/>sometimes, not without hazard, on account of the
<lb/><name xml:id="a01" rend="slant(italic)post(*)" corresp="#n01">Northers</name>; as they are called. The passengers,
<lb/>though strangers, were respectable, and I
<lb/>promised myself a safe and agreeable trip.</p>

        <p>I was on board at the time appointed, <name>Tuesday</name>, 
<lb/><date when="1831-10-18"><name>October</name> 18</date>, at three o'clock. We were to sail
<lb/>at four. All hands were punctual—every thing
<lb/>ready. I took my seat, with the other passengers
<lb/>on deck, engaged in conversation with some
<lb/>friends, while waiting for the tow steamer, to
	<lb/>conduct us to the mouth of the <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>.
<lb/>Thus occupied, I did not regard the lapse of 
<lb/>time, until the sun went down, and no steamer
<lb/>came. My attention was aroused, by a philippic
<lb/>of our captain, against a certain class of people
<lb/>in <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>, for their faithlessness, and utter
<lb/>disregard of their engagements. He was, how­
<lb/>ever, extremely moderate, considering the disap­
<lb/>pointment, inconvenience and delay, we were
<lb/>about to suffer. It was now too late to proceed
<lb/>for this day. The musquetos were troublesome.
<lb/>There was no alternative, but to go on shore:
<lb/>which most of us did, with the utmost good
<lb/>nature, not much displeased, in fact, with the
<lb/>prospect of one more night, of comfortable re­
	<lb/>pose, without <emph>rocking</emph>. So here is good night to
<lb/>you. We will take a fresh start in the morning.</p>

        <p rend="first-indent(0)"><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> next day, at the appointed hour, we were
<lb/>all at our quarters. The captain of the tow-boat
<lb/>sent word, that he would be along for us about
<lb/>sun-set. But, our captain doubtless thinking one
<lb/>good turn deserves another, without giving him
<lb/>notice, made a different arrangement, and before
<lb/>that time, we were attached to the smoking sides 
<lb/>of the <name rend="slant(italic)">Shark</name>, balanced by another schooner on
<lb/>the opposite side, and under way for sea.</p>
        <p>The skies were soft—our spirits buoyant,
<lb/>and under the influence of sanguine hopes, we
<lb/>were willing to consider these little delays, as
<lb/>the most serious, if not the most amusing, of our
<lb/>adventures. We moved smoothly down the cur­
<lb/>rent, during a glowing sun-set, succeeded by a
<lb/>full moon, giving a romantic beauty to the luxu­
<lb/>riant and cultivated shores.</p>
        <p>I had now, an opportunity to notice my fellow
<lb/>travellers. They were all bound, like myself, to
<lb/><mcr>the land of promise</mcr>, on a tour of observation, with

<pb n="22"/>

<mw type="pageNum">22</mw>
<lb/>reference to a permanent residence. A better as­
<lb/>sortment of professions and character, for an in­
<lb/>fant colony, could not have been selected. An
<lb/>editor of a gazette from <placeName>Michigan</placeName>—a civil en­
<lb/>gineer, from <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>—a trader from <placeName>Missouri</placeName>,
<lb/>with his bride along, and an outfit of dry goods—
<lb/>a genteel good looking widow, on a visit to her
<lb/>son—with a suitable proportion of the working
<lb/>class.</p>
        <p>At day-light, the next morning, the tow-boat
<lb/>left us, to pursue our solitary course, in the great
<lb/>gulph, which spread its deep waters before us.
<lb/>We pressed onward, while she tacked about, to 
<lb/>offer assistance to a ship and four brigs, which
<lb/>were waiting for an escort to the city we had
<lb/>left.</p>
        <p>We stood out for sea, with a gentle breeze
<lb/>from the south-east. Soon we were sensible of
<lb/>the change of motion. We began to find it dif­
<lb/>ficult to preserve our equilibrium, and very short­
<lb/>ly, most of us were compelled to yield to the 
<lb/>sickening influence of the sea, our sufferings from
<lb/>this cause, being not a little aggravated by the
<lb/>pitchings and tossings, of so small a vessel. My
<lb/>mattress was spread on deck, for I could not en­
<lb/>dure the closeness of the cabin. Under other

<pb n="23"/>

<lb/>circumstances, what a delightful situation was
<lb/>this for contemplation. The resplendent sky
<lb/>above, around me, on every side, the sea, ever 
<lb/>glorious and beautiful. But, nothing, just then,
<lb/>was capable of inspiring me with sentimental
<lb/>emotions, nothing could counteract the morbid
<lb/>sensations which oppressed both my body and
<lb/>mind. The other ladies and some of the gentle­
<lb/>men, were in the same predicament, making a 
	  <lb/>most poetical group—poetry, after the <persName>Hogarth</persName>
<lb/>school.</p>
        <p>Our progress was rapid. We met no sail,
<lb/>and encountered no adventure. On the evening
<lb/>of the second day we had a gale, sufficiently vio­
<lb/>lent to frighten ladies, but not so much so as to
<lb/>endanger the vessel, the wind blowing off shore.
<lb/>The storm was soon over, leaving a swelling sea.
<lb/>I cannot say that night was the most agreeable I
<lb/>ever passed, being prostrated by sickness, and 
<lb/>having eaten nothing for two days. I would ad­
<lb/>vise all who take this voyage, to carry a liberal
<lb/>supply of oranges with them. This fruit is most
<lb/>refreshing to the lips, and has a relish, when 
<lb/>every other article of food seems insipid.</p>
        <p>The morning of <date when="1831-10-22"><name>October</name> 22d</date>, was fair and
<lb/>bright, and land to our great joy was announced.

	  <lb/>After dinner, the mouth of the <placeName>Brazos</placeName> lay before
<lb/>us. It was less than three days, since we parted
<lb/>from the levee, in <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>. We cast an­
<lb/>chor and sent off a boat for a pilot, and to take 
<lb/>soundings on the bar. The pilot came on board.
<lb/>He is an <name>American</name>, of gentlemanly deportment,
<lb/>and lives at the point of land, formed by the
	  <lb/><placeName>Brazos</placeName> with the gulf. Here there is a Mexican
<lb/>garrison, and the tri-colored flag is hoisted, the 
<lb/>first signal of our approach to a foreign land.
<lb/>He reported, that in consequence of the high
<lb/>wind, the night before, there were but four feet
	  <lb/>of water on the bar, that tide, and the <name>Spica</name>,
<lb/>drawing six feet, it would be necessary for us to
<lb/>remain where we were, until the next morning,
<lb/>when he would conduct us over.</p>
        <p>We had now leisure to survey our position—
<lb/>to recover our spirits and the use of our feet; to
<lb/>fish and amuse ourselves, and to enjoy the grateful
<lb/>feelings which succeed to moments of suffering
<lb/>and danger.</p>
        <p>On our right, in front of their palmetto-roof­
<lb/>ed, and windowless barracks, the lazy sentinels
<lb/>were <quote>walking their lonely rounds,</quote> without ex­
<lb/>cessive martial parade; nor did the unturretted
<lb/>quarters of the commanding officer, show forth

<lb/>much of the blazonry of a Spanish Don. There
<lb/>was no tree, no cultivation. A uniform verdure,
<lb/>alone, indicated the season of the year. Nothing
<lb/>marked civilization, save a fabric for making salt;
<lb/>itself an image of desolation, and the solitary
<lb/>house of the pilot, standing high on piles, serving,
<lb/>at once, for a beacon for the mariner, and a refuge
<lb/>from the storm. The whole appearance of the 
<lb/>scene, at the north, with the associations of a 
<lb/>northern climate, would be called bleak; but in
<lb/>this latitude, the dark blue sea, when not made
<lb/>terrific by a storm, always suggests agreeable
<lb/>images to the mind, especially that of a refreshing
<lb/>coolness.</p>
        <p>We amused ourselves, while lying here, with
<lb/>dissecting some of those curious links, between 
<lb/>the vegetable and animal kingdoms, called sun­
<lb/>fish. They were large and delicately white and
<lb/>transparent; formed, not unlike a flower of the
<lb/>rose shape, partially expanded, and placed in a 
<lb/>saucer. At first view, one is disposed to call it a
<lb/>vegetable; but, on applying the knife, it shrinks
<lb/>and quivers, as from a sensation of pain, es­
<lb/>pecially, the saucer part of it. The saucer, is
<lb/>obviously and beautifully designed by its author,
<lb/>as a boat for the little mariner. The collapsing,

<lb/>irregular, had not yet recovered from the in­
<lb/>fluence of the storm, nor attained its usual height,
<lb/>though there was no hope of its being higher, 
<lb/>that day. This bar presents a serious obstruction
<lb/>to the navigation of the river. Vessels have
<lb/>been, indeed, wrecked, in crossing it, and none
<lb/>but strong vessels, or such as are of light draught,
<lb/>should attempt it. It is to be hoped, and may

<lb/>commerce will justify the expense, this bar will be,
<lb/>in a good measure, removed by the hand of art.</p>
        <p>This bar is not peculiar to the <placeName>Brazos river</placeName>.
<lb/>Bars are common to all the rivers of this coast.
<lb/>They are formed by the prevalence of the 
<lb/>southerly winds, which act in a direction contrary
<lb/>to that of the stream, and by checking and dis­
<lb/>persing the current, cause a deposite of the sand,
<lb/>which the water brings with it.</p>
        <p>Vessels arriving after the commencement of
<lb/>the northers, as they are called, which is, gene­
<lb/>rally about the last of <name>November</name>, are sometimes
<lb/>blown off to sea, for weeks. When they re­
<lb/>turn to the coast, there is much danger, that the
<lb/>southern breezes, not always gently blowing, may
<lb/>dash them against the bar. The moment of
<lb/>arrival, therefore, is a moment of great anxiety,
<lb/>as well as of joy, and all hands pray for fair
<lb/>weather, and <quote xml:id="a02" rend="pre()post(*)slant(italic)" corresp="#n02">whistle for favouring gales.</quote> We

<lb/>interesting river, and has one peculiarity which is
<lb/>very remarkable. Its head waters spring in the 
<lb/><name>Comanche</name> country, and consequently, are but
<lb/>little known. It has the very peculiar feature, in 
<lb/>one of its branches, which has no parallel in any
<lb/>part of the world—a salt water river running
<lb/>from the interior towards the sea.</p>
        <p>The westernmost branch has its source, in an

<lb/>Mountain</placeName>, of which so much was said and sung,

<lb/>plain, of one or two hundred miles, in extent, the
<lb/>land of which, is charged with mineral salt, and
<lb/>on which nitre is deposited by the atmosphere.
<lb/>The rains dissolve this salt. When, in the dry
<lb/>season, the water is evaporated, the salt is de­
<lb/>posited, in immense quantities, and the whole
<lb/>plain is covered with chrystalized salt. When,
<lb/>on the other hand the rains are copious, an ex­

        <p>The freshet produced in the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>, by the

<mw type="pageNum">29</mw>
<lb/>them a fine red clay, as slippery as soap, and as
<lb/>sticky as putty. This clay is deposited, on the
<lb/>shores of the river, and retains its saltness, as
<lb/>does the water its brackish, or slightly saltish,
<lb/>taste, until a freshet produced by the fresh
<lb/>branches, washes it away, or covers it up, when
<lb/>the river becomes fresh and potable, and con­
<lb/>tinues so, until another rise in the salt branch.</p>
        <p>We came to, before the door of the pilot's
<lb/>house, which fronts the stream. The officer of
<lb/>the garrison boarded us, to examine our passports,
<lb/>a ceremony, the <name>Mexicans</name> are very tenacious of,
<lb/>from their known jealousy of foreigners. He
<lb/>was a young man, dark and rather handsome, in
<lb/>a neat Mexican uniform, probably his dress-suit,
<lb/>for occasions of so much company, are not of
<lb/>every day occurrence, on this station. He very
<lb/>politely, addressed our captain, in a few words
<lb/>of <name>English</name>, probably, his whole vocabulary;
<lb/>while the latter displayed to best advantage, in 
<lb/>reply, his whole stock of <name>Spanish</name>. Saluting us
<lb/>gracefully, as he passed, the business of passports
<lb/>was soon adjusted in the cabin. Ours were spoken
<lb/>of, and inquired about; but with courtly com­
<lb/>plaisance, and gallant reliance upon a lady's word,
<lb/>he waived the ceremony of examination, and

<lb/>saved us the trouble of searching our trunks for
<lb/>them.</p>
        <p>Our sails were now spread to a fair, light
	  <lb/>breeze, upon the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>. We proceeded gaily,
<lb/>with the accession of spirits, our good fortune
<lb/>had inspired, for about four miles. The river,
<lb/>for that distance is deep, but partially obstructed,
<lb/>at one spot, by a sunken vessel. The average
	  <lb/>width of the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>, from its mouth, to <placeName>Bolivar</placeName>,
<lb/>is about fifty yards. Its average depth, from 
<lb/>three to five fathoms. A slight flaw of wind
<lb/>took us, suddenly, too far towards the left bank;
<lb/>the tide left us, and there we stuck fast. Here 
<lb/>we remained another day, waiting for the evening 
<lb/>tide. Thou<supplied reason="flawed-reproduction">gh</supplied> impatient to proceed, we made a
<lb/>virtue of ne<supplied reason="flawed-reproduction">cess</supplied>ity, and did not permit the hours
<lb/>to drag heavily upon our hands. The gentemen
<lb/>went ashore to hunt, and the ladies amused them­
<lb/>selves with fishing. Wild fowl of every de­
<lb/>scription, were continually passing over our 
<lb/>heads, while ducks, snipe and curlews, were in
<lb/>constant motion, among the high grass of the
<lb/>shore.</p>
        <p>The next tide, happily, took us from our
<lb/>moorings and our sports, and soon opened to us,

        <p>The alternate woodland and prairie, which
	  <lb/>make the peculiar beauty of a <placeName>Texas</placeName> landscape,
<lb/>commenced, with small intervals: now the glossy
<lb/>boughs of the one, hanging over the river's brink,
<lb/>and now the rich grass of the other, extending,
<lb/>as far as the eye could reach. Nothing was
<lb/>wanting, but neat white dwellings, to complete
<lb/>the picture. The lawns were as smooth as art
<lb/>could make them, and the trees, sometimes in
<lb/>clumps, sometimes in avenues, seemed to display
<lb/>the hand of taste. The sun and the air, seemed
<lb/>brighter and softer, than elsewhere. We were,

        <p>Thus we moved onward, through a day of 
<lb/>gentle pleasure, feeling, as if we, alone, were the
<lb/>possessors, of this beautiful creation: for we saw
<lb/>not a human creature, nor any trace of one. We
<lb/>admired the variety of foliage, much of which

<pb n="32"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="3(4)v"/>

<lb/>was new to us, all in the hues of spring, and the

	  <lb/>in the whole course of the <placeName>Ohio</placeName> and <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>,
	  <lb/>for quiet beauty, to be compared with the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>.
<lb/>So much were we excited, one and all, by our

        <p rend="first-indent(0)"><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> shores of the <placeName>Brazos</placeName> are not flat, though
<lb/>never bold, but undulating and graceful. The
<lb/>prairies, only are level, gently sloping towards
<lb/>the bay. The trees of larger growth are some­
<lb/>times covered with Spanish moss, as on the shores 
	  <lb/>of the <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>. But these bearded non-de­
<lb/>scripts are not so frequent as to give the sensation
<lb/>of gloom; nor is there any cypress, to increase
<lb/>that effect on the mind. Where the land is of,
<lb/>comparatively, recent formation, the growth is of
<lb/>willow and cotton wood, with occasional young
<lb/>sycamores; but this is not very frequent. The
	  <lb/><placeName>Brazos</placeName> pursues the noiseless tenour of its way,
<lb/>and never overflows its banks, in its whole
<lb/>course, of many hundred miles. In colour, it is
	  <lb/>more red than the <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>, or the <placeName>Missouri</placeName>,
<lb/>and resembles that of the <placeName>Red river</placeName>. From the
<lb/>centre, both shores show to advantage. There
	  <lb/>is no caving in, no <mcr>cut offs</mcr>, no dead timber, and
<lb/>scarcely a snag. Nature in its solitudes, is quiet

<pb n="34"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="3(5)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">34</mw>
<lb/>and lovely, and subject, here, to no violence.
<lb/>Such, at least, was its aspect, when I saw it. I
<lb/>have been informed, it is not always so. In the
<lb/>common stage of water, it is justly represented
<lb/>by images of gentleness and peace. The water
<lb/>is, then, tranquil, and its onward movement, silent
<lb/>and uniform. Where it is seldom disturbed, as
	  <lb/>above <placeName>Brazoria</placeName>, it is as smooth as a mirror,
<lb/>slightly tinged with green. I am told, indeed,
	  <lb/>that all the rivers of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, when undisturbed by
<lb/>freshets, have this greenish hue, like the sea in
<lb/>shallow water.</p>
        <p>When, on the contrary, the mountain torrents,
<lb/>pour down, with their infusions of red clay, the
	  <lb/><placeName>Brazos</placeName> becomes dark and furious, tearing away
<lb/>all obstructions of its channel, but never carrying
<lb/>away its banks. In its former state, it may be
<lb/>compared, in tranquility, to a lamb: in the latter,
<lb/>to a roaring lion, foaming with blood.</p>
        <p>Thus its name, <name xml:lang="es" rend="pre(“)post(”)">El Brazos de Dios,</name> is sig­
<lb/>nificant of its character; being placid and benefi­
<lb/>cent in repose—mighty and terrible in wrath.</p>
        <p>We saw but one alligator. These creatures
<lb/>are lazy and harmless, and not ferocious, devour­
<lb/>ing animals, as some suppose. You must tread
<lb/>on them, as they lie baking in the sun, before

<lb/>they will move, and then, they slowly drag their
<lb/>clumsy length along. This one was fired at, and
<lb/>twice hit, without stirring, and a billet of wood,
<lb/>at last, drove him into his natural element. We
<lb/>were near to him, and closely inspected his ugly 
<lb/>proportions. Never was such odious deformity.</p>
        <p>We have not been, at all, incommoded by
<lb/>mosquetos, or other insects, during this voyage,
<lb/>and have, but two nights, made use of mosqueto 
<lb/>bars.</p>
        <p>We reached <placeName>Brazoria</placeName> on the evening of the
<lb/><date when="1831-12-26">26th</date>, being the third day from the mouth of the
	  <lb/>river, and the sixth, from <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>. Thus,
<lb/>had we not been detained by the bar, and by
<lb/>getting aground, we should have made the whole
<lb/>passage in four days. The last ten miles, we had
	  <lb/>to <term rend="slant(italic)">warp</term>, as the sailors term it, the turns were so
<lb/>numerous, and the wind so fitful and faint. It
<lb/>certainly cannot be long, before all tedious delays
<lb/>from this cause, will be remedied by the inter­
<lb/>position of steam power. Never, was a river
	  <lb/>better calculated than the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>, whether we
<lb/>consider its depth, its placid current, or unob­
<lb/>structed channel, for the perfect operation of the 
<lb/>steam engine. At present, they say, there is not
<lb/>enough of business to defray the expense of a

<lb/>steamboat. The experiment has been made. But
<lb/>the tide of population is setting in so strongly and 
<lb/>trade increasing so rapidly, that this objection,
<lb/>must of course, be speedily removed.</p>
        <p>Some of the passengers, tired of confinement,
<lb/>went ashore, to exercise their limbs and survey
<lb/>the land. They proceeded to town on foot, and
<lb/>arrived there long before us. They saw many
<lb/>deer, in their walk. They, with the male po­
<lb/>pulation, en masse, stood on the shore, the future
	  <lb/>quay, to welcome us. An arrival at <placeName>Brazoria</placeName>, is
<lb/>an event of some moment; and the schooner
	  <lb/><name>Spica</name> excited a far livelier interest than the <name>Lady
<lb/>Clinton</name> or the <name>Benjamin Franklin</name> usually do in
	  <lb/>the docks of <placeName>New York</placeName> and <placeName>Boston</placeName>. The <mcr rend="slant(italic)">port</mcr>
<lb/>was not crowded with shipping, nor would it be
<lb/>slander to allude to <mcr rend="slant(italic)">grass-grown</mcr> streets. We
<lb/>were safely moored among tall masts (the only
<lb/>masts there) still flourishing in all their leafy
<lb/>honors. Not a <mcr rend="slant(italic)">naked spar</mcr>, save ours, was to be
<lb/>seen, nor an inch of canvass, to dispute the su­
<lb/>premacy of nature over art.</p>
        <p>The staging being adjusted, we were soon
<lb/>boarded, not by Spanish myrmidons, or cannibal
	  <lb/><name>Indians</name>, but by friends and kinsmen, all of the
<lb/>same complexion with ourselves, and speaking

<lb/>our native tongue. The letter bag was the first
<lb/>object of curiosity, and its interesting contents
<lb/>were soon searched.</p>
        <p>Too much must not be expected of <placeName>Brazoria</placeName>.
<lb/>It is not located in a prairie, where nothing was
<lb/>to be done to prepare the foundation of the rising
<lb/>city, but to mark off its lines with compass and
<lb/>chain; but upon a wooded elevation of poach­
<lb/>land, as it is called. This spot was chosen as
<lb/>the most commanding and healthful, besides com­
<lb/>bining other advantages. It has, therefore, to
<lb/>dispute empire with the lords of the forest, which
<lb/>are paying tribute to the power of man, in every
<lb/>possible position, from the erect to the prostrate.
	  <lb/>One street stretches along the bank of the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>, 
<lb/>and one parallel with it farther back, while other
<lb/>streets, with the trees still standing, are laid out 
<lb/>to intersect these at right angles, to be cleared at
<lb/>some future day, as the wants of the citizens may
<lb/>require. Its arrangements, as well as its wealth
<lb/>and greatness, are all prospective. A speedy
<lb/>settlement and a rapid growth in population and
<lb/>importance, are calculated upon with perfect cer­
<lb/>tainty. Nor will these calculations appear un­
<lb/>reasonable, when we consider that it is but three
<lb/>years since the first tree was cut, and it now

<lb/>contains fifty families, many of which are of the
<lb/>first respectability. A stranger is more surprised 
<lb/>to see brick stores and frame dwelling houses,
<lb/>than disposed to complain that he does not find
<lb/>more elegance and convenience.</p>
        <p><placeName>Brazoria</placeName> gives constant employment to the
<lb/>few carpenters there, so many buildings are re­
<lb/>quired by the rapid increase of population from
<lb/>abroad. Every body here is employed, and 
<lb/>every house occupied. Some families, recently
	  <lb/>arrived, are obliged to <mcr>camp out</mcr>, from the im­
<lb/>practicability of getting other accommodation.
<lb/>The place has, therefore, a busy and prosperous
<lb/>air, which it is always agreeable to notice, but
<lb/>has not yet advanced beyond the wants of first
<lb/>necessity. There is neither cabinet-maker,
<lb/>tailor, hatter, shoe-maker, nor any other me­
<lb/>chanic, except carpenters above mentioned, not
<lb/>even a blacksmith. Such persons would, of
<lb/>course, find encouragement and business. By
<lb/>combining agriculture with their trade, they need
<lb/>not fear a want of employment. The useful arts
<lb/>only are likely to be encouraged in a new colony.
<lb/>Sound policy, indeed, should teach the colonists 
<lb/>to look coldly on whatever tends to extravagance 
<lb/>of any kind.</p>

        <p><placeName>Brazoria</placeName> is thirty miles from the mouth of
	  <lb/>the <placeName>Brazos</placeName> by the meanders of the river, and
<lb/>fifteen by land. It is situated on the right bank,
<lb/>and contains from two to three hundred inhabit­
<lb/>ants. It has a very good boarding-house, that
<lb/>is, one that furnishes every thing that absolute
<lb/>necessity requires, in neatness and good order.
<lb/>The proprietors of it are from <placeName>New York</placeName>, and
<lb/>know how things should be, and have intelli­
<lb/>gence and good sense enough to make the best
<lb/>of circumstances they cannot control. Thus
<lb/>they contrive to render their house, not only a
<lb/>comfortable, but an agreeable sojourn for travel­
<lb/>lers. A hotel is about to be erected, which will 
<lb/>accommodate a greater number of persons. It
<lb/>is a very desirable thing to have such a one here,
<lb/>as in all places, the first impression, whether
<lb/>favourable or the contrary, depends so much
<lb/>upon the degree of personal comfort enjoyed.</p>
        <p><placeName>Brazoria</placeName> has, already, some families of edu­

<lb/>excursions, I called on Mrs. ――, who was, I
	  <lb/>found, from my native state, (<placeName>Connecticut</placeName>,) a cir­
<lb/>cumstance sufficient to place us, at once, on the
<lb/>most sociable footing. The family had not been
<lb/>here long, and their <mcr rend="slant(italic)">cabin</mcr> was not yet built.

<pb n="40"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="4(2)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">40</mw>
<lb/>They occupied a temporary shed among the
	  <lb/>trees, or <term rend="slant(italic)">camp</term>, as they call it here, not imper­
<lb/>vious to the light, though there was no window.
<lb/>A white curtain supplied the place of door.
<lb/>The single apartment contained three or four
<lb/>beds, as white as snow. Books, glass, china,
<lb/>and other furniture in polite usage, were arrang­
<lb/>ed in perfect neatness about the room, as best
	  <lb/>suited the present exigence. It was <name>Sunday</name>
<lb/>evening. Mrs. ―― was seated in a white
<lb/>cambric wrapper and tasteful cap. The children
<lb/>around the door, and the servants, were at their
<lb/>several occupations, or sitting at leisure about
<lb/>the temporary fire-place without. The whole
<lb/>scene was an exhibition of peace and happiness.
<lb/>I gazed upon it with emotions of admiration and
<lb/>delight. I have seldom seen a more striking do­
<lb/>mestic group, or enjoyed a conversation of more 
<lb/>genuine good sense, than during the hour of my
<lb/>visit. The prospects of a new country and the
<lb/>retrospect of the old, were of course the ab­
<lb/>sorbing topics of our discourse, as they are the
<lb/>unfailing themes of conversation among all classes
	  <lb/>in <placeName>Brazoria</placeName>, all uniting to extol the advantages of
<lb/>these fair regions of the sun, over the frozen cli­

<lb/>about to open a school, in which the higher
<lb/>branches of education will be taught; the first
	  <lb/>school in <placeName>Brazoria</placeName>.</p>
        <p>Nowhere is conversation so animated as
<lb/>here, where every body is excited by the beauti­
<lb/>ful creations around them, and all busily engaged
<lb/>in appropriating the luxuriant bounties of heaven
<lb/>to their own use. Each has the best land, the
<lb/>best water courses, the finest timber, and the
<lb/>most judicious mode of operation; proving, at
<lb/>least, that each is satisfied with his own lot, and
<lb/>not disposed to envy his neighbour. Never was
<lb/>self more amiably displayed. Never was rivalry
<lb/>more honourable in itself, or one that promised
<lb/>more beneficial results to the community.</p>
        <p>In <placeName>Texas</placeName>, most domestic business is transact­
<lb/>ed in the open air. There has not been time to

<lb/>trees</mcr>. Upon inquiring what kind of tree was
<lb/>meant by honey tree, I learned, that hollow trees,
<lb/>in which the bees deposit their honey, are so
<lb/>called. These trees are very abundant, and
<lb/>honey of excellent quality and in any quantity,
<lb/>may be obtained from them. These trees are
	  <lb/>also called <term rend="slant(italic)">bee trees</term>. There are persons here,
<lb/>who have a peculiar tact in coursing the bee, and
<lb/>of thus discovering these deposits of the luscious 
<lb/>store. This employment is not a mere pastime,
<lb/>but is profitable. The wax alone, thus obtained,

<pb n="43"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="4(4)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">43</mw>
	  <lb/>is a valuable article of commerce in <placeName>Mexico</placeName>,
<lb/>and commands a high price. There is always a
<lb/>demand for it, it is so much used in the churches.
	  <lb/>This, it will be remembered, is a Catholic country.
<lb/>In some of the churches, the wax candles made
<lb/>use of, are as large as a man's arm. It often hap­
<lb/>pens, that the hunters throw away the honey,
<lb/>and save only the wax.</p>
        <p>The character of <name>Leather Stocking</name>, is not
	  <lb/>uncommon in <placeName>Texas</placeName>. Many persons employ an

<lb/>branches; and thus, are constantly supplied with 
<lb/>provisions of every description, even to eggs,
<lb/>which are furnished by the immense numbers of
<lb/>wild fowl. These hunters are very profitable to
<lb/>their employers, and much cherished in the
<lb/>family, and often become spoiled by familiarity
<lb/>and indulgence. A roughness of manners, and
<lb/>a rudeness of speech are tolerated in them, which
<lb/>would not be brooked in other servants. They
	  <lb/>are a sort of privileged character. <name>Indians</name> and
	  <lb/><name>Mexicans</name>, are considered the best qualified for 
<lb/>this important office. But it sometimes happens
<lb/>that a white man from the <placeName rend="slant(italic)">States</placeName>, who has be­

<lb/>substituted. The dress of these hunters is usually

<pb n="44"/>

<mw type="pageNum">44</mw>
<lb/>of deer-skin. Hence, the appropriate name

<lb/>more beautiful cannot be found.</p>
        <p>It is a very curious fact, in the natural history
<lb/>of the bee, that it is never found in a wild coun­
<lb/>try, but always precedes civilization, forming a
<lb/>kind of advance guard between the white man
	  <lb/>and the savage. The <name>Indians</name>, at least, are per­
<lb/>fectly convinced of the truth of this fact, for it
<lb/>is a common remark among them, when they
<lb/>observe these happy insects, <quote>there come the
<lb/>white men.</quote></p>
        <p>The people of <placeName>Texas</placeName> should take the bee for
<lb/>their emblem, as the Mexican nation has done the
<lb/>Cactus, Nopal, or Prickly Pear; and for the same

<pb n="45"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="4(5)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">45</mw>
<lb/>reason, its abundance and delicious fruits. For
<lb/>their motto, I would add, this most appropriate
<lb/>sentiment: <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">Industry is Fortune's right hand.</quote></p>
        <p>The Nopal, or Prickly Pear, which you may
<lb/>observe in the Mexican coat of arms, is a very
	  <lb/>interesting and valuable production of <placeName>Mexico</placeName>.
<lb/>In some districts of the upper country, it 
<lb/>grows in great abundance, and forms, in places
<lb/>impenetrable thickets, higher than a man on
<lb/>horseback. This plant produces an immense
<lb/>quantity of fruit, which, together with the young
<lb/>leaves, furnishes food for vast herds of cattle and
	  <lb/>wild horses. On this account, the <name>Mexicans</name>,
<lb/>when selecting land for a stock farm, always
<lb/>choose that which has a good proportion of the
<lb/>Nopal.</p>
        <p>Of the fruit of the Nopal, there are two kinds;
<lb/>one is a scarlet, about the size and shape of a
<lb/>large pear. The other is much longer, and when
<lb/>ripe, of a yellowish white color. The latter is
<lb/>most esteemed, and is sold in the market of <placeName>Mexi­
<lb/>co</placeName> as a choice fruit.</p>
        <p>During the revolution, the army of the patriots
<lb/>was, at one time, preserved from famine by the
<lb/>fruit of the Nopal. Which circumstance, in con­
<lb/>nexion with its never-failing abundance, its great

<pb n="46"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="4(5)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">46</mw>
<lb/>value for feeding cattle, and for nourishing the 
<lb/>Cochineal Insect, probably suggested the idea of
<lb/>adopting it as a part of the Mexican Arms.</p>
        <p>Among the superstitions of the <name>Mexicans</name>,
<lb/>there is a tradition, from which many credulous
<lb/>people derive the origin of this emblem. The
	  <lb/><name>Mexicans</name>, it is said, originally inhabited a cold
<lb/>climate, and a barren, mountainous country,
<lb/>where, with difficulty, they gathered a scanty
<lb/>subsistence. They resolved to migrate in a 
<lb/>body. The Great Spirit appeared to the king in
<lb/>a vision, and directed him to lead his nation to
<lb/>the south. An eagle should fly before them to
<lb/>direct their course. This guide they were to
<lb/>follow, until it should settle and finally disappear.</p>
        <p>In conformity with these instructions, the
<lb/>whole nation followed the eagle, which accord­
<lb/>ing to promise, flew before them. The eagle
	  <lb/>stopped on a tree in <placeName>California</placeName>, but did not dis­
<lb/>appear, continuing to fly around and around the
<lb/>same spot, every day. The king, believing that
<lb/>this was the place destined for the permanent lo­
<lb/>cation of his people, caused large storehouses
<lb/>to be erected, the ruins of which may be seen in
	  <lb/>the forests of <placeName>California</placeName> to this day, known by
<lb/>the name of <foreign rend="pre(“)post(”)" xml:lang="es">las casas grandes.</foreign></p>
        <pb n="47"/>
        <milestone unit="sig" n="4(6)r"/>
        <mw type="pageNum">47</mw>
        <p>At this place the nation remained a few years,
<lb/>the eagle still hovering round the spot. At length
<lb/>the king received an indication, by means of an­
<lb/>other vision, that the eagle would lead them to
<lb/>their permanent home, having rested at that place
<lb/>only to let them recruit. Accordingly, the wing­
<lb/>ed guide again set his feathered sails for the des­
<lb/>tined haven. The nation, with the king at their
<lb/>head, again followed the eagle, until he settled
<lb/>upon a Nopal, on an island in the <placeName>lake Tescaco</placeName>,
<lb/>and shortly afterwards, died. This was pronounc­
<lb/>ed by the king, priests, and wise men of the na­
<lb/>tion, to be the spot designed by the Great Spirit, 
<lb/>for their permanent location. Here they remain­
<lb/>ed and founded the city of <placeName>Mexico</placeName>.</p>
        <p>From <placeName>Brazoria</placeName> to <placeName>Bolivar</placeName>, I came in a sail­
<lb/>boat, with occasional rowing, as the wind subsi­
<lb/>ded or was unfavourable. The weather was fine,
<lb/>and the scenery picturesque. The different
<lb/>reaches of the river, resembling so many lakes
<lb/>in a chain, were like mirrors, to reflect from their
<lb/>polished surfaces, the shores of unbroken forests.
<lb/>The limpid water, instead of being muddy and
	  <lb/>red, as below <placeName>Brazoria</placeName>, looked as if it passed
<lb/>over a bed of emeralds, and had not been dis­
<lb/>turbed since creation. No human creature was

<pb n="48"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="4(6)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">48</mw>
<lb/>to be seen, and the numerous flocks of birds
<lb/>were so tame, as seemingly to court our acquaint­
<lb/>ance. A basking alligator and an occasional
<lb/>herd of cattle, which gazed at us with almost
<lb/>human curiosity, were the only objects which in­
<lb/>terrupted our musings. A solitude more com­
<lb/>plete, it is not easy to imagine. But I enjoyed
<lb/>it. The universal repose of nature inspired my
<lb/>heart with solemn, peaceful, pleasing emotions.</p>
        <p>Half way between <placeName>Brazoria</placeName> and <placeName>Bolivar</placeName>, is
	  <lb/>the town of <placeName>Marion</placeName>, or <placeName>Bell's Landing</placeName>, from the
<lb/>name of the proprietor. It has two or three
<lb/>cabins, a country store, and one frame house
<lb/>painted white. The lofty forest trees have been
<lb/>left standing, in sufficient numbers to protect it
<lb/>from the vertical sun, and to prevent the banks
<lb/>from sinking. This little village, as I strolled 
<lb/>among its quiet shades at noon, struck my fancy
<lb/>very agreeably. You must know, it is the com­
<lb/>mon practice with settlers here, to cut away
<lb/>every tree of a clearing, and to substitute, for
<lb/>the noble giants of the forest, those of diminu­
<lb/>tive size, and ephemeral growth; whether with a
<lb/>view to shade or ornament, I know not; but it
<lb/>certainly is a very mistaken policy; as well as
<lb/>most wretched taste. Fine trees are not the

<pb n="49"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="5(1)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">49</mw>
<lb/>growth of a life-time. How much better is it to
<lb/>suffer those to live, which are venerable by age
<lb/>and size, which, by their elevation do not ob­
<lb/>struct the free circulation of air nor <choice><sic>b</sic><corr>h</corr></choice>arbour in­
<lb/>sects; but, being trimmed to the top, serve as
<lb/>true parasols to the dwellings they ornament.</p>
        <p>How would <name>Europeans</name> be astonished to be
	  <lb/>told that almost every settler in <placeName>Texas</placeName>, hews or
<lb/>burns down the fine live oaks that grow about 
<lb/>his door, and thus, in this sunny climate, leaves
<lb/>his roof without a shelter from the rays of the
<lb/>sun.</p>
        <p>Before sun-set, I arrived at this my forest
	  <lb/>home, for such <placeName>Bolivar</placeName> may now be regarded,
	  <lb/>being the place of my temporary abode in <placeName>Texas</placeName>.
	  <lb/><placeName>Bolivar</placeName>, though selected as an advantageous loca­
<lb/>tion for a commercial town, and laid off for that
	  <lb/>purpose before <placeName>Brazoria</placeName>, at present consists of
<lb/>but a single residence. Its location, for purposes
<lb/>of trade as well as on account of the fertility of
<lb/>the adjacent country, has doubtless many advan­
<lb/>tages. But it was abandoned for that which was
<lb/>regarded, upon the whole, as a more eligible po­
<lb/>sition, on account of its easier access from the
<lb/>sea. It is at the head of tide water on the
	  <lb/><placeName>Brazos</placeName>, sixty miles from the river's mouth by

<lb/>water and forty-five by land. It is an important
<lb/>point, as any vessel that can pass the bar can
<lb/>ascend to this place in the lowest stage of water,
<lb/>but not farther. It is fifteen miles nearer to <placeName>San
	    <lb/>Felipe</placeName> than <placeName>Brazoria</placeName>, and the road much better.
	  <lb/>The distance from <placeName>Bolivar</placeName> to the navigable wa­
<lb/>ters of the <placeName>Galveston bay</placeName>, is but fifteen miles,
<lb/>over a high, dry prairie, with the exception of
<lb/>six miles through timber land, where the road is
<lb/>now good.</p>
        <p>The land, in and about <placeName>Bolivar</placeName>, is the best in
<lb/>the colony; clothed with heavy timber, with 
<lb/>peach and cane undergrowth, to the distance of
<lb/>six miles from the river. The bank of the river
<lb/>in front of the town, is a high bluff of stiff red
<lb/>clay. About fifty acres are cleared and under
<lb/>cultivation.</p>
        <p>The undergrowth of the best land in the
<lb/><placeName>Brazos valley</placeName>, is cane and a species of laurel,
<lb/>the leaves of which taste like the kernel of the
<lb/>peach stone, containing an extraordinary quantity
<lb/>of prussic acid. The leaves resemble those of
<lb/>the peach tree. Hence it is called by the colo­
<lb/>nists, wild peach. This tree is an evergreen
<lb/>and grows to the height of twenty or thirty feet,
<lb/>though its usual height does not exceed ten feet.

<lb/>the moment, I now proceed to give you the re­
<lb/>sult of my inquiries. These inquiries relate to
<lb/>the general face of the country, including its
<lb/>rivers, soil, productions, towns, and harbours; <name>In­
<lb/>dians</name>, climate, and natural resources; the history
<lb/>of its original settlement, together with the pre­
<lb/>sent conditions and encouragements of coloniza­
<lb/>tion.</p>
        <p>I shall endeavor to be as systematic in my re­
<lb/>marks as I can, but you must not expect the 
<lb/>complete and formal arrangement of a book.</p>
        <p><placeName>Texas</placeName> at present forms a part of the state of
	  <lb/><placeName>Coahuila</placeName> and <placeName>Texas</placeName>, being provisionally annexed
	  <lb/>to <placeName>Coahuila</placeName>, until its population and resources
<lb/>are sufficient to form a separate State, when its
	  <lb/>connexion with <placeName>Coahuila</placeName> will be dissolved. Its
<lb/>latitude is, from 28° to 34° north, and is bound­
	  <lb/>ed by <placeName>Louisiana</placeName> on the east, by <placeName>Red river</placeName>, which
	  <lb/>divides it from <placeName>Arkansas</placeName>, on the north, by the
<lb/><placeName>Nueces river</placeName>, which divides it from
	<placeName>Tamaulipas</placeName>
<lb/>and
	<placeName>Coahuila</placeName>, on the west, and by the <placeName>Gulf of 
<lb/>Mexico</placeName> on the south.</p>
        <p><placeName>Texas</placeName> is divided into three distinct tracts or
<lb/>regions, whose characteristics are, in many
	  <lb/>respects, entirely different. These are, the <mcr>level</mcr>,
	  <lb/>the <mcr>undulating</mcr>, and the <mcr>mountainous</mcr> or <mcr>hilly</mcr>.</p>

        <p>The whole coast, from the <placeName>Sabine river</placeName> to the
	<lb/><placeName>Neuces</placeName>, is rather low and very level, but entirely
<lb/>free from marsh; so much so, that in most places
<lb/>a loaded wagon may be driven to the beach with­
<lb/>out obstruction. There is a belt of prairie along
<lb/>its whole coast, about eight or ten miles wide.
<lb/>This prairie is destitute of timber, except nar­
<lb/>row skirts, on the margins of the rivers and
<lb/>creeks.</p>
        <p>That part of the level region which lies be­
	<lb/>tween the <placeName>Sabine</placeName> and <placeName>San Jacinto rivers</placeName>, ex­
<lb/>tends back about seventy miles from the coast, 
<lb/>in a north and north-westerly direction. This
<lb/>tract is, in general, heavily timbered with pine,
<lb/>oak, ash, cedar, cypress, and other forest trees.
	<lb/>The <placeName>Sabine</placeName>, <placeName>Naches</placeName>, and <placeName>Trinity rivers</placeName>, are all
<lb/>navigable entirely through this section, and the
<lb/>latter for a considerable distance above it. The
	<lb/><placeName>Naches</placeName> affords good navigation to the junction of
	<lb/>the <placeName>Angelina</placeName>, twenty-five miles south-east of
	<lb/><placeName>Nacogdoches</placeName>.</p>
        <p>North and north-west of this section of the
<lb/>level region, the country is undulating to <placeName>Red
<lb/>river</placeName>, there being no portion of it sufficiently
<lb/>broken to be called hilly. The thickly timbered
<lb/>or wooded lands, extend quite to <placeName>Red river</placeName>, and

<mw type="pageNum">54</mw>
<lb/>as far west, as a line drawn due north from the
	<lb/>heads of the <placeName>Sabine</placeName>. West of this line, there
<lb/>is a wide belt of undulating prairie, extending
<lb/>along <placeName>Red river</placeName>, which is thinly timbered, the
<lb/>timber being confined to the margins of the
<lb/>streams.</p>
        <p>The whole of this eastern section of <placeName>Texas</placeName>
<lb/>is very well watered by the above mentioned
<lb/>rivers and their tributaries, which afford many
<lb/>favourable sites for saw-mills and manufactories.
<lb/>The soil, in general, is well adapted to agricul­
<lb/>ture and grazing. The timber business, from
<lb/>this quarter, will become very valuable, for the 
<lb/>supply of the southern ports of the <placeName>Gulf of 
<lb/>Mexico</placeName>, as soon as mills are put into extensive
<lb/>operation. One steam saw-mill is already com­
	<lb/>pleted at <placeName>Harrisburg</placeName>, and another will soon be
	<lb/>in operation on the east bank of the <placeName>San Jacinto</placeName>,
<lb/>opposite the mouth of <placeName>Buffalo Bayou</placeName>.</p>
        <p>The old Spanish military post and village of
	<lb/><placeName>Nacogdoches</placeName>, is situated in this eastern section
	<lb/>of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, in latitude 31° 40′, sixty miles west
<lb/>of the <placeName>Sabine river</placeName>. In <date when="1819">1819</date> or <date when="1820">1820</date>, it was
<lb/>totally broken up by the revolution and aban­
<lb/>doned. Its inhabitants were driven away by the
<lb/>Spanish troops and compelled to seek a refuge

<pb n="55"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="5(4)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">55</mw>
	<lb/>in <placeName>Louisiana</placeName>, near <placeName>Nachitoches</placeName>, exiles from their
<lb/>native country, and dependent in most instances,
<lb/>on the hospitality of strangers.</p>
        <p><placeName>Nacogdoches</placeName> remained without population,
<lb/>until the year <date from="1822" to="1823">1822-23</date>, when many of the emi­
<lb/>grants who left the <placeName>United States</placeName> with the view 
	<lb/>of joining <placeName>Austin's Colony</placeName>, stopped at this place.
<lb/>A number of the ancient inhabitants, also, return­
<lb/>ed to their former possessions, and thus the town
<lb/>has been gradually re-peopled and is now a
<lb/>respectable village. A garrison of Mexican
<lb/>troops is stationed here under the command of a
<lb/>Colonel of the army. There is, also, a custom
<lb/>house established, for the collection of duties
	<lb/>on the inland trade from <placeName>Louisiana</placeName>. The country
	<lb/>on the road between this place and the <placeName>Sabine</placeName>,
<lb/>is thinly settled by emigrants from the <placeName>United
<lb/>States</placeName>.</p>
        <p>A military post and town has been establish­
<lb/>ed by order of <persName>General Teran</persName>, on the north-east
<lb/>corner of <placeName>Galveston bay</placeName>, opposite the mouth of
<lb/><placeName>Trinity river</placeName>, called <placeName rend="slant(italic)">Anahuac</placeName>. The lands on
<lb/><placeName>Trinity river</placeName> and the lands on the lower portion
	<lb/>of the <placeName>Naches</placeName>, is pretty well settled. There is
<lb/>a settlement of about two hundred and fifty
<lb/>families on <placeName>Red river</placeName>, above the mouth of <placeName>Sul­

<pb n="56"/>

<lb/>phur fork</placeName>, which, it is supposed, will fall within
	<lb/>the boundary of <placeName>Texas</placeName> when the line is accu­
<lb/>rately run.</p>
        <p>The section of the level region lying be­
<lb/>tween the <placeName>San Jacinto</placeName> and <placeName>Guadalupe rivers</placeName>, in­
	<lb/>cluding the lower parts of the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>, <placeName>San Ber­
	  <lb/>nard</placeName>, <placeName>Colorado</placeName>, and <placeName>La Baca rivers</placeName>, extends into
<lb/>the interior about eighty miles from the coast, in
<lb/>a northerly direction. This beautiful and very
	<lb/>valuable portion of <placeName>Texas</placeName> as far as the <placeName>La Baca</placeName>,
	<lb/>is embraced in <placeName>Austin's Colony</placeName>. The land is suf­
<lb/>ficiently elevated to drain easily and rapidly after
<lb/>heavy rains. It is entirely clear of all marsh,
<lb/>lakes, and overflow. The supply of pure water
<lb/>is sufficiently abundant in the rivers and creeks,
<lb/>while excellent water for domestic purposes may
<lb/>be obtained from wells, at a moderate depth, in
<lb/>every part of this territory.</p>
        <p>The alluvial bottom lands of the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>, <placeName>San
	  <lb/>Bernard</placeName>, and <placeName>Colorado</placeName>, are from three to twenty
<lb/>miles in width. They are heavily timbered with
<lb/>live oak, with red, black, and other species of
<lb/>oak, with cedar, pecan, elm, hackberry, mul­
<lb/>berry, and all the other varieties of forest trees
<lb/>and undergrowth common in the rich alluvions
	<lb/>of the <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>. The cane-brakes are of im­

<pb n="57"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="5(5)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">57</mw>
<lb/>mense extent, particularly on <placeName>Cane-brake creek</placeName>.
<lb/>On this creek there is an uninterrupted cane-
<lb/>brake seventy-five miles long and from one to
<lb/>three miles wide. It extends on both sides of the
<lb/>creek, from within twelve miles of its mouth into
<lb/>the gulf, to its source, a few hundred yards from
<lb/>the <placeName>Colorado river</placeName>. Scarcely a tree is to be
<lb/>found in this ocean of cane, which has, hence,
<lb/>received the name of the <placeName>Great Prairie Cane-
<lb/>brake</placeName>. It is bordered on each side by the heavy
<lb/>and lofty timber of the alluvial soils.</p>
        <p><placeName>Cane-brake creek</placeName> or <placeName>Caney</placeName>, as it is usually
<lb/>called, winds its way through this tract, and ex­
<lb/>hibits so many and such unequivocal evidences
<lb/>of its having been once a branch of the <placeName>Colorado
<lb/>river</placeName>, that not a reasonable doubt exists that such
<lb/>is the fact. The bed of the creek is of equal
<lb/>depth and of equal width, with the bed of the
<lb/>river. The appearance of the banks, the nature
<lb/>of the adjacent soil, in short, every feature is the
<lb/>same in both. What seems to confirm the above
<lb/>suggestion beyond controversy, is the abrupt
<lb/>termination of the deep, wide bed of <placeName>Caney</placeName>,
<lb/>within less than two hundred yards of the bank
<lb/>of the river, in an alluvial bottom nearly ten
<lb/>miles in width. From these appearances, it is

<pb n="58"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="5(5)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">58</mw>
	<lb/>very evident that the <placeName>Colorado</placeName>, at some former
<lb/>period, divided at or near the present source of 
	<lb/><placeName>Caney</placeName> and discharged its waters into the gulf
<lb/>by two distinct mouths more than twenty-five
<lb/>miles apart, forming an extensive island. This
<lb/>island constituted what is now called the <placeName>Bay
<lb/>Prairie</placeName>; a large, rich, and very beautiful prairie,
	<lb/>lying between the timbered lands of <placeName>Caney</placeName>, and
	<lb/>those of the <placeName>Colorado</placeName>. Not any of the water of
	<lb/>the river has been known to flow into <placeName>Caney</placeName>
	<lb/>since <placeName>Austin's colony</placeName> was commenced, nor is
<lb/>there any indication of there having been an
<lb/>overflow for many years.</p>
        <p><placeName>Oyster creek</placeName>, on the east side of the <placeName>Brazos
<lb/>river</placeName>, affords also extensive bodies of prairie
<lb/>cane-brake, though by no means so extensive as
<lb/>that which has just been mentioned. The cane
<lb/>land on <placeName>Oyster creek</placeName> extends indeed along its 
<lb/>entire course, but it is not all prairie cane-brake,
<lb/>in many places being interspersed with heavy
<lb/>timber. This singular creek takes its rise in the
	<lb/>alluvial lands of the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>. Winding its course
<lb/>through the bottoms of this river, which it drains,
<lb/>it discharges into the gulf two miles east of its
<lb/>mouth. <placeName>Oyster creek</placeName> forms a connexion with
	<lb/>the <placeName>Brazos</placeName> at <placeName>Bolivar</placeName>, by a deep channel,

<pb n="59"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="5(6)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">59</mw>
<lb/>through which the waters of the river, in time of
<lb/>freshets, pour their crimson tide with a rapid
<lb/>current.</p>
        <p>The soil of the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>, <placeName>Bernard</placeName>, <placeName>Caney</placeName>, and
	<lb/><placeName>Colorado</placeName> lands, has the same general character,
<lb/>as to appearance, fertility, and natural produc­
<lb/>tions. It is of a reddish cast, nearly resembling
<lb/>a chocolate colour, and is evidently alluvial,
<lb/>formed by deposits of the rivers during freshets.
<lb/>The colour of the soil is precisely such as would
<lb/>be expected from the appearance of the river at
	<lb/>such seasons: for the <placeName>Brazos</placeName> and <placeName>Colorado</placeName>, when 
<lb/>swollen by the spring and autumn freshets, are
<lb/>of a deep red and very turbid. The deposits
<lb/>from these rivers at these stages, are very great;
<lb/>much greater than that from the waters of either
	<lb/>the <placeName>Mississippi</placeName> or <placeName>Red river</placeName>.</p>
        <p>The beds of these rivers are deep and nar­
<lb/>row. Their banks are clayey and not so liable
<lb/>to wear away as sandy banks, nor easily permit
<lb/>a change of channel.</p>
        <p>The <placeName>Guadalupe</placeName>, <placeName>La Baca</placeName>, <placeName>Navidad</placeName>, and a
<lb/>great number of fine rivulets that intersect
<lb/>this level region, also afford valuable bottoms
<lb/>of rich alluvial black soil, all of which are well
<lb/>clothed with timber.</p>

        <p>These alluvions are in the highest degree
<lb/>productive and easily cultivated. Three thou­
<lb/>sand pounds of seed cotton and seventy-five
<lb/>bushels of Indian corn or maize, are an average
<lb/>crop in these lands.</p>
        <p>That remarkable feature of the <placeName>Brazos river</placeName>,
<lb/>the <placeName>Salt Branch</placeName>, has been already mentioned. It
<lb/>is probably owing to this particuarity that the
	<lb/>land of the <placeName>Brazos</placeName> has a fertility so truly extra­
<lb/>ordinary. The freshets of the fresh branches
<lb/>are much more copious and frequent than those of 
<lb/>the <placeName>Salt Branch</placeName>. They all rise and flow through 
<lb/>very rich land, and their waters go towards the
<lb/>sea, charged with fine loam and clay washed into
<lb/>them by the floods.</p>
        <p>The alternate deposits by these salt and
<lb/>fresh tributaries in time of freshets, form a soil
<lb/>of a light reddish brown colour, slightly impreg­
<lb/>nated with salt and nitre. The colour of the
<lb/>water varies from a deep red to almost choco­
<lb/>late, according as the one or the other rise pre­
<lb/>vails. Salt and saltpetre, it is well known, are
	  <lb/>potent manures. This bright <term rend="slant(italic)">mulatto</term> soil, as it is
<lb/>called, formed in this manner, is considered the 
	<lb/>best land in <placeName>Texas</placeName>. The whole valley of the
	<lb/><placeName>Brazos</placeName> is mostly of this description. On the

<pb n="61"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="6(1)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">61</mw>
<lb/>surface of this alluvion, a black mould is formed
<lb/>by the decomposition of vegetable matter. The
<lb/>soil, properly speaking, possessing the power of 
<lb/>vegetation in all its vigour, extends to an unlimited
<lb/>depth. When brought to the surface from a 
<lb/>depth of twenty feet, it will produce as good
<lb/>crops as the surface itself.</p>
        <p>Where this mulatto soil is found, the banks of
<lb/>the rivers and smaller streams are clothed with
<lb/>heavy timber. Near the sea coast, the timber is
<lb/>mostly live oak of enormous size, intermixed
<lb/>with Spanish oak, red and black oak, ash, syca­
<lb/>more, mulberry, pecan, hackberry, and other
<lb/>kinds. Immediately on the bank of the river
	<lb/>cotton wood abounds. At <placeName>Bolivar</placeName>, the timber 
<lb/>tract is five or six miles wide and the road to
<lb/>the prairie is walled in with tall cane filling all
<lb/>the space between the trees.</p>
        <p>The live oak region is from the <placeName>Bay of Ma­
<lb/>tagorda</placeName> to the west end of <placeName>Galveston bay</placeName>, and
	<lb/>extends on the banks of the <placeName>Brazos</placeName> towards the
<lb/>interior about seventy miles. There is a live
	<lb/>oak tree in <placeName>Bolivar</placeName>, sixteen feet in circumference, 
<lb/>and keeps this size more than thirty feet from
<lb/>the ground. It then spreads out its enormous 
<lb/>branches. Larger trees than this, however, are
<mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(2)">6</mw>

<pb n="62"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="6(1)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">62</mw>
	<lb/>not uncommon. Ten miles from <placeName>Bolivar</placeName>, there
<lb/>is a tree which measures nineteen feet in circum­
<lb/>ference. What would such trees be worth in
	<lb/>the dock yards of the <placeName>United States</placeName> or of <placeName>England</placeName>!</p>
        <p>About fifteen miles east of the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>, the live
	<lb/>oak region ends. Thence to the <placeName>Sabine river</placeName>, 
<lb/>fine cedar, Spanish oak, post and red oak, and
<lb/>black oak, ash and mulberry, with other com­
<lb/>mon timbers, are the growth on the water
<lb/>courses.</p>
        <p>The intervening country between the rivers,
<lb/>creeks, and rivulets, is open, level, rich, and ele­
<lb/>vated prairie, clothed with a thick and luxuriant
<lb/>growth of grass of a good quality for pasturage,
	  <lb/>with occasional <term rend="slant(italic)">points</term> and <term rend="slant(italic)">islands</term> of timber, as
<lb/>the wooded projections and scattered clumps of
<lb/>trees are called, which give the plains the ap­
<lb/>pearance of vast parks, with ornamental trees
<lb/>artifically arranged to beautify the prospect.
<lb/>Nothing can exceed the beauty of these vast,
<lb/>natural meadows in the spring and summer sea­
<lb/>sons, neither is it possible to form an estimate,
<lb/>even in imagination, of the number of useful do­
<lb/>mestic animals that may be reared on them with­
<lb/>out trouble or expense. Even in the winter sea­
<lb/>son, the pasturage is sufficiently good to dispense
<lb/>with feeding live stock.</p>

        <p>The value of the prairie lands is not confined, 
<lb/>however, to grazing alone. These lands are so
<lb/>nearly equal to timbered alluvions for all the
<lb/>purposes of planting and farming, that many per­
<lb/>sons who have cultivated this kind of land,
<lb/>prefer it to the alluvial bottoms. They main­
<lb/>tain that the prairie, when properly broken up by
<lb/>the plough and sufficiently mellowed, will yield
<lb/>crops nearly equal to the best alluvions. That
<lb/>the labour, expense, and time, required to clear
<lb/>twenty acres of timbered bottom land and pre­
<lb/>pare it for cultivation, would be sufficient to pre­
<lb/>pare sixty acres of prairie, that, supposing both
<lb/>kinds of land to be equally prepared, a hand
<lb/>can cultivate two-thirds more of the latter than
<lb/>of the former. So that, taking all things into
<lb/>account, the cultivation of the prairie land re­
<lb/>quires less capital in the outset and is more pro­
<lb/>fitable in the end, than the cultivation of the bot­
<lb/>toms. Experience has proved that these calcu­
<lb/>lations are not unfounded, and that the prairies
<lb/>are valuable for all the purposes of farming, as
<lb/>well as for grazing. The soil of the prairies is
<lb/>a deep black mould mixed with sand in various
<lb/>proportions.</p>

        <p>Of the settlements in this region of country,
	<lb/>besides <placeName>Brazoria</placeName>, which has been already men­
<lb/>tioned, a town has been laid off at the mouth of
	  <lb/>the <placeName>Colorado river</placeName>, on the bay of <placeName>Matagorda</placeName>,
	<lb/>called <placeName>Matagorda</placeName>. This place must become
	  <lb/>the depot of the <placeName>Colorado river</placeName> and of an ex­
<lb/>tensive fertile country which will find its natural
<lb/>market at this point.</p>
        <p>The town of <placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName> was found­
<lb/>ed in <date when="1824">1824</date>, by <persName>Col. Austin</persName> and the commissioner
<lb/>of the government, <persName>Baron de Bastrop</persName>. It is the
	<lb/>capital of <placeName>Austin's Colony</placeName>, situated on the right
	  <lb/>bank of the <placeName>Brazos river</placeName>, eighty miles from the
<lb/>gulf by land, and one hundred and eighty miles
<lb/>by the meanders of the river. The site of this
<lb/>town is exceedingly beautiful. It is a high prairie
<lb/>bluff, which strikes the river at the upper or
<lb/>northern limit of the level region. It is the re­
<lb/>sidence of the Empresario, <persName>Col. Austin</persName>. The
<lb/>state and municipal officers of the jurisdiction
<lb/>hold their offices here, and here all the land and 
<lb/>judicial business of the colony is transacted.</p>
        <p>Above the level region just noticed, upon the
	  <lb/><placeName>Brazos</placeName>, <placeName>Colorado</placeName>, and <placeName>Guadalupe rivers</placeName>, the
<lb/>country  becomes gently and beautifully undu­
<lb/>lating. This description of land extends in a

<pb n="65"/>

<mw type="pageNum">65</mw>
<lb/>north-west, direction up those rivers, from one
<lb/>hundred and fifty to two hundred miles above the
<lb/>level region, and reaches to the mountain range of
	<lb/><placeName>Texas</placeName>. This extensive undulating section is
<lb/>probably as desirable a country for the residence
<lb/>of man, as any other o<choice><sic><g ref="#invertedn"/></sic><corr>n</corr></choice> the face of the earth.
<lb/>Whether we regard productiveness of soil,
<lb/>healthfulness of climate, or beauty of natural
<lb/>landscape, it cannot be surpassed. The soil, in
<lb/>general, is of the first quality of black mould,
<lb/>easily cultivated and very productive. The cli­
<lb/>mate is much more healthful and pleasant than
<lb/>that of the level region. There are no mosquetos
<lb/>and very few insects of any kind. The surface
<lb/>is beautifully and often fancifully diversified with
<lb/>prairie and woodland, presenting to the enter­
<lb/>prising farmer, large and fertile fields already 
<lb/>cleared by the hand of nature, and waiting, as it
<lb/>were, to receive the plough. The woods which
<lb/>encircle the prairies, afford the best of oak, ce­
<lb/>dar, ash, and other timber, valuable for fencing
<lb/>and building.</p>
        <p>The whole of this undulating region, is most
<lb/>bountifully watered, and abounds in bold rivulets
<lb/>and springs of pure water. These rivulets have
<lb/>all more or less of bottom land adjacent to them
<mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(2)">6*</mw>

<pb n="66"/>

<lb/>and are lined with the lofty forest trees of the
<lb/>rich alluvions.</p>
        <p>The undulations, in many places, rise into emi­
<lb/>nences of considerable elevation, but always with
<lb/>a gentle ascent and with lengthened intervals.
<lb/>Abrupt elevations or cliffs seldom occur, nor is
<lb/>the surface so uneven or broken, as to be justly
<lb/>designated hilly. From the summit of these ele­
<lb/>vations the view is extensive and imposing.
<lb/>The landscape is rich and splendid, and the eye
<lb/>delights to roam over the smooth, verdant, ex­
<lb/>tended slopes. The round tops of the eminences
<lb/>are here crowned with tufts of cedars or groves of
<lb/>oaks and pecans; there presenting an unbroken
<lb/>surface of grass. The pale green of the prairie
<lb/>sprinkled with flowers of every hue, forms a 
<lb/>pleasing contrast with the dark foliage of the ce­
<lb/>dars and other lofty forest trees: while the rivu­
<lb/>lets which wind their serpentine course at the
<lb/>foot of the undulations, agreeably diversify the
<lb/>scene. All combined under a clear blue sky,
<lb/>present a picture, not only delightful to the eye
<lb/>but enchanting to the imagination, which, with
<lb/>the pencil of fancy, would fain fill up the scene
<lb/>under view, with rural cottages, with the flocks

<lb/>of the herdsman, and all the various indications
<lb/>of human activity and domestic happiness.</p>
        <p>Successful experiments have been made in va­
<lb/>rious places on these undulating lands, of wheat,
<lb/>rye, oats, and flax, and the result satisfactorily
<lb/>establishes the fact, that these articles may be
<lb/>cultivated upon them to any extent. All the
<lb/>fruits and agricultural productions of the level
<lb/>region arrive at perfection here, except sugar and
<lb/><placeName>Sea Island</placeName> cotton. It is considered to be fully
<lb/>equal to the level region, for raising black cattle
<lb/>and hogs, and far superior to it for rearing horses 
<lb/>and sheep. Lime stone and building stone of va­
<lb/>rious sorts may be obtained in any abundance in 
<lb/>this tract, neither of which has yet been disco­
<lb/>vered in the level country. Indigenous grapes,
<lb/>of several varieties, grow in great profusion, and
<lb/>extensive natural vineyards await the hand of the
<lb/>vine-dresser.</p>
        <p>A military post and town has been established
	<lb/>on the right bank of the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>, twelve miles
	<lb/>above the upper road leading from <placeName>Bexar</placeName> to
	<lb/><placeName>Nacogdoches</placeName>, fifteen miles below the mouth of
	  <lb/>the <placeName>San Andress river</placeName>, and one hundred miles
	<lb/>above <placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName>. This post is called
	<lb/><name>Tenoxticlan</name>.  It is very eligbly situated and

<pb n="68"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="6(4)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">68</mw>
<lb/>abundantly supplied with excellent water. It is
<lb/>the intention of the government to keep a garrison
<lb/>at this place, for the twofold purpose of protecting
	<lb/>the frontiers of <placeName>Austin's Colony</placeName> from the preda­
	<lb/>tory incursions of <name>Indians</name>, and of facilitating the
<lb/>extension of that colony, northwesterly, up the
	  <lb/><placeName>Brazos river</placeName>. The adjacent country for many
<lb/>miles around, is fertile and heathful, and the
	<lb/><placeName>Brazos</placeName> in seasons of freshets, is navigable some
<lb/>miles above this port.</p>
        <p>A new town is about to be established by the
<lb/>Empresario, <persName>Col. Austin</persName>, in his contract of <date when="1827">1827</date>, on
	<lb/>the left bank of the <placeName>Colorado</placeName>, at the intersection
<lb/>of the road above mentioned, with the river. An
<lb/>abundant supply of fine cedar, oak, ash, and
<lb/>other timber is found at this spot, as also lime
<lb/>and other building stone, clay and sand suitable
<lb/>for brick-making.</p>
        <p>The town of <placeName>Gonzales</placeName>, the capital of <placeName>De 
<lb/>Witt's Colony</placeName>, is situated in the tract of country
<lb/>now under review. It is on the left bank of the 
	<lb/><placeName>Guadalupe river</placeName>, at the point where the direct
	<lb/>road from <placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName> intersects that
<lb/>river. The site of this town is elevated, plea­
<lb/>sant, and healthful, and possesses many natural
<lb/>advantages.</p>

        <p>To return to the level or coast lands. That
<lb/>portion of them which lies to the west and south­
	<lb/>west of the <placeName>Guadalupe</placeName>, lying between that river
	<lb/>and the <placeName>Neuces</placeName>, differs in some important re­
<lb/>spects from that which stretches to the eastward,
<lb/>and which has been already noticed. This tract
<lb/>is much narrower than the eastern tract and not
<lb/>so well clothed with timber. The distance from
<lb/>the bay shore to the undulating lands varies from 
<lb/>twenty-five to thirty miles. The margins of the
	  <lb/><placeName>Aransaso</placeName> and <placeName>Neuces bays</placeName> are also much higher
<lb/>than the margins of the bays lying farther east­
<lb/>ward. The whole tract is more elevated, though
<lb/>level, than any parts of the level regions before
<lb/>noticed. The climate also, is believed to be more
<lb/>salubrious and pleasant. The soil of this tract,
<lb/>like that of the other prairie lands, is a deep 
<lb/>black mould, very fertile and productive. The
<lb/>pasturage here, is confessed to be even superior
<lb/>to that of any other district of the country, con­
<lb/>sisting of a different species of grass, called
<lb/>Muskit grass, (pronounced Muskeet.) This grass
<lb/>bears a strong resemblance to the blue grass, so
<lb/>common in the <placeName>United States</placeName>, and furnishes the
<lb/>most nutritious pasturage. It continues green
<lb/>throughout the winter, and retains its nutritious

<pb n="70"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="6(5)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">70</mw>
<lb/>qualities, even after it has become dry and ap­
<lb/>parently dead.</p>
        <p>The Muskit tree also abounds here, affording
<lb/>excellent fire-wood and valuable materials for
<lb/>fencing; while forests of oak, ash, and other
<lb/>timber suitable for building, flourish on the mar­
<lb/>gins of the water courses.</p>
        <p>Two Irish gentlemen have contracted with 
<lb/>the government to settle an Irish colony on this
<lb/>tract. The boundaries of the contemplated
<lb/>colony embrace all the lands between the <placeName>Guada­
	    <lb/>lupe</placeName> and <placeName>Neuces rivers</placeName>, within ten leagues of the
<lb/>gulf or bay shore. This is a very valuable part 
	<lb/>of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, and there can be no doubt but that
	  <lb/>many thousands of the oppressed sons of <name>Erin</name>, if
<lb/>they possessed the information and means of emi­
<lb/>gration, would joyfully exchange their <mcr rend="slant(upright)pre(“)post(”)">cows
<lb/>grass</mcr> and <mcr rend="slant(upright)pre(“)post(”)">potatoe lots</mcr> for rich farms in this
<lb/>colony. Here are no tithes, no poor rates, no
<lb/>burthensome exactions, nor vexatious restrictions.
<lb/>Here enterprize and energy may unfold them­
<lb/>selves to their fullest extent, in all the various
<lb/>pursuits of honest industry, without fear and
<lb/>without reproach. The colony has already com­
<lb/>menced operations under favourable auspices, and
<lb/>will doubtless succeed and ultimately flourish.

<lb/>Nothing is now wanting to insure its immediate
<lb/>success, but a sufficient supply of industrious
<lb/>emigrants.</p>
        <p>The undulating region succeeds to the level
	<lb/>tracts just noticed, between the <placeName>Guadalupe</placeName> and
	<lb/><placeName>Neuces</placeName>, which, stretching in a north-westerly di­
<lb/>rection and gradually increasing in elevation,
<lb/>finally terminates in the mountain range, a dis­
<lb/>tance of about two hundred miles. The whole
<lb/>of this extensive tract affords the best of pastur­
<lb/>age, being principally clothed with the Muskit 
<lb/>grass, and is, on this account, peculiarly adapted
<lb/>to grazing and the raising of stock of every de­
<lb/>scription. Timber and water are not, however,
<lb/>so abundant as in the country lying farther east.
<lb/>The Nopal thrives here with greatest luxuriance,
<lb/>forming oftentimes impenetrable thickets, and
<lb/>furnishing, with its fruit and leaves, a bountiful
<lb/>supply of excellent food for cattle and wild
<lb/>horses.</p>
        <p>The Muskit tree before mentioned, the most
<lb/>common tree found in this section, is a species of
<lb/>locust. Its size is about that of a peach tree,
<lb/>which, when viewed at a distance, it very much
<lb/>resembles in appearance. The leaves of it are
<lb/>similar to those of the honey locust, but much

<pb n="72"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="6(6)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">72</mw>
<lb/>smaller. It bears a pod about the size and shape
<lb/>of the common snap bean, quite sweet to the 
	<lb/>taste, and when dry, is used by the <name>Indians</name> in
<lb/>times of scarcity, for food. It is highly valued
	<lb/>by the <name>Mexicans</name>, who maintain, that for purposes
<lb/>of fattening cattle and hogs, it is equal to Indian
<lb/>corn. The wood of the Muskit is very durable,
<lb/>as much so as black locust or cedar, and hence
<lb/>its value as a material for fencing.</p>
        <p>Lime stone and building stone of good quality
<lb/>abound, and are procured with little labour.</p>
        <p>The ancient town of <placeName>Bexar</placeName> is situated in this
	  <lb/>region of country, on the <placeName>San Antonio river</placeName>, 
<lb/>which flows through it. This place is in latitude 
<lb/>29° 25′, 140 miles from the coast, and contains
	<lb/>2500 inhabitants, all native <name>Mexicans</name>, with the 
<lb/>exception of a very few American families who
<lb/>have settled there. A military out-post was es­
<lb/>tablished at this spot by the Spanish government
<lb/>in <date when="1718">1718</date>. In the year <date when="1731">1731</date>, the town was set­
<lb/>tled by emigrants sent out from the <placeName>Canary
	  <lb/>Islands</placeName> by the king of <placeName>Spain</placeName>. It became a
<lb/>flourishing settlement, and so continued till the
<lb/>revolution in <date when="1812">1812</date>. Since which period the

<lb/>least, the prosperity of the town.</p>
        <p>All the land cultivated in this vicinity, is irri­
	  <lb/>gated from the <placeName>San Antonio river</placeName>. To facilitate
<lb/>this purpose, a low dam of stone is thrown across 
<lb/>the river, which diverts a portion of the water 
<lb/>into a small canal leading to the cultivated 
<lb/>grounds. More than two hundred thousand acres
<lb/>of land might be irrigated, at and below this
<lb/>place, with great ease and with trifling expense.
<lb/>The soil is rich, and the principal articles culti­
<lb/>vated by the inhabitants, are corn, sugar cane,
<lb/>beans, and other vegetables.</p>
        <p>This place is admirably located for the estab­
<lb/>lishment of manufactories, especially of cotton
<lb/>and wool. The supply of water is abundant,
<lb/>and the fall of the river sufficient to admit the ad­
<lb/>vantageous application of it to machinery, at very
<lb/>frequent intervals. The <placeName>San Antonio</placeName> seldom or
<lb/>never overflows its banks, nor is it exposed to
<lb/>sudden or violent freshets, its source being within 
	<lb/>three leagues of <placeName>Bexar</placeName>, and there is not sufficient
<lb/>space for any dangerous accumulation of water.
<lb/>From a concentration of innumerable springs,
<lb/>which unite their rivulets within a few hundred
<lb/>yards of their fountains, the <placeName>San Antonio</placeName> bursts

        <p>A second Irish colony has been commenced

	<lb/>wardly down the rivers <placeName>Madina</placeName> and <placeName>Guadalupe</placeName>,
	<lb/>to the vicinity of <placeName>Bexar</placeName>. Spurs also extend
	<lb/>down the rivers <placeName>Slanos</placeName> and <placeName>Pedernales</placeName> and the
	<lb/>smaller western tributaries of the <placeName>Colorado</placeName>.
	<lb/>Similar spurs stretch up the <placeName>Colorado</placeName>, above
<lb/><placeName>San Saba</placeName>, to a considerable distance, and round
	<lb/>the head-waters of the <placeName>San Andress</placeName> and <placeName>Bosque</placeName>,
	<lb/>tributaries of the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>.</p>
        <p>The mountains are of third and fourth magni­
<lb/>tude in point of elevation. Those of <placeName>San Saba</placeName>
<lb/>are much the highest. They are in many places
<lb/>thickly covered with forests of oak, cedar, and
<lb/>other trees, interspersed with a great variety of
<lb/>shrubbery. Granite, quartz, lime-stone, and other
<lb/>rocks, are common. It is believed they abound

<pb n="76"/>

<lb/>also in mineral wealth, but they have been, yet,
<lb/>very imperfectly explored. Iron, lead, and
<lb/>mineral coal, have been found, and tradition says,
<lb/>that a silver mine on the <placeName>San Saba</placeName> was success­
<lb/>fully wrought many years ago, but the prosecu­
	  <lb/>tion of it was arrested by the <name>Indians</name>, who cut 
<lb/>off the workmen.</p>
        <p>Towards the head waters of the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>, a
<lb/>large mass of metal is known to exist. It is of
<lb/>several tons weight, and said to be worshipped
<lb/>by the <name>Comanche Indians</name>. It is malleable and
<lb/>bright, having little oxide or rust upon its sur­
<lb/>face. A large piece of this metal was taken to
<lb/><placeName>New York</placeName> many years since, by way of <placeName>Nachi­
<lb/>toches</placeName>, under a belief that it was platina. It is
<lb/>said that experiments made by chemists in that
<lb/>city, proved it to be pure iron in a malleable
<lb/>state. The existence of such a mass of metal is
<lb/>doubtless very remarkable. It is, however, well
	  <lb/>attested by many persons in <placeName>Nachitoches</placeName> and in
	  <lb/><placeName>Texas</placeName>, who have been at the spot and seen it.
<lb/>Whether it be iron, is perhaps not so well ascer­
<lb/>tained.</p>
        <p>Extensive valleys of rich, arable, alluvial
<lb/>lands, are found throughout this range, particu­
<lb/>larly upon the water courses. Most of these val­

<pb n="77"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="7(3)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">77</mw>
<lb/>ley lands may be irrigated at little expense, from
<lb/>the numerous streams which flow through them.
<lb/>The sides and even the summits of the moun­
<lb/>tains are, for the most part, susceptible of culti­
<lb/>vation. The soil is sufficiently rich, and adapted
<lb/>to wheat, rye, and other small grain, as well as to
<lb/>the vine and all the northern fruits.</p>
        <p>This range of high land on its north-western
	  <lb/>frontier is of vast advantage to the state of <placeName>Texas</placeName>.
<lb/>It not only renders the atmosphere more salu­
<lb/>brious, but abounding in copious fountains of
<lb/>limpid water, it gives rise to the numberless rivu­
<lb/>lets which, having first irrigated their own fruit­
<lb/>ful valleys, flow off with a rapid current, and
<lb/>unite to form the large rivers of the central and
<lb/>western parts of the state. These last mention­
<lb/>ed rivers are uniformly more limpid than the
	  <lb/>rivers to the east of the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>.</p>
        <p>The resources of this elevated or mountain­
<lb/>ous section are very great and valuable. At
<lb/>some future period, it will, in all probability,
<lb/>supply the whole country with grain, and afford
<lb/>a surplus for exportation. Fine wool will be a
<lb/>staple article from these high lands, which are
<lb/>probably as well adapted to the raising of sheep
<lb/>as any country in the world.</p>

<lb/>these dry, geographical details. I can only say,
<lb/>by way of apology, that I have made them as
<lb/>concise as possible, and have not permitted my
<lb/>imagination to expatiate for a moment, as it was
<lb/>very prone to do, over the delightful scenery we
<lb/>have traversed. I need not repeat to you, for the
<lb/>hundredth time, that I am charmed with this beau­
<lb/>tiful country. Its mountains, its prairies, its

<pb n="79"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="7(4)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">79</mw>
<lb/>forests, and its rivers, all have their charms for
<lb/>me. Hence it is, I suppose, that what you may
<lb/>regard dry geographical details, affect my mind
<lb/>with much of the inspiration of poetry. As I
<lb/>have not permitted any opportunity of gathering
<lb/>useful information to escape me, I have yet more
<lb/>details of the same kind in store, with which I
<lb/>shall now proceed to tax your patience. You must
<lb/>accompany me in a trip along the coast, and take
<lb/>a view of the bays and inlets which indent the
	  <lb/>shores of <placeName>Texas</placeName>.</p>
        <p>The following account of the harbours and
	  <lb/>bays of <placeName>Texas</placeName> was received, not from a lands­
<lb/>man, but from an old sailor, who has traversed
<lb/>the ocean around and across in every direction.
<lb/>A more experienced navigator, or more accurate
<lb/>observer is not to be found. A spirit of enter­
<lb/>prise in the prosecution of his profession, led
<lb/>him in one of his expeditions, to examine a por­
<lb/>tion of this coast; so that he speaks from actual
<lb/>personal observation and survey, of most of the
<lb/>points here noticed.</p>
        <p>Beginning at the eastern extremity of the
	  <lb/>coast, the first large body of water is <placeName>Sabine
<lb/>lake</placeName>. The inlet into this lake has six feet of
<lb/>water. It is, however, difficult to cross, owing to

<pb n="80"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="7(4)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">80</mw>
<lb/>the mud and oyster banks which extend opposite
<lb/>to this inlet, out of sight of land.</p>
        <p><placeName>Galveston</placeName> is the next inlet to the westward.
<lb/>This inlet has twelve feet of water on the bar.
	  <lb/>The harbour lies between <placeName>Galveston</placeName> and <placeName>Pelican
<lb/>islands</placeName>, in which there is good anchorage in five
<lb/>fathoms of water, with muddy bottom. From
	  <lb/>the harbour, through <placeName>Galveston bay</placeName>, to the mouth
	  <lb/>of <placeName>Trinity river</placeName>, or the <placeName>San Jacinto</placeName>, the naviga­
	  <lb/>tion is difficult, being obstructed by <placeName>Red Fish
<lb/>bar</placeName>. This bar has five feet of water at high
<lb/>tides, but in northerly winds, not more than three
<lb/>feet. The bay generally has about nine or ten 
<lb/>feet of water.</p>
        <p>A western arm of this bay stretches to the
<lb/>south-westward, along the coast, to within two
	  <lb/>miles and a half of the <placeName>Brazos river</placeName>, and might
<lb/>be very easily connected with that river by a
<lb/>short canal. There is also an inlet at the west
	  <lb/>end of <placeName>Galveston island</placeName>, which may be advan­
<lb/>tageously used by small vessels, drawing not
<lb/>more than six or seven feet.</p>
        <p>An eastern arm of <placeName>Galveston bay</placeName> extends
	  <lb/>along the coast, called <placeName>East bay</placeName>; from the head
<lb/>of which there is a deep tide water creek, which
	  <lb/>nearly intersects a similar creek from <placeName>Sabine

<pb n="81"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="7(5)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">81</mw>
<lb/>lake</placeName>. By uniting these two creeks, which might
<lb/>be effected with little expense, a canal commu­
<lb/>nication could be opened between the bay and
<lb/>the lake.</p>
        <p>The <placeName>Trinity</placeName> and <placeName>San Jacinto rivers</placeName> discharge
	  <lb/>their waters into <placeName>Galveston bay</placeName>. The former in
<lb/>the north-east, the latter in the north-west corner
	  <lb/>of it. <placeName>Trinity river</placeName> is navigable in time of fresh­
<lb/>ets, a considerable distance above the upper
<lb/>road, heretofore mentioned in these letters. The
<lb/><placeName>San Jacinto</placeName> forms a very beautiful bay at its
<lb/>mouth, and is navigable for any vessel that can
	  <lb/>pass <placeName>Red Fish bar</placeName>, as far as the mouth of <placeName>Buffalo
<lb/>Bayou</placeName>. The <placeName>Buffalo Bayou</placeName> is also navigable to
	  <lb/>its forks above <placeName>Harrisburg</placeName>, to within forty miles
	  <lb/>of <placeName>San Felipe de Austin</placeName>, which interval is a level
<lb/>prairie. It resembles a wide canal, with high
<lb/>and heavily timbered banks. The tide flows up 
<lb/>as far as the forks above mentioned.</p>
        <p>The <placeName>Brazos river</placeName> presents the next inlet.
<lb/>This river has been already noticed in part, but
<lb/>deserves a more particular description in this
<lb/>connexion. The ordinary depth of water upon
<lb/>the bar of this river is six feet. The bar is nar­
<lb/>row, formed by a bank of sand not more than 
<lb/>twenty yards wide. The harbour inside the bar

<pb n="82"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="7(5)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">82</mw>
<lb/>is perfectly safe, and the river is sufficently deep
	  <lb/>for large ships as far as <placeName>Brazoria</placeName>. The anchor­
<lb/>age off this bar is good in northers, which blow
<lb/>off shore, or in light southerly winds. The bot­
<lb/>tom is blue mud with three fathoms of water,
<lb/>immediately outside the bar, which gradually
<lb/>deepens as you recede from the shore. This bar
<lb/>is about four hundred yards from the beach.
<lb/>The substratum beneath the sand of the bar is
<lb/>blue clay, as is also that between the bar and the
<lb/>beach. This clay would afford a solid founda­
<lb/>tion for piling, by which the channel of the river
<lb/>might be contracted over the bar, and thus a deep
<lb/>and safe passage formed into the largest and most
	  <lb/>important river of <placeName>Texas</placeName>.</p>
        <p>The next entrance west of the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>, is the
<lb/><placeName>Passo Cavallo</placeName>, which is the inlet into the spa­
	  <lb/>cious and beautiful bay of <placeName>Matagorda</placeName>. This
<lb/>pass has twelve feet water over the bar, and a
<lb/>safe anchorage within, with four fathoms of wa­
	  <lb/>ter. Like <placeName>Galveston bay</placeName>, however, this bay is
<lb/>shallow. The average depth of water through
	  <lb/>it to the mouth of the <placeName>Colorado river</placeName>, is not
<lb/>more than eight feet. Vessels that can cross the
<lb/>bay, cannot approach nearer than one mile of the
<lb/>mouth of the river, and are compelled to unlad<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">e</unclear>

<pb n="83"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="7(6)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">83</mw>
<lb/>their cargoes by means of lighters. The same
<lb/>inconvenience exists at the mouth of the <placeName>La Baca</placeName>,
<lb/>three feet, or three feet and a half, being the depth
<lb/>of water at the entrance of those rivers, at ordi­
<lb/>nary high tides.</p>
        <p>The <placeName>Colorado river</placeName> is obstructed by a raft of
<lb/>drift wood, ten miles above the town of <placeName>Mata­
<lb/>gorda</placeName>. The raft fills the bed of the river and 
<lb/>causes a dispersion of the water into several
<lb/>channels. The raft is not extensive, and might
<lb/>be easily removed. When this is accomplished
<lb/>the river will be navigable almost to the moun­
<lb/>tains.</p>
        <p>Between the <placeName>Brazos</placeName> and the <placeName>Passo Cavallo</placeName>,
	  <lb/>the <placeName>San Barnard river</placeName> and <placeName>Caney creek</placeName> discharge
<lb/>into the gulf, but the water on their bars is very
<lb/>shallow.</p>
        <p>Pursuing our course in a south-west direction,
<lb/>we come next to the entrance into the bay of
	  <lb/><placeName>Aransaso</placeName>. This entrance is easy for vessels
<lb/>drawing not more than seven feet. The bay is
	  <lb/>safe and much deeper than either <placeName>Galveston</placeName> or
	  <lb/><placeName>Matagorda</placeName>. This bay is the principal harbour
<lb/>for vessels whose cargoes are destined for <placeName>Go­
	    <lb/>liad</placeName> or <placeName>Bexar</placeName>, and for the Irish colonies of the
	  <lb/><placeName>Neuces</placeName>.</p>
        <pb n="84"/>
        <milestone unit="sig" n="7(6)v"/>
        <mw type="pageNum">84</mw>
        <p>The entrance into <placeName>Neuces</placeName> bay is in every
	  <lb/>respect equal to that into <placeName>Aransaso</placeName> bay, but it 
<lb/>has not often been resorted to. Settlements are
<lb/>now beginning to be formed on its margin, and
<lb/>all affirm that no situation for building can be
<lb/>more beautiful and picturesque. The margin is
<lb/>bold and elevated, and when the wilderness shall
<lb/>have given place to a respectable body of Irish
<lb/>emigrants, this spot will present one of the most
	  <lb/>pleasant and desirable residences in <placeName>Texas</placeName>.</p>
        <p>I am perfectly satisfied that <placeName>Texas</placeName> is, in many 
<lb/>respects, the most eligible part of <placeName>North America</placeName>.
<lb/>I speak of course of its natural advantages. Its
<lb/>civil and political condition is of course alto­
<lb/>gether prospective and uncertain. If it should
<lb/>hereafter become the victim of foreign domina­
<lb/>tion, or the theatre of domestic oppression, it
	  <lb/>would not be the first instance of an <placeName>Eden</placeName> con­
<lb/>verted into an abode of sorrow and wretched­
<lb/>ness by the folly of man. Its position is favour­
<lb/>able for commerce. Its climate is salubrious,
<lb/>pleasant, and diversified, partaking of the tropical
<lb/>and the temperate, according to local situation.
<lb/>It presents every species of soil that can be
<lb/>found in alluvion, level, undulating, or mountain­
<lb/>ous lands, embracing all the varieties of clayey,

<pb n="85"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="8(1)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">85</mw>
<lb/>sandy, pebbly, rocky, with all their intermixtures.
<lb/>It is sufficiently supplied with good timber and
<lb/>woodland, also with the most useful metals and
<lb/>fossils. Its harbours and rivers are well adapted
<lb/>to facilitate all the purposes of commercial in­
<lb/>tercourse both at home and abroad. Situated on
<lb/>the <placeName>Gulf of Mexico</placeName>, it has easy access to the 
<lb/>Mexican ports on the south, to the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>
<lb/>on the east, and the <placeName>United States</placeName> on the north.
<lb/>An immense inland trade may be also carried on 
	  <lb/>through the ports of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, with <placeName>New Mexico</placeName>,
	  <lb/><placeName>Chihuahua</placeName>, and all the northern portion of the
<lb/>Mexican republic. This inland trade now passes
	  <lb/>in large caravans, from <placeName>St. Louis</placeName>, in <placeName>Missouri</placeName>, to
<lb/><placeName>Santa Fe</placeName>, in <placeName>New Mexico</placeName>, through a wilderness
	  <lb/>infested with <name>Indians</name>. Whereas the distance 
	  <lb/>from either of the ports of <placeName>Texas</placeName> to the <placeName>Paseo
	    <lb/>del Norte</placeName> and <placeName>Chihuahua</placeName>, or <placeName>New Mexico</placeName>, is
<lb/>much less than from <placeName>St. Louis</placeName>, and a good wa­
<lb/>gon road may be opened the whole distance.</p>
        <p>Nature has been bountiful in distributing her
	  <lb/>favours in <placeName>Texas</placeName>. Nothing now is wanting but
<lb/>a liberal system of policy, on the part of the go­
<lb/>vernment, with regard to emigration on the one
<lb/>hand, and a population of industrious mechanics
<lb/>and farmers and intelligent planters on the other,
<mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(2)">8</mw>

<pb n="86"/>

<mw type="pageNum">86</mw>
<lb/>to make this country rival the most favoured
<lb/>parts of the earth.</p>
        <p>And now, I suppose, you are prepared to de­
	  <lb/>mand a chapter on the politics of <placeName>Texas</placeName>. What
<lb/>is the present and likely to be the future political
	  <lb/>position of this infant <persName>Hercules</persName>? On this topic
<lb/>I must disappoint you, for feeling little interest in
<lb/>politics myself, I have made few inquiries on the
<lb/>subject. I should say, however, that it is not
<lb/>difficult to determine what, in all likelihood, will
	  <lb/>be the future destiny of <placeName>Texas</placeName>. Should the
<lb/>Mexican government adopt a correct policy in
<lb/>relation to this country, it will form a valuable
<lb/>and efficient state of the Mexican confederation,
<lb/>for under a judicious system of administration, it
<lb/>would not be the interest of the inhabitants to 
<lb/>dissolve the present connexion, and they could
<lb/>feel no motive to do so. It certainly is not their
<lb/>interest to separate now, nor do I believe they,
<lb/>that is the more prudent and intelligent settlers,
<lb/>have the least wish to do so.</p>
        <p>It is very possible, however, that an unwise
<lb/>course of administration, on the part of the 
<lb/>general government, might provoke a separation.
<lb/>What might be the ultimate result of such a se­
<lb/>paration, I shall not attempt to conjecture.</p>
        <pb n="87"/>
        <milestone unit="sig" n="8(2)r"/>
        <mw type="pageNum">87</mw>
        <p>All the attention and vigour of the settlers ap­
<lb/>pears to be now, as it ought to be, directed to
<lb/>their own individual private concerns. If unmo­
<lb/>lested in their lawful pursuits of industry, and
<lb/>protected by equal laws from the imposition of
<lb/>the federal officers, they will be satisfied, for I
<lb/>cannot conceive that they should be so blind to
<lb/>their own interests as wantonly to resist the laws
<lb/>of the republic. One thing is certain, that no
<lb/>greater calamity could befal them than the intru­
<lb/>sion of party politics among them. Nothing
<lb/>would more inevitably retard the development
<lb/>of the resources of the country, check emigra­
<lb/>tion, and in every way thwart the benevolent
<lb/>purposes of heaven, and blast the present san­
	  <lb/>guine expectations of the friends of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, than 
<lb/>party jealousies and party intrigue.</p>
        <p>The question of negro slavery in connexion
<lb/>with the settlement of this country, is one of
<lb/>great importance, and perhaps may hereafter
<lb/>present a difficulty. The existing constitution
<lb/>and laws totally prohibit this worst of evils.
	  <lb/>Should this wise policy be abandoned and <placeName>Texas</placeName>
	  <lb/>become, what <placeName>Louisiana</placeName> now is, the receptacle of
<lb/>the redundant and jail-delivered slaves of other
<lb/>countries, all its energies would be paralysed,

<lb/>and whatever oppressions may hereafter arise
<lb/>either from abroad or at home, must be endured,

<lb/>upon, and, from necessity, would be forever de­

<lb/>inhabiting the country to the north and north­
<lb/>west of <placeName>San Antonio de Bexar</placeName>. They are a
<lb/>wandering race, do not cultivate the earth for
<lb/>corn, but depend altogether upon the chase for
<lb/>subsistence. They follow the immense herds of
<lb/>buffaloe which graze the vast plains of this re­
<lb/>gion, often to the amount of thousands in one
<lb/>herd. These plains are also stocked with wild
<lb/>horses, which run together in droves of many
<lb/>hundreds. These wild horses are called, in the

<pb n="89"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="8(3)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">89</mw>
<lb/>language of the country, <term rend="slant(italic)">Mustangs</term>, and hence
<lb/>the figure of speech to denote any thing wild and
<lb/>uncultivated, as a mustang girl, applied to a rude
<lb/>hunter's daughter. These horses are not natives,
<lb/>but descended from the stock brought over by
	  <lb/>the first <name>Spaniards</name>. Domestic animals, and man
<lb/>himself, become rude, when removed from the
	  <lb/>associations of civilized life. The <name>Comanches</name>
<lb/>catch and tame these wild horses, and when un­
<lb/>successful in the chase, subsist upon them.</p>
        <p>These <name>Indians</name> always move on horseback.
<lb/>Besides the bow and arrows, the usual arms of 
<lb/>the Indian warrior, they are armed with a long
<lb/>spear, having a sword blade for the point. A
	  <lb/>war party of these mounted <name>Indians</name> is sufficiently
<lb/>formidable. They are headed by two squaws,
<lb/>who by their shrill voices, serve as trumpeters,
<lb/>and have, like them, various tones, to denote the
<lb/>different evolutions and movements. When they
<lb/>descry an object of attack, or pursuit, they dart
<lb/>forward in a column, like lightning, towards it.
<lb/>At a suitable distance from their prey, they di­
<lb/>vide into two squadrons, one half taking to the
<lb/>right, and the other to the left, and thus sur­
<lb/>round it.</p>

        <p>The <name>Comanches</name> have one head chief and

<lb/>councils quarterly, and a grand council of the
<lb/>whole tribe once a year. At these councils all
<lb/>important matters are decided, and all prisoners
<lb/>taken for offences are tried. Their discipline is
<lb/>rigid. If a hunting party takes the life of a <name>North
<lb/>American</name> after making him prisoner, without
<lb/>bringing him before the council for trial, the of­
<lb/>fenders are punished with death. Not so with
	  <lb/>the <name>Mexicans</name>, who are considered as enemies
<lb/>and treated as such. This hatred is mutual, and
	  <lb/>fully reciprocated on the part of the <name>Mexicans</name>.
<lb/>Hence the origin of the epithet, expressing odium,

<lb/>Being illustrative of the character of the <name>Co­
<lb/>manches</name>, I insert it here. It will show you also,

<lb/>an instance of the kind of hazard, both of life
<lb/>and limb, which this enterprizing man has en­
<lb/>countered in accomplishing his noble project.</p>
        <p>On his way to the city of <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, in the
<lb/>year <date when="1822">1822</date>, with but two persons in company,
<lb/>arriving at <placeName>San Antonio</placeName>, he was told it was dan­
<lb/>gerous to proceed without an escort, for a war-
	  <lb/>party of <name>Comanches</name> was abroad, killing every
<lb/>unprotected person who came in their way, that
<lb/>some individuals had been murdered by them the
<lb/>day before, and that he, with so much baggage,
<lb/>being a valuable prize, could not possibly hope
<lb/>to escape.</p>
        <p>Finding, however, no opportunity of obtain­
<lb/>ing an escort, and the business of the colony re­
<lb/>quiring his presence in the metropolis, he resolv­
<lb/>ed, at all hazards, to proceed on his journey.
<lb/>They travelled the first day unmolested. On the
<lb/>morning of the second day, feeling somewhat in­
<lb/>disposed, he undertook to prepare some coffee.
<lb/>There were no accommodations on the road, and
<lb/>it was necessary to carry provisions on a pack-
<lb/>horse, and cook by the way-side. His com­
	  <lb/>panions warned him, that if there were <name>Indians</name>
<lb/>near, they would be attracted by the smoke. He
<lb/>flattered himself, that by selecting a sheltered

<pb n="92"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="8(4)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">92</mw>
<lb/>place, and making little smoke, it would be im­
<lb/>possible for them to discern it. Besides, his
<lb/>craving for the coffee was so great, being afflict­
<lb/>ed with a bad head-ache, he insisted he must have
<lb/>it, at all risks. They were upon an open plain,
<lb/>and they could see many miles around. No liv­
<lb/>ing creature at the moment, but themselves, was
<lb/>in view.</p>
        <p>The men in company went to seek the horses,
<lb/>which had been hoppled the night before and let
<lb/>loose to feed. This is a mode of tying the
<lb/>horses' legs together to keep them from running
<lb/>away. The Colonel retired to a little ravine to
<lb/>enjoy his coffee. It was boiled, and in the act of
<lb/>putting the refreshing beverage to his parched
<lb/>lips, he heard a sound like the trampling of many
<lb/>horses. Raising his head, with the coffee yet
<lb/>untasted, he beheld in the distance, fifty mounted
	  <lb/><name>Comanches</name>, with their spears glittering in the 
<lb/>morning sun, dashing towards him at full speed.
<lb/>As the column advanced, it divided, according to
<lb/>their usual practice, into two semi-circles, and
<lb/>in an instant, he was surrounded. Quicker than
<lb/>thought, he sprang to his loaded rifle, but as his
<lb/>hand grasped it, he felt that resistance by one
<lb/>against a host, was vain.</p>
        <pb n="93"/>
        <milestone unit="sig" n="8(5)r"/>
        <mw type="pageNum">93</mw>
        <p>The plunder commenced. Every article of
<lb/>the little encampment, with the saddle-bags,
<lb/>which he stood upon to protect if possible, was
<lb/>greedily seized. His presence of mind, however,
<lb/>did not forsake him. He calmly meditated for a
<lb/>moment, on what course to pursue.</p>
        <p>Assuming great composure, he went up to the
	  <lb/>chief, and addressing him in <name>Spanish</name> and the few
	  <lb/>words of <name>Indian</name> he knew, he declared himself to
	  <lb/>be an <name>American</name>, and demanded if their nation
	  <lb/>was at war with the <name>Americans</name>. <said>No,</said> was the
	  <lb/>reply. <said>Do you like the <name>Americans</name>?</said> <said>Yes—
<lb/>they are our friends.</said> <said>Where do you get your
<lb/>spear heads, your blankets,</said> &amp;c. naming all their
<lb/>foreign articles, one by one. <said>Get them from our 
	    <lb/>friends the <name>Americans</name>.</said> <said>Well, do you think if
<lb/>you were passing through their nation, as I am
<lb/>passing through yours, they would rob you as
<lb/>you have robbed me?</said> The chief reflected a
<lb/>little, and replied, <said>No, it would not be right.</said>
<lb/>Upon which he commanded his people to restore 
<lb/>all the things taken.</p>
        <p>Every article of value came back, with the
<lb/>same despatch with which it had disappeared,
<lb/>except the saddle-bags. These, which contained
<lb/>all his money, were indispensable to the further

<pb n="94"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="8(5)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">94</mw>
<lb/>prosecution of his journey. No one could tell
<lb/>any thing of the saddle-bags. Almost in despair
<lb/>of seeing them again, he observed in a thicket, at
<lb/>a little distance, a squaw, one of the trumpeters,
<lb/>kicking and belabouring her horse, to make him
<lb/>move off, while the sagacious beast would not
<lb/>stir a step from the troop. The Colonel instantly
<lb/>pursued the female robber, and, thanks to her
<lb/>restive mustang, secured his property, which was
<lb/>very adroitly hidden under the saddle blanket and
<lb/>herself. The whole sqaudron then wheeled off,
<lb/>and were seen no more.</p>
        <p>One little circumstance connected with this 
	  <lb/>adventure must be added. A <name>Spanish</name> grammar,
<lb/>which the Colonel carried suspended at the sad­
<lb/>dlebow, that he might study it as he rode along,
	  <lb/>(for he was not then familiar with the <name>Spanish</name>
<lb/>language,) was missing. This grammar was af­
	  <lb/>terwards found among the <name>Indians</name> by some
<lb/>traders, and having the owner's name in it, a re­
<lb/>port spread abroad, that he had been killed by
	  <lb/>the <name>Comanches</name>. This report reached the ears
	  <lb/>of his anxious mother and sister in <placeName>Missouri</placeName>, and
<lb/>it was many months before they learned that he
<lb/>had survived this dreary pilgrimage.</p>
        <pb n="95"/>

        <p>The <name rend="slant(italic)">Carancahuas</name> inhabited, formerly the
<lb/>whole of the sea coast. They were reputed to
<lb/>be cannibals and very ferocious. Hence, proba­
	  <lb/>bly, the <name>Spaniards</name> were little disposed to invade
<lb/>them, or to visit the country without a strong mili­
<lb/>tary escort. Hence also, it is less surprising, that 
<lb/>they acquired little knowledge of the coast, and
<lb/>that they supplied the place of knowledge, with
<lb/>tales of factitious horrors.</p>
        <p>The first settlers in this part of the country,
<lb/>under <persName>Colonel Austin</persName>, arrived in considerable
	  <lb/>force, and were well armed. The <name>Carancahuas</name>
<lb/>were sufficiently peaceable so long as the settlers
<lb/>remained in a body, annoying them only by beg­
<lb/>ging and stealing, whatever fell in their way.
<lb/>But when the settlers separated to explore the 
<lb/>country for the purpose of selecting an eligible
<lb/>location, four of the number, who were left with 
<lb/>the provisions and baggage to protect them, were
	  <lb/>killed by these <name>Indians</name>, and their goods carried
<lb/>off.</p>
        <p>Thus hostilities commenced. The colonists,
<lb/>at this period, were not strong enough to inflict
	  <lb/>the chastisement the <name>Indians</name> had provoked, being
<lb/>unaided by a single soldier from the government,
<lb/>and were compelled to submit to the insolence

<pb n="96"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="8(6)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">96</mw>
<lb/>they could not resent. These vexations were
<lb/>endured for some years, when, at last, the num­
<lb/>ber of the colonists being much increased, they
<lb/>mustered a party of sixty riflemen, to punish them
<lb/>for some murders they had committed. <persName>Colonel
<lb/>Austin</persName> commanded this expedition in person.
<lb/>The result was, the slaughter of half the tribe.
<lb/>The remainder took refuge in the church of the
<lb/>Mexican Mission of <placeName>La Bahar</placeName>. The priests
<lb/>were ordered to turn them out, on pain of having
<lb/>the sanctuary violated in case of refusal. But,
	  <lb/>after much entreaty, by the priests and Alcade,
<lb/>a truce was granted them, on condition, that they
<lb/>should never again cross the <placeName>La Baca</placeName> river, the
<lb/>western boundary of the colony. The Alcade
<lb/>and priests became surety for their good beha­
<lb/>viour. This engagement, they have faithfully
<lb/>kept.</p>
        <p>Recently, the <name>Mexicans</name> have commenced kill­
<lb/>ing the remnant of this tribe, for some robberies
<lb/>and murders committed by them. The survivors
<lb/>have crossed the <placeName>La Baca</placeName>, to the number of forty
<lb/>or fifty, to beg the protection of the colonists, of­
<lb/>fering to perform any kind of service or labour,
<lb/>in return for protection and food. The people

<pb n="97"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="9(1)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">97</mw>
<lb/>on that frontier have, accordingly, distributed
<lb/>them amongst their families, as servants.</p>
        <p>Thus, the shores and bays of this beautiful 
<lb/>region, in which these fierce children of the
<lb/>woods once roamed, free as the lion of the de­
<lb/>sert, have been transferred to other hands. From
<lb/>being the rightful proprietors of the domain,
<lb/>they have become the hewers of wood and 
<lb/>drawers of water, to their invaders.</p>
        <p>There are remnants of several other tribes of
	  <lb/><name>Indians</name>, which still exist in <placeName>Texas</placeName>, but of too
<lb/>little note to merit particular notice. They are
<lb/>either too few in numbers to be formidable, or so
<lb/>far civilized, as to provide well for themselves,
	  <lb/>without disturbing others. The <name>Cushatees</name> are
<lb/>most worthy of notice. They have their vil­
	  <lb/>lages on the <placeName>Trinity river</placeName>, their houses are well
<lb/>constructed, and their fields well cultivated.
<lb/>They have good stocks of horses and cattle, use
<lb/>culinary utensils, and are hospitable to strangers.
<lb/>In autumn, when their crops are laid by, they
<lb/>range the country in small parties, to procure a
<lb/>winter's stock of venison and bear's meat, leaving
<lb/>their villages often without a single individual, <unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">to</unclear>
<lb/>protect them. They are few in number, and
<lb/>quite friendly. When among the settlements,
<mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(2)">9</mw>

<pb n="98"/>

<mw type="pageNum">98</mw>
<lb/>they conduct themselves with great propriety,
<lb/>and know the difference between a wild hog and
<lb/>one that has a mark on his ear.</p>
        <p>The <name>Kickapoos</name> and <name>Shawnees</name>, driven by the
<lb/>people of the <placeName>United States</placeName> to the west of the
	  <lb/><placeName>Mississippi</placeName>, sometimes extend their hunting par­
	  <lb/>ties quite to the settlements on the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>. They
	  <lb/>appear to regard the American settlers in <placeName>Texas</placeName>,
<lb/>as a part of the people of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, and 
<lb/>conduct themselves in a friendly and respectful
<lb/>manner.</p>

<lb/>Austin</persName> and his little band of hardy pioneers, dis­
<lb/>plays a spirit of noble enterprise not often sur­
<lb/>passed. If the project of establishing such a
	  <lb/>colony in <placeName>Texas</placeName> did not originate with the <name>Aus­
<lb/>tins</name>, it was the first proposal of the kind that

<pb n="99"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="9(2)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">99</mw>
<lb/>was accepted by the Mexican authorities, and it
<lb/>cannot be denied, that the sagacity, the prudence,
<lb/>the industry and perseverance, displayed by <persName>Col.
<lb/>Austin</persName> in the successful execution of the under­
<lb/>taking, are worthy of all admiration. A short
<lb/>history of the origin of the colony, with some
<lb/>of the difficulties which embarrassed its first
<lb/>struggles for existence, cannot fail to be inter­
<lb/>esting.</p>
        <p>The idea of forming a settlement of <name>North
	    <lb/>Americans</name> in the wilderness of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, it is be­
<lb/>lieved, originated with <persName>Moses Austin</persName>, esq. of 
	  <lb/><placeName>Missouri</placeName>, and, after the conclusion of <name>De Onis' 
<lb/>treaty</name>, in <date when="1819">1819</date>, efforts were made by him to put
<lb/>matters in train for an application to the Spanish
<lb/>government in <placeName>Old Spain</placeName>. In answer to his inqui­
<lb/>ries as to the best mode of laying the subject be­
<lb/>fore the Spanish government, he was advised to 
<lb/>apply to the Spanish authorities in <placeName>New Spain</placeName>.
<lb/>A memorial was accordingly presented, and his
	  <lb/>application granted, on the <date when="1821-01-17">17th of <name>January</name>, 1821</date>,
<lb/>by the supreme government of the <placeName>Eastern In­
	  <lb/>ternal Provinces of New Spain</placeName>, at <placeName>Monterrey</placeName>.
<lb/>Authority was hereby granted to <persName>Mr. Austin</persName> to 
	  <lb/>introduce three hundred families into <placeName>Texas</placeName>, on
<lb/>terms that were satisfactory to both parties.</p>

        <p>At this juncture of affairs, before any location
<lb/>for the intended colony was fixed upon, in the
<lb/>midst of diligent preparations to fulfil his engage­
<lb/>ment, <persName>Mr. Moses Austin</persName> died. His health had
<lb/>suffered greatly by exposure to bad weather,
<lb/>from swimming and rafting rivers, and from want
	  <lb/>of provisions on his return to <placeName>Missouri</placeName> from
	  <lb/><placeName>Bexar</placeName>, for at that time <placeName>Texas</placeName> was an entire wil­
	  <lb/>derness from <placeName>Bexar</placeName> to the <placeName>Sabine</placeName>. A severe
<lb/>cold, occasioned by this exposure, terminated in
<lb/>an inflammation of the lungs, which finally put
<lb/>an end to his mortal life.</p>
        <p>This gentleman was a native of <placeName>Durham</placeName>, in
<lb/>the <placeName>State of Connecticut</placeName>, and presents an eminent
<lb/>specimen of the enterprising character of the
<lb/><placeName>New England</placeName> people. At a very early age, im­
<lb/>pelled by a thirst of knowledge, and an ambition
<lb/>to make a speedy fortune, he left his native state,
<lb/>and, at the age of twenty, was married to <persName>Miss
	    <lb/>Maria Brown</persName>, in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>. Shortly afterwards,
<lb/>in partnership with his brother, <persName>Stephen Austin</persName>,
<lb/>he purchased the lead mines, called <name>Chessel's
	    <lb/>Mines</name>, on <placeName>New river</placeName>, <placeName>Wythe county</placeName>, <placeName>Virginia</placeName>,
<lb/>to which he removed, and established a regular
<lb/>system of mining and smelting, together with the
<lb/>manufacture of shot, sheet-lead, &amp;c. Miners

<pb n="101"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="9(3)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">101</mw>
<lb/>and mechanics to prosecute this business, were in­
	  <lb/>troduced from <placeName>England</placeName>, for at that time, manu­
<lb/>factures, of this description, were in their infancy
<lb/>in the <placeName>United States</placeName>. Owing to causes beyond
<lb/>his control, this enterprise failed of success.
<lb/>Having received flattering accounts of the lead
	  <lb/>mines in <placeName>Upper Louisiana</placeName>, now <placeName>Missouri</placeName>, he re­
<lb/>solved to visit that distant and unknown country.
<lb/>Accordingly, having procured the necessary
<lb/>passports from the Spanish minister, he visited
<lb/><placeName>Upper Louisiana</placeName> in <date when="1797">1797</date>, and procured a grant
<lb/>from the Governor General, <persName>Baron de Carondelet</persName>,
<lb/>for one league of land, including the <name>Mine-a-
<lb/>Burton</name>, forty miles west of <placeName>St. Genevieve</placeName>. After
<lb/>closing all his affairs in the <placeName>United States</placeName>, he re­
<lb/>moved his family, with a number of others from
<lb/><placeName>Wythe county</placeName>, by a new and almost untried
<lb/>route, down the <placeName>Kenhawa river</placeName>, to his new grant,
<lb/>in <date when="1799">1799</date>, and laid a foundation for the settlement,
<lb/>of, what is now called, <placeName>Washington county</placeName>, in
	  <lb/><placeName>Missouri</placeName>. The early settlers of this county will
<lb/>bear ample testimony to his enterprise, public
<lb/>spirit, and honourable character. The exercise
<lb/>of these generous qualities, in fact, brought on
<lb/>another reverse of fortune, and compelled him
<lb/>to turn, with unabated ardour, in the decline of

<milestone unit="sig" n="9(3)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">102</mw>
<lb/>life, to a new and hazardous enterprise in the
	  <lb/>wilderness of <placeName>Texas</placeName>.</p>
        <p>At his death, <persName>Mr. Moses Austin</persName> left a request,
<lb/>that his son, <persName>Stephen F. Austin</persName>, should prosecute
<lb/>the enterprise which he had thus commenced, of
	  <lb/>forming a settlement in <placeName>Texas</placeName>. <persName>Stephen F.
<lb/>Austin</persName>, whom I shall hereafter designate as <persName>Col.
<lb/>Austin</persName>, immediately entered upon the prosecu­
<lb/>tion of the enterprise with vigour. After having
	  <lb/>first visited the capital of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, to make the
<lb/>legal arrangements, and having personally sur­
<lb/>veyed the country, without a guide, and at much
<lb/>risk, in order to select a favourable location, in
	  <lb/><date when="1821-12"><name>December</name>, 1821</date>, he arrived on the <placeName>river Brazos</placeName>
<lb/>with the first emigrants, and the new settlement
<lb/>was commenced in the midst of an entire wilder­
<lb/>ness. Without entering into a detailed history
<lb/>of all the difficulties, privations and dangers that
<lb/>were encountered by the first emigrants, it is suf­
<lb/>ficient to say, that such a detail would present
<lb/>examples of inflexible perseverance and fortitude
<lb/>on the part of these settlers, which have been
<lb/>seldom equalled in any country, or in any enter­
<lb/>prise.</p>
        <p>Of two cargoes of provisions, shipped from
<lb/><placeName>New Orleans</placeName> for their subsistence, one was lost

<pb n="103"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="9(4)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">103</mw>
<lb/>on the coast, the other, after having been de­
<lb/>posited on shore, was destroyed by the <name>Caran­
<lb/>cuhuas</name>, and four men, left to protect it, were
<lb/>massacred. They were compelled by these dis­
<lb/>appointments, to obtain their seed-corn over land,
	  <lb/>and with much trouble, from <placeName>Sabine</placeName> or <placeName>Bexar</placeName>. For
<lb/>months, they were totally destitute of bread and
<lb/>salt. Sugar and coffee were luxuries, enjoyed 
<lb/>only in remembrance or in anticipation. Their
<lb/>only dependence for subsistence, was upon the
<lb/>wild game. To range the country for buffaloe,
	  <lb/>was dangerous on account of the <name>Indians</name>. The 
<lb/>mustangs, or wild horses, fortunately were abun­
<lb/>dant and fat, and, it is estimated, that one hundred
<lb/>of them were eaten in the course of the two first
<lb/>years.</p>
        <p>The <name>Carancuahua Indians</name> were very hostile on 
	  <lb/>the coast. The <name>Wacos</name> and <name>Tawakanies</name> were
<lb/>equally so in the interior, and committed constant
	  <lb/>depredations. Parties of <name>Tankaways</name>, <name>Lep<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">a</unclear>ns</name>,
<lb/>and other tribes, were intermingled with the set­
	  <lb/>tlers. These <name>Indians</name> were beggarly and inso­
<lb/>lent, and were restrained from violence the first 
<lb/>two years, only by presents, forebearance, and
<lb/>policy. There was not force enough in the
<lb/>colony to awe them. One imprudent step with

<pb n="104"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="9(4)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">104</mw>
	  <lb/>these <name>Indians</name>, would have destroyed the settle­
<lb/>ment, and the settlers deserve as much credit for
<lb/>their forebearance, during the years <date from="1822" to="1823">1822-23</date>, as
<lb/>for their fortitude. In <date when="1824">1824</date>, the force of the
<lb/>colony justified a change of policy, and a party
	  <lb/>of <name>Tarankaways</name> was, in that year, publicly tied
<lb/>and whipped, in the presence of their chiefs, for
<lb/>horse stealing.</p>
        <p>The hardships of the wilderness, however,
<lb/>were not the only difficulties to be surmounted.
<lb/>Great embarrassment arose from another quarter,
<lb/>which produced much delay, expense, personal
	  <lb/>risk, and discouragement to <persName>Col. Austin</persName>, and not
<lb/>only checked all further accession to the colony
<lb/>for a time, but compelled some of the actual emi­
<lb/>grants to abandon their lands.</p>
        <p>In <date when="1824-03"><name>March</name></date>, <persName>Col. Austin</persName> proceeded to <placeName>Bexar</placeName> to
<lb/>make his report to the Governor, by whom he
<lb/>was informed, for the first time, that it would be
<lb/>necessary for him to proceed, immediately, to the
	  <lb/>city of <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, in order to procure from the
<lb/><orgName>Mexican Congress</orgName>, then in session, a confirma­
<lb/>tion of the original grant to his father, <persName>Moses
<lb/>Austin</persName>, and receive special instructions as to the
<lb/>distribution of land, the issuing of titles, &amp;c.
<lb/>This intimation was totally unexpected, and, as

<pb n="105"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="9(5)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">105</mw>
<lb/>may be well supposed, very embarrassing; for not
<lb/>calculating upon any thing of the kind, he had
<lb/>not made the necessary preparations for such a
<lb/>journey. There was no time for hesitation.
<lb/>Hasty arrangements were made with <persName>Mr. Josiah
<lb/>H. Bell</persName>, to take charge of the infant settlement,
<lb/>and <persName>Col. Austin</persName> immediately departed for the
	  <lb/>city of <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, a journey of twelve hundred
<lb/>miles.</p>
        <p>This was an undertaking of no little hazard 
<lb/>at that time. Owing to the revolutionary state 
<lb/>of the country, the roads were infested with 
	  <lb/>robbers, and the <name>Indians</name>, taking advantage of the
<lb/>times, committed many outrages. <persName>Col. Austin</persName>
<lb/>fortunately escaped without molestation, except
<lb/>that of being partially robbed by a party of <name>Co­
<lb/>manches</name>, as related in a preceeding letter. From
	  <lb/><placeName>Monterrey</placeName>, he had but one companion. They
<lb/>both disguised themselves in ragged clothes, with
<lb/>blankets, so as to pass for very poor men, who
	  <lb/>were going to <placeName>Mexico</placeName> to petition for compensa­
<lb/>tion for services in the revolution.</p>
        <p>The state of political affairs in the capital, at
<lb/>this time, was very unsettled. In addition to em­
<lb/>barrassments likely to arise from this source,
	  <lb/>when <persName>Col. Austin</persName> arrived in <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, he laboured

<pb n="106"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="9(5)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">106</mw>
<lb/>under the disadvantages of being a foreigner, a
<lb/>total stranger, and ignorant of the language of
<lb/>the country, except what little knowledge he had
	  <lb/>acquired in his first trip to <placeName>Bexar</placeName>, and on his
<lb/>journey to the capital. Without entering into a 
<lb/>minute detail of all the perplexities and difficul­
<lb/>ties which embarrassed the business, arising out
<lb/>of the revolutions and frequent modifications of
<lb/>the general government, which took place at that
<lb/>period, and these were neither few nor small,
<lb/><persName>Col. Austin</persName>, after a whole year's detention, at
	  <lb/>last had the satisfaction of returning to <placeName>Texas</placeName>,
<lb/>with the object of his journey fully accomplish­
	  <lb/>ed. His authority to plant a colony in <placeName>Texas</placeName>, 
<lb/>under which he had been acting, was confirmed 
<lb/>by all the national authorities which, under dif­
<lb/>ferent names, had ruled the Mexican nation 
<lb/>during the year; and, as the last confirmation was
<lb/>by the <orgName>Sovereign Constituent Congress</orgName>, whose
<lb/>members were the acknowledged and legal repre­
<lb/>sentatives of the people of the nation, there
<lb/>could be no shadow of doubt as to the legality
<lb/>and validity of his concession.</p>
        <p>In <name>August</name>, when <persName>Col. Austin</persName> arrived in the
<lb/>colony, it was nearly broken up, in consequence
	  <lb/>of his long detention in <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, and emigration

<pb n="107"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="9(6)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">107</mw>
<lb/>had totally ceased. Many of the first emigrants
<lb/>had returned to the <placeName>United States</placeName>, and a number
<lb/>of those who had commenced their journey for
<lb/>the colony, had stopped in the vicinity of <placeName>Na­
<lb/>cogdoches</placeName>, or on the <placeName>Trinity river</placeName>, and thus the
<lb/>settlement of those sections of the country began.
<lb/>By energetic exertion and prudent management,
<lb/>however, the life of the expiring colony was
<lb/>soon revived, and from the day of <persName>Col. Austin's</persName>
<lb/>personal re-appearance in the settlement to the 
<lb/>present day, the affairs of the colony have flowed
<lb/>onward, with a silent, but rapid and uninterrupted
<lb/>prosperity. It now numbers upwards of six
<lb/>thousand inhabitants, and the influx of emigrants
<lb/>greater than ever. These people I am assured
<lb/>are, as a body, of the most industrious and worthy
<lb/>character, for the greatest precaution has been
<lb/>used, from the commencement of the enterprise,
<lb/>to exclude the idle and the vicious.  This judi­
<lb/>cious policy has been pursued throughout, from
<lb/>a conviction, that the success of the undertaking
<lb/>must depend upon the good character of the po­
<lb/>pulation. A report, counter to this statement,
<lb/>has more than once found its way to the public
<lb/>ear, and been circulated in the newspaper, but
<lb/>it is a fabrication and a slander.</p>

        <p>Several fugitives, who found their way into
<lb/>the colony in <date from="1823" to="1824">1823-4</date>, he expelled, under the se­
<lb/>verest threats of corporal punishment if they re­
<lb/>turned, and in one instance he inflicted it. As
<lb/>regards the general morality and hospitality of
<lb/>the inhabitants, and the commission of crimes,
<lb/>the settlement, it is contended, will bear a fa­
<lb/>vourable comparison with any county in the 
<lb/><placeName>United States</placeName>.</p>
        <p>When, in the progress of years, the state of
	  <lb/><placeName>Texas</placeName> shall take her place among the powerful
<lb/>empires of the American continent, her citizens
<lb/>will doubtless regard <persName>Col. Austin</persName> as their patri­
<lb/>arch, and children will be taught to hold his name
<lb/>in reverence; for thought there have been many
<lb/>other respectable men engaged in the work of
<lb/>colonization, yet <persName>Col. Austin</persName> began the work, 
<lb/>and was the first to open the wilderness. All
<lb/>the subsequent labour of others has been com­
<lb/>paratively easy.</p>
        <p><persName>Col. Austin</persName> has proved himself, both in point 
<lb/>of talents and sound judgement, perfectly qualified
<lb/>for the arduous undertaking he took in hand. In
<lb/>the first place, we view him as the hardy and
<lb/>bold pioneer, braving all the dangers of a wilder­
	  <lb/>ness infested with hostile <name>Indians</name>, far out of the

<pb n="109"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="10(1)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">109</mw>
<lb/>reach of civilized society, and all the most com­
<lb/>mon comforts of civilized life, enduring with the
<lb/>humblest labourer of the little band, all the expo­
<lb/>sure and privation of the camp, living for months
<lb/>upon wild horse-flesh, without bread or salt.</p>
        <p>In the second place, we view him as the skil­
	  <lb/>ful negotiator in the capitol of <placeName>Mexico</placeName>. His
<lb/>difficulties here, were of the most trying and dis­
<lb/>couraging kind, and required the greatest discre­
<lb/>tion to surmount; for his business was with the
<lb/>government, and that government in a constant
<lb/>state of revolution and counter-revolution. Twice
<lb/>was his business brought, as he had every reason
<lb/>to think, almost to a successful termination,
<lb/>when a change of government threw it out, and
<lb/>left him where he began months before, to com­
<lb/>mence anew. His difficulties were not a little
<lb/>increased by the number of petitions for grants
<lb/> of colonization similar to his own. Among these
<lb/>applications, was one from <persName>Gen. Wilkinson</persName>, for­
	  <lb/>merly of the <orgName>United States army</orgName>.  It argues not
<lb/>a little in favour of his own skilful management,
<lb/>that, of all these petitions, his alone was finally
<lb/>acceded to, at that time, by the Mexican authori­
<lb/>ties.</p>
        <mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(2)">10</mw>
        <pb n="110"/>
        <milestone unit="sig" n="10(1)v"/>
        <mw type="pageNum">110</mw>
        <p>Next, view him as the civil governor and
<lb/>military commander of the people, for he was 
<lb/>clothed with very extensive civil and judicial au­
<lb/>thority in all matters, and, as commander of the
<lb/>militia, he was vested with the rank of Lieut.
	  <lb/>Colonel, by the provincial deputation of <placeName>Coahuila</placeName>
	  <lb/>and <placeName>Texas</placeName>. If his power has been great, most
<lb/>judiciously and beneficently has he wielded it,
<lb/>as is abundantly proved and illustrated, by the
<lb/>present prosperity of the colony. If any one is
<lb/>inclined to surmise, that this prosperity was a
<lb/>matter of course, he should reflect, that, out of
<lb/>twenty grants of colonization similar to his own, 
<lb/>his, alone, can be said to have fully succeeded.
<lb/>Whoever will reflect upon the proverbial jealousy
<lb/>of the Mexican people, which, for years, was in­
<lb/>dulged to such a degree as to exclude every
	  <lb/>foreign footstep from the soil of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, will
<lb/>know how to appreciate the prudent and saga­
<lb/>cious management which has produced such 
<lb/>pleasing results. Nor should it be forgotten,
<lb/>that, whatever has been accomplished, has been
<lb/>effected by policy and private resources alone,
<lb/>without the aid of a single soldier to repel hostile
	  <lb/><name>Indians</name>, or a single dollar from the public trea­

<pb n="111"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="10(2)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">111</mw>
<lb/>sury, even to pay the salaries of the necessary 
<lb/>subordinate officers and clerks.</p>
        <p>It may be supposed, that he is now sufficiently
<lb/>compensated for all his labours by a vast accu­
<lb/>mulation of wealth. But this is not so. He in­
<lb/>deed, holds the title to much valuable land. Aside
<lb/>from this, he is poor, and land can hardly be con­
<lb/>sidered wealth, where land is so abundant, and 
<lb/>to be got almost for nothing. Many of the set­
<lb/>tlers, without any hardships, or exposure, 
<lb/>or labour, which he has encountered, are richer
<lb/>than he. That many opportunities of promoting
<lb/>his private fortune have presented themselves, 
<lb/>will, of course, be understood. But his character
<lb/>is noble and generous, and he has, in a great
<lb/>measure, yielded all considerations of a private
<lb/>nature, to the general welfare of the colony. He
<lb/>has had his enemies and calumniators, as it is na­
<lb/>tural to expect of one, who held the power, and
<lb/>was determined to exercise a wholesome au­
<lb/>thority, in the management of affairs. His repu­
<lb/>tation, however, remains untarnished, and never
<lb/>in higher estimation than at this present moment.
<lb/>Amidst all the slanderous imputations that have 
<lb/>been uttered against him, he finds sufficient con­
<lb/>solation, in the general confidence of all the intel­

<pb n="112"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="10(2)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">112</mw>
<lb/>ligent and worthy part of the settlers, and above
<lb/>all, in the uniform approbation of the Mexican
<lb/>authorities.</p>
        <p>The colony has received the most cordial and
<lb/>uninterrupted manifestations of liberality, confi­
<lb/>dence, and kindness, from every superior officer,
	  <lb/>who has governed the province of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, or the 
	  <lb/>state of <placeName>Coahuila</placeName> and <placeName>Texas</placeName>, from its commence­
<lb/>ment to the present time. For its services on
<lb/>one occasion, it received, in flattering terms, the
<lb/>approbation of the President. These testimo­
<lb/>nials are too high and unimpeachable to leave any
<lb/>doubt, as to the morality, honour, and integrity,
<lb/>of either <persName>Col. Austin</persName> himself, or of the great
<lb/>mass of the settlers. To say that there are no
<lb/>base men here, would be a violation of candour
<lb/>and truth, but these individuals meet their reward
	  <lb/>in <placeName>Texas</placeName>, as in other well regulated communi­
<lb/>ties, in the frowns of public opinion.</p>
        <p><persName>Col. Austin</persName> is still a young man, not yet forty
<lb/>years of age, but, through the hardships of his
<lb/>life, looks much older than he really is. In his
<lb/>youth, he received a respectable academical edu­
	  <lb/>cation at <orgName>Colchester</orgName>, in <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, but began,
<lb/>very early, to acquire that species of knowledge
<lb/>which is to be obtained only by the experience

<pb n="113"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="10(3)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">113</mw>
<lb/>of business, and the intercourse of men,—a kind
<lb/>of knowledge which has qualified him to perform
<lb/>well his part in the peculiar sphere of life in
	  <lb/>which he has been called, by <name>Providence</name>, to act.
<lb/>He is, now, a member of the <orgName>Legislature of Coa­
	      <lb/>huila and Texas</orgName>, which holds its sittings at <placeName>Sal­
<lb/>tillo</placeName>. Long may he live to reap the reward of 
<lb/>his arduous labours, and enjoy the fruits of his
<lb/>noble enterprise.</p>
        <p>We do injustice to the subject, and to the
	  <lb/><name>Austins</name>, by regarding them merely as the founders
<lb/>of the colony which bears their name, They
<lb/>have, in fact, been the movers, either directly or
<lb/>indirectly of the whole North American and
<lb/>Irish emigration to this country, and, whatever
<lb/>good may result to the great cause of liberty, of
<lb/>science, and human happiness, by the introduc­
<lb/>tion into this vast region, of the <name>English</name> lan­
<lb/>guage, and of those principles of republican and
<lb/>constitutional government, which always accom­
<lb/>pany that language, may be very properly attri­
<lb/>buted to them,—to the father for conceiving the
<lb/>idea of such an enterprise, to the son for suc­
<lb/>cessfully accomplishing it. Few instances occur 
<lb/>in the history of new settlements, in which re­
	  <lb/>sults <emph>so</emph> important and permanent have been pro­

<lb/>duced by means so comparatively feeble, and 
<lb/>under circumstances so discouraging, The set­
<lb/>tlers of <placeName>Austin's Colony</placeName> were unaided by capital
<lb/>or support, either from the Mexican government
<lb/>or from any other quarter. They had no re­
<lb/>sources, whatever, to depend upon, except those
<lb/>afforded by the spirit and prudence of their 
<lb/>leader, a total contempt of danger, obstacles,
<lb/>and privations, and a firm reliance on their rifles,
<lb/>themselves, and their God. Besides the natural
<lb/>difficulties of subduing the wilderness, they had
<lb/>to contend with the deeply fixed prejudices of
<lb/>the people in the <placeName>United States</placeName>, who were loath
<lb/>to remove to a country, which they had been
<lb/>taught to believe, was barren and savage, doomed
<lb/>to eternal pestilence and fevers, and, at least, but
<lb/>a refuge for fugitive criminals, pirates, and des­
<lb/>perados. Other obstacles, not less appalling to
<lb/>some, arose from the revolutionary and distracted
	  <lb/>condition of the civil government of <placeName>Mexico</placeName>.</p>
        <p>Until recently, neither the Mexican govern­
<lb/>ment nor the Mexican people, knew any thing of
<lb/>this interesting country, and, whatever value it
<lb/>now possesses in their estimation, or in the opi­
<lb/>nion of the world, is to be attributed, entirely, to
<lb/>the foreign emigrants. They redeemed it from

<pb n="115"/>

<mw type="pageNum">115</mw>
<lb/>the wilderness,—they developed its resources,—
<lb/>they have explored it, in its length and breadth,
<lb/>and made known its geography. All has been
<lb/>done by them, without the cost of a single cent
	  <lb/>to the <name>Mexicans</name>. This consideration, certainly
<lb/>gives to those emigrants, a natural and a just claim
<lb/>upon the liberality of the government, and au­
<lb/>thorises them to expect a system of colonization,
<lb/>of revenue and municipal law, adapted to their
<lb/>local situation and their infant state.</p>

        <p rend="first-indent(0)"><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> people of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, as yet, have little time for
<lb/>trade. Every body is occupied with his domes­
<lb/>tic arrangements and plans for supplying his im­
<lb/>mediate wants. It is found to be easier to raise
<lb/>or manufacture such articles as are needed in the
<lb/>family, or to do without, than to obtain them from
<lb/>abroad, or to employ an individual to scour the

<pb n="116"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="10(4)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">116</mw>
<lb/>country, in search of such as may be desired.
<lb/>People live too far apart, to beg or borrow often,
<lb/>and few trouble themselves to send any thing to
<lb/>market, though they have ever so much to spare.
<lb/>They had rather give to you of their abundance,
<lb/>if you will send to their doors. The towns are
<lb/>too distant to obtain supplies from them; while
<lb/>some are too proud, some too lazy, and most too
<lb/>indifferent, to trouble themselves about the matter.
<lb/>If they want any article of first necessity, coffee,
<lb/>for instance, which is much used, they will send
<lb/>some of their chickens, butter, and eggs, to a 
<lb/>neighbouring family newly arrived, and propose
<lb/>an exchange as most new comers bring with 
<lb/>them some stores. There is much of this kind
<lb/>of barter, provisions being so much more plenty 
<lb/>than money. Nobody, however, fares very sump­
<lb/>tuously; the new comers have not the articles,
<lb/>and the older residents have grown indifferent to 
<lb/>the use of them. Besides, they are rich enough;
<lb/>without depending upon the sale of small matters
<lb/>for an income.</p>
        <p>There is a peculiar feeling among them about
<lb/>game. No one will receive money for any thing
<lb/>taken by his gun, but will cheerfully give you as
<lb/>much as you will take, and feel insulted, if you

<pb n="117"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="10(5)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">117</mw>
<lb/>offer him money in return. As the chief supplies
<lb/>are of this description, there is, of course, little
<lb/>for sale. It would be better for the public, if this
<lb/>feeling did not prevail, as provisions of this sort,
<lb/>could be furnished at so easy and cheap a rate.</p>
        <p>Hence, there is some ground for reasonable
	  <lb/>complaint against the living in <placeName>Texas</placeName>. But it is
<lb/>not the fault of the country. It is an evil, which
<lb/>persons suitably disposed, who would open farms,
<lb/>gardens, and poultry yards, in the vicinity of the 
<lb/>settlements, could very soon remedy, while they
<lb/>would not, themselves, be the persons least bene­
<lb/>fitted. In no country, with the usual attention to
<lb/>the arts of life, could more luxuries for the table
<lb/>be furnished. At present, vegetables, fruits, eggs,
	  <lb/>butter, and chickens, sell very high in <placeName>Brazoria</placeName>;
<lb/>though they are yielded in every season of the
<lb/>year, in a profusion unexampled in any part of 
<lb/>the world. The new comer has but to plant his
<lb/>seeds in the ground, and collect a first supply of
<lb/>live stock to begin with. They need but little or
<lb/>no care afterwards, and the increase is astonishing.
<lb/>He brands his cattle and hogs, and lets them run.
<lb/>They require no attention, but to see that they do
<lb/>not stray too far from home, and become wild.
<lb/>A field once planted in pumpkins, seldom needs

<pb n="118"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="10(5)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">118</mw>
<lb/>planting again. The scattered seed sow them­
<lb/>selves, and the plants are cultivated with the corn.
<lb/>These pumpkins, as large, often, as a man can
<lb/>lift, have a sweet flavour, and are very palatable.
<lb/>A field of them is a curiosity, they are in such
<lb/>numbers and so large. Sweet potatoes, also, are
<lb/>cultivated with almost equal ease, and yield, at
<lb/>times, five hundred bushels to the acre. Some of
<lb/>these potatoes weigh from four, to seven pounds.
	  <lb/>Yet they sell, at <placeName>Brazoria</placeName>, at the enormous price
<lb/>of seventy-five cents a bushel. Corn is obtained 
<lb/>in the prairie cane-brakes, the first year, when
<lb/>there is no time to prepare the land, with the
<lb/>plough, by merely making a hole for the seed,
<lb/>with a hoe. Cows and horses get their own living.
	  <lb/>The trees at this moment, (<date when="1831-12-17">17th <name>December</name></date>,) are
<lb/>loaded with rich clusters of grapes; not very
<lb/>large, but of a delicious flavour.</p>
        <p>Amidst this profusion of the good things of
<lb/>life, can it be difficult, with proper arrangement,
	  <lb/>to live, and to live well, in <placeName>Texas</placeName>? Unfortunately,
<lb/>cooks do not grow on trees. The epicure, there­
<lb/>fore, who brings with him his morbid appetites,
<lb/>must also bring his cook.</p>

        <p rend="first-indent(0)"><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> extensive flat country, which stretches from
	  <lb/>the coast of <placeName>Texas</placeName> many hundred miles, to the
<lb/>interior mountains, produces periodical winds,
	  <lb/>like the monsoons of <placeName>India</placeName>.  From <name>March</name> to <name>No­
<lb/>vember</name>, but little rain falls, and the power of the
<lb/>sun upon the flat surface of the land is such, as
<lb/>to exhale that little, promptly. The face of the
<lb/>flat region is, therefore, dry in summer, and the
<lb/>continual action of the sun upon a surface so ex­
<lb/>tensive, flat, and dry, causes a constant indraught
<lb/>of air from the sea. A strong south-east wind is

<pb n="120"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="10(6)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">120</mw>
<lb/>thus produced, which blows, almost without in­
<lb/>termission, except at the full and change of the
<lb/>moon. There are occasional interruptions, by the
<lb/>calms of midsummer, and by northers of slight
<lb/>force, and of short duration, in the spring and
<lb/>fall.</p>
        <p>In <name>November</name>, the strong northers set in. The
<lb/>rains, which usually fall in this month, cool the
<lb/>land. The mountains of the interior, now covered
<lb/>with snow, serve as generators of cold air; while
<lb/>the continued action of the sun upon the waters
<lb/>of the gulf, rarefies the air in that direction, and
<lb/>consequently a strong current is produced, of the
<lb/>cold and heavier atmosphere of the north. Hence,
<lb/>in the months of <name>December</name> and <name>January</name>, the cold
<lb/>northern winds sweep down the plains, with nearly
<lb/>as much regularity, as the south-east wind in sum­
<lb/>mer; being, occasionally, interrupted by that wind,
<lb/>chiefly on the full and change of the moon. In
<lb/>these months, the southerly winds are of short
<lb/>duration, and soon produce rain, an infallible in­
<lb/>dication of an immediate norther. These north­
<lb/>ers, or northerly winds, blow sometimes from the
<lb/>north-west, and sometimes from the north<choice><sic> </sic><corr>-</corr></choice>east.
<lb/>The north-west is most prevalent in midwinter:
<lb/>the north-east, early and late in the season. They

<pb n="121"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="11(1)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">121</mw>
<lb/>come on very suddenly; often without warning,
<lb/>always blow strong, and at times, very violently.</p>
        <p>The effect of these winds upon the tide-water
<lb/>of the bays along the coast, is very perceptible.
<lb/>In <placeName>Galveston bay</placeName> a strong norther, reduces the
<lb/>depth of water three or four feet, and keeps out
<lb/>the tide until it moderates. A south-east gale has
<lb/>a reverse effect. On <placeName>Red Fish bar</placeName>, which crosses
<lb/>that bay, during a strong norther, there are, at
<lb/>times, but three and a half feet of water at high
<lb/>tide, but with a strong south-east wind, there are
<lb/>usually six feet, and sometimes seven. This ob­
<lb/>servation will apply to all the bays of the coast.</p>
        <p>These periodical winds, doubtless tend, greatly,
<lb/>to purify the atmosphere, and contribute much to
	  <lb/>give to the climate of <placeName>Texas</placeName> a blandness, which
<lb/>I do not recollect to have experienced any where
<lb/>else, and a salubrity, which we look for, in vain,
<lb/>in the low country of the southern <placeName>United States</placeName>.
<lb/>The climate may be described to be, in general
<lb/>terms, a perpetual summer. But it must not be
	  <lb/>supposed, that there are no cold days in <placeName>Texas</placeName>,
<lb/>nor exceptions here, as elsewhere, to the general
<lb/>course of things. The last winter, (<date when="1830">1830</date>.) was
	  <lb/>so severe in <placeName>Louisiana</placeName>, as well as in <placeName>Texas</placeName>, that
<lb/>all the young orange trees were killed, and the

<lb/>old ones injured. Even much of the cane was
<lb/>destroyed. But this is a very rare occurrence.
<lb/>In <date when="1831">1831</date>, of which I have personal experience,
<lb/>the northers, as they are technically called, were
	  <lb/>frequent from the middle of <name>November</name> until
	  <lb/><date when="--12-25"><name>Christmas</name></date>. They seldom lasted long, not more
<lb/>than a day or two, and were invariably succeeded
<lb/>by warm rains, or bright sunshine. The greatest
<lb/>cold produced but white frost, considered at the
<lb/>north, as the harbinger of mild weather, except
<lb/>once, when there was hail and sleet, and the
<lb/>ground had a slight covering of snow, the only
<lb/>instance except one, <persName>Col. Austin</persName> informed me,
<lb/>since his residence in the country. The foliage
<lb/>did not leave the trees, nor even the rose bushes,
<lb/>and the grass was verdant. Yet with summer
<lb/>feelings and summer dresses, and apartments not
<lb/>very tight, these winds were sufficiently uncom­
<lb/>fortable. I regret not having a better thermome­
<lb/>ter than my own feelings, to give you the precise
<lb/>degree of cold. These cold days, however,
<lb/>while they last, make so small a proportion of 
<lb/>the year, as to be hardly remembered when they
<lb/>are past.</p>
        <p>Emigrants arriving during the time of which
<lb/>I speak, would of course, be disappointed in their

<milestone unit="sig" n="11(2)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">123</mw>
<lb/>visions of the climate. It is not at all surprising,
	  <lb/>that some, who have arrived in <placeName>Texas</placeName> at this un­
<lb/>propitious moment, have become disheartened,
<lb/>and sighed for home, or what is much less excu­
<lb/>sable, have given vent to their morbid feelings,
<lb/>by detraction, and slanderous misrepresntations
	  <lb/>of the country. An old settler from <placeName>Maine</placeName> told
<lb/>me, he had known winters here so mild, as not to
<lb/>kill the Lima bean. The best month to arrive in,
	  <lb/>is <name>October</name>. The first impression at that time is
<lb/>delightful, as well as just, and there is less incon­
<lb/>venience and trouble at that time, than at any
<lb/>other season. It is also the most favourable season
<lb/>on account of health. The change to the hot
<lb/>months of the succeeding year, is then gradual. 
<lb/>Those persons who come from the northern states
	  <lb/>or from <placeName>Europe</placeName>, in the spring and summer, expe­
<lb/>rience too sudden a change, and are always more 
<lb/>or less, affected by it.</p>
        <p>House-keepers should bring with them all in­
<lb/>dispensable articles for household use, together
<lb/>with as much common clothing (other clothing is
<lb/>not wanted) for themselves and their children, as
<lb/>they, conveniently, can. Ladies in particular,
<lb/>should remember, that in a new country, they
<lb/>cannot get things made at any moment, as in an

<pb n="124"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="11(2)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">124</mw>
<lb/>old one and that <unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">th</unclear>ey will be sufficiently busy,
<lb/>the first two yea<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">rs in</unclear> arranging such things as
<lb/>they have, without occupying themselves in ob­
<lb/>taining more. It should also be done as a mat­
<lb/>ter of economy. Where the population increas­
<lb/>es, beyond the increase of supplies, articles of
<lb/>necessity, as well as of luxury, are dear. If, on
<lb/>arrival, they find a surplus on hand, it can be read­
<lb/>ily disposed of to advantage; for trade, by barter,
<lb/>is much practiced, and you buy provisions, with
<lb/>coffee, calico, tea-kettles, and saucepans, instead
<lb/>of cash.</p>
        <p>Those who <emph>must</emph> have a feather-bed, had bet­
<lb/>ter bring it, for it would take too long to make
<lb/>one; and though the air swarms with live geese,
<lb/>a feather-bed could not be got for love or money.
<lb/>Every body should bring pillows and bed linen.
<lb/>Mattresses, such as are used, universally, in <placeName>Lou­
<lb/>isiana</placeName>, and they are very comfortable, are made
<lb/>of the moss, which hangs on almost every tree.
<lb/>They cost nothing but the case and the trouble of
<lb/>preparing the moss. The case should be brought.
<lb/>Domestic checks are best, being cheap and light,
<lb/>and sufficiently strong. The moss is prepared,
<lb/>by burying it in the earth, until it is partially rot­
<lb/>ted. It is then washed very clean, dried and

<pb n="125"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="11(3)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">125</mw>
<lb/>picked; when it is fit for use. These mattresses
<lb/>should be made very thick: and those who like
<lb/>a warmer bed in winter, can put some layers of
<lb/>wool, well carded, upon the moss, taking care to
<lb/><emph>keep this side up</emph>.</p>
        <p>Every emigrant should bring musqueto bars.
	  <lb/>Since the middle of <name>October</name>, I have not found
<lb/>them necessary. They are indispensable in the
<lb/>summer season, and are made of a thin species of
<lb/>muslin, manufactured for the purpose. Furniture,
<lb/>such as chairs and bureaus, can be brought in se­
<lb/>parate pieces and put together, cheaper and bet­
<lb/>ter, after arrival, than they can be purchased here,
<lb/>if purchased at all. But it must be recollected,
<lb/>that very few articles of this sort, are required,
<lb/>where houses are small, and building expensive.
<lb/>Think of the Vicar of <placeName>Wakefield's</placeName> picture. Ta­
<lb/>bles are made by the house carpenter, which an­
<lb/>swer the purpose very well, where nobody has
<lb/>better, and the chief concern is, to get something
<lb/>to put upon them. The maxim here, is, nothing
<lb/>for show, but all for use. A few well selected
<lb/>standard books, must not be forgotten.</p>
        <p>Hitherto, no duties have been required by the
<lb/>government, upon any articles, brought from any
<lb/>country by emigrants. The time of limitation,
<mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(2)">11*</mw>

<pb n="126"/>

<mw type="pageNum">126</mw>
<lb/>however, has now expired, and custom-houses
<lb/>have lately been established. The rate of duty
<lb/>can be ascertained, by applying to a Mexican con­
<lb/>sul, from whom it is necessary to obtain passports.
<lb/>No foreigner is admitted into the country, with­
<lb/>out a passport. Careful attention must be given
<lb/>to these particulars, to prevent detention, and an
<lb/>examination, by no means agreeable, on arrival.
<lb/>It should be stated in the passport, whether the
<lb/>person be really an emigrant or a trader, as the
<lb/>former is allowed some privileges over the latter.</p>
        <p>The rate of exchange, operates very favour­
<lb/>ably to emigrants. At the present moment, they
<lb/>may receive seven per cent, on all the money
	  <lb/>they bring. Money is scarce, in <placeName>Texas</placeName>; but all
<lb/>that money can purchase, and much that it can
<lb/>never buy, is plenty. The poor man of industry,
<lb/>should know, that he can get along without it; or
<lb/>at least, with very little. Those who are so for­
<lb/>tunate as to have it, loan it, at a very high inter­
<lb/>est, on real estate security. Fifteen and twenty
<lb/>per cent is the common rate of interest.</p>

        </opener>
        <p rend="first-indent(0)"><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">One</hi>s feelings in <placeName>Texas</placeName> are unique and original,
<lb/>and very like a dream or youthful vision realized.
	  <lb/>Here, as in <placeName>Eden</placeName>, man feels alone with the God
<lb/>of nature, and seems, in a peculiar manner, to en­
<lb/>joy the rich bounties of heaven, in common with
<lb/>all created things. The animals, which do not
<lb/>fly from him; the profound stillness; the genial
<lb/>sun and soft air,—all are impressive, and are cal­
<lb/>culated, both to delight the imagination, and to
<lb/>fill the heart, with religious emotions.</p>
        <p>With regard to the state of society here, as is
<lb/>natural to expect, there are many incongruities.
<lb/>It will take some time for people gathered from
<lb/>the north, and from the south, from the east, and
<lb/>from the west, to assimilate, and adapt themselves 
<lb/>to new situations. The people are universally
<lb/>kind and hospitable, which are redeeming quali­
<lb/>ties. Every body's house is open, and table
<lb/>spread, to accommodate the traveller. There are

<pb n="128"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="11(4)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">128</mw>
<lb/>no poor people here, and none rich; that is, none
<lb/>who have much money. The poor and the rich,
<lb/>to use the correlatives, where distinction, there is
<lb/>none, get the same quantity of land on arrival,
<lb/>and if they do not continue equal, it is for want
<lb/>of good management on the one part, or superior
<lb/>industry and sagacity on the other. All are hap­
<lb/>py, because busy; and none meddle with the af­
<lb/>fairs of their neighbours, because they have enough
<lb/>to do to take care of their own. They are bound
<lb/>together, by a common interest, by sameness of 
<lb/>purpose, and hopes. As far as I could learn, they
<lb/>have no envyings, no jealousies, no bickerings, 
<lb/>through politics or fanaticism. There is neither
<lb/>masonry, anti-masonry, nullification nor court in­
<lb/>trigues.</p>
        <p>The common concerns of life are sufficiently
<lb/>exciting to keep the spirits buoyant, and prevent
<lb/>every thing like ennui. Artificial wants are en­
<lb/>tirely forgotten, in the view of real ones, and self,
<lb/>eternal self, does not alone, fill up the round of
<lb/>life. Delicate ladies find they can be useful, and
<lb/>need not be vain. Even privations become plea­
<lb/>sures: people grow ingenious in overcoming dif­
<lb/>ficulties. Many latent faculties are developed.
<lb/>They discover in themselves, powers, they did

<pb n="129"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="11(5)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">129</mw>
<lb/>not suspect themselves of possessing. Equally
<lb/>surprised and delighted at the discovery, they
<lb/>apply to their labours with all that energy and
<lb/>spirit, which new hopes and conscious strength, in­
<lb/>spire.</p>
        <p>You wish to know my opinion, if it will do
	  <lb/>for all sorts of people to emigrate to <placeName>Texas</placeName>, and
<lb/>if I would advise <persName>J――</persName> and <persName>S――</persName> to sell out
<lb/>and remove. On this point, I should say, indus­
<lb/>trious farmers will certainly do well, and cannot
<lb/>fail of success; that is to say, if abundant crops, 
<lb/>and a ready market with high prices, will satisfy 
<lb/>them. Substantial planters, with capital and
<lb/>hands, may enlarge their operations here to any
<lb/>extent, and with enormous profits. One gentle­
<lb/>man, for instance, whom I visited, has ninety-
<lb/>three acres under cultivation, by seven hands.
<lb/>His crop, this year, consists of eighty bales of 
<lb/>cotton, two thousand bushels of corn; five hun­
<lb/>dred bushels of sweet potatoes, besides other ar­
<lb/>ticles of minor importance.</p>
        <p>Those persons, however, who are established
<lb/>in comfort and competency, with an ordinary por­
<lb/>tion of domestic happiness; who have never been
<lb/>far from home, and are excessively attached to 
<lb/>personal ease; who shrink from hardship and

<pb n="130"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="11(5)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">130</mw>
<lb/>danger, and those who, being accustomed to a
<lb/>regular routine of prescribed employment in a
<lb/>city, know not how to act on emergencies, or
<lb/>adapt themselves to all sorts of circumstances,
<lb/>had better stay where they are. There is no bet­
<lb/>ter advice, than, <quote>to let well enough alone.</quote> All
<lb/>changes may be for the worse as well as better,
<lb/>and what we are used to, though not so good as
<lb/>might be, may suit us best. New shoes, though
<lb/>handsomer and better than old ones, may pinch
<lb/>and fret the wearer. Happiness is relative. A
<lb/>high standard for one person, is a low one for
<lb/>another, and what one prizes, another may think
<lb/>worthless. So that even conceding all the advan­
	  <lb/>tages I have claimed for <placeName>Texas</placeName>, it does not follow
<lb/>that the happiness of all would be promoted, by 
<lb/>emigrating to this country. It depends much
<lb/>upon the spirit of the man.</p>
        <p>He whose hopes of rising to independence in
<lb/>life, by honourable exertion, have been blasted by
<lb/>disappointment; whose ambition has been thwarted
<lb/>by untoward circumstances; whose spirit, though
<lb/>depressed, is not discouraged; who longs only for
<lb/>some ample field on which to lay out his strength; 
<lb/>who does not hanker after society, nor sigh for
<lb/>the vanished illusions of life; who has a fund of

<pb n="131"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="11(6)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">131</mw>
<lb/>resources within himself, and a heart to trust in
<lb/>God and his own exertions; who is not peculiarly
<lb/>sensitive to petty inconveniences, but can bear
<lb/>privations and make sacrifices, of personal com­
<lb/>fort—such a person will do well to settle accounts
	  <lb/>at home, and begin life anew in <placeName>Texas</placeName>. He will
<lb/>find, here, abundant exercise for all his faculties,
<lb/>both of body and mind, a new stimulus to his
<lb/>exertions, and a new current for his affections.
<lb/>He may be obliged to labour hard, but riches are
<lb/>a very certain reward of his exertions. He may
<lb/>be generous, without fear of ruin. He will learn
<lb/>to find society in nature, and repose in solitude,
<lb/>health in exertion, and happiness in occupation.
<lb/>If he have a just ambition, he will glow with gen­
<lb/>erous pride, while he is marking out an untrodden
<lb/>path, acting in an unhackneyed sphere, and found­
<lb/>ing for himself, and his children after him, a per­
<lb/>manent and noble independence.</p>

	    <lb/>respects, exclusive reference to <placeName>Austin's Colony</placeName>, though, with few ex­
<lb/>ceptions, they are equally applicable to the whole country. It is to be
<lb/>hoped, that the omission, either in these answers or in the preceding
	    <lb/>letters, of more extended notices of other colonies in <placeName>Texas</placeName>, will not
<lb/>be regarded as any disparagement of those colonies. The author's
	    <lb/>visit was to <placeName>Austin's Colony</placeName> alone, where opportunities of inquiry
<lb/>respecting the local concerns of the other colonies, did not occur.
<lb/>Whatever notices of these colonies she might have been disposed to 
<lb/>insert in this volume, must necessarily, have been compiled from the
<lb/>printed documents of the companies engaged in colonization, already
<lb/>before the public. To these documents, she must refer the reader for 
<lb/>any local information that may be desired. It may be stated here, that
<lb/>efforts were made by the editor, to procure, from the persons concerned,
<lb/>a general statement of the condition of all the colonies and grants, that
	    <lb/>have been authorized by law, in <placeName>Texas</placeName>, that the public might have the
<lb/>whole subject presented in one view. The work was, actually delayed
<lb/>more than a month, waiting for a statement of this sort, which was
<lb/>promised by a gentleman every way qualified to prepare it. A pressure
<lb/>of important buisiness, alone, prevented him from accomplishing his
<lb/>intention.</p>

	  <lb/>The colonization law of the State of <placeName>Coahuila</placeName> and <placeName>Texas</placeName>,
<lb/>grants one league of land to families, and a quarter of a 
<lb/>league to single men. A Mexican league, is 5000 Mexican
<lb/>varas square; equal to 4428 acres English measure. The
<lb/>vara is 8 per cent. less than the English yard. The quantity
<lb/>of land distributed in <placeName>Austin's Colony</placeName>, with legal titles, is
<lb/>about 1400 leagues.</p>
              <p>In the colony contracted by <persName>De Witt</persName>, on the <placeName>Guadalupe
<lb/>river</placeName>, upwards of two hundred leagues have been granted
<lb/>to American emigrants, settled by him, and about an equal
	  <lb/>number of leagues, to native <name>Mexicans</name>. The Irish colonies

<lb/>have been distributed under these contracts. The country
<lb/>on the <placeName>San Antonio river</placeName>, with that on the lower portion of

	  <lb/>reside in <placeName>Bexar</placeName> and <placeName>Golind</placeName>. The extensive country lying
	  <lb/>east of <placeName>Austin's Colony</placeName> as far as the <placeName>Sabine river</placeName>, is holden
<lb/>under contracts of colonization, by several respectable com­
<lb/>panies and individuals, who are successfully engaged in ap­
<lb/>propriating their lands, but the number of leagues distribu­
<lb/>ted by them, cannot be stated.</p>
              <p><label rend="slant(italic)indent(0)">Titles</label>—<persName>Col. Austin</persName>, has 
entered into five contracts, of
<lb/>different dates, with the Mexican government, to colonize
<lb/>a number of families, not exceeding two thousand. Of
<lb/>these obligations, two have been already completed. One
<lb/>will expire in <date when="1833">1833</date>, and another in <date when="1834">1834</date>. The last of the
      <lb/>above-mentioned contracts, was made in <date when="1831-02"><name>February</name>, 1831</date>, 
<lb/>and, like all the others, will be in force for six years from
<lb/>the date of it.</p>
              <p>The emigrant, after being duly admitted by <persName>Austin</persName> as
<lb/>a colonist, under his contract, receives a title from the
<lb/>commissioner of the government, for the quantity of land
<lb/>assigned him, by law. This commissioner is appointed by
<lb/>the governor of the state, and the title issues in the name
<lb/>of the state, on stamp paper, which costs from two to three
<lb/>dollars. The whole cost of a league of land, to the settler,
<lb/>will, generally, be about four cents an acre. For a part of
<lb/>the sum a credit is given, of four, five and six years. All
	    <lb/>land titles in <placeName>Texas</placeName> are granted in this manner, whether to
	    <lb/>foreigners or <name>Mexicans</name>, and are all subject to the condition

<mw type="pageNum">135</mw>
<lb/>of being forfeited to the state, if the grantee fails to make
<lb/>actual settlement, and to cultivate his land, within six years,
<lb/>from the date of his deed, or neglected to pay the sums of
<lb/>money required by law. All right and title to the land are
<lb/>also forfeited, if the grantee abandon the country, or sell
	    <lb/>his land, before having cultivated it. <name>Mexicans</name>, however,
<lb/>who obtain lands from the government by purchase, and not
<lb/>as mere settlers, have the privilege of selling it, before
<lb/>the actual settlement or cultivation, but the second purchaser, 
<lb/>is bound to do both, within six years from the date of the
<lb/>original title, or forfeit the land.</p>
              <p>The settlements in <placeName>Austin's Colony</placeName>, extend quite
down
<lb/>to the gulf shore, and to the margins of <placeName>Galveston</placeName> and

<lb/>cessfully cultivated. The cotton produced here, is of very
<lb/>superior quality, and yields from 2500 to 3000 pounds of
<lb/>seed-cotton, to the acre. Seventy-five bushels of Indian
<lb/>corn to the acre, have been, frequently gathered: but it is

              </p>
              <p>The natural productions of <placeName>Texas</placeName> are, in general, the
<lb/>same with those of <placeName>Louisiana</placeName> and <placeName>Florida</placeName>. The indigenous
<lb/>indigo of <placeName>Texas</placeName> is considered, by those who have tried it,
<lb/>to be greatly superior to the plant which is cultivated in
<lb/>the <placeName>United States</placeName>. It is manufactured in families, for do­
<lb/>mestic use, and is preferred to the imported indigo.</p>
              <p>The productions which may be considered as naturally 
	    <lb/>adapted to the soil of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, and which may be made pro­
<lb/>fitable by cultivation, are short and long staple cotton,
<lb/>sugar, indigo, tobacco, olives, grapes, rice, wheat, Indian
<lb/>corn, rye, oats, barley, flax, hemp, sweet and Irish potatoes.
<lb/>The extensive natural pastures found in the prairies, furnish
<lb/>peculiar facilities for rearing horses, black cattle, hogs,
<lb/>sheep and goats. Butter and cheese may be made in very
<lb/>great quantities, and of superior quality. The honey-bee
	    <lb/>seems to have found a favourite haunt in <placeName>Texas</placeName>. These in­
<lb/>dustrious insects swarm in great abundance in every district,
<lb/>and bees-wax and honey may be produced in any quantity,

<pb n="136"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="12(2)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">136</mw>
<lb/>and without the least expense. White or bleached bees-wax,
<lb/>generally sells for one dollar a pound, in the cities of <placeName>Mex­
		<lb/>ico</placeName>.  <placeName>Texas</placeName> is, without doubt, equal, and perhaps superior
	      <lb/>to <placeName>Cuba</placeName>, for bees, and will rival that island, in the expor­
<lb/>tation of honey and wax.</p>
              <p>Dried fruits and distilled spirits, may be estimated as

              <p>Emigrants should provide themselves with the principal
<lb/>iron agricultural implements and tools, in common use in

	    <lb/>scythes, harrow teeth, chains, &amp;c. &amp;c. In <placeName>Texas</placeName>, as in

	    <lb/><name>Mexicans</name>, here, and in all parts of <name>Mexico</name>, is, what may 
<lb/>very properly be called, the <mcr>primitive</mcr> plough. It is formed
<lb/>of one stick of timber only. A tree is sought for with a
<lb/>long straight body. One end of this is made to answer the
<lb/>purpose of a tongue. Near the other end a fork projects,

<pb n="139"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="12(4)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum">139</mw>
<lb/>at an angle of 45 degrees, about one foot long, having a
<lb/>strap of iron fixed to the end. This is the part which
<lb/>breaks the ground. On the upper side and just at the ex­
<lb/>tremity of the main stick is the handle, by which, when in
<lb/>operation, the plough is kept erect, and guided by the
<lb/>ploughman. This simple plough is similar to that which is
<lb/>called a coulter plough. It serves to loosen the earth to a
<lb/>considerable depth, without turning it over, and is preferred
	    <lb/>by the <name>Mexicans</name> for this reason. They say that experience,
<lb/>in the <placeName>Island of Cuba</placeName> and in other hot climates, has proved,
<lb/>that the use of such ploughs as turn over the soil at every
<lb/>furrow, impoverishes the land and wears it out in a few
<lb/>years, by exposing it, too much, to the action of a burn­
<lb/>ing sun. Many farmers use the coulter and bull-tongue
<lb/>ploughs.</p>
              <p>A box of tools, containing, saws, augers, chisels, a
<lb/>broad axe, planes, a drawing knife, square and compasses,
<lb/>&amp;c. is indispensable, as these tools are needed to make the

<lb/>procure; for though seeds and fruits, of various kinds, are
	    <lb/>to be found in <placeName>Texas</placeName>, they are not always to be obtained

<lb/>the effect of climate. Little attention has<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">,</unclear> hitherto, been
<lb/>paid to the cultivation of fruit, and the country is imper­
<lb/>fectly supplied with the choicer varieties. The climate and
<lb/>soil are well adapted, to all the varieties of the peach, nec­
<lb/>tarine, apricot, plum, pear, and grape. In the interior, the
<lb/>apple, cherry, and similar fruits, and near the coast, all
<lb/>the more hardy tropical fruits succeed very well, while, 
<lb/>with a little care, the more delicate ones, may be brought 
<lb/>to perfection.</p>
              <p>Seeds of small grain and grass, are scarce, such as
<lb/>wheat, rye, barley, buckwheat, &amp;c. timothy, clover, and
<lb/>other grasses. Thorns suitable for permanent hedges, are
<lb/>very desirable.</p>
              <p>Of domestic animals, emigrants from <placeName>England</placeName> who can
<lb/>afford it, should bring the best breed of English cattle, and the
		<lb/><mcr>grass hog</mcr>. The prairies afford vast natural pastures for
<lb/>these animals. Also a few blooded horses, to intermix with
<lb/>the light and active Andalusian breed of Mexican horses.
<lb/>Merino and other fine wool sheep are needed, to improve
<lb/>the native stock. The expense of raising sheep and goats,
<lb/>is so very trifling here, that it does not enter into the list
<lb/>of farm expenditures. Sheep require no feeding, either
<lb/>in summer or winter, the natural pasture being always

<lb/>was not the least insurrectionary spirit manifested by them, or any wish
<lb/>to oppose the laws of the country. They hailed, with joy, the success
<lb/>of <persName>Gen. Santa Anna's</persName> party, as the pledge of a more just and liberal

<lb/>and may health and happiness always attend thee.</p>
            </said>
            <p>To this address the Colonel made the following reply:</p>
            <said rend="bestow((pre(“))(p))post(”)">
              <p>Fellow-citizens, and Soldiers of the <orgName>Santa Anna Vol­
<lb/>unteer Company</orgName>,—I have not words duly to express my
<lb/>grateful feelings and unfeigned thanks for the kind welcome
<lb/>with which you have honoured my return to this colony.
<lb/>In all my acts, as far as they have been connected with the
		<lb/>advancement of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, I have been governed by the most
<lb/>sincere desire to promote its prosperity and the permanent
<lb/>happiness of its citizens. My leading motto has been and
<lb/>is, <quote rend="pre()post()slant(italic)">fidelity to the constitution of our adopted country.</quote> The same
<lb/>has been and is, the governing principle of the inhabitants
<lb/>of this colony. I thank my fellow-citizens for their appro­
<lb/>bation; it is the highest reward that can be offered to me
<lb/>for my humble services as their public agent.</p>
              <p>I accord with you in the opinion, that the present is
<lb/>an important epocha in the political march of our adopted
<lb/>and beloved country. With institutions founded on the
<lb/>broad basis of representative democracy, the general gov­
		<lb/>ernment of <placeName>Mexico</placeName> has, for the last two years, been admin­
<lb/>istered, in many particulars, on principles which more pro­
<lb/>perly belong to a military despotism than to a free republic.
<lb/>A great and glorious regeneration is taking place; the free
<lb/>democracy of the nation, <emph rend="slant(upright)case(smallcaps)">the people</emph>, have asserted their
<lb/>rights under the banner of that distinguished patriot and
<lb/>leader, <persName rend="case(smallcaps)">Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna</persName>.—The cause 
<lb/>of constitutional democratic liberty is about to triumph
<lb/>throughout the whole of this vast republic.</p>
              <p>Borne down, in this remote section of the nation, by
<lb/>military oppression, and by the most shameful violations of 
		<lb/>the rights of the state of <placeName>Coahuila</placeName> and <placeName>Texas</placeName>, you believed
<lb/>that all the guarantees of the constitution and laws were

<pb n="144"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="12(6)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">144</mw>
<lb/>disregarded and trampled upon. Patience itself was ex­
<lb/>hausted, and you had recourse to arms, thus espousing that
<lb/>cause of the constitution and of the people which is so
<lb/>bravely advocated by <persName>Gen. Santa Anna</persName>. In doing this you
<lb/>have not, for one moment, lost sight of your duty as Mex­
<lb/>ican citizens, but have defended the true dignity of the
<lb/>national flag, which has been insulted by the violators of
<lb/>the constitution. In the course you have taken you will be
		<lb/>sustained by <persName>Col. Mexia</persName>, who has come to <placeName>Texas</placeName> with a
<lb/>fleet and forces, under the orders of <persName>Gen. Santa Anna</persName> to
<lb/>protect the rights of the nation and of the state; and you
<lb/>will receive the support and approbation of <persName>Gen. Santa
<lb/>Anna</persName> himself, of <persName>Gen. Mo<choice><sic>r</sic><corr>n</corr></choice>tezuma</persName>, and of all liberal and
		<lb/>enlightened <name>Mexicans</name>. In such a cause you have nothing
<lb/>to fear—<emph rend="slant(upright)case(smallcaps)">it is just</emph>, and I will give my hearty co-operation,
<lb/>so far as my feeble services can avail.</p>
            </said>
            <p>At the conclusion of this address, the Colonel was salu­
<lb/>ted, with 12 rounds of cannon and small arms; after which,
<lb/>attended by the civil authorities, at the head of the com­
<lb/>pany, he proceeded on the road to his quarters at the edge
<lb/>of the town, and was met by the regular troops, lately un­
<lb/>der the command of <persName>Lieut. Col. Ugartecha</persName>, in <name>fort Velasco</name>, at
	      <lb/>the mouth of the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>, and then commanded by <persName>Lieut. Moret</persName>,
<lb/>who after having given a salute of two rounds of small
<lb/>arms which was returned by the <orgName>Santa Anna Company</orgName>, fell
<lb/>into the line, and the whole marched to the Col's. quarters
		<lb/>where he addressed the regular troops in <name>Spanish</name>, as fol­
<lb/>lows:</p>
            <said>
              <p>I thank you, in the name of the inhabitants of this
<lb/>colony, for this manifestation of your friendly sentiments
<lb/>towards them. It is but a short time since you and they
<lb/>were in a hostile array against each other at <name>fort Velasco</name>:
<lb/>that was a political contest merely between different citizens under
<lb/>the same national flag, not a war between enemies. The
<lb/>contest, over, each party only remembered that they were
		<lb/>all <name>Mexicans</name>, and forgot that a difference of political opi­
<lb/>nions had for a short time made them belligerents. As
		<lb/><name>Mexicans</name> I now embrace you, for an evidence that <emph>we</emph>, the
<lb/>people of this colony, are such also, and that we duly ap­
<lb/>preciate the motives which have led you voluntarily to join
<lb/>in welcoming my return.</p>
            </said>
            <p><persName>Col. Austin</persName> then embraced the Mexican officers, amidst
<lb/>cheers of <quote rend="pre()post()slant(italic)" xml:lang="es">viva la federacion y la constitucion

<lb/>whole company then partook of refreshments and retired.</p>

            <mw type="pageNum">145</mw>
            <p>At 4 o'clock the citizens and the military again as­
<lb/>sembled, and partook of a plentiful dinner, provided for
<lb/>the occasion. Each State and Territory of the Mexican
<lb/>Republic was toasted separately by name, and a salute of
<lb/>cannon fired for each. After which, <persName>Col. Austin</persName> rose and
<lb/>said: <said>We have drank to the prosperity of each state and
<lb/>territory of the Mexican confederation, and I now beg to
<lb/>offer as a sentiment,—the shield and bond of union of them
		<lb/>all, <emph>the constitution</emph>, and <persName>Gen. Santa Anna</persName>, i<choice><sic/><corr>t</corr></choice>s 
defender.</said></p>
            <p><persName>Lieut. Moret</persName>, of the regular troops, then gave this senti­
<lb/>ment: <said>May the Supreme Being preserve the life of <persName>Col.
		  <lb/>Austin</persName> to the citizens of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, twenty years and longer,
<lb/>so that they may have the benefit of his exertions to sepa­
		<lb/>rate <placeName>Texas</placeName> from <placeName>Coahuila</placeName>, and form it into a State of the
<lb/>great Mexican Confederation, as the only means of securing
<lb/>its prosperity, and the true interests of the Mexican re­
<lb/>public.</said></p>
            <p>The <foreign xml:lang="es">Alcalde</foreign>, in the name of the <foreign xml:lang="es">Ayuntamiento</foreign>, gave
<lb/><said>Union, the Constitution, and <persName>Gen. Santa Anna</persName>, their 
<lb/>defender.</said></p>
            <p><persName>F. W. Johnson</persName> gave <said>The State of <placeName>Texas</placeName> and the State
		<lb/>of <placeName>Coahuila</placeName>: may their political separation be the bond of
<lb/>union between them.</said></p>
            <p>Besides the toasts thus particularized, many others were
<lb/>given, all expressing, in one way or other, the sentiments of
	      <lb/><quote rend="pre()post()slant(italic)">union with <placeName>Mexico</placeName>; support of the constitution; separation from
		<lb/><placeName>Coahuila</placeName>; and encouragement of emigration.</quote> The greatest
<lb/>harmony prevailed throughout the whole entertainment.</p>
            <p>On the <date when="1832-07-27">27th</date>, a general meeting of citizens, summoned
<lb/>by the <foreign xml:lang="es">Ayuntamiento</foreign> of the jurisdiction, was held at <placeName>San
<lb/>Felipe</placeName>; and the assembly unanimously adopted an exposition
	      <lb/>and resolution, which explained the causes and nature of 
<lb/>the late events at <placeName>Anahuac</placeName> and <placeName>Brazoria</placeName>, and formally de­
<lb/>clared their own adhesion to the <name>Santa Anna</name> party. This
<lb/>measure, adopted as it has been, with the co-operation and
<lb/>advice of <persName>Col. Austin</persName>, publicly given at the meeting, has
<lb/>united the people of the colony fully, many of whom were
<lb/>doubtful as to the course to be taken in the peculiarly criti­
<lb/>cal situation of public affairs, unexpectedly precipitated,
<lb/>as they had been, under the excitement caused by <persName>Col.
<lb/>Bradburn's</persName> illegal and arbitrary imprisonment of several of
	      <lb/>the citizens. <placeName>Austin's Colony</placeName> is therefore now identified
<lb/>with the <name>Santa Anna</name> party; and information received from
	      <lb/><placeName>Bexar</placeName>, <placeName>La Bahia</placeName> and <placeName>Nacogdoches</placeName>, justifies the opinion

	      <lb/>that all <placeName>Texas</placeName> will unite on the same side of the great po­
<lb/>litical question, which now agitates the Mexican nation.</p>
            <p>In order to prevent any misconstructions, it is proper 
	      <lb/>and necessary to state, that the people of <placeName>Austin's Colony</placeName>
	      <lb/>will most decidedly oppose any attempt to separate <placeName>Texas</placeName> 
<lb/>from the Mexican confederation, and that they will as de­
<lb/>cidedly insist, by all just and constitutional means, that the
	      <lb/>embarrassments in the way of emigration to <placeName>Texas</placeName>, be re­
<lb/>moved, so that it may, as speedily as possible, be formed
	      <lb/>into a state of the Mexican Union, separate from <placeName>Coahuila</placeName>,
	      <lb/>the <placeName>river <hi rend="slant(italic)">Neuces</hi></placeName> being the dividing line. There is no doubt

            <p>The causes of the late disturbances are plain to every
		<lb/>person who resides in <placeName>Texas</placeName>, or is informed of the events
<lb/>which have transpired here since the commencement of the
<lb/>year <date when="1830">1830</date>; but as those causes have never been laid before
<lb/>the Mexican people, it is necessary and proper that it should
<lb/>now be done, as a justification of the course taken by a
<lb/>large and respectable portion of the inhabitants, and also
<lb/>as explanatory of the reasons which have impelled the
<lb/><foreign xml:lang="es">Ayuntamiento</foreign> and the inhabitants of this colony unani­
<lb/>mously to adhere to the <name>plan of Vera Cruz</name>.</p>
            <p>From the time when a national and state law invited
<lb/>persons of all nations to come and settle in the wilderness
		<lb/>of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, <emph>duties</emph> and <emph>rights</emph> were established between those
<lb/>who govern and those who were to obey in virtue of them.
<lb/>Those laws and the general and state constitutions have 
<lb/>clearly designated the guarantees which secure the citizens
<lb/>from the caprice and the arbitrary will of the subaltern
<lb/>authorities. But unfortunately, since the present adminis­
<lb/>tration went into power, an uninterrupted series of depra­
<lb/>dations, calumnies, and injustice, has been the recompense
		<lb/>received by the citizens of <placeName>Texas</placeName> for their firm adhesion
<lb/>to the Mexican republic and to the federal system by which 
<lb/>it is governed. The civil authorities have been viewed by
<lb/>the military as mere subalterns, to be commanded as a cor­

<lb/>poral commands a soldier. This military power, under the
<lb/>authority of the superior chief, has disregarded all the rights
<lb/>which the constitution secures to free citizens, and has
<lb/>wished to subject every thing to its enslaving influence.
		<lb/>The government of the state of <placeName>Coahuila</placeName> and <placeName>Texas</placeName> has 
<lb/>not exercised in these colonies any more power than what
<lb/>the superior military chief has been pleased to grant as a 
<lb/>favour.</p>
            <p>To enumerate in detail all the violations of the consti­
<lb/>tution and laws, and attacks upon the rights of the state of
		<lb/><placeName>Coahuila</placeName> and <placeName>Texas</placeName>, which have been committed by the
<lb/>military authority, would occupy more time and space than
<lb/>the present occasion will admit; only a few of the leading
<lb/>ones will therefore be mentioned, which have had a direct 
<lb/>influence in producing the late disturbances.</p>

<lb/>prudence of the arrested person, and of the citizens who
<lb/>were to have received titles for lands, and who by this event
<lb/>were deprived for the time being from obtaining legal pos­

<lb/>upon him by the supreme government of the union, under
		  <lb/>the 3d article of the national law of <date when="1830-04-06">6th <name>April</name>, 1830</date>, the

<lb/>tion to the 11th article of said general law; and notwith­
<lb/>standing he has been assured that such is not the case, he
<lb/>still persisits in his opinion. For these reasons, this matter

<lb/>authority competent to remedy evils of such magnitude, but
<lb/>unfortunately the state government was then borne down
	      <lb/>by the same iron rod that was held over <placeName>Texas</placeName>. His ex­
<lb/>cellency, the governor, in his message before quoted, very

<lb/>alternative left to him, and this he was not authorized to
<lb/>adopt, without the previous sanction of the legislature. His
<lb/>exellency, therefore, did all he could without an open
<lb/>declaration of war against the military.</p>
            <p>In this state of things, the citizens, goaded to despera­
<lb/>tion by military despotism on the one hand, and seeing on
<lb/>the other, that the state government had in vain made every
<lb/>effort of a pacific nature to sustain itself, and protect them,
<lb/>considered that petitions made on paper, were useless, that
<lb/>they would in fact only have given new opportunities to the 
<lb/>military to ridicule and trample upon the state authorities,
<lb/>and to rivet their chains more firmly.</p>
            <p>The last and only remedy left to an oppressed people,
<lb/>was then resorted to, and without any previous combina­
<lb/>tions, or organized plans, a large number of citizens, moved
<lb/>by a common and simultaneous influence, took up arms, and
	      <lb/>marched to <placeName>Anahuac</placeName>, to release the prisoners whom <persName>Brad­

            <p>Notwithstanding the efforts of the administration of

<lb/>same causes which had disturbed the public tranquility here,
	      <lb/>had roused the spirit of the free and enlightened <name>Mexicans</name>
<lb/>in every part of this great confederation, and that on the

            <p>The citizens of <placeName>Brazoria</placeName> and of the precinct of <placeName>Victo­
<lb/>ria</placeName> in this colony also pronounced in favour of said plan.
<lb/>A deputation was sent to <persName>Lieut. Col. Ugartecha</persName> the com­
	      <lb/>mandant of <placeName>Velasco</placeName>, inviting him to adhere to said plan,
<lb/>which he refused. This left those who had pronounced no
	      <lb/>alternative but to attack him; they did so on the <date when="1832-06-27">27th <name>June</name></date>,
<lb/>under the command of the 2d <foreign xml:lang="es">Alcalde</foreign> of this jurisdiction,
<lb/><persName>John Austin</persName>, and after a bloody battle in which the most
<lb/>determined bravery was displayed on both sides, the fort sur­
<lb/>rendered to the <name>Santa Anna</name> forces, and not to a faction of
<lb/>rebels against the nation, as had been erroneously stated by 
		<lb/>the enemies of <placeName>Texas</placeName> and of its inhabitants.</p>
            <p>It is due to <persName>Lieut. Col. Ugartecha</persName> and but justice to say,
<lb/>that the only complaint against him was that he sent a
<lb/>re-inforcement of troops and arms to <persName>Col. Bradburn</persName> and
<lb/>that he refused to adhere to the <name>plan of Vera Cruz</name>. He
<lb/>acted under the orders of <persName>Col. Bradburn</persName>, and was bound
<lb/>by his duty as a subordinate officer, to obey him, and do
<lb/>as he did. No one has attached blame or censure to him,
	      <lb/>and the same men who attacked <placeName>fort Velasco</placeName>, embraced
<lb/>him most cordially the moment the conflict ended as a per­
<lb/>sonal friend, whom they esteemed and respected for his

<pb n="152"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="13(4)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">152</mw>
<lb/>moral worth and bravery. Every attention and respect
<lb/>which circumstances would permit was shown to him, his
<lb/>officers and troops; it was, in fact, a political conflict be­
<lb/>tween citizens acknowledging the same national flag.</p>
            <p>The <foreign xml:lang="es">Ayuntamiento</foreign> of the jurisdiction of <placeName>Austin</placeName>, were
<lb/>impressed with the importance of preserving the public
<lb/>tranquility, and felt the peculiarly delicate situation of the
<lb/>settlers of these colonies, owing to their being of foreign
<lb/>birth. It was well known that every species of calumny
	      <lb/>had been heaped upon the by the enemies of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, and
<lb/>of a republican and enlightened emigration, with the de­
	      <lb/>sign of reviving amongst the <name>Mexicans</name> the old Spanish
<lb/>prejudices, against persons born in another country. It
<lb/>was feared that those enemies would take advantage of
<lb/>any disturbances here, to pervert the truth and attribute
<lb/>to them hostile views against the Mexican territory and
<lb/>federal constitution. This body was under the immediate
<lb/>eye and direction of the political chief of the department,
<lb/>who was then in this town and equally anxious to preserve
<lb/>the public tranquility; and who we are assured is as much
<lb/>opposed to military encroachments as any other man in the
<lb/>community. It will also be remembered that the <foreign xml:lang="es">Ayunta­
<lb/>miento</foreign> had no means of acquiring information as to the 
<lb/>true state of things in the interior of this republic, the only
<lb/>newspaper that was permitted to reach here through the
<lb/>post office department, was the ministerial <title rend="pre(“)post(”)">Registro Offi­
<lb/>cial</title>—under these circumstances, this body used every effort
<lb/>to preserve good order and keep the settlers from partici­
<lb/>pating in the present civil war, and it is probable that
<lb/>these efforts would have been successful, had not events
<lb/>been precipitated in the manner they have been by the
<lb/>tyrannical and illegal acts of <persName>Col. Bradburn</persName>. But now as
<lb/>public opinion has expressed itself in the most decided and
<lb/>unequivocal manner, in favour of the <name>plan of Vera Cruz</name>,
<lb/>the same reasons which prevented the <foreign xml:lang="es">Ayuntamiento</foreign> from
<lb/>taking an early lead in this question, have impelled that
<lb/>body, to unite with the people in adhering to said plan;
<lb/>which reasons are the preservation of harmony and the ad­
<lb/>vancement of the general good which can alone be effected
<lb/>by the most perfect union. In consideration of all which
<lb/>and being convinced that the objects of the political party,
	      <lb/>who, on the <date when="1832-01-02">2d of <name>January</name> last</date>, proclaimed the plan of <placeName>Vera
<lb/>Cruz</placeName>, are to restore the government to the true constitu­

                        <p>The enemies of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, the enemies of the enterprising
<lb/>men who have devoted their time and labours to improve a 
<lb/>country that was never before trod by civilized men, have 
<lb/>taken pains and are continually doing it, to attribute to us
<lb/>a disposition to separate from the Mexican confederation.
<lb/>We have not entertained and have not any such intention or 
		<lb/>desire. We are <name>Mexicans</name> by adoption, we are the same in 
<lb/>hearts and will so remain. If the laws have granted to us
<lb/>the honourable title of citizens, we wish that title should
<lb/>be respected, and that the authorities established by the
<lb/>constitution of the state, shall govern us. We are farmers
<lb/>and not soldiers, and therefore desire, that the military
<lb/>commandants shall not interfere with us at all. Since <date when="1830">1830</date>,
<lb/>we have been pretty much governed militarily, and in so
<lb/>despotic a manner, that we were finally driven to arms, to
<lb/>restrain within their limits, the military subalterns of the
<lb/>general government. We have not insulted the flag of our
<lb/>adopted country, as has been falsely stated by our enemies, 
<lb/>but on the contrary, we have defended and sustained its
<lb/>true dignity, and attacked those who have outraged it, by

		<lb/>stitution and sovereignty of the state of <placeName>Coahuila</placeName> and <placeName>Texas</placeName>,
<lb/>and as a cover for their baseness and personal crimes. The

<lb/>many despotic and arbitrary acts. He refused to respect

		<lb/>and <placeName>Texas</placeName>, or to adhere to the <name>plan of Vera Cruz</name> which
<lb/>we had adopted. He was sustained by the commandant of

<lb/><persName>Lieut. Col. Ugartecha</persName>, and consequently we were compelled
<lb/>to oppose them all. <persName>Col. Ugartecha</persName> was invited by a com­
<lb/>mittee appointed for that purpose to espouse the <name>plan of 
<lb/>Vera Cruz</name>. He refused to do so, and we attacked <placeName>fort

	    <lb/>information that the colonists assembled before <placeName>Anahuac</placeName>
	    <lb/>had declared for the constitution and <persName>Gen. Santa Anna</persName>.
<lb/>We were rejoiced to see this declaration, for such had been 
<lb/>for a long time, our own feelings and wishes.</p>
                          <p>For a long time we had groaned under the arbitrary acts
	    <lb/>of <persName>Bustamente's</persName> administration. We had been convinced
<lb/>that that administration was disregardful of the constitution,
<lb/>that it was hostile to the most vital interests of the colo­
<lb/>nists, as was sufficiently evinced among other things, by
	    <lb/>their odious law of the <date when="1830-04-06">6th of <name>April</name></date>, and by the establish­
<lb/>ing of numerous garrisons amongst us in time of peace;
<lb/>which garrisons always trampled upon the civil authority,

<pb n="164"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="14(4)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum">164</mw>
<lb/>and upon the constitutional rights and privileges of our citi­
<lb/>zens. The people of this precinct, therefore, immediately
<lb/>met and concurred in the declaration for the constitution,
	    <lb/>and <name>Santa Anna</name>. When this was done, we felt ourselves
<lb/>in open opposition to all the officers, civil and miltary of 
<lb/>the government, against which he had declared.</p>
                          <p>To declare against a government and to permit its offi­
<lb/>cers to remain unmolested at our very doors, would be in­
<lb/>consistent and ridiculous; we therefore proceeded to dis­
	    <lb/>place the collector of the customs at <placeName>Brazoria</placeName>, and to re­
<lb/>duce the nearest garrison, which was that at the mouth of 
	    <lb/>the <placeName>Brazos</placeName>.</p>
                          <p>In all that we have done, we have cried out and fought
<lb/>for the constitution and <persName>Gen. Santa Anna</persName>, its defender.
<lb/>We have conceived, and do conceive the constitution to be
<lb/>a liberal, enlightened and republican instrument, and have,
<lb/>therefore, never raised a voice or an arm against it.</p>
                          <p>We have understood, however, that it has gone abroad,
<lb/>that we have been declaring and battling for independence.
<lb/>This is slanderous of us, and we wish you as our friend,
	    <lb/>so to represent it to <persName>Gen. Santa Anna</persName>, and at the same time, 
<lb/>to assure him, that an administration guided by the consti­
<lb/>tution, will find as warm and as loyal support among the
	    <lb/>colonists of <placeName>Texas</placeName>, as any other part of the Mexican re­
<lb/>public.</p>

<lb/>the <foreign xml:lang="es">Alcalde</foreign>, under date of the <date when="1832-07-16">16th inst.</date> and the printed
<lb/>document which accompanied it, has informed you of my
<lb/>sentiments, and what were the motives which caused my
	    <lb/>visit to <placeName>Texas</placeName>.</p>
                <p>The late occurrences produced by the causes which the
<lb/>committee and the president have just explained, were
<lb/>represented in a very different light from the true one. It
<lb/>was stated and repeated by the official reports made by the 
<lb/>commandants of three miltary posts to their supreme chief,
<lb/>that the object of the inhabitants of these colonies, was to
<lb/>separate from the Mexican confederation, and declare them­
	    <lb/>selves independent. As a <name>Mexican</name>, I could not look on
<lb/>with indifference when the territories of my nation was at­
<lb/>tacked, and forming an armistice with my adversary, I
<lb/>offered to aid the authorities of this province against those
<lb/>who had attacked it with such intentions. The printed do­
<lb/>cument before mentioned by me, explains this part of the
<lb/>subject.</p>
                <p>I sailed from <placeName>Matamoras</placeName> with the fleet and forces under
<lb/>my command, and in 40 hours anchored off the bar of this
<lb/>river where I informed myself of the nature of the late
<lb/>occurrences.</p>
                <p>These inhabitants have had their meetings with that re­
<lb/>publican frankness, which characterises them, they have 
<lb/>adopted the resolutions, which you have presented to me,
	    <lb/>adhering to the <name>plan of Vera Cruz</name>, sustained by <persName>Gen. Santa
<lb/>Anna</persName> as the chief. The cause which you have thus adopted
<lb/>is that of the people against oppression; that of the friends
<lb/>of federal institutions, against the military and oppressive
	    <lb/>government which the ministers of <persName>Gen. Bustamente</persName> wished
<lb/>to establish. These being the principles which influence
<lb/>this respectable community, I should be inconsistent with 
<lb/>my own, were I not to offer them my friendship, and the
<lb/>support of the chiefs under whose orders I am acting.</p>
                <p>Until affairs are settled in the interior which have been
<lb/>in commotion from the same causes that have produced the
<lb/>confusion here. I recommend peace, harmony and union,
<lb/>to effect which you will find me disposed to contribute my 
<lb/>support.</p>
