        <lb/>meet the waters of the sea, the town of <placeName>N――</placeName> is situated.
        <lb/>As you approach from the west, it exhibits a rural aspect,
        <lb/>of meadows intersected by streams, and houses over­
        <lb/>shadowed with trees. Viewed from the eastern acclivity,
        <lb/>it seems like a citadel guarded by parapets of rock, and
        <lb/>embosomed in an ampitheatre of hills, whose summits
        <lb/>mark the horizon with a waving line of dark forest green.
        <lb/>Entering at this avenue, you perceive that its habitations
        <lb/>bear few marks of splendour, but many of them, retiring

        <lb/>behind the shelter of lofty elms, exhibit the appearance
        <lb/>of comfort and respectability. Travelling southward about
        <lb/>two miles, through the principle road, the rural features
        <lb/>of the landscape are lost, in the throng of houses, and
        <lb/>bustle of men. The junction of two considerable streams
        <lb/>here forms a beautiful river, which, receiving the tides of
        <lb/>the sea, rushes with a short course into its bosom.</p>
        <p>Mast peer over ware-houses, and streets rise above
        <lb/>streets, with such irregularity that the base of one line
        <lb/>of buildings sometimes overlooks the roofs of another.
        <lb/>Here Man, incessantly combating the obstacles of Na­
        <lb/>ture, is content to hang his dwelling upon her rocks, if
        <lb/>he may but gather the treasures of her streams. Yet spots
        <lb/>of brightness, and of beauty occur amid these eagle-nests
        <lb/>upon the cliff; gardens of flowers; bold and romantic
        <lb/>shores; pure, broad, sparkling waters; white sails dancing
        <lb/>at the will of the breeze; boats gliding beneath bridges,
        <lb/>or between islands of verdure, with sportive and graceful
        <lb/>motion, like the slight gossamer in the sun-beam.</p>
        <p>Between these two sections of the town, which, though
        <lb/>sisters, bear no family resemblance, is a landscape, which
        <lb/>some writer of romance might be pleased to describe. It
        <lb/>is about a mile from the mouth of the smallest of the two
        <lb/>streams just mentioned, which, winding its way through
        <lb/>green meadows with a mild course, is fringed with the
        <lb/>willow, and many aquatic shrubs, bending their drooping
        <lb/>branches to kiss its noiseless tide. Suddenly it assumes
        <lb/>the form of a cataract. Dashing tumultuously from rock

        <pb n="003"/><milestone unit="sig" n="1(2)r"/>
        <mw type="pageNum">3</mw>

        <lb/>to rock; it sends forth from their excavations, deep, hollow
        <lb/>sounds; as if thunders were born in those unvisited cav­
        <lb/>erns. Tossing and foaming over the masses that obstruct
        <lb/>its channel, it becomes compressed within narrow limits
        <lb/>by two lofty precipices. One, rises frowning and per­
        <lb/>pendicular like the walls of a castle. A few hardy ever­
        <lb/>greens cling to its crown, and mark the spot whence the
        <lb/>hunted <name>Pequots</name> were forced, by their conquerors the
        <lb/><name>Mohegans</name>, to their fatal plunge from time into eternity.
        <lb/>Fancy, awakened by tradition, sometimes paints their
        <lb/>forms mingling with the dark, slow waters that circle the
        <lb/>base of that fearful cliff; or hears their spirits shrieking
        <lb/>amid the clamour of the cataract. The opposite rampart
        <lb/>presents a chain of rocks, of less towering height, inter­
        <lb/>spersed with lofty trees, displaying the names of many
        <lb/>who have visited and admired this wild and picturesque
        <lb/>scenery. The enthusiast of Nature, who should conquer
        <lb/>its precipitous descent, and stand upon the margin of the
        <lb/>flood which creeps in death-like stillness through this
        <lb/>guarded defile, might see on his right, the foam, the va­
        <lb/>pour, the tossing of a tempestuous conflict; on his left,
        <lb/>a broad chrystal mirror, studded with emerald islets,
        <lb/>and bounded by romantic shores, where peaceful man­
        <lb/>sions, embosomed in graceful shades, are seen through
        <lb/>vistas of green. Beneath, the black and almost motion­
        <lb/>less waters seem, to him who gazes intently, like the
        <lb/>river of forgetfulness, annihilating the traces of a passing
        <lb/>world. Above, the proud cliff rears its waving helmet,


        <pb n="004"/><milestone unit="sig" n="1(2)v"/>
        <mw type="pageNum">4</mw>

        <lb/>as if in defiance of the bowing cloud. To hear the voice
        <lb/>of Nature in passionate strife, and at the same moment to
        <lb/>gaze upon her slumbering calmness; to be lost in con­
        <lb/>templation upon the mortal contrast; then startled into
        <lb/>awe by her strong features of majesty; leave the mind
        <lb/>uncertain whether, in this secluded temple, beauty ought
        <lb/>most to charm, or awe to enchain it, or devotion to
        <lb/>absorb all other sensations in reverence to the invisible
        <lb/>God.</p>
        <p>Retracing our steps to the northern division of <placeName>N――</placeName>,
        <lb/>we find a society remarkable for the preservation of pri­
        <lb/>mitive habits. There, was exhibited the singular exam­
        <lb/>ple of an aristocracy, less intent upon family aggrandize­
        <lb/>ment, than upon becoming illustrious in virtue; and of a
        <lb/>community where industry and economy almost banished
        <lb/>want. Domestic subordination taught the young to hon­
        <lb/>our the old, while the temperance and regularity which
        <lb/>prevailed gave to age both contentment and health. The
        <lb/>forty years, which have elapsed since the period of this
        <lb/>sketch, have wrought many changes; but some features
        <lb/>of similarity remain. That luxury which enervates cha­
        <lb/>racter, and undermines the simple principles of justice,
        <lb/>and charity, has found its ravages circumscribed by the
        <lb/>example of those to whom wealth gave influence. An
        <lb/>unusual number of individuals, whose first steps were in
        <lb/>humble life, have risen to the possession of riches, not by
        <lb/>fortunate accidents, or profuse gains, by lotteries or by
        <lb/>war, but through an industry which impoverished none,

        <pb n="005"/><milestone unit="sig" n="1(3)r"/>
        <mw type="pageNum">5</mw>

        <lb/>and a prudence which as resolutely frowned upon waste
        <lb/>of time, as waste of money. It has been thought that the
        <lb/>advantages, arising from a favourable situation for com­
        <lb/>merce, and from a surrounding country eminently agricul­
        <lb/>tural, languished for want of vigorous enterprize. Yet a
        <lb/>source of wealth still less fluctuating has been discovered,
        <lb/>in lessening the number of factitious wants, and pruning
        <lb/>the excrescences of fashion and folly. A more moral
        <lb/>state of society can scarcely be imagined, than that which
        <lb/>existed within the bosom of these rocks. Almost it might
        <lb/>seem as if their rude summits, pointing in every direc­
        <lb/>tion, had been commissioned to repel the intrusion of
        <lb/>vice. In this department of the town was the mansion of
        <lb/><persName>Madam L――</persName>. It raised its broad, dignified front, with­
        <lb/>out other decorations than the white rose, and the sweet
        <lb/>brier, rearing their column of beauty and fragrance,
        <lb/>quite to the projection of the roof. In front, was a court
        <lb/>of shorn turf, like the richest velvet, intersected by two
        <lb/>paved avenues to the principal entrances, and enclosed
        <lb/>by a white fence, resting upon a foundation of hewn stone.
        <lb/>On each side of the antiquated gate waved the boughs
        <lb/>of a spruce, intermingling their foliage, and defying, in
        <lb/>their evergreen garb, the changes of climate. The habi­
        <lb/>tation, which faced the rising sun, had on its left, and in
        <lb/>the rear of its long range of offices, two large gardens for
        <lb/>vegetables and fruit. A third, which had a southern ex­
        <lb/>posure, and lay beneath the windows of the parlour, was
        <lb/>partially devoted to flowers. There, in quadrangles, tri­

        <lb/>angles, and parallelograms, beds of mould were thrown
        <lb/>up, and regularly arranged, according to what the florists
        <lb/>of that age denominated <mcr rend="pre(“)post(”)">a knot</mcr>. There, in the centre,
        <lb/>the flaunting peony reared its head like a queen upon her
        <lb/>throne, surrounded by a guard of tulips, arrayed as
        <lb/>courtiers in every hue, deep crimson, buff streaked with
        <lb/>vermillion, and pure white mantled with a blush of car­
        <lb/>mine. In the borders, the purple clusters of the lilac,
        <lb/>mingled with the feathery orb of the snow-ball, and the
        <lb/>pure petals of the graceful lily. Interspersed were vari­
        <lb/>ous species of the rose, overshadowing snow-drops, and
        <lb/>daffodils the earliest heralds of <name>Spring</name>—the violet, whose
        <lb/>purple eye seems half to beam with intelligence—the
        <lb/>hyacinth, the blue-bell, and the guinea-hen in its mot­
        <lb/>tled robe.</p>
        <p>There were also all the personified flowers—gaudy soldiers
        <lb/>in green—the tawdry ragged lady—the variegated batch­
        <lb/>elor—the sad mourning bride—and the monk in his som­
        <lb/>bre hood. The larkspur mingled with the sweet pea, and
        <lb/>the humble fumatory grew at the foot of the proud crown
        <lb/>imperial, which lifted its cluster of flowers, and crest of
        <lb/>leaves, with patrician haughtiness. A broad walk divided
        <lb/>this garden into neatly equal compartments. The west­
        <lb/>ern part, covered with rich turf, and interspersed with
        <lb/>fruit trees, displayed at its extremity a summer-house,
        <lb/>encircled by a luxuriant vine, and offering a delightful
        <lb/>retreat from a fervid sun. Seated beneath the canopy of
        <lb/>fragrant clusters, you might see the velvet-coated peach,

        <lb/>the rich plum with its purple, or emerald robe, and the
        <lb/>orange-coloured pear bruising itself in its fall. Raspber­
        <lb/>ries, supporting themselves by the fence, interwove their
        <lb/>branches with the bushes that lined it, as if ambitious
        <lb/>to form an impervious hedge; while at their feet, the red
        <lb/>and white strawberry offered its treasures. Near the same
        <lb/>region was a small nursery of medicinal plants; for the
        <lb/>mind which had grouped so many pleasures for the eye
        <lb/>and the taste of man, had not put out of sight his infirmi­
        <lb/>ties, or forgotten where it was written, <quote>in the garden
        <lb/>was a sepulchre.</quote> There, arose the rough leafed sage,
        <lb/>with its spiry efflorescence, the hoarhound foe of consump­
        <lb/>tion, the aprient cumphrey, the aromatic tansy, and the
        <lb/>bitter rue and wormwood. There, also, the healing balm
        <lb/>was permitted to flourish, and the pungent peppermint for
        <lb/>distillation. Large poppies, scattered here and there, per­
        <lb/>fected their latent anodyne, and hop-vines, clasping the
        <lb/>accustomed arches, disclosed from their aromatic clus­
        <lb/>ters some portion of their sedative powers. Through
        <lb/>these scenes of odiferous wildness <persName>Madam L――</persName> often
        <lb/>wandered, and like our very first mother, amused herself by
        <lb/>removing whatever marred its beauty, and cherishing all
        <lb/>that heightened its excellence.</p>
        <p>Her alert step, and animated aspect would scarcely
        <lb/>permit the beholder to believe that the weight of almost
        <lb/>seventy years oppressed her; though the spectacles, that
        <lb/>aided her in distinguishing weeds from plants, proved that
        <lb/>time had not spared to levy some tribute upon his favour­

        <lb/>ite. Her fair, open forehead, clear expressive blue eye,
        <lb/>and finely shaped countenance displayed that combination
        <lb/>of intellect with sensibility, which marked her character.
        <lb/>A tall and graceful person, whose symmetry age had res­
        <lb/>pected, gave dignity to a deportment which the sorrows
        <lb/>of life had softened. A vein of playful humour had been
        <lb/>natural to her youth, and might still occasionally be de­
        <lb/>tected in her quick smile, and kindling eye. Yet this
        <lb/>was divested of every semblance of asperity by the spirit
        <lb/>of a religion, breathing love to all mankind. Her voice
        <lb/>had that peculiar and exquisite tone, which seems an echo
        <lb/>of the soul's harmony. Her brow was circled with thin
        <lb/>folds of the purest cambrick, whose whiteness was con­
        <lb/>trasted with the broad, black ribband which compressed
        <lb/>them, and the kerchief of the same colour, pinned in quaint
        <lb/>and quaker-like neatness over her bosom. Her counte­
        <lb/>nance in its silence spoke the language of peace within,
        <lb/>good will to all around, and the sumblimated joy of one,
        <lb/>whose <quote>kingdom is not of this world.</quote> Her liberality
        <lb/>was proverbial. She loved the poor and the sick, as if
        <lb/>they were unfortunate members of her own family. To
        <lb/>afford them relief, was not a deed of ostentation, but a
        <lb/>source of heartfelt delight. She considered herself as
        <lb/>the obligated party, when an opportunity was presented of
        <lb/>distributing His bounty, who by entrusting her with riches
        <lb/>had constituted her as his almoner, and would at last re­
        <lb/>quire an account of her stewardship. Her piety was not
        <lb/>a strife about doctrines, though the articles of her belief

        <pb n="009"/><milestone unit="sig" n="1(5)r"/>
        <mw type="pageNum">9</mw>

        <lb/>were by no means indifferent to her. She thought the
        <lb/>spirit of controversy should be held in subjection to that,
        <lb/>which moveth to love and to good works.</p>
        <p>She disclaimed that bigotry which desires to extinguish
        <lb/>every light which its own hand has not kindled. She
        <lb/>looked upon the varying sects of <name>Christians</name>, as trav­
        <lb/>ellers pursuing different roads to the same eternal city.</p>
        <p>This liberality of sentiment was deserving of more
        <lb/>praise, forty years since than in our times, when supe­
        <lb/>rior illumination bears with stronger influence upon the
        <lb/>mists of prejudice. Educated in the metropolis of the
        <lb/>state, the daughter of its first magistrate, born of a family
        <lb/>of high respectability, introduced by marriage into the
        <lb/>aristocracy of <placeName>N――</placeName>, conscious that her excellencies were
        <lb/>so appreciated by those around her, that she was consid­
        <lb/>ered almost as being of an higher order, it would not
        <lb/>have been wonderful if some haughtiness had marked her
        <lb/>exterior, at a period when those distinctions signified more
        <lb/>than they do at present. But that self-complacency,
        <lb/>which is the most spontaneous growth of the unrenovated heart,
        <lb/>was early checked by a religion which taught her <quote>not
        <lb/>to glory save in the cross of Christ.</quote> Afflictions also
        <lb/>humbled the hopes which might have unwisely aspired,
        <lb/>or laboured to lay too deep a foundation on the earth. She
        <lb/>had borne the yoke in her youth. The early death of her
        <lb/>parents was strong discipline for a tender spirit. Her hus­
        <lb/>band was endued by nature with every excellence to awak­
        <lb/>en her attachment and confidence. His mind, enlarged

        <lb/>by the best education which this country afforded, had
        <lb/>pursued its scientific researches in <placeName>Europe</placeName>, and become
        <lb/>exalted both by extensive knowledge, and rational piety.
        <lb/>It was his pleasure to employ his wealth in the relief of
        <lb/>indigence, and the encouragement of enterprise. He was
        <lb/>early revered as the patron of merit in obscurity, and his
        <lb/>name is still enrolled by the grateful town which gave
        <lb/>him birth, as first in the list of its benefactors. United
        <lb/>in the warmth of his earliest affections to a kindred spirit,
        <lb/>they shared all the blessings of a perfect union of hearts.</p>
        <p>Many years of conjugal felicity had been their portion.
        <lb/>But she was at last appointed to watch the progress
        <lb/>of a protracted and fatal disease, and to mark with still
        <lb/>keener anguish the mental decay of him who had been her
        <lb/>instructor and counsellor. <said>I have seen an end of all
        <lb/>perfection,</said> she said, as his strong and brilliant pow­
        <lb/>ers yielded to the sway of sickness and when she bent in
        <lb/>agony over his grave, she put her trust in the widow's
        <lb/>God. The earlier part of their union had seen three
        <lb/>sons rising like olive-plants around their table. The eldest
        <lb/>exhibited at the age of seven a precocity of intellect, and
        <lb/>maturity of character, which at once astonished and de­
        <lb/>lighted the beholder. To store his memory with moral
        <lb/>and sublime passages, to sit a solitary student over his
        <lb/>book, to request explanations of subjects beyond his rea­
        <lb/>son, were his pleasures. The sports of his contemporaries
        <lb/>were emptiness to him, and while he forebore to censure,
        <lb/>he withdrew himself from them. Within his reflecting

        <pb n="011"/><milestone unit="sig" n="1(6)r"/>
        <mw type="pageNum">11</mw>

        <lb/>mind, was a desire to render himself acceptable to his
        <lb/>Maker. Though younger than the <rs type="properAdjective">Jewish</rs> king, who, at
        <lb/>the age of eight years, separated himself for the search
        <lb/>of wisdom, he began like him to <quote>seek the God of his
        <lb/>Fathers.</quote> When he requested from his parents their
        <lb/>nightly blessing to hallow his repose, the often inquired,
        <lb/>with an interesting solemnity, <said>Do you think that my
        <lb/>Father in Heaven will be pleased with me this day?</said>
        <lb/>To a soul thus embued with the principles of religion, it
        <lb/>was sufficient to point out that the path of duty was illu­
        <lb/>mined with the smile of the Almighty, and to deter from
        <lb/>the courses of evil, by the assurance of his displeasure.</p>
        <p>The second had a form of graceful symmetry, and a
        <lb/>complexion of feminine delicacy. The tones of his voice
        <lb/>promised to attain the melting richness of his mother's, as
        <lb/>a bud resembles the perfect flower. He possessed that
        <lb/>rapid perception, and tremulous sensibility, which betok­
        <lb/>en genius. His character, even in infancy, displayed
        <lb/>those delicate involutions, and keen vibrations of feeling,
        <lb/>which mark the most poignant susceptibility of pleasure
        <lb/>or of pain. His was the spirit on which the unfeeling
        <lb/>world delights to wreak her tyranny; as the harsh hand
        <lb/>shivers the harp-strings which it has not the skill to controul.</p>
        <p>The youngest, just completing his third year, was the
        <lb/>picture of health, vigour and joy. His golden curls cluster­
        <lb/>ed round a bold forehead which spoke the language of
        <lb/>command, like some infant warrior. His erect head, and
        <lb/>prominent chest, evinced uncommon strength, and so full

        <pb n="012"/><milestone unit="sig" n="1(6)v"/>
        <mw type="pageNum">12</mw>

        <lb/>of glee was this happy and beautiful being, that the
        <lb/>mansion or its precincts rang, from morning till night,
        <lb/>with the clamour of his sports, or the shouts of his laughter.
        <lb/>Active, unwearied, and intelligent, he seemed to bear,
        <lb/>within his breast, and upon his brow, the consciousness
        <lb/>that he was one of the lords of creation.</p>
        <p>On these three objects of affection and solicitude of
        <lb/>the parents centered. Often they spake to each other of
        <lb/>their differing lineaments of character, consulted on the
        <lb/>methods of eradicating what was defective, or confirming
        <lb/>what was lovely, and often contemplated the part they
        <lb/>might hereafter act in life, with a thrilling mixture of fear
        <lb/>and of hope. But for this anxiety it had been written, in
        <lb/>the infinite councils, that there was no need. In one week,
        <lb/>all these beloved beings were laid in the grave. <emph>In one
        <lb/>week</emph>, and the arms of the mourning parents remained
        <lb/>forever vacant. Death, whose <quote type="paraphrase">shadow is without or­
        <lb/>der,</quote> respected in this awful instance the claims of priori­
        <lb/>ty. He first smote the eldest at his studies. His languishing
        <lb/>was short. <said>I go to my Father in Heaven,</said> he said, and
        <lb/>without a struggle ceased to breathe. His disease was
        <lb/>so infectious, that it was necessary to commit him im­
        <lb/>mediately to the earth.</p>
        <p>As the bereaved parents returned from his grave, of
        <lb/>whom, they had said, <said>this same shall comfort us concern­
        <lb/>ing all our toil,</said> they found the second, bowing, like a
        <lb/>pale flowret upon its broken stem. Pain fed upon his frail
        <lb/>frame, <quote>as a moth fretting a garment.</quote> Anguish visit­

        <lb/>ed, and tried every nerve, yet, if he might  but lay his
        <lb/>head upon his mother's bosom, he would endure without
        <lb/>repining. Tears quivered in his soft, blue eyes, like dew
        <lb/>in the bell of the hyacinth, if she were no longer visible.
        <lb/>Yet, when in a moment she returned, a smile of the spirit
        <lb/>would beam through, and rule the convulsions of physical
        <lb/>agony. <said>My son,</said> said his father, <said>let us be willing that you
        <lb/>should go to your Saviour, and to your brother in heaven.</said>
        <lb/>But the suffering child, who could imagine no heaven
        <lb/>brighter than the indulgence of his own young affections,
        <lb/>sighed incessantly as death approached. Yet his convuls­
        <lb/>ed brow resumed partial tranquillity, when his mother's
        <lb/>voice poured forth, in trembling, agonizing harmony, the
        <lb/>sacred music of the hymn he loved. It was then that he
        <lb/>breathed away his spirit, fancying that angels hastened
        <lb/>him to rise, and learn their celestial melodies. But, ere
        <lb/>his heart ceased to throb, the destroyer had laid his hand
        <lb/>upon the youngest, <quote>the beautiful, the brave.</quote> Uncon­
        <lb/>sciousness miserably changed a countenance, which was
        <lb/>ever lighted by the glow of intelligence, or the gladness of
        <lb/>mirth. Unbroken sleep seemed setling without resist­
        <lb/>ance upon him, who had never been willing even for a
        <lb/>moment to be at rest. Yet nature on the eve of dissolu­
        <lb/>tion aroused to an afflicting contest with her conqueror.
        <lb/>Cries and struggles were long and violent, and now and
        <lb/>then a reproachful glance would be bent upon his parents,
        <lb/>as if the victim wondered why they should lend no aid to his
        <lb/>conflict.</p>

        <p>Cold, big drops started thick upon his temples, and his
        <lb/>golden hair streamed with the dews of pain. It was a fear­
        <lb/>ful sight to see a child so struggle with the king of terrors.
        <lb/>At length with one long sob he yielded, and moaning sank
        <lb/>to rest.</p>
        <p>The little white monument still marks the couch of the
        <lb/>three brothers. Its silence is eloquent on the uncertainty
        <lb/>of the hopes of man—on the bitterness that tinges the
        <lb/>brightest fountains of his joy.</p>
        <p>Such were the adversities to which the heart of <persName>Madam
        <lb/>L――</persName> had been subjected. Her blossoms had been riven
        <lb/>from her, as a fig-tree shaketh its untimely figs before the
        <lb/>blast. An affecting memorial of her feelings, at this peri­
        <lb/>od, is still preserved, where, in a poetical form, she pours
        <lb/>out her sorrows before Him who has afflicted her, and
        <lb/>urges with the most afflicting earnestness, that her spirit
        <lb/>may not lose the benefits of his discipline. After the calm­
        <lb/>ness of resignation had soothed the tumult of woe, she
        <lb/>seldom spoke of her griefs. She kept them sacred for the
        <lb/>communiucation of her soul with its Maker. Yet they dif­
        <lb/>fused over her cheerful and faithful discharge of duty,
        <lb/>a softness, a sympathy with those who mourned, a serene
        <lb/>detachment of confidence from terrestrial things, which
        <lb/>realized the tender descriptions of a recent, moral poet:

        <lb/>be enabled to complete the fabric, beneath the smiles of
        <lb/>peace. In gratitude, and quietness of spirit, they rested
        <lb/>beneath the shadow of their own vine; and had they pos­

        <p>We return to <placeName>N――</placeName>, which might be considered, at
        <lb/>this period, the strong hold of <mcr rend="pre(“)post(”)">steady habits,</mcr> and mod­
        <lb/>erated desires. The family of <persName>Madam L――</persName> was usually
        <lb/>enlivened by the residence of some of her relations. The
        <lb/>daughter of a beloved sister had been adopted by her,
        <lb/>soon after the death of her three sons. She had taken
        <lb/>a maternal pleasure in superintending the unfolding of
        <lb/>a character, whose maturity afforded her the consolations
        <lb/>of an endearing intercourse. A heart of sensibility—a
        <lb/>rapid and strong intellect—superiority in those attain­
        <lb/>ments of her sex, which give comfort and elegance to the
        <lb/>domestic department—a liberal soul, indignant at mean­
        <lb/>ness and oppression, and imbued with deep reverence to­
        <lb/>wards God, were the characteristics of this object of her

        <lb/>affections. She depended much on this gentle and zeal<choice><sic/><corr>­</corr></choice>
        <lb/>ous companion, during the mental decay of her husband;
        <lb/>but, soon after his decease, shuddered as she remarked
        <lb/>the pale cheek and hollow eye of this dear friend, whose
        <lb/>delicate frame was gradually resigning the elasticity of
        <lb/>health.</p>
        <p>All the powers of medicine were exerted to mitigate
        <lb/>the sufferings of a long, nervous consumption; until at­
        <lb/>tenuated like a shadow, her mind still gathering bright­
        <lb/>ness amid the wasting of its tabernacle, her spirit was
        <lb/><quote>exhal'd, and went to heaven.</quote> This bereavement was
        <lb/>recent, and the heart of the aged mourner felt a deep
        <lb/>void, whenever her eye rested upon the places usually
        <lb/>occupied by this daughter and friend.</p>
        <p>She was now soothed by the society of a son of her
        <lb/>husband's only sister, who, since the death of his uncle,
        <lb/>had made her house his home, except during an interval
        <lb/>of absence in <placeName>England</placeName> and <placeName>France</placeName>. His accurate mind,
        <lb/>stored with knowledge, which a wide sphere of observa­
        <lb/>tion had given him the means of acquiring, rendered him
        <lb/>both an interesting and instructive companion. Nor did
        <lb/>he forget to profit from those treasures of wisdom, which
        <lb/>he daily beheld falling from the lips of age. He was par­
        <lb/>ticularly fond of the science of <name>Natural History</name>, and of
        <lb/>exploring those labyrinths in which nature delights to in­
        <lb/>volve her operations, where she has made men, both the
        <lb/>habitant of a region of wonders, and a link in their mys­
        <lb/>terious chain. His aged relative, whom he revered as a

        <lb/>parent, and by whom his attachment was reciprocated,
        <lb/>used familiarly to style him her <soCalled rend="pre(“)post(”)">philosophical nephew.</soCalled>
        <lb/>By the light-minded, he was considered reserved, and by
        <lb/>the ignorant, haughty; but those, who were worthy to
        <lb/>comprehend him, discovered a heart, alive to the impul­
        <lb/>ses of friendship and affection, and a mind, occupied in a
        <lb/>tissue of thought too intricate for vulgar comprehension;
        <lb/>or balancing the delicate and almost imperceptible points
        <lb/>of moral principle.</p>
        <p>Besides this nephew, the family of <persName>Madam L――</persName>
        <lb/>comprised, at the present time, only herself, and two do­
        <lb/>mestics. These were blacks, and descendents of ances­
        <lb/>tors who had originally been slaves, before the voice of a
        <lb/>wise and free people decreed the abolition of slavery.
        <lb/>Several <name>Africans</name> had been owned by the father of her hus­
        <lb/>band, in whose family she had become an inmate at the
        <lb/>time of her marriage. His death took place, at the advanc­
        <lb/>ed age of ninety-two, while his frame still possessed vigour,
        <lb/>and his unimpaired mind expatiated freely upon the past,
        <lb/>and looked undaunted toward the future. Temperance
        <lb/>had guarded his health, and economy the fortune, which
        <lb/>his industry had acquired. Religion had been his anchor
        <lb/>from his youth, sure and stedfast; and, with the dignity
        <lb/>of a patriarch, he descended to the tomb, illustrious at
        <lb/>once, by the good name he bequeathed to his offspring,
        <lb/>and by the lustre which their virtues in turn, reflected
        <lb/>upon him. He lived at a time, when to hold in servitude
        <lb/>the children of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, had not been set in a true light by

        <lb/>the eloquence and humanity of a more favoured age.
        <lb/><persName>Clarkson</persName>, and <persName>Wilberforce</persName> had not then arisen to unlock
        <lb/><said>indignantly the secrets of their prison-house,</said> nor <persName>Cow­
        <lb/>per</persName>, to bid the eye of sensibility weep over their wrongs.
        <lb/>In the community, where the lot of this venerable patri­
        <lb/>arch had been cast, they were found in the families of a
        <lb/>few men of wealth, nurtured as dependants, but never op­
        <lb/>pressed as slaves. Under his roof they were treated with
        <lb/>uniform kindness, and after the accession of his son to the
        <lb/>paternal estate, received their freedom.</p>
        <p>Two descendants of these <mcr rend="pre(“)post(”)">servants born in the house,</mcr>
        <lb/>still continued with <persName>Madam L――</persName>, one as a hireling, the
        <lb/>other for the sake of his clothing, board and education,
        <lb/>until his minority should cease. <persName>Beulah</persName>, who had reach­
        <lb/><choice><sic/><corr>ed</corr></choice> her twenty-second winter, was an athletic, industrious fe­
        <lb/>male, grave in her deportment, and of strict honesty. <persName>Cuff</persName>,
        <lb/>her brother, was her junior by six years, active, and of an
        <lb/>affectionate disposition, with some mixture of <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> hu­
        <lb/>mour. Both were attached to their mistress, like the
        <lb/>vassals of feudal times, regarding her as <said>but a little
        <lb/>lower than the angels.</said> She cherished their unaffected
        <lb/>regard, by a sway of equanimity, and gentleness, profes­
        <lb/>sing herself to be, like the <persName>Vicar of <placeName>Wakefield</placeName></persName>, an <quote>ad­
        <lb/>mirer of happy human faces.</quote></p>
        <p>It was now <name>Saturday</name> night, and the setting sun ushered
        <lb/>in that stillness which used to mark its return, forty years
        <lb/>since, in <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>. Every ware-house, and shop was
        <lb/>shut, and man, like the creation around him, seemed

        <lb/>relapsing into quietness and repose. There was some­
        <lb/>thing both soothing and dignified in the solemnity with
        <lb/>which this period was then observed. Labour and revelry
        <lb/>were alike laid aside, and a pause of silence announced
        <lb/>the approach of that day, which the Creator consecrated.</p>
        <p>It seemed like the deference of a reflecting spirit, con­
        <lb/>scious that its habitual vocations were earthly, and un­
        <lb/>willing, without purifying itself from their defilement, to
        <lb/>rush into those services, which, to be acceptable, are
        <lb/>required to be holy. It was like the change of garments
        <lb/>of the <rs type="properAdjective">Levitical</rs> priesthood, ere they entered the Sanctua­
        <lb/>ry. Our puritanic fathers then said to their worldly cares,
        <lb/>as <persName>Abraham</persName> to his servants at the base of <placeName>Mount Moriah</placeName>,
        <lb/><quote>abide ye here, while I go yonder and worship.</quote></p>
        <p>They maintained that, if according to scripture, the
        <lb/>evening and the morning constituted the first day, the
        <lb/><name>Sabbath</name> embraced the preceding evening within its ap­
        <lb/>pointed limits. So strictly did they enjoin the sanctifi­
        <lb/>cation of <name>Saturday</name> night, that it might be said of them in
        <lb/>that season, as it was of the <name>Egyptians</name> during their tem­
        <lb/>pest of hail, <quote>he who feared the word of the Lord, made
        <lb/>his servants, and his cattle flee into their house.</quote> The
        <lb/>penal laws, which guarded the observance of the <name>Sabbath</name>
        <lb/>among our ancestors at the first settlement of this country,
        <lb/>had relaxed in their severity. Still, to travel on that day
        <lb/>was considered an offence, meriting close examination
        <lb/>from those vested with authority and ending in restraint,
        <lb/>unless the sickness or distress of distant relations sanction­

        <lb/>ed the measure. <mcr rend="pre(“)post(”)"><name>Sunday</name> airings,</mcr> were then unknown,
        <lb/>and would have been deemed as an <quote>iniquity to be punish­
        <lb/>ed by the judges.</quote> So fully had the saint-like simplicity
        <lb/>of our predecessors embued <name>Saturday</name> eve with the sanctity
        <lb/>of the subsequent morn, that seldom were the wheels of
        <lb/>the traveller, or his voice, asking admission at the inns,
        <lb/>known to disturb the silence of this hallowed period. La­
        <lb/>bourers restored to their places the instruments of their
        <lb/>weekly toil; mechanics the implements of their trade;
        <lb/>students their books of entertainment, and <quote>every good
        <lb/>man and true,</quote> was supposed to be convening his fami­
        <lb/>ly around the domestic altar.</p>
        <p>In the parlour of <persName>Madam L――</persName>, this was a season of solita­
        <lb/>ry and heartfelt meditation. The reflection of a clear wood­
        <lb/>fire gleamed fitfully upon the crimson moreen curtains,
        <lb/>gilded clock, ebony-framed mirror, and polished wain­
        <lb/>scot, ere light glimmered more brightly from two stately,
        <lb/>antiquated candlesticks. The lady was seated in her
        <lb/>rocking-chair, which stood in its accustomed corner. A
        <lb/>favourite grey-robed cat, with neck and paws of the most
        <lb/>exquisite whiteness, sat at the feet of her mistress, gazing
        <lb/>wistfully in her face. Slowly erecting herself, she ad­
        <lb/>vanced a soft velvet paw to the hand which rested upon
        <lb/>the arm of the chair, as if to remind its owner of ancient
        <lb/>friendship, or to claim some expression of fondness. Finding
        <lb/>herself unnoticed, she removed her station to a green
        <lb/>cushion in the vicinity, and turning round thrice, betook

        <pb n="022"/><milestone unit="sig" n="2(5)v"/>
        <mw type="pageNum">22</mw>

        <lb/>herself to repose, in the attitude of a caterpillar, coiled
        <lb/>upon a fresh verdant leaf.</p>
        <p>On a small round table, lay the Scriptures and <title rend="pre(“)post(”)"><persName>Young's</persName>
        <lb/>Night Thoughts,</title> the favourite poem of <persName>Madam L――</persName>. The
        <lb/>latter was open at that canto, where the author so feel­
        <lb/>ingly describes the loss of friends, and her spectacles laid
        <lb/>therein, as if to preserve some striking passage for fur­
        <lb/>ther perusal, which she indulged in those contemplations
        <lb/>which it awakened. Her brow resting on her hand, dis­
        <lb/>played the emotions of a soul, whose strong susceptibility
        <lb/>to the influences of religion had tempered, purified, subli­
        <lb/>mated. Before her, past in review, the pictured scenes
        <lb/>of childhood, the gaiety of youth, the sorrows of maturi­
        <lb/>ty, the loneliness of age. Memory awoke Grief from the
        <lb/>slumber into which time had soothed her, and revived
        <lb/>her long buried energies. The mourner seemed to see
        <lb/>her mother, the soft nurse of her infancy, the watchful
        <lb/>monitress of her childhood, again smitten by an unseen
        <lb/>hand, and covered suddenly with the paleness of the
        <lb/>tomb: one moment, bending over her plants, in the sweet
        <lb/>recesses of her garden, the next, lying lifeless among them,
        <lb/>blasted by Him who maketh all the <quote>glory of man, as
        <lb/>the flower of grass.</quote></p>
        <p>Her father, venerable for years, and high in publick
        <lb/>honour, was again stretched before her, in the agonies of
        <lb/>dissolving nature. Once more, his farewell tone falter­
        <lb/>ed on her ear, as she wiped the dews from his temples,
        <lb/><said>My daughter! visit the fatherless, and the widow in

        <lb/>their afflictions, and keep thyself unspotted from the
        <lb/>world.</said> Her faithful obedience to this admonition, utter­
        <lb/>ed from the confines of another state, might have cheered
        <lb/>her heart, had it been wont to linger amid the recollections
        <lb/>of its own virtue. The tissue of her good deeds, which
        <lb/>was extolled by others as woven by a perfect hand, she
        <lb/>was accustomed to scan, as to administer to her hu­
        <lb/>mility.</p>
        <p>Such influence had imagination in this hour of excited
        <lb/>feeling, that almost, her husband, the companion of her
        <lb/>youth, seemed present, in his accustomed seat by her
        <lb/>side. In fancy, she gazed upon his mild features, radiant
        <lb/>with the beams of intelligence. Half she listened to his
        <lb/>voice, explaining the axioms of science, or pouring forth
        <lb/>the spirit of benevolence. Then came the prattling tones
        <lb/>of children, the smile, the sport, the winning attitudes
        <lb/>of those three boys, who returned no more. But illusion
        <lb/>vanished, and more bitterly than her melancholy poet,
        <lb/>she might have apostrophized the grim conqueror;
        <quote><lg type="indeterminate">

        </lg></quote></p>
        <p>Yet no repining mingled with her sorrow. She loved
        <lb/>Him who had chastened her; and raising upward eyes,
        <lb/>whose pure azure shone through the big tear, she uttered
        <lb/>in the low tone of mental devotion; <said>I thank Thee that
        <lb/>I am not alone, for <emph>Thou</emph> art with me.</said> Tenderly im­

        <p>At its close, she relapsed into a train of animating, de­
        <lb/>votional contemplations, admirably fitting the mind for
        <lb/>the duties of that day, on which the Reedemer, whom
        <lb/>she loved, ascended from the tomb.</p>
        <p>Around the fire of her domestics, quietness and com­
        <lb/>fort, though of a different nature, predominated. The
        <lb/>clean-wash'd floor, well brush'd shoes, and preparations
        <lb/>for a <name>Sunday's</name> dinner, shewed that the householders of
        <lb/>that time provided, in their domestic regulations, that
        <lb/>their servants also might attend the worship of the sanc­
        <lb/>tuary, and enjoy the privileges of a day of rest. Neatness
        <lb/>and order, in which the ancient house-keeping matrons
        <lb/>certainly yield not the palm to their daughters, or grand­
        <lb/>daughters, prevailed throughout the simply-furnished
        <lb/>apartment. The dressers, unpainted, but as white as the
        <lb/>nature of the wood permitted them to be, sustained the
        <lb/>weight of rows of pewter, emulous of silver in its beau­
        <lb/>tiful lustre.</p>

        <lb/>daily applied to its surface, could produce. A heavy
        <lb/>oaken cupboard, the sound of whose opening doors was
        <lb/>music to the mendicant, and the neighbouring poor, and
        <lb/>five or six tall chairs, with rush bottoms, completed the
        <lb/>furniture. A wooden seat or sofa, commonly called a
        <lb/>settle, was immoveably fixed, not far from the ample ex­
        <lb/>panse of the fire-place. Over the mantle-piece, was a
        <lb/>high and narrow shelf, which, at its western extremity,
        <lb/>was multiplied into a triple row of shorter ones; forming
        <lb/>a repository for a servant's library. This was composed
        <lb/>principally of pamphlet sermons, or what was considered
        <lb/><name>Sunday</name> reading—ere the writer of novels had engrossed
        <lb/>that department. Approximating to this library, hung the
        <lb/>roasting-jack; which, when put in motion, with its com­
        <lb/>plicated machinery extending from garret to cellar, alarm­
        <lb/>ed the unlearned by its discordant sounds, and awoke
        <lb/>in the minds of the superstitious some indefinite suspicion
        <lb/>of the agency of evil spirits. On the broad hearth-stone,
        <lb/>sat <persName>Beulah</persName> and her brother; the former, in token of seni­
        <lb/>ority occupying the post of honour, in front of a blazing
        <lb/>fire; the latter, with due decorum ensconced in a corner.
        <lb/>The brow of the ebon damsel exhibited a more than usual
        <lb/>cast of solemnity, by way of testifying respect to a New-
        <lb/>Testament, on whose pages her eyes were devoutly fixed.</p>
        <p><persName>Cuffee</persName> regarded her for some minutes, as if doubtful
        <lb/>whether an interruption of her studies would be tolerat­
        <lb/>ed. At length, with a long yawn, he hazarded the experi­

        <lb/>had recently eaten. To distinguish <name>Saturday</name> night, by
        <lb/>a dish of beans baked with pork, was one of the peculiar­
        <lb/>ities of their native town. Many of the oldest householders
        <lb/>could recollect no instance in which this ancient custom
        <lb/>had been violated beneath their roof; and children some­
        <lb/>times formed an inseparable connection in their minds,
        <lb/>between this prelusive dish, and the duties of the <name>Sab­
        <lb/>bath</name>. The inhabitants still preserve this usage of their
        <lb/>ancestors, as faithfully as the sons of <persName>Rechab</persName> transmitted
        <lb/>his prohibition of wine to their remote posterity. <persName>Cuffee</persName>,
        <lb/>finding his exordium unchecked, proceeded to relate with
        <lb/>proportionable astonishment, that <emph>once</emph> within the memory
        <lb/>of an aged man of his own colour, the <title><name>Saturday</name>-night
        <lb/>Statute-act</title> was violated, at the inn where he was ser­
        <lb/>vitor.</p>
        <p><said>Next mornin,</said> said he, elevating his eyes with be­
        <lb/>coming gravity, <said>next mornin, they ebery soul forget it
        <lb/>be Sabba-day. They go 'bout their work—wash, scour
        <lb/>—Misse take her knitten-work—Massa write his 'counts
        <lb/>—Brister go to barn—thrash grain.</said></p>
        <p>He described their utter consternation, when the bell

        <p>He next proceeded to state, on the authority of a young
        <lb/>man of his acquaintance, the dire disasters which befel his
        <lb/>father's household, for a similar omission. Their resi­
        <lb/>dence was on <placeName>Bean-hill</placeName>, a section of the town, where this

        <lb/>important article is required to appear on the table, twice
        <lb/>in a week, on the evenings of <name>Wednesday</name> and <name>Saturday</name>.
        <lb/>This ordinance, it seems, had once been neglected
        <lb/>since the building of their house. That night, a strange
        <lb/>uproar awoke every member of the family, and frightful
        <lb/>dreams disturbed their repose. Lo! in the morning, their
        <lb/>culinary furnace was found prostrate, and every brick
        <lb/>dislodged from its station; as if invisible agents had as­
        <lb/>sumed the punishment of the offence. <persName>Cuffee</persName> though
        <lb/>somewhat diffuse in his narrations, drew no sign of atten­
        <lb/>tion from his sister, who greatly valued herself upon a
        <lb/>solemn deportment at devotional seasons. At length,
        <lb/>slowly rolling towards him an eye, where white remarkably
        <lb/>predominated, she inquired <choice><sic>ino</sic><corr>into</corr></choice> the nature of the book,
        <lb/>which he held unopened in his hand.</p>
        <p><said>Catechize,</said> he replied, with the tone of an indolent
        <lb/>boy at school, equally reluctant to study, or to recite his
        <lb/>lesson. But <persName>Beulah</persName>, moved with righteous zeal, drew
        <lb/>her chair into a line with his, and enveloping the volume
        <lb/>in her huge hand, took it from his with no gentle grasp.</p>
        <p>By dint of spelling, she rendered the title-page vocal,
        <lb/>which proved to be, <said><title>The Scholar's Introduction to the
        <lb/>Science of Arithmetic</title>. By <persName>Master Edward Cocker</persName>.</said></p>
        <p><said>That's a Catechise-Book, I s'pose!</said> she exclaimed
        <lb/>with commendable asperity. Her brother hastily pro­
        <lb/>ceeded to justify himself, on the ground of a mistake
        <lb/>made in the volume, before the candle was lighted.
        <lb/>Wishing however to divert attention from this view of the

        <pb n="028"/><milestone unit="sig" n="3(2)v"/>
        <mw type="pageNum">28</mw>

        <lb/>subject, he descanted upon the carelessness of the owner
        <lb/>of this ancient volume, who had torn sundry leaves, besides
        <lb/>decorating the blank spaces with ill-drawn pictures, and
        <lb/>blots. He repea<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">te</unclear>d a quaint saying, purporting that those
        <lb/>who deface their books, have within them that principle
        <lb/>of carelessness, which leads to want and disgrace. To
        <lb/>his expressions of wonder that the name of <persName rend="pre(“)post(”)">Benedict
        <lb/>Arnold</persName>, so often occurred, in almost illegible scrawls,
        <lb/><persName>Beulah</persName> replied that this was the book, which taught the
        <lb/>elements of arithmetic to the traitor of that name, who
        <lb/>resided in that house for several years, as one of the
        <lb/>clerks of her deceased master. Unable to resist the
        <lb/>temptation of displaying superiour knowledge, her pious
        <lb/>taciturnity vanished. She spoke eloquently of his enor­
        <lb/>mities in burning a neighbouring town, and putting to
        <lb/>death all the brave defenders of the fort; many of whom
        <lb/>had been his acquaintance, and friends. She complained
        <lb/>that, after landing on the devoted spot, and dining with a
        <lb/>worthy lady, who took great pains for his accommodation,
        <lb/>he ordered her house to be the first set on fire.</p>
        <p>She described the men of her native place, marching
        <lb/>to the relief of their distressed neighbours, as soon as the
        <lb/>sound of the cannon reached then, and their wives and
        <lb/>daughters weeping at the doors and windows, as they
        <lb/>departed. In enlarging upon the losses sustained by the
        <lb/>conflagration of so many buildings, she could not avoid
        <lb/>descanting upon the quantity of eatables that were de­
        <lb/>stroyed, especially the <said>oceans of butter and lard,</said>

        <pb n="029"/><milestone unit="sig" n="3(3)r"/>

        <lb/>which were seen frying in the cellars; naturally feeling
        <lb/>strongest sympathy for the waste of these condiments,
        <lb/>which in her culinary art she most highly valued. But she
        <lb/>dwelt with the deepest interest upon an exploit of a female
        <lb/>of her own colour, which whom she profest a particular
        <lb/>acquaintance, calling her <persName>Aunt Rose</persName>. It seems that <persName>Ar­
        <lb/>nold</persName>, fatigued with the contest, had paused to quench his
        <lb/>battle-thirst at a well. As he stooped over it, this ebon
        <lb/>heroine, who had been commissioned to hold his horse,
        <lb/>made some questionable advances towards him, and had
        <lb/>actually grasped his ancles, to precipitate him into the
        <lb/>pit. Proving unsuccessful in her enterprize, she found
        <lb/>it expedient to withdraw with unusual despatch.</p>
        <p><said>That very night,</said> subjoined <persName>Beulah</persName>, <said rend="post()"><persName>Aunt Rose</persName>, hab
        <lb/>most remarkable dream. She 'tink she die, and go rite

        <lb/>speak out to 'em and say, <said>how you 'spect me to get
        <lb/>supper? Don't ye see there's no kitchen in Heaven?</said></said></p>
        <p><persName>Beulah</persName> then launched into a new tide of invective,
        <lb/>against the wicked traitor, as she styled him, until <persName>Cuffee</persName>
        <lb/>inquired if he had no good quality, observing that his
        <lb/>mistress said, that we should not forget to speak of the
        <lb/>good, as well as the evil in the characters of our fellow
        <lb/>creatures. The maiden, inly reproved, deigned no an­

        <lb/>sation was too diffuse for <name>Saturday</name> night. This she per­
        <lb/>ceived much more readily, when she herself ceased
        <lb/>to be the chief speaker. After a decent pause, she
        <lb/>explained her doubts to her brother, with an empathic
        <lb/>nasal twang, whether he had yet proceeded in the <title>Assem­
        <lb/>bly of Divines' Catechism</title> as far as <title rend="pre(“)post(”)">Effectual Calling;</title>
        <lb/>adding, that long before she had reached his age, she was
        <lb/>able to repeat the whole, with the proofs, and ask herself
        <lb/>the questions, into the bargain.</p>
        <p><said>I wonder,</said> he replied, <said>who had not rudder ax <emph>dem­
        <lb/>selves</emph> questions, dan hab any body else. Den if you can't

        <p>The ringing of the bell, which on <name>Saturday</name> night, like
        <lb/>the old <rs type="properAdjective">Norman</rs> curfew, was always at eight o'clock,
        <lb/>reminded them that much time had been spent, and until

        <lb/>in their respective studies.</p></div>

          <lb/>was the residence of a once powerful tribe of <name>Indians</name>.
          <lb/>But diminished in numbers, and oppressed by a sense of
          <lb/>degradation, the survivers exhibited the melancholy rem­
          <lb/>nant of a fallen race, like that almost extinguished embers
          <lb/>of a flame, once terrible in wildness. The aged remem­
          <lb/>bered the line of their hereditary kings, now becomes ex­
          <lb/>tinct; the younger preserved in tradition faint gleams of
          <lb/>the glory which had departed. Yet, in the minds of all,
          <lb/>was a consciousness that their anceastors possessing the land,
          <lb/>in which they were now as strangers, and from whence
          <lb/>their offspring were vanishing as a <quote>guest that tarrieth
          <lb/>but a night.</quote> The small territory, on which they resided,
          <lb/>was secured to them by government; and its fertile soil
          <lb/>would have been more than adequate to their wants, had
          <lb/>they been assiduous in its cultivation. But those roving
          <lb/>habits, which form their national characteristic, are pe­
          <lb/>culiarly averse from the laborious application, and minute
          <lb/>details of agriculture. Here and there, a corn-field with­
          <lb/>out enclosure might be seen, displaying its yellow treas­

          <lb/>ures beneath a ripening sun; but such was their native
          <lb/>improvidence, that the possessor, ere the return of another
          <lb/><name>Autumn</name>, would be as destitute of food, as he who had
          <lb/><quote>neither earing nor harvest.</quote> The productions of a little
          <lb/>spot of earth, near the door of many of them, denominated
          <lb/>a garden, supplied them during the gentler seasons, with
          <lb/>the more common vegetables; yet so reckless were they
          <lb/>of futurity, that cold winter's want was unthought of, as
          <lb/>long as it was unfelt, and the needs of to-morrow never
          <lb/>disturbed the revel of to-day. In their simple estimation,
          <lb/>he was a man of wealth, whose dominion extended over
          <lb/>a cow; yet it was wealth rather to be wondered at, than
          <lb/>envied. To roam freely over the forest, and drink the
          <lb/>pure breath of the mountains; to earn with their arrow's
          <lb/>point, the food of the passing day, and wrap themselves
          <lb/>in a blanket from the chill of midnight, seemed all the
          <lb/>riches they coveted—all the happiness they desired.</p>
          <p>These were, however, more properly, the lineaments
          <lb/>of their character, in its native nobleness. Civilization
          <lb/>had excluded them from the forests, their original empire,
          <lb/>and awakened new wants which they were inadequate to
          <lb/>supply. It had familiarized them to the sight of the white
          <lb/>man's comforts, without teaching them the industry by
          <lb/>which they are purchased. It had introduced them to
          <lb/>vices, which destroyed their original strength, like the
          <lb/>syren pointing in derision to the humbled <persName>Sampson</persName>, whose
          <lb/>locks her own hand had shorn. Thus they sacrificed the
          <lb/>virtues of their savage state, and fell short of the ad­

          <pb n="033"/><milestone unit="sig" n="3(5)r"/>
          <mw type="pageNum">33</mw>

          <lb/>vantages which a civilized one bestows; and striking, as
          <lb/>it were, both upon <name>Scylla</name> and <name>Charybdis</name>, made ship­
          <lb/>wreck of all.</p>
          <p>Still some interesting features might be traced amid this
          <lb/>assemblage of gloom; some individuals remained, around
          <lb/>whom, as around <persName>Philipœmon</persName>, <quote>the last of the <name>Greeks</name>,</quote>
          <lb/>gleams of brightness lingered. A few warriors, who, in
          <lb/>the contest of <date when="1755">1755</date>, dared death for the country which
          <lb/>had subjugated them, still survived, to speak, with flash­
          <lb/>ing eyes, of battle, and of victory. Some, who had shared
          <lb/>the toils of that recent ear which had emancipated from
          <lb/><rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> thraldom one who was to rank among the nations
          <lb/>of the earth, remained, to shew their wounds, so poorly
          <lb/>requited. Many might still be found, in whose hearts,
          <lb/>gratitude, hospitality, and inviolable faith, the ancient
          <lb/>characteristics of their race, were not extinguished.</p>
          <p>But over the greater mass hung the cloud of intem­
          <lb/>perance, indolence, and mental degradation. Conscious­
          <lb/>ness of their own state, and of the contempt of others,
          <lb/>presented hopeless obstacles to every reforming hand,
          <lb/>except His who brought light out of chaos. The dwel­
          <lb/>ings of this dilapidated tribe, though universally in a
          <lb/>state of rudeness, exhibited considerable variety of ap­
          <lb/>pearance. Occasionally, the ancient wigwam might be
          <lb/>detected, lifting its cone-like head among the bushes; then
          <lb/>a tenement of rough logs, reeking with smoke, would pre­
          <lb/>sent its more substantial, though less romantic structure.
          <lb/>These, which fronted the road, were usually of boards,

          <lb/>sometimes containing two rooms, with a chimney of stones,
          <lb/>and admitting comparative comfort. Trees, loaded with
          <lb/>small apples, yielded their spontaneous refreshment to
          <lb/>those, who never cultured the young sapling when the
          <lb/>parent stock decayed.</p>
          <p>Their situation afforded conveniences for their favourite
          <lb/>employment of fishing; and a few boats in their posses­
          <lb/>sion, enabled them to pursue their victims into the deep
          <lb/>waters.</p>
          <p>The females were more easily initiated into the habits
          <lb/>of civilized life. These, they readily saw diminished
          <lb/>their labours, and augmented their consequence. Still,
          <lb/>the prerogative of dominion, entrusted to man by his
          <lb/>Maker, is tenaciously cherished by the <name><rs type="properAdjective">American</rs> Indian</name>.
          <lb/>He slowly yields, to the courtesy of example, the custom
          <lb/>of making his weaker companion the bearer of burdens,
          <lb/>and the servant of his indolence. In this perishing tribe,
          <lb/>the secondary sex were far the most docile, whether
          <lb/>religious truth, or domestic economy were the subjects
          <lb/>of instruction.</p>
          <p>Still the distaff, the needle, and the loom were less
          <lb/>congenial to their inclinations, than the manufacture of
          <lb/>brooms, mats, and baskets. In the construction of the
          <lb/>latter, considerable ingenuity was often manifested; and
          <lb/>their extensive knowledge of the colouring matter, con­
          <lb/>tained in the juices of plants and herbs, enabled them
          <lb/>to adorn these fabrics with all the hues of the rainbow.
          <lb/>Bending beneath a load of these fabrics, and often the

          <mw type="pageNum">35</mw>

          <lb/>additional weight of a pappoose, or babe, deposited in
          <lb/>a large basket and fastened around the neck, with a leath­
          <lb/>ern strap, might be seen, walking through the streets of
          <lb/>the town, after a weary journey from their own settlement,
          <lb/>the descendents of the former lords of the soil, perhaps
          <lb/>the daughters of kings. Clad in insufficient apparel after
          <lb/>the <rs type="properAdjective">American</rs> fashion, with a little round bonnet of blue
          <lb/>cloth, in the shape peculiar to themselves, and somewhat
          <lb/>resembling a scallop-shell, and a small blanket thrown over
          <lb/>the shoulders, if the season were cold, they would enter
          <lb/>every door in search of a market. There, in the soft,
          <lb/>harmonious tones, by which the voice of the female na­
          <lb/>tive is distinguished, they would patiently inquire for a
          <lb/>purchaser. If all their humble applications were nega­
          <lb/>tived, they might be heard requesting in the same gentle
          <lb/>utterance a little refreshment, or a morsel of bread for the
          <lb/>infant at their back. I will not say that these entreaties
          <lb/>were always in vain—but the poor, famished dog, which
          <lb/>would be crouching at the feet of the suppliant, was too
          <lb/>happy if he could obtain a fleshless bone, to allay the
          <lb/>cravings of hunger.</p>
          <p>These females, when employed, as they sometimes
          <lb/>were, in the families of whites, to repair worn chairs, were
          <lb/>uniformly industrious, and grateful for any trifling favour.
          <lb/>In their own culinary processes, they were studious of
          <lb/>comfort as far as their rude notions, and imperfect know­
          <lb/>ledge extended. Dishes composed of green corn, and
          <lb/>beans boiled with clams, and denominated <term>Succatash</term>,

          <pb n="036"/><milestone unit="sig" n="3(6)v"/>
          <mw type="pageNum">36</mw>

          <lb/>the same grains parched nicely, and pulverized, by the
          <lb/>name of <term>Yokeag</term>, fish, or birds, prepared in different ways,
          <lb/>with cakes of <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> meal baked in ashes, or before the
          <lb/>fire upon a flat board, gave variety to their simple re­
          <lb/>pasts.</p>
          <p>They were likewise the physicians of their tribe. They
          <lb/>regarded no toil in travelling, or labour in searching the
          <lb/>thickets, for medicinal plants and roots. To sooth the
          <lb/>agony of pain, or conquer the malignity of disease,
          <lb/>was a victory, which their affectionate hearts prized more
          <lb/>than the warrior, who intoxicated with false glory, boasts
          <lb/>of the lives he has destroyed. Their knowledge of aperi­
          <lb/>ents and cathartics, was extensive; their antidotes to poison
          <lb/>were also considered powerful, and their skill in the
          <lb/>healing of wounds was said to have been justly valued in
          <lb/>time of war. Such were the females in their best estate;
          <lb/>and such the poverty and degeneracy of the once power­
          <lb/>ful tribe of <name>Mohegans</name>.</p>
          <p>Yet, strange as it may seem, amid their degradation
          <lb/>they retained strong traits of national pride. In the gravi­
          <lb/>ty, and dignity of brow, which the better sort assumed,
          <lb/>might be traced a lingering remnant of the creed of their
          <lb/>ancestors, that the red man was formed before his white
          <lb/>brethren, and of better clay. The proud recollections of
          <lb/>royalty were cherished with particular tenacity; and the
          <lb/>most distant ramification of the blood of their kings, pre­
          <lb/>served in tradition with all the <rs type="properAdjective">Cambrian</rs> enthusiasm. The
          <lb/>place of burial for their monarchs was never suffered to

          <lb/>be polluted by the ashes of the common people. It is
          <lb/>still visible, with its decaying monuments, in the southern
          <lb/>part of the town; and its mouldering inscriptions have
          <lb/>appeared in the records of recent travellers. A few years
          <lb/>only have elapsed, since a <name>Mohegan</name> who was employed
          <lb/>in mowing, in the northern part of town, and a <name>Pequot</name>
          <lb/>who was passing through it, both died on the same day,
          <lb/>apparently destroyed by the excessive heat of the weath­
          <lb/>er; perhaps, the victims of some latent disease. Coffins
          <lb/>were provided by the inhabitants, and the bodies laid
          <lb/>therein with all the demonstrations of respect, which they
          <lb/>were accustomed to pay to the forsaken tenement of a
          <lb/>soul. Most of the population of <name>Mohegan</name> attended the ob­
          <lb/>sequies, which were solemnized upon the Square, opposite
          <lb/>the Court-house. As the clergyman lifed his voice in
          <lb/>pathetic tones, to Him <quote>who hath made of one blood, all
          <lb/>who dwell upon the face of the earth,</quote> the females throng­
          <lb/>ed to his side, as if they loved and revered the ambassa­
          <lb/>dor of that Great Spirit, who giveth life and taketh it
          <lb/>away. Tears flowed over their sad faces, as they gazed
          <lb/>upon the lifeless forms; but on the countenances of the
          <lb/>men, was a dark expression, as if they remembered that
          <lb/>they were but servants, where once their fathers were
          <lb/>lords. This recollection occupied their minds more than
          <lb/>the scene which mournfully illustrated the equality of
          <lb/>man. At length the dissatisfied spirit revealed itself in
          <lb/>words. Graves had been prepared for the unfortunate
          <lb/>men, in the burial-place of the northern parish of <placeName>N――</placeName>,

          <lb/>which surrounded the green where they were assembled.</p>
          <p><said>These men shall not lie side by side,</said> they exclaim­
          <lb/>ed, with their usual conciseness and energy. <said>Ask ye
          <lb/>why? In one of them is the blood of our kings. He was
          <lb/>sixteenth cousin to our last monarch. The other is an
          <lb/>accursed <name>Pequot</name>. Think ye the same earth shall cover
          <lb/>them? No! Their spirits would contend in their dark
          <lb/>habitation. The noble soul would scorn to see the vile
          <lb/>slumberer so near. They could not arise and walk to­
          <lb/>gether in the shadowy regions, for their everlasting home
          <lb/>is not the same.</said></p>
          <p>Such was the haughty spirit, which lurked in the bosom
          <lb/>of an oppressed, a crushed people. They could not for­
          <lb/>get the throne that was overturned, though they grovelled
          <lb/>among worms at its footstool.</p>
          <p>Yet this tribe, now so despised, was once formidable to
          <lb/>our ancestors. Its friendship was courted, and its aid,
          <lb/>during the wars with <persName>Philip</persName>, in the seventeenth century,
          <lb/>was very important to them in the infancy of their colony.
          <lb/>It was, at that time, formidable both for the extent of territo­
          <lb/>ry, and number of warriors. Its power was increased by
          <lb/>the conquest of <persName>Sassacus</persName>, king of the <name>Pequots</name>, who at the
          <lb/>arrival of the <name>English</name> had under his dominion 26 sachems,
          <lb/>and 700 warriors; and also by the subjugation of the <name>Nip­
          <lb/>mucks</name>, whose strong hold was in <placeName>Oxford</placeName>, in <placeName>Massachu­
          <lb/>setts</placeName>, though their dominion extended over a part of <placeName>Con­
          <lb/>necticut</placeName>. These conquests were achieved by the enter­

          <lb/>prise and talents of <persName>Uncas</persName>, a monarch whose invincible
          <lb/>courage would have been renowned in history, did he not
          <lb/>belong to a proscribed race; whose wisdom might place
          <lb/>him by the side of the son of <persName>Laertes</persName>, had we but an <name>Ho­
          <lb/>mer</name> to immortalize his name; and whose friendship for
          <lb/>our fathers ought to secure him a place in the annals of
          <lb/>our gratitude. Originally of the nation of the <name>Pequots</name>,
          <lb/>he revolted against the tyranny of <persName>Sassacus</persName>, whose king­
          <lb/>dom comprised the whole sea-coast of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>. <persName>Un­
          <lb/>cas</persName> partook of his blood, and had a command among his
          <lb/>warriors, but rebelled against his arbitrary rule, and de­
          <lb/>parted from his jurisdiction.</p>
          <p>Considerable address must have been requisite to ren­
          <lb/>der himself the monarch of another tribe, and make the
          <lb/>royal honours hereditary in his family. When, at the
          <lb/>arrival of our ancestors, the enmity of the <name>Pequots</name> dis­
          <lb/>covered itself in such terrible forms of conspiracy and
          <lb/>murder, that unable to perform in safety the duties of the
          <lb/>consecrated day of rest, armed sentinels were stationed at
          <lb/>the threshold of their churches. <persName>Uncas</persName> continued their un­
          <lb/>alterable ally. When the bravery of <persName>Mason</persName> staked, as it
          <lb/>were, the existence of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> on the firmness of one
          <lb/>little band, <persName>Uncas</persName>, with his warriors, partook every hard­
          <lb/>ship, shared every danger, and, by his counsels, and su­
          <lb/>periour knowledge of the modes of <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> warfare, greatly
          <lb/>facilitated the victory over their ferocious foes. His pres­
          <lb/>ence of mind, in any sudden emergency, would have ranked
          <lb/>him among heroes, had he borne a part in the wars of <placeName>Rome</placeName>.

          <lb/>Thrice, assassins were employed against his life, and suc­
          <lb/>ceeded in wounding him, but he discovered no perturba­
          <lb/>tion. One, bribed by <persName>Miantonimoh</persName>, his deadly enemy,
          <lb/>in <date when="1643">1643</date>, shot him through the arm, but, like the wretch
          <lb/>employed against the great <persName>Coligny</persName> by the <rs type="properAdjective">Medicean</rs> fac­
          <lb/>tion, fled, without daring to meet the eye of the hero.
          <lb/>Another, instigated by the treacherous <persName>Ninigrate</persName>, in <date when="1648">1648</date>,
          <lb/>approached him as he stood unsuspiciously in a ship, and
          <lb/>pierced his breast with a sword. But the wound was not
          <lb/>mortal, and, in both instances, his cool and majestic de­
          <lb/>portment evinced his contempt of treachery, and his supe­
          <lb/>riority to the fear of death. But, though prodigal of his
          <lb/>own blood when danger impended, he was tenacious of
          <lb/>the lives of his people.</p>
          <p><persName>Sequasson</persName>, a sachem on <placeName>Connecticut River</placeName>, having de­
          <lb/>stroyed one of his subjects, and refused to make reparation,
          <lb/><persName>Uncas</persName> challenged him to single combat, and slew him;
          <lb/>cancelling with his blood the debt of justice, which he had
          <lb/>scorned to acknowledge. The same tenderness for the
          <lb/>lives of his followers may be discerned when they were
          <lb/>drawn up in battle array, against the force of <persName>Miantonimoh</persName>,
          <lb/>his mortal foe. During the short pause which preceded
          <lb/>the encounter, the <rs type="properAdjective">Mohegan</rs> monarch, lofty in native val­
          <lb/>our, approaching from his ranks, stretched forth his hand
          <lb/>toward his antagonist, and said,—</p>
          <p><said>Here are many brave men; but the quarrel is ours,
          <lb/><persName>Miantonimoh</persName>. Come forth, let us fight together. If you

          <lb/>destroy me, my men shall be yours; if you fall, yours
          <lb/>shall be mine.</said></p>
          <p>The haughty king of the <name>Narragansetts</name> answered proud­
          <lb/>ly,—</p>
          <p><said>My men came to fight, and they shall fight.</said></p>
          <p>They fought and they were defeated. The vanquished
          <lb/>leader was taken prisoner by <persName>Uncas</persName>, who, contrary to the
          <lb/>expectations of his followers, restrained that rage of ven­
          <lb/>geance, which savages rank among their virtues. He led
          <lb/>his captive to <placeName>Hartford</placeName>, and delivered him to the justice of
          <lb/>the Colony, submitting his personal resentment to the
          <lb/>sanction of laws, which he acknowledged to be more wise
          <lb/>than his own. They decreed his death, on account of
          <lb/>many crimes, and restored the victim to his conquerer.
          <lb/><persName>Uncas</persName> returned with him to the spot where the battle was
          <lb/>fought, and when the carnage, which <persName>Miantonimoh</persName> had caus­
          <lb/>ed, was before his eyes, an <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> executioner cleft his head
          <lb/>with a hatchet. <persName>Uncas</persName>, having yielded so much to the
          <lb/>forms of justice, now testified some adherence to the sav­
          <lb/>age customs of his country; which, if fully observed,
          <lb/>would have demanded the torture of the criminal. Sev­
          <lb/>ering a piece of flesh from the shoulder of his lifeless ene­
          <lb/>my, he devoured it with expressions of triumph. The fal­
          <lb/>len monarch was then laid in a grave, over which a heap
          <lb/>of stones was raised, and the spot, which is a short dis­

          <lb/><placeName>Absalom's Dale</placeName>, from the pillar erected in remembrance
          <lb/>of that false prince.</p>
          <p>The character of <persName>Uncas</persName> comprehended many noble
          <lb/>properties. He was indignant at oppression, of invincible
          <lb/>valour, of inflexible friendship, careful of the lives of his
          <lb/>people with parental solicitude, possessing presence of
          <lb/>mind in danger, wisdom in council, and a <rs type="properAdjective">Spartan</rs> con­
          <lb/>tempt of personal hardship and suffering. The historians
          <lb/>of that age, who were accustomed to represent the na­
          <lb/>tives in shades of indisc<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">ri</unclear>minate blackness, have been
          <lb/>careful to give us the reverse of the picture. They assure
          <lb/>us that the wisdom, by which they profited, partook too
          <lb/>much of art and strategem to be worth of commendation.
          <lb/>They inform us that he was tyrannical, in his administration,
          <lb/>to the remnant of <name>Pequots</name> who were subjected to his do­
          <lb/>minion. This was undoubtedly true, yet <persName>William the Con­
          <lb/>queror</persName>, with all his superior advantages of education and
          <lb/><name>Christianity</name>, was more oppressive to his <rs type="properAdjective">Saxon</rs> vassals,
          <lb/>than this <rs type="properAdjective">Pagan</rs> king. They also accuse him of having
          <lb/>been inimical to the <rs type="properAdjective">Christian</rs> faith. Probably the inde­
          <lb/>pendent mind of the <name>Pagan</name> preferred the mythology in
          <lb/>which he had been nurtured, to the tenets of invaders,
          <lb/>who, however zealously they might point his race to an­
          <lb/>other world, evinced little disposition to leave them a
          <lb/>refuge in this. Possibly, he might have thought the in­
          <lb/>junctions of the Prince of Peace, not well interpreted by
          <lb/>the bloodshed that marked the steps of his followers.
          <lb/>Yet, under the pressure of age, and at the approach of

          <lb/>death, he pondered the terms of the gospel, which in his
          <lb/>better days, he had not appreciated, and felt the value of
          <lb/>that <quote>hope, which is an anchor to the soul.</quote> Like the
          <lb/>patriarch <persName>Joseph</persName>, he <quote>gave commandment concerning his
          <lb/>bones.</quote> He had selected, during health, a spot for his
          <lb/>interment; and his dying request was, that all the royal
          <lb/>family might be laid in the same sepulchre. His people
          <lb/>revered the injunction of their deceased king, and con­
          <lb/>tinued to lay his descendants in that hallowed ground,
          <lb/>until the royal line became extinct. It is situated within
          <lb/>the town of <placeName>N――</placeName>, about seven miles from the common
          <lb/>burial place of <name>Mohegan</name>.</p>
          <p><persName>Uncas</persName> was succeeded by his son <persName>Owaneco</persName>, commonly
          <lb/>called <persName>Oneco</persName>, who continued a faithful ally of our fathers,
          <lb/>during the wars with <persName>Philip</persName>, when the destruction of the
          <lb/>colony was attempted by more than 3000 warriors. On
          <lb/>the <date when="1671-12-09">9th of <name>December</name>, 1671</date>, when <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> and <placeName>Con­
          <lb/>necticut</placeName> hazarded a battle with <persName>Philip</persName>, and the combined
          <lb/>force of the <name>Nipmucks</name> and <name>Narragansetts</name>, <persName>Oneco</persName> accom­
          <lb/>panied them with 300 warriors.</p>
          <p>They endured without complaint; the hardships of a
          <lb/>march at that inclement season, and displayed the same
          <lb/>firmness in the cause of another, which the whites evinced
          <lb/>in their own. On their arrival where the enemy were em­
          <lb/>bodied, after sustaining a sharp conflict with an advanced
          <lb/>party, they found that the greatest part of the force was in
          <lb/>the fort with their king, in the centre of a morass. This
          <lb/>was ascertained to be of unusual height, great strength,

          <mw type="pageNum">44</mw>

          <lb/>and so artful a construction, that only one person could
          <lb/>enter it at a time without the utmost difficulty. The
          <lb/>troops, on approaching it, found themselves in a hazard­
          <lb/>ous situation, being seriously annoyed by the fire from
          <lb/>within the fortification, without the power of acting upon
          <lb/>the defensive. In the council of officers, held at this criti­
          <lb/>cal juncture, <persName>Oneco</persName> exclaimed, with all a hero's enthu­
          <lb/>siasm,—</p>
          <p><said>I will scale these walls. My people shall follow me.</said></p>
          <p>They assented with surprize and gratitude, and instant­
          <lb/>ly <persName>Oneco</persName>, with his bravest warriors, was seen at the top of
          <lb/>the fort. From hence they hurled their tomahawks, and
          <lb/>took deadly aim with their fire-arms, among the mass
          <lb/>within. In their steps ascended the intrepid <persName>Capt. Ma­
          <lb/>son</persName>, the first among the whites who hazarded so perilous
          <lb/>an adventure. Here he received his mortal wound, and
          <lb/>the troops from <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> who followed him, sustained
          <lb/>the heaviest share in the loss of that day. Six hours the
          <lb/>horrible contest continued. Through the huge logs of the
          <lb/>fort, blood streamed in torrents, and of the great numbers,
          <lb/>which it contained, scarcely 200 escaped.</p>
          <p><placeName>New-England</placeName>, that day, bewailed the death or wounds
          <lb/>of between 5 and 600 of her colonists, and of this loss
          <lb/>more than a fourth part was sustained by her faithful al­
          <lb/>lies, the <name>Mohegans</name>. Three hundred wounded men were
          <lb/>borne, by their companions, 16 miles to a place of safety,
          <lb/>on the day of this fatiguing battle. Many of these per­
          <lb/>ished, in consequence of a storm of snow, which rendered

          <lb/>the march almost impracticable; and 400 soldiers were
          <lb/>disabled from action by the severe cold. In all these
          <lb/>dangers and sufferings, <persName>Oneco</persName> never shrunk from his
          <lb/>friends, or refused any aid, which it was in his power to
          <lb/>offer. Sometime afterwards, in a conflict with the <name>Narra­
          <lb/>gansetts</name>, he rendered out ancestors essential aid, and by
          <lb/>his followers, the wily sachem, <persName>Cononchet</persName> was destroyed
          <lb/>in a river, where he had sought concealment. Again he
          <lb/>hazarded his life, and his people, in a battle, where the
          <lb/><name>Narragansetts</name>, led on by their queen, the wife of <persName>Philip</persName>,
          <lb/>were defeated, after displaying great valour. Until <date when="1675">1675</date>,
          <lb/>when the campaigns of <persName>Philip</persName> were terminated by his
          <lb/>death, <persName>Oneco</persName> continued to lead his men into every scene
          <lb/>of danger, which threatened his allies. Frequently un­
          <lb/>noticed, and usually unrewarded, he suffered nothing to
          <lb/>shake the constancy of his friendship, or to induce diso­
          <lb/>bedience to the command of his deceased father, never
          <lb/>to swerve from his oath to the <name>English</name>. When the <rs type="properAdjective">Ma­
          <lb/>chiavelian</rs> policy of <persName>Philip</persName> was ultimately defeated by
          <lb/>the undaunted <persName>Capt. Church</persName>, the head of that <quote>troubler
          <lb/>of <placeName>Israel</placeName>,</quote> was presented him by the warriors of <persName>Oneco</persName>,
          <lb/>who had drawn him from beneath the waters, where, like
          <lb/>the unfortunate <persName>Duke of <placeName>Monmouth</placeName></persName>, he had sought shel­
          <lb/>ter.</p>
          <p>The historians of that day, who were more accustomed

          <lb/>he was instrumental in preserving, let our national annals
          <lb/>bear witness. He died childless, and was succeeded by his
          <lb/>brother <persName>Joshua</persName>, a peaceful prince, who is scarcely men­
          <lb/>tioned in the records of that age, except as executing
          <lb/>deeds for the conveyance of lands to the <name>English</name>. As
          <lb/>soon as they obtained respite from war, the same spirit,
          <lb/>which incited the more southern settlers to search for gold,

          <lb/>blood, who by their laws is permitted to take the life of
          <lb/>the murderer, slew the young prince ere he was crowned.
          <lb/><persName>Uncas</persName>, then hoary with age, deeply regretted the loss of
          <lb/>his favourite son, but was too wise to complain of the
          <lb/>ancient laws of his tribe. Covering his face, for a short
          <lb/>time, to conceal the anguish of a parent for his first-born,
          <lb/>he again raised his eyes, and said with an unmoved coun­
          <lb/>tenance,—</p>
          <p><said>It is well, my people. Let him be carried to his
          <lb/>grave.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Joshua</persName> was succeeded by the brother-kings, <persName>Benjamin</persName>
          <lb/>and <persName>Samuel</persName>. The first being the eldest, had the right to
          <lb/>reign, and was saluted by the nation as its sovereign.

          <lb/>The younger, manifesting a more pliant disposition to the
          <lb/>will of the colonists, was supported by them. He adopt­
          <lb/>ed a military dress, and was fond of the customs and
          <lb/>conversation of the whites. The elder, strong in native
          <lb/>eloquence, drew around him the strength of his tribe.
          <lb/>Like <persName>Cyrus</persName> and <persName>Artaxerxes</persName>, the rival monarchs of <placeName>Persia</placeName>,
          <lb/>separate interests awoke their ambition, yet not like them
          <lb/>did they lift their hand against each other in battle. Kindred
          <lb/>blood restrained the animosity which their partizans would
          <lb/>fain have fomented; and their example is a reproof to
          <lb/>more civilized combatants, who can not only forget that
          <lb/>they had but one father, but even that <quote>one God created
          <lb/>them.</quote> At length the elder king paid the debt of nature,
          <lb/>and though he had been wise and humane, yet among the
          <lb/>adherents of his brother was no mourning. But death,
          <lb/>as if determining that the grief should be general, smote
          <lb/>the younger also, and they reposed in one grave. On
          <lb/>the tomb-stone of the favourite of our ancestors, the fol­
          <lb/>lowing epitaph was inscribed. It was the production of
          <lb/>a late celebrated physician of <placeName>N――</placeName>, whose memory is em­
          <lb/>balmed by excellence and piety, more than by his poeti­
          <lb/>cal talents.

          <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">It</hi> has been mentioned that the tribe of natives, whose
          <lb/>traditions we have partially gathered, retained amid its
          <lb/>degeneracy, some individuals worthy of being rescued
          <lb/>from oblivion. Among these, history has been most
          <lb/>faithful in preserving the lineaments of their spiritual
          <lb/>guide, the <persName>Rev. Samson Occom</persName>. He received instruction
          <lb/>in the sciences and in the <rs type="properAdjective">Christian</rs> faith, from the <persName>Rev.
          <lb/>E. Wheelock</persName>, afterwards President of <orgName>Dartmouth College</orgName>.
          <lb/>The sympathies of this excellent man were aroused by
          <lb/>the ignorance of a race, at once rapidly vanishing, and
          <lb/>miserably despised. Regardless of the censure which
          <lb/>stamped him as an enthusiast, and a visionary, he com­
          <lb/>menced a school for them in <placeName>Lebanon, (Connecticut,)</placeName>
          <lb/>about the middle of the eighteenth century, and by his
          <lb/>disinterested efforts for their improvement and salvation,
          <lb/>deserves an illustrious rank among <rs type="properAdjective">Christian</rs> philanthro­
          <lb/>pists. <persName>Occom</persName> was his first pupil, and his intellectual ad­
          <lb/>vances, and genuine piety, compensated the labours of
          <lb/>his revered instructor. After a residence of several years
          <lb/>in the family of his benefactor, he became the teacher of
          <lb/>a school on <placeName>Long Island</placeName>, and endeavoured to impart the

          <lb/>rudiments of divine truth, to the <rs type="properAdjective">Montauk</rs> tribe, who were
          <lb/>in his vicinity. His piety, and correct deportment pro­
          <lb/>cured for him a license to preach the gospel to his be­
          <lb/>nighted brethren. He travelled through various tribes,
          <lb/>enduring the hardships of a missionary, and faithfully
          <lb/>doing the work of an evangelist. His eloquence, par­
          <lb/>ticularly in his native language, was very impressive, and
          <lb/>his discourses in <name>English</name> were well received, from the
          <lb/>pulpits of the largest and most polished congregations in
          <lb/>the <placeName>United States</placeName>. In <date when="1765">1765</date>, he crossed the <placeName>Atlantic</placeName>, and
          <lb/>was welcomed in <placeName>England</placeName>, with a combination of strong
          <lb/>curiosity, and ardent benevolence, which were highly grat­
          <lb/>ifying to him. Here his mind was enlarged by extensive
          <lb/>intercourse with the wise and the good, with some of
          <lb/>whom he continued to maintain a correspondence through­
          <lb/>out life. At his return, he commenced the discharge of the
          <lb/>duties of his station, with increased ardour, and an inter­
          <lb/>esting humility. He delighted much in devotional poet­
          <lb/>ry, and presented a volume of hymns, selected by himself,
          <lb/>to his <rs type="properAdjective">American</rs> brethren, which together with the let­
          <lb/>ters which are preserved, evince his correct knowledge
          <lb/>of our language, and the predominance of religious senti­
          <lb/>ments in his mind. His residence was not stationary until
          <lb/>near the close of his life, but at the period of this sketch,
          <lb/>he was with his brethren of the <rs type="properAdjective">Mohegan</rs> tribe. They
          <lb/>listened to his instructions with awe, and regarded him
          <lb/>with affectionate interest. When in explaining to them
          <lb/>the sufferings of a Saviour, his eyes would overflow, and

          <lb/>a more than earthly fervour pervade his features and ex­
          <lb/>pressions, they felt convinced that he loved what he im­
          <lb/>parted, and honoured his sincerity. But when he enforced
          <lb/>the wrath of the Almighty against impenitence, his tones
          <lb/>rising with his theme, the terrours of the law bursting
          <lb/>from his lips, they forgot the lowliness of his station, the
          <lb/>subdued meekness of his character, and trembled as if
          <lb/>they had heard rising among the mountains, the voice of
          <lb/>the Eternal Spirit.</p>
          <p><persName>Robert Ashbow</persName> was the chieftain, the counsellor of the
          <lb/>tribe. Descended from the royal family, he was tenacious
          <lb/>of  that shadowy honour; yet he who might decry such an
          <lb/>empty distinction, could not long scan him, without per­
          <lb/>ceiving that nature had enrolled him among her nobility.
          <lb/>She had endued him with a noble form, and an eye,
          <lb/>whose glance seemed to penetrate the secrets of the soul.
          <lb/>His lofty forehead spoke the language of command, though
          <lb/>his countenance when at rest wore a cast of gravity,
          <lb/>even to melancholy, as if his habitual musings were among
          <lb/>the broken images of other days. Yet his kindling brow,
          <lb/>and the curl of his strongly compressed lip could testify
          <lb/>the fiery enthusiasm of eloquence, or the most terrible
          <lb/>emotions of anger. Some acquaintance with books had
          <lb/>aided the vigour of his intellect, and he was fond of asso­
          <lb/>ciating with the better class of whites, because he could
          <lb/>thus gratify his thirst for knowledge. When the general
          <lb/>government of the states had become settled upon a per­
          <lb/>manent foundation, <persName>Robert Ashbow</persName> was permitted to

          <lb/>represent his people in the council of the nation, and re­
          <lb/>ceived from some of the most distinguished Senators,
          <lb/>proofs that his talents were duly estimated, and his opin­
          <lb/>ions honoured. In religion, he was somewhat more than a
          <lb/>skeptick, and less than a believer. He was familiar with
          <lb/>the language of scripture, and assented to the excellence
          <lb/>of its precepts, yet was perplexed at the division of faith
          <lb/>from practice, which he beheld in many who professed to
          <lb/>obey it. His adorations of the Great Spirit were stated and
          <lb/>reverential. On the death of the Son of God for man, and
          <lb/>on the nature of the gospel breathing peace, and good­
          <lb/>will, he reflected with awe, and admiration, but he suffer­
          <lb/>ed his reasoning powers to be perplexed with the faults, the
          <lb/>crimes of <name>Christians</name>. Perhaps also, the command <quote>to
          <lb/>love our enemies</quote>, interfered too palpably with his code
          <lb/>of honour, or with that spirit of revenge, which his proud
          <lb/>soul had been taught to nourish as a virtue.</p>
          <p><persName>John Cooper</persName> deserves also to be mentioned, were it
          <lb/>only because he was the most wealthy man in his tribe.
          <lb/>It would be unpardonable to forget this distinction, in a
          <lb/>country like ours, where wealth so often supplies the
          <lb/>place of every other ground of merit; and where it is un­
          <lb/>derstood by the body of the people, if not literally the
          <lb/><quote>one thing needful,</quote> yet the best illustration of what is
          <lb/>shadowed forth in scripture, as the <quote>pearl of great price,</quote>
          <lb/>which the wise merchantman will <emph>sell all</emph> to obtain.</p>
          <p>The habitation of <persName>John</persName> bore no external marks of splen­
          <lb/>dour, but beside a numerous household, his jurisdiction

          <lb/>extended over a yoke of oxen, two cows, and sundry swine,
          <lb/>riches heretofore unknown among the unambitious sons of
          <lb/><name>Mohegan</name>.</p>
          <p>He was also a patient, and comparatively skilful agri­
          <lb/>culturalist. He had a supply of the implements of hus­
          <lb/>bandry, for himself and sons, and availed himself of the
          <lb/>labours of the plough, which his countrymen, either from
          <lb/>dislike of toil, or jealousy at innovation, too generally
          <lb/>neglected. The corn of <persName>John Cooper</persName> might be known
          <lb/>from that of his neighbours, by its tall, regular ranks,
          <lb/>and more abundant sheaves. Its interstices were fill­
          <lb/>ed with the yellow pumpkin, and the green crooked-
          <lb/>neck'd squash, and its borders adorned with the prolific
          <lb/>field bean. A large stack of hay furnished the winter
          <lb/>food of his animals, as he had not yet aspired to the luxu­
          <lb/>ry of a barn. He was regarded by some of his brethren
          <lb/>with a suspicious eye; not that they envied his possessions,
          <lb/>for <emph>they</emph> had not learned to place wealth <emph>first</emph> on the list
          <lb/>of virtues. But they imagined that he approximated too
          <lb/>closely to the habits of white men, whom if they regard­
          <lb/>ed as friends, they could not wholly forget had been
          <lb/>invaders. They conceived poverty to be less degrading
          <lb/>than daily toil, and thought <emph>he</emph> could not be a true <name>Indian</name>,
          <lb/>who would not prefer the privations of one, to the slavery
          <lb/>of the other. But <persName>John</persName> found patient industry favourable
          <lb/>not only to his condition but to his character. His regular
          <lb/>supply of necessary articles removed those temptations to
          <lb/>intemperance, which arise from the alternation of famine

          <lb/>and profusion. Labour prompted his health, and provi­
          <lb/>dence of comforts for his family inspired a soothing self
          <lb/>satisfaction. His untutored mind also found the connex­
          <lb/>ion, which has been thought to exist between agriculture
          <lb/>and natural religion. While committing his seed to the
          <lb/>earth, he thought of Him who made both the earth and her
          <lb/>son who feeds upon her bosom. He remembered that all
          <lb/>his toil would be fruitless, unless that Great Spirit should
          <lb/>give his smile to the sun, and to the rain that matured the
          <lb/>harvest. Softened by such contemplations, his heart be­
          <lb/>came prepared for the truths of revealed religion. <persName>Mr.
          <lb/>Occom</persName> found him a docile student in the school of his Sa­
          <lb/>viour, and imparted to him with delight the knowledge of
          <lb/>the word that bringeth salvation. The husbandman sub­
          <lb/>mitted himself to the teaching of the Spirit, and embraced
          <lb/>the <rs type="properAdjective">Christian</rs> faith. His employment became dearer than
          <lb/>ever, and he was continually drawing from its spiritual em­
          <lb/>blems, to animate gratitude, or to deepen humility. When
          <lb/>subjecting to cultivation an unbroken piece of ground, the
          <lb/>brambles which invested it, would remind him of the
          <lb/>spontaneous vices of the unrenovated heart. <said>Their end
          <lb/>is to be burned,</said> he would say internally, <said>and such had
          <lb/>been mine, but for thy mercy, my God.</said> The pure
          <lb/>spring that gave refreshment to his weariness, restored to
          <lb/>his thought <quote>that fountain, which cleanseth from sin, and
          <lb/>of which he who drinketh shall thirst no more.</quote> In the
          <lb/>storm which frustrated his hopes, he traced the wisdom of
          <lb/>Him, who giveth not account of his ways unto man, but

          <lb/>from the cloud sendeth forth the bow of promise to renew
          <lb/>his trust, and the sunbeam to cheer his toil. In the cul­
          <lb/>tured fields, clothed with their various garb, he perceiv­
          <lb/>ed an emblem of the righteous man, bringing forth good
          <lb/>fruits, out of faith unfeigned: in the harvest bowing to the
          <lb/>reaper, he beheld him ready to be gathered into the gar­
          <lb/>ner of eternal life. Thus increasing in knowledge and,
          <lb/>piety, <persName>Mr. Occom</persName> considered him an useful assistant in his
          <lb/>stated instructions to the people and thought of commit­
          <lb/>ting them to his spiritual charge, when he was compelled
          <lb/>to be absent. But though they acknowledged that what
          <lb/><persName>John Cooper</persName> said of religion was well, and his prayers to
          <lb/>the Great Spirit sufficiently long, it was evident that he
          <lb/>did not possess their entire confidence, and some of them
          <lb/>could not refrain from saying, that they <said>never yet saw
          <lb/>an <name>Indian</name> so eager after both worlds.</said> Near the dwelling
          <lb/>of <persName>John</persName> was that of <persName>Arrowhamet</persName> the warrior, or <persName>Zachary</persName>
          <lb/>as he was familiarly called, by the name of his baptism.
          <lb/>Tall, erect and muscular, he seemed to defy the ravages
          <lb/>of time, though the records of his memory proved, that
          <lb/>seventy winters had passed over him. He had borne a
          <lb/>part in the severe campaign, which preceded the defeat of
          <lb/><persName>Braddock</persName>, and shared the hardships of the war of revolu­
          <lb/>tion, as the firm friend of the <name>Americans</name>. The tacitur­
          <lb/>nity of his nation prevented that garrulous recitation of
          <lb/>the minutiæ of his drama, to which aged soldiers are
          <lb/>often addicted; but sometimes, when induced to speak
          <lb/>of his battles, his flashing eye, and lofty form rising still

          <lb/>more high, attested his military enthusiasm. His wife,
          <lb/><persName>Martha</persName>, who with him had embraced the <rs type="properAdjective">Christian</rs> reli­
          <lb/>gion, was a descendant of the departed royalty of <name>Mohe­
          <lb/>gan</name>. Their attachment for each other was strong, and
          <lb/>exemplified on his part, by more of courteousness, on hers
          <lb/>by more of affectionate expression, than was common to
          <lb/>the reserve of their nation. Their tenement consisted of
          <lb/>two rooms, with a shed in the rear, for the deposite of
          <lb/>tools, or the rougher household utensils.</p>
          <p>It was encompassed with a little garden of herbs and veg­
          <lb/>etables, and the whole wore an unusual aspect of neatness
          <lb/>and comfort. But a mysterious personage had been ad­
          <lb/>ded to that family, which had not within the memory of
          <lb/>the young, comprised but <persName>Zachary</persName> and <persName>Martha</persName>. More
          <lb/>than two years had elapsed, since a female had been
          <lb/>observed to share their shelter, and to sit at their board.
          <lb/>The <name>Indians</name> had remarked with surprise that she was of
          <lb/>the race of the whites, young, and apparently in ill health,
          <lb/>as she never quitted the mansion. They at first had testi­
          <lb/>fied some disgust, but as in their visits to the old warrior
          <lb/>and his companion, she had always looked mildly on
          <lb/>them, and spoken gently, they came to the conclusion,
          <lb/>that <said>the pale squaw was <foreign xml:lang="mof">wauregan</foreign>,</said> or good. Any in­
          <lb/>quiry respecting the guest was uniformly answered,—
          <lb/><said>She is our daughter;</said> and perceiving that their friends
          <lb/>did not wish to be pressed on the subject, they resigned

          <p>The <name>Indian</name> possesses in such respects a native polite­
          <lb/>ness, which might sometimes be a salutary model to
          <lb/>more civilized communities. It is an accomplishment
          <lb/>which their neighbours of <rs type="properAdjective">Yankee</rs> origin might however
          <lb/>be slow in acquiring. They seem to have elevated into a
          <lb/>virtue, that close inspection of the concerns of their neigh­
          <lb/>bour, which almost always precludes attention to their own, and
          <lb/>doubtless think that their knowledge of the contents of his cel­
          <lb/>lar and garret, the management of his kitchen, the gene­
          <lb/>alogy of his guests, and his secrets so far as they might be
          <lb/>ascertained, a suitable employment for those who are
          <lb/>commanded to love their neighbour as themselves.</p>
          <p>It might have been remarked, however, that since the
          <lb/>arrival of this stranger; the dress of old <persName>Zachary</persName> was ar­
          <lb/>ranged with a more scrupulous attention to neatness. No
          <lb/>rents were observed in any part of his apparel, and where
          <lb/>they threatened to make their appearance, the delicate
          <lb/>stitches of no untaught needle might be traced. The
          <lb/>broad gold band, which had been the present of an officer,
          <lb/>as a testimony of valour, was now constantly worn upon
          <lb/>his well-brush'd hat; and old <persName>Martha</persName> was arrayed every
          <lb/>afternoon in a plain black silk gown, made in a very
          <lb/>proper and becoming manner. The interiour of the hum­
          <lb/>ble house evinced the daily use of the broom, and near
          <lb/>its door two bee-hives, ranged upon a rough bench, sent
          <lb/>forth the cheerful hum of industry. Beds of thyme and
          <lb/>sage lent their aromatic essence to the winged throng,
          <lb/>which might be seen settling upon them with intense

          <lb/>pleasure, in the earliest ray of the morning sun. The de­
          <lb/>partment of medicinal herbs was gradually enlarged, as
          <lb/>they were found to promote the comfort of the drooping in­
          <lb/>mate, and <persName>Martha</persName> had become too old to seek them as
          <lb/>she was wont in the woods. She busied herself frequent­
          <lb/>ly in the construction of work-baskets, whose smooth
          <lb/>compartments displayed the light touches of a pencil, to
          <lb/>whose delicacy the natives laid no claim. The zeal of
          <lb/>these hospitable beings to promote the accomodation of
          <lb/>their guest was very remarkable. <persName>Zachary</persName> would push
          <lb/>his rude boat into the distant waters, that he might obtain
          <lb/>supplies of those fish which were accounted most rare, or of
          <lb/>such oysters as might allure the appetite of an invalid.
          <lb/>When he carried to the market articles of domestic manu­
          <lb/>facture, he never returned without having expended some
          <lb/>portion of his little gains, in the purchase of a few crack­
          <lb/>ers, or a small quantity of wheat flour, or perhaps some
          <lb/>of the tropical subacid fruits, which are so grateful to
          <lb/>the parched lip on the sufferer from febrile disease.
          <lb/><persName>Martha</persName> brought with maternal tenderness, the morning
          <lb/>draught of milk warm from the cow, who in her rude
          <lb/>tenement in the rear of the building quietly ruminated.
          <lb/>She would present also on a clean wooden plate, a dessert
          <lb/>from her bee-hive, for the knowledge of whose manage­
          <lb/>ment, she was indebted to the gentle being on whom her
          <lb/>care centered. She would also search the adjoining fields
          <lb/>for the first ripe strawberries, and whortleberries in their
          <lb/>season, and bring them in a little basket of green leaves,

          <lb/>that their freshness and fragrance might tempt the sick­
          <lb/>ening palate. An emaciated hand would receive these
          <lb/>gifts, and a face white as marble beam with a faint smile,
          <lb/>while a soft voice uttered, <said>I thank you Mother.</said> But
          <lb/>all seemed in vain, the lilly grew paler upon its stem,
          <lb/>and seemed likely to sink into the grave, lonely and beau­
          <lb/>tiful, with all its mysteriousness unrevealed.</p>
          <p>One more personage deserves to be noticed ere we
          <lb/>close this brief catalogue. <persName>Maurice</persName>, or as he was called
          <lb/>before his baptism <persName>Kehoran</persName>, was deemed by his country­
          <lb/>men the most singular of men. Yet so accustomed had
          <lb/>they become to his habits, that they almost ceased to be
          <lb/>an object of animadversion. Years had elapsed since he
          <lb/>withdrew himself from the residence of man, and became
          <lb/>the tenant of a cave, at the base of a rock, at a consider­
          <lb/>able distance from the principal settlement. Nature had
          <lb/>there formed an irregular apartment of about twenty feet
          <lb/>in length, and varying in height and breadth. Its aper­
          <lb/>ture, much below the stature of a man, was of a triangular
          <lb/>shape, and apparently made by the disruption of the
          <lb/>rock, which formed the roof of the cavern. It was par­
          <lb/>tially closed by rolling against it a large stone which was
          <lb/>found within, among other rubbish, which the hermit had
          <lb/>removed. Here <persName>Maurice</persName> dwelt, subsisting upon the roots
          <lb/>and berries, which the shaggy forest overhanging his roof
          <lb/>supplied, and quenching his thirst at a spring which ran
          <lb/>bubbling from the rocky height, and, gliding past his
          <lb/>door like a riband-snake, disappeared in the adjoining

          <mw type="pageNum">60</mw>

          <lb/>thicket. A bed of skins afforded him a place of repose,
          <lb/>and the severity of his life distressed even the natives,
          <lb/>who were accustomed to despise hardships and privation.
          <lb/><persName>Maurice</persName> was tall, and emaciated, clad in a rough man­
          <lb/>tle of skins, fastened round his loins with a strip of
          <lb/>bark. At a distance he might be taken for a miserable
          <lb/><name>Franciscan</name>, and as he approached, the crucifix always
          <lb/>borne around his neck, revealed the religion which he
          <lb/>professed. It was the general opinion that the terrible
          <lb/>penances which he endured, had been enjoined as an
          <lb/>expiation for some unknown crime. It was remembered
          <lb/>by the oldest inhabitants that he had been a warrior, and
          <lb/>a hunter of athletic frame, and keen eye. Now, when a
          <lb/>partridge rested near him, or a squirrel sprang from the
          <lb/>branch where he stood, he had been observed to raise his
          <lb/>arm involuntarily, as if to bend his bow, then dropping it
          <lb/>suddenly to exclaim, <said>No! No! there is blood enough
          <lb/>already.</said> His feet were bare, and often wounded by
          <lb/>thorns, and his white beard which he suffered not to be
          <lb/>cut, rested upon his breast. Every autumn he disap­
          <lb/>peared, and was no more seen, until the opening spring
          <lb/>permitted him to inhabit his cave, and resume his usual
          <lb/>regimen. It was at length understood, that in his inter­
          <lb/>vals of absence, he travelled to <placeName>Canada</placeName>, to visit the <name>Jesuit</name>
          <lb/>who converted him, and to become confirmed in the faith
          <lb/>which he had embraced. But the present winter he had
          <lb/>omitted this stated journey. Some fancied that his be­
          <lb/>loved instructor was dead, but the majority concluded

          <pb n="061"/><milestone unit="sig" n="6(1)r"/>
          <mw type="pageNum">61</mw>

          <lb/>that the infirmities of age precluded the hermit from the
          <lb/>fatigues of his pilgrimage. He was seen to guide his tot­
          <lb/>tering steps by a staff, and to look vacantly at surround­
          <lb/>ing objects, as if his eye was dim to their proportions.
          <lb/>The hair upon his head had become thin, and whiter than
          <lb/>silver, yet he defended it by no covering from the blast
          <lb/>or from the tempest. He now received with unwonted
          <lb/>kindness, additional clothing, or occasional food from his
          <lb/>countrymen, but if they offered him flesh, he would repel
          <lb/>it with disgust, saying, <said>it must never pass the lips of
          <lb/><persName>Maurice</persName>.</said> The benevolence of <persName>Mr. Occom</persName> was strong­
          <lb/>ly excited in his behalf. He visited him in his cell, re­
          <lb/>lieved his famine, and urged him to accept of a milder
          <lb/>faith and rely on the expiation of his Redeemer, and not
          <lb/>on the mortification of his frail, decaying body. He would
          <lb/>listen calmly to his discourses, but when he touched upon
          <lb/>any peculiar tenet of the <rs type="properAdjective">Roman</rs> church, would wave his
          <lb/>withered hand, with all its wasted energy, and exclaim
          <lb/><said>your way is not my way.</said></p>

          <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> charities of <persName>Madam L――</persName> had become proverb­
          <lb/>ial. Not only did the sufferers in her vicinity resort to
          <lb/>her under the pressure of calamity, but the roving beggar
          <lb/>trusted to find in her mansion, relief or shelter. These
          <lb/>mendicants, not being restrained at that period by the fear
          <lb/>of work-houses, were more numerous in proportion, and
          <lb/>vastly more at ease in their peregrinations than at the
          <lb/>present day. Although there were not among them, as in
          <lb/><placeName>England</placeName>, any selling of stands or circuits, fortunes se­
          <lb/>cretly amassed, or establishments which transformed the
          <lb/>gains of the day into nocturnal revels, where the cripple
          <lb/>danced, and the blind recovered their sight; yet there
          <lb/>existed that system of sympathetic intelligence, by which
          <lb/>the houses of the bountiful were seldom unvisited, or
          <lb/>those of the churl entered. <persName>Madam L――</persName>, being one day
          <lb/>summoned to the kitchen to receive a guest of that order,
          <lb/>was accosted in piteous tones by a man, who raised him­
          <lb/>self with difficulty by the aid of a staff upon one limb, while

          <lb/>the other was so bandaged that it seemed an useless ap­
          <lb/>pendage. This he said was disabled by a shot at the battle
          <lb/>of the <placeName>Eutaw Springs</placeName>, where, being left senseless on the
          <lb/>field, his head was dreadfully lacerated by the tomahawks
          <lb/>of the <name>Indians</name>. A swelling, and excoriation upon his arm,
          <lb/>which he also exhibited, he termed a <quote>Rose-Cancer.</quote>
          <lb/>Moved by such a combination of ills, and ever alive to
          <lb/>the sufferings of those who fought the battles of our revo­
          <lb/>lution, the Lady bestowed upon him alms, which rendered
          <lb/>him eloquent in thanksgiving, and ordered him some din­
          <lb/>ner. As she retired to her parlour, <persName>Cuff</persName> following said in
          <lb/>a suppressed voice, <said>He been here afore, Ma'am. He
          <lb/>no more lame, than I lame.</said></p>
          <p>Returning and scrutinizing him more closely as he par­
          <lb/>took of his repast, she recognized in his face, half covered
          <lb/>by the large cap which concealed his wound, some resem­
          <lb/>blance to a recent applicant. <said>Were you here, a short
          <lb/>time since?</said> she inquired. <said>No—God bless your soul,
          <lb/>Ma'am,</said> answered the man, rapidly. <said>I never see your
          <lb/>blessed face till this day,</said> regarding <persName>Cuff</persName> with eyes in­
          <lb/>flamed with anger. <persName>Beulah</persName> then spoke,—<said>three weeks
          <lb/>ago yesterday, he come here, walking on two legs, with­
          <lb/>out any hurt in his head, or Rose-Cancer.</said> <said>Put a spoon
          <lb/>in your calabash-mouth, and see if that will keep down
          <lb/>your false tongue,</said> said the beggar, in his hoarse, natural
          <lb/>voice; forgetting the melancholy notes, to which he at
          <lb/>first set his articulation. Hastily seizing the pack, from
          <lb/>which he had unharness'd himself, that he might more

          <lb/>easily take refreshment, he slipped the strap over his
          <lb/>neck with such an ill grace, as to dislodge the cap, which
          <lb/>he said he was obliged always to keep over his wound,
          <lb/>because the <said>air made it ache tormentedly.</said> This un­
          <lb/>fortunate occurrence discovered an unscalped head, with
          <lb/>a thick growth of hair. The wrinkles, with which he had
          <lb/>plaited his forehead, suddenly disappeared before the
          <lb/>emotion, which put disguise to flight; for, though proba­
          <lb/>bly long inured to dissimulation, he could not without
          <lb/>some compunction be stripped of his mask, in the presence
          <lb/>of abused goodness. <said>You are the man,</said> said the Lady
          <lb/>in a calm voice, <said>who, a short time since, requested
          <lb/>charity for a houseless wife and seven children, whose
          <lb/>little home, erected by your industry, was burnt at mid­
          <lb/>night. You wept, as you said, that your eldest daugh­
          <lb/>ter, who was sick, perished in the flames. Did you not
          <lb/>tell me the name of the village within the borders of <placeName>Mas­
          <lb/>sachusetts</placeName>, where your family remained, shelterless, and
          <lb/>that you were in haste to gain a little aid, that you might
          <lb/>return and comfort them?</said> To this mild appeal the dis­
          <lb/>sembler had no answer. He would have repelled anger
          <lb/>with imprudence, but undeserved gentleness silenced him.
          <lb/>Busying himself to collect his cap, hat and staff, he uncon­
          <lb/>sciously found his useless limb, very serviceable in facili­
          <lb/>tating his exit. <said>Fear not,</said> said the Lady, <said rend="post()">that I shall
          <lb/>reclaim the alms I have given you. But remember, though
          <lb/>you may sometimes deceive your fellow-creatures, there

          <lb/>like a consuming fire to all iniquity.</quote></said> Returning to her
          <lb/>parlour, she found her brother <persName>Dr. L――</persName>, waiting to make
          <lb/>her his daily visit. He was the only brother of her de­
          <lb/>ceased husband, and a few years younger than herself.
          <lb/>The residence of his family was opposite her own; and
          <lb/>the unrestrained intercourse, which had ever been main­
          <lb/>tained, greatly alleviated her loneliness. <persName>Dr. L――</persName> was
          <lb/>a man of great goodness of heart, and exemplary life.
          <lb/>Gentleness of manner, moderation in sentiment, and sin­
          <lb/>cere piety were his characteristicks. As he approached
          <lb/>the close of a long life, (for more than fourscore years
          <lb/>were allotted him,) benevolence became more and more
          <lb/>his distinguishing feature; as the stream expands more
          <lb/>widely, as it prepares to enter the bosom of that sea,
          <lb/>where its course terminates. Invariable temperance, and
          <lb/>a mind a stranger to those starts of passion which disorder
          <lb/>the wheels of existence, gave him an age of unbroken ac­
          <lb/>tivity and health; cheered by the sight of his children's
          <lb/>children, springing up like olive plants around his path.
          <lb/>He lived to see the eyes of this beloved sister closed in
          <lb/>death, when she had nearly attained fourscore years and
          <lb/>ten. The fraternal attachment, which had been nourish­
          <lb/>ed for more than half a century by the sympathies of daily
          <lb/>intercourse, did not fully reveal its strength, till its ties
          <lb/>were sundered. <quote>Bowing down, he walked heavily, as
          <lb/>one who mourneth for his mother,</quote>—and in two years
          <lb/>slumbered near her, beneath the clods of the valley.</p>
          <p>At the period of this sketch, he was in his grand climac­

          <mw type="pageNum">67</mw>

          <lb/>terick, with a florid brow, and a step like youthful agility.
          <lb/>He was of small stature, and correct proportions, and in
          <lb/>his attire preserved those ancient fashions, which were
          <lb/>then thought to give consistency and dignity to the form
          <lb/>which time had honoured. A white, full bottomed wig,
          <lb/>beautifully curled, shaded his venerable brow. This was
          <lb/>surmounted by a low-crowned three-cornered hat, or, dur­
          <lb/>ing his favourite rides on horseback, by one with a deep
          <lb/>brim, to afford shelter to the eyes. His nicely plaited
          <lb/>stock, long waistcoat, and silver buckles, never yielded to
          <lb/>modern innovations; and the neatness, which distinguished
          <lb/>his dress, extended through his mansion, and its precincts.
          <lb/>It also pervaded every branch of the domestic depart­
          <lb/>ment, and like the spirit of order, promised to be an heir­
          <lb/>loom to his family. Such was the person to whom <persName>Mad­
          <lb/>am L――</persName>, with the freedom of sisterly intercourse, re­
          <lb/>lated the adventure which had just occurred in her kitch­
          <lb/>en. <said>I have long wished,</said> he remarked, <said>for an op­
          <lb/>portunity to converse with you on this subject. I believe
          <lb/>that you are often deceived by those who solicit your
          <lb/>charity. The good are not easily suspicious, and the
          <lb/>wicked take advantage of it.</said></p>
          <p><said>I know brother,</said> she replied, <said>that I have sometimes
          <lb/>given to the unworthy. The occurrence of to-day is by
          <lb/>no means a solitary one. Yet how can we always dis­
          <lb/>criminate, unless we could read the heart? That suspi­

          <lb/>another. I have thought that while <emph>our</emph> reliance was upon
          <lb/>a Benefactor, <quote>kind to the unthankful and evil,</quote> we ought
          <lb/>not to hold, with too strict a hand, the balance of merit,
          <lb/>when we hear the complaint of misery. I cannot find that
          <lb/>our Saviour hath said <quote rend="pre(‘)post(’)">Relieve <emph>only</emph> the <emph>righteous</emph>,</quote>, but
          <lb/><quote>the poor ye have <emph>always</emph> with you, and <emph>whenever ye
          <lb/>will</emph> ye may do them good.</quote> Does he not almost make
          <lb/>them His substitute? <quote><emph>me</emph> ye have not always,</quote>—as if
          <lb/><emph>they</emph> were to furnish proof of our compassion, when He
          <lb/>should be raised above the ills of humanity? When I
          <lb/>have thus reflected on this passage, I have felt that I had
          <lb/>rather relieve ten unworthy claimants, than to neglect one
          <lb/>suffering servant of my Lord.</said></p>
          <p><said>These sentiments,</said> said <persName>Dr. L――</persName>, <said>might be ex­
          <lb/>pected from the benevolence of your heart. Yet while
          <lb/>we indulge in charitable feelings, we should be careful
          <lb/>not to reward deceit, or cherish vice. We are command­
          <lb/>ed not <quote>to do evil that good may come?</quote> Is it not pos­
          <lb/>sible that, from a zeal to do good, evil may arise? It is
          <lb/>always safe to give food to the hungry, and clothing to the
          <lb/>naked, and kind words to him who is of a heavy heart.
          <lb/>But the indiscriminate gift of money enables the drunkard
          <lb/>to repeat his sin, and the indolent to become more vi­
          <lb/>cious. Benevolence is blessed in itself, but it must be
          <lb/>associated with discretion, ere it can confer blessings on
          <lb/>others. The science of medicine is salutary, but if the
          <lb/>physician use but one remedy for every disease, he will
          <lb/>sometimes occasion death. Yet I would not speak as if

          <lb/>you alone were liable to deception from those who solicit
          <lb/>charity. It is but a short time since a young man brought
          <lb/>to my house a paper, signed by several persons, de­
          <lb/>claring him to be deaf and dumb from his birth. His
          <lb/>conduct comported with this declaration. His questions
          <lb/>were unintelligible to me, and his eye possessed that
          <lb/>earnest, inquiring gaze, which characterizes that interest­
          <lb/>ing, and unfortunate race. Affected at the lot of a being,
          <lb/>cut off from all the privileges and joys of society, I was
          <lb/>preparing to impart liberally to his wants. My wife,
          <lb/>regarding him with a penetrating look, said <said>she had no
          <lb/>doubt he was an imposter, who could hear and speak as
          <lb/>well as any of us.</said> He could not avoid turning his head
          <lb/>as if to listen, and, more moved by resentment than good
          <lb/>manners, answered <said rend="post()">You lie!</said></said></p>
          <p><said>What,</said> inquired the Lady, <said>do you consider the best
          <lb/>method of doing good, with the least possible harm?</said>
          <lb/><said>Undoubtedly, that of relieving the poor, through their own
          <lb/>industry,</said> he answered. <said>Thus, instead of the degrada­
          <lb/>tion of beggary, you elevate their character, with the con­
          <lb/>sciousness of a right improvement of time. If they are
          <lb/>addicted to vices, you diminish their strength, by destroy­
          <lb/>ing indolence. You dry up the streams, by choking the
          <lb/>fountain. A <name>Christian</name> should seek not merely to relieve
          <lb/>bodily want, but to elevate moral character. If you sup­
          <lb/>port the children of an intemperate man, you take from him
          <lb/>the strongest possible motive to reformation and industry.
          <lb/>In those countries where establishments for the indigent

          <pb n="070"/><milestone unit="sig" n="6(5)v"/>
          <mw type="pageNum">70</mw>

          <lb/>have been the most abundant, charity has at length discov­
          <lb/>ered, that the way to multiply the poor, is to provide for the
          <lb/>poor; or in other words to destroy their motives of action.</said></p>
          <p><said>Your theory, my brother, no one can question; the
          <lb/>difficulty seems in reducing it to practice. The sick,
          <lb/>and the infant must ever be an exception, and those also,
          <lb/>who devote themselves to their comfort. The class of
          <lb/>roving mendicants would also evade it, until the commu­
          <lb/>nity shall be so impressed as to erect houses for their
          <lb/>restraint and labour. To the families of the poor, who
          <lb/>have health, it applies itself, as the most natural, and
          <lb/>efficacious system of relief. I have ever found wool and
          <lb/>flax gladly received, and wrought by poor, virtuous
          <lb/>females. Their children can assist them in some parts of
          <lb/>the toil, and thus industrious habits are implanted, where
          <lb/>otherwise a vagrant idleness might take root. When these
          <lb/>domestic manufactures have exceeded my own wants, I
          <lb/>have sometimes disposed of them at reduced prices among
          <lb/>those who have wrought them. Thus their families are
          <lb/>clad in durable materials, instead of those insufficient
          <lb/>fabrics, which the poor often purchase for the sake of
          <lb/>cheapness, but which vanish long before one inclement
          <lb/>season has past. I have usually found it expedient not to
          <lb/>render them payment in money, but in those articles
          <lb/>which are necessary to comfortable subsistence; for I
          <lb/>believe the cause of poverty will often be found to exist
          <lb/>in the destitution of that economy, which warns against
          <lb/>spending the little <quote>all for that which is not bread, and

          <pb n="071"/><milestone unit="sig" n="6(6)r"/>

          <lb/>the labour for that which satisfieth not.</quote> This system of
          <lb/>charity creates such an intimacy and freedom of detail,
          <lb/>that opportunities are discovered, where medicines for
          <lb/>sickness, and books for children may be distributed with
          <lb/>great advantage.</said> <said>This laborious system, have you then
          <lb/>been pursuing, so silently that I had not discovered it?</said>
          <lb/>said her brother. <said rend="pre(“)post()">What I began for a reproof ends as
          <lb/>usual in the commendation, that, <quote rend="post()">many daughters have
          <lb/>done virtuously, but thou still excellest.</quote></said> <said rend="post()">I pray you,</said>
          <lb/>answered the Lady, <said rend="pre()">to mention nothing of what I have
          <lb/>imparted to you. The detail was given merely for the
          <lb/>sake of the inference, that the system was too extensive
          <lb/>for an individual. To be rendered effectual, it should be
          <lb/>supported, by an association of the charitable. It ought
          <lb/>to comprise a warehouse, where materials for labour
          <lb/>should be furnished, the manufactures exposed for sale,
          <lb/>and a stock of articles kept, suitable to be rendered in
          <lb/>payment. This should be superintended by the directors
          <lb/>of the institution; and a poor, and pious widow, might
          <lb/>receive a salary for attending in it. A collection of such
          <lb/>medicines, as might be administered safely without appli­
          <lb/>cation to a physician, might also be connected with it, and
          <lb/>would often prevent serious sickness in those, whose
          <lb/><choice><sic>strengh</sic><corr>strength</corr></choice> is put in daily requisition, without the power of
          <lb/>obtaining necessary cordials. Books of instruction for
          <lb/>children, and of consolation for the aged and sorrowful,
          <lb/>should also be kept for gratuitous distribution. I have
          <lb/>thought that a Charity School, if it were kept but on <name>Sat­

          <mw type="pageNum">72</mw>

          <lb/>urday</name> afternoons, might give opportunity of teaching many
          <lb/>valuable precepts to the children of those who laboured in
          <lb/>this institution. It might at least then be ascertained how
          <lb/>they had passed their time during the week, and if they
          <lb/>were prepared to attend in a proper manner, the exercises
          <lb/>of the approaching <name>Sabbath</name>.</said></p>
          <p><said>The great objection to this excellent system,</said> said
          <lb/><persName>Dr. L――</persName>, <said>will be found in the love of ease. The rich
          <lb/>had generally rather satisfy the poor, and their own con­
          <lb/>sciences, at the least expense of time and thought. These
          <lb/>objects are accomplished by the gift of money, and a
          <lb/>claim to the title of bountiful is thus easily procured.
          <lb/>This mode of relief involves no troublesome inquiry into
          <lb/>the sources of want-no difficult, and perhaps abortive
          <lb/>attempt to awaken industry. To the actings of this indo­
          <lb/>lent spirit, we ae all more or less prone. This moves
          <lb/>us even in the education of our children, to overlook in­
          <lb/>stead of exterminating the ramifications of evil, and to
          <lb/>cover an injury, which will probably affect them through­
          <lb/>out the whole of life, with the soft name of affectionate
          <lb/>indulgence.</said></p>
          <p>Their conversation was interrupted by a low rap at the
          <lb/>door, and the entrance of a woman apparently in humble
          <lb/>life. A cloak of homemade cloth covered a form whose
          <lb/>size promised great strength; and a decent black bonnet
          <lb/>partially concealed a face, where health and an expression
          <lb/>of cheerful contentment reigned. <said>I have brought home
          <lb/>Ma'am,</said> she said <said>the rest of the yarn which you wish­

          <lb/>very glad to take it.</said>—<said>Sit down <persName>Mrs. Rawson</persName>,</said> said
          <lb/><persName>Madam L――</persName>. <said>You never seem to be tired, while any
          <lb/>work remains. Have you walked three miles this cold,
          <lb/>unpleasant day?</said>—<said>Any body who is strong, and well,
          <lb/>need not complain of walking a few miles, Ma'am. Some
          <lb/>part of the way is rather wet, but since I've been able
          <lb/>through your help to get such a pair of strong shoes, I
          <lb/>don't mind any sort of walking. What a blessed thing it
          <lb/>is, when the hearts of the rich are turned to give work to
          <lb/>the poor, and assist them to get the necessaries of life, for
          <lb/>themselves and families.</said></p>
          <p><said>Heaven,</said> said <persName>Dr. L――</persName>, <said>helps those who are wil­
          <lb/>ling to help themselves. Have you any children, good
          <lb/>woman?</said>—<said>O yes sir. God be thanked. What a lonely
          <lb/>creature I should be without them<choice><sic/><corr>.</corr></choice> We live almost a mile
          <lb/>from any neighbour, and they are company and comfort
          <lb/>to me. Some folks blame me, because I don't put them
          <lb/>to service. But there are only two of them, and they're
          <lb/>very serviceable to me. The boy is twelve years old,
          <lb/>and he takes care of the little spot of garden that we have,
          <lb/>and raises vegetables, and cuts my wood inn the winter,
          <lb/>and when he can work out a day or two, with the farmers,
          <lb/>he's willing and thankful to do it, to get a little provision
          <lb/>for me, or help pay my rent. The girl is two years
          <lb/>younger, and does the <mcr rend="slant(italic)">chores</mcr> while I spin. She takes to
          <lb/>the wheel too, herself, as natural as a duck runs to the
          <lb/>water. My eldest son wanted to follow the seas like his

          <lb/>father. It was a trial to me, but I remembered that he
          <lb/>had the same protector on the water, as on the land.
          <lb/>When he went away, he said—<said>Mother, keep up a good
          <lb/>heart. I shall come back, and bring you something to
          <lb/>help you along.</said> Oh! with what delight I used then to
          <lb/>read the <bibl><regMe>107th Psalm</regMe></bibl>, which speaks of them <quote>that go
          <lb/>down to the sea in ships; to do business in the great
          <lb/>waters, how they see the works of the Lord, and his won­
          <lb/>ders in the deep.</quote> Many a time, when I have lain awake,
          <lb/>in stormy nights, when my bed has shook under me with
          <lb/>the winds that rock'd the house, I have thought perhaps
          <lb/>my poor boy is among those who <quote>mount up to the
          <lb/>heavens, and go down again to the depths, with their soul
          <lb/>melted because of trouble.</quote> The again it would come
          <lb/>into my mind, who knows but he <quote>will cry unto the
          <lb/>Lord, and he will bring him out of his distresses.</quote> That
          <lb/>thought comforted me. If he can only be made to seek
          <lb/>his God, in the days of his youth, what matter is it though
          <lb/>he should suffer, and his mother's heart ache? all would be
          <lb/>well in the end. When it came time to expect him back,
          <lb/>I found myself too anxious and impatient, for one who
          <lb/>ought to trust all to God. One day, when I was looking
          <lb/>for him, a wagon drove up to the door. My heart was
          <lb/>in my mouth. A man got out, and brought me a chest,
          <lb/>and said, <said>This belonged to your son. He died of a fe­
          <lb/>ver, a fortnight before we arrived on this coast.</said> My
          <lb/>tongue was speechless—something said to me, <said>be still!
          <lb/>and know that I am God.</said> All day long, as I went about

          <mw type="pageNum">75</mw>

          <lb/>my work, that boy seemed to stand beside me, with his
          <lb/>face between smiles and tears, as when he last said
          <lb/><said>Good bye, mother.</said> When I went to bed, and all was
          <lb/>darkness, his pale corpse lay stretched before me, and I
          <lb/>trembled with agony as when I bore him. But through
          <lb/>that long sleepless night, the same voice repeated, <said>Be
          <lb/>still! and know that I am God.</said> The next day, I opened
          <lb/>his chest. There lay all the clothes, that those dear
          <lb/>hands had toiled to procure, and that I had made for him. But
          <lb/>oh! what a blessing. Wrapt up in the choicest manner, I
          <lb/>found a prayer, which he had himself written. It has been
          <lb/>my comfort ever since, when I have grieved, as a mother
          <lb/>will grieve for her first-born. Then I could turn to the
          <lb/>psalm, which had been my companion in his absence, and
          <lb/>say, <said>Oh! that men <emph>would</emph> praise the Lord for his good­
          <lb/>ness! and for his wonderful works to the children of men.</said>
          <lb/>How merciful that he was not thrown overboard, without
          <lb/>a moment's time to beg favour of God. But if the child
          <lb/>of many prayers did, in his sickness, pray himself for sal­
          <lb/>vation, and be heard, what more have I to desire? Some­
          <lb/>times in my dreams, I have seen him as an angel, walk­
          <lb/>ing on the waves, and reaching his hand toward me.—God
          <lb/>grant that I may not be deceived in my hope.</said> She
          <lb/>paused, to wipe the tears that were escaping down her
          <lb/>cheeks; and recollecting herself, said, <said>I ought to ask
          <lb/>pardon, for talking so much about my own poor con­
          <lb/>cerns.</said> <persName>Madam L――</persName> perceiving that her brother was

          <lb/>you keep in view the Hand that rules, both under the
          <lb/>cloud, and in the sun-shine. I wish you would relate to my
          <lb/>brother, what you have told me, respecting your husband.</said></p>
          <p><said>He was a man,</said> she answered, <said>of better edu­
          <lb/>cation, than people in his station always enjoy. I mar­
          <lb/>ried him, when I was sixteen, and my whole endeavour
          <lb/>was to please him. I did not consider that it is our duty
          <lb/>to seek <quote><emph>first</emph> the Kingdom of God, and his righteous­
          <lb/>ness.</quote> My husband was an ambitious man; and at last be­
          <lb/>came master of a vessel. He was always looking for great
          <lb/>things, but seemed to be unfortunate. While he was gone
          <lb/>whole years, I would live upon as little as would keep
          <lb/>life in me, so as not to be a burden to him; and some­
          <lb/>times when I was sick, and would have been thankful for
          <lb/>six-pence, to buy medicine, a letter would come from him,
          <lb/>full of nothing but poetry. Yet I was rejoiced to see only
          <lb/>a line, written by his hand, <quote>because of the love I bore
          <lb/>him.</quote> Once, when my babes and I were really in want of
          <lb/>food, there came from him a present to me, of a gold
          <lb/>ring, and his picture as big as life. The children were
          <lb/>frightened to death, at the sight of such a great face, that
          <lb/>did not talk; and they cried and screamed so, that I had
          <lb/>to carry it up garret, and turn it backside out. I sold
          <lb/>the gold ring, and brought <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> meal, and some wool to
          <lb/>spin stockings for our bare feet. I would have sold the
          <lb/>picture, but nobody would buy it. I thought it was not
          <lb/>becoming in me to keep such a costly thing. I wrote to

          <pb n="077"/><milestone unit="sig" n="7(3)r"/>
          <mw type="pageNum">77</mw>

          <lb/>my husband, <quote>if you had but sent me a piece of meat as
          <lb/>big as the picture, I should know what to do with it.
          <lb/>Here are three little mouths, waiting to be filled, that
          <lb/>call you Father.</quote> But he meant all in kindness. Once
          <lb/>he sent me money to buy a small house, which he liked.
          <lb/>But the man, who had the care of it, spent it, and before
          <lb/>he got ready to pay me, he failed, and could not. Yet I
          <lb/>found that what I repined at, was in mercy. Not long
          <lb/>after, that very house took fire in the night, and burnt
          <lb/>down: and who knows, but what if we had lived there,
          <lb/>one of the children might have been burned in it?—
          <lb/>After some time, my husband came home, a poor, sick
          <lb/>creature, with a leg to be taken off. I felt as if I knew
          <lb/>not which way to turn, to make him comfortable. But
          <lb/>strength came with the need. The doctor was favourable
          <lb/>in his bill, and I was able to be about, both day and night.
          <lb/>My husband suffered every thing in the operation, and in
          <lb/>the sickness afterwards. He was disappointed at being
          <lb/>so poor, when he had promised himself riches; and all
          <lb/>together made him very unhappy, and violent. His oaths
          <lb/>and curses made me tremble, but I knew that he was in mis­
          <lb/>ery, and my prayers rose for him with almost every breath.
          <lb/>Those, who heard him speak to me, thought he was un­
          <lb/>kind, but they did not know what he suffered. My voice
          <lb/>was always cheerful to him; but, when he slept, I took
          <lb/>time to weep. My greatest sorrow was, that he seemed
          <lb/>to be hastening into the presence of his Maker, with a
          <lb/>heart bitter against him. If he awoke, and I was not by,

          <lb/>he would shriek after me in a voice that frightened me,
          <lb/>saying that when I was away, evil spirits came to tear
          <lb/>him. Yet when I appeared, he would sometimes say,
          <lb/>that my sight was hateful to him, as theirs. His pain,
          <lb/>made him loath all creatures, and himself also. But God
          <lb/>in mercy, gave him a better frame of spirit. For a month
          <lb/>before his death, there were no blasphemies, but prayers
          <lb/>for patience. He would ask me to read from the good
          <lb/>book, and listen with tears. I feared to say much to him,
          <lb/>because of his weakness; but I thanked my Father in
          <lb/>Heaven for his altered mind. When he died, he looked
          <lb/>at me, and his children, with a mild pleasant face, and
          <lb/>though he was not able to speak, it seemed as if there was
          <lb/>peace within his heart. I asked him, if he could leave
          <lb/>his fatherless children with God, and he bowed his head
          <lb/>with a smile, that lifted a weight from my heart. For
          <lb/>many months, the sound of his groans lingered in my ears,
          <lb/>both when I lay down, and when I rose up, but I commend­
          <lb/>ed my soul to the God of the widow, and was preserved.</said></p>
          <p><said>And were you able,</said> said <persName>Dr. L――</persName>, <said>to support
          <lb/>your children entirely by your own industry?</said></p>

          <lb/>with thankful hearts to Him who permitted us to live in his
          <lb/>good and beautiful world. Once, when we were eating

          <lb/>our breakfast of potatoes, the youngest boy, who was then
          <lb/>about five years old, lifted up to me his bright eye, and
          <lb/>rosy face, and said, <said>Mother, when I am a little bigger,
          <lb/>the farmers will hire me to work, and then I shall bring
          <lb/>you home, a bushel of rye.</said> But what made me feel for
          <lb/>a little while, as if I did not know how to get along, was
          <lb/>when my father and mother came to live with me, just
          <lb/>after I was left a widow. I was willing to work my fingers
          <lb/>to the bone for them, but they were old, and infirm people,
          <lb/>and my house was very small, and I feared that I could
          <lb/>not make them comfortable. It did seem to me too, that
          <lb/>my sister, who sent them down to me from <placeName>Vermont</placeName>, was
          <lb/>better able to take care of them than I; for she had a
          <lb/>husband, and a good farm, and was well-off in the world—
          <lb/>while I had to work early and late to get my children
          <lb/>bread. But I thought again—God has ordered it, and he
          <lb/>will provide; though I have not even a barrel of meal, or
          <lb/>a cruse of oil, like the widow in the Old Testament. And
          <lb/>so it was—we were all able to live upon the little that my
          <lb/>hands obtained, until my poor mother became sick and
          <lb/>bedrid; and then the good people were very kind to help
          <lb/>me to medicines, and comfortable things for her. She was
          <lb/>a heavy woman, and in lifting her I strained my breast,
          <lb/>so that it has never been strong since. But how much
          <lb/>more did she endure for me in my infancy—and how small
          <lb/>a part could I pay the mother, who had patience with
          <lb/>my helpless and wayward years. Often have I thought,
          <lb/>when I was broke of my rest for many nights, and had

          <lb/>my heart to forsake my father and mother, how could I
          <lb/>hope that the Lord would take me up in my distresses.</said>
          <lb/>And I thank Him who gave me the strength unto the end; for
          <lb/>their aged eyes blessed me, when their voice was lost in
          <lb/>death. <quote rend="post()">Surely goodness and mercy have followed me

          <p>In the neighbourhood of <persName>Madam L――</persName>, was a tenement,
          <lb/>inhabited by an aged <name>African</name>, whose name was <persName>Primus</persName>.
          <lb/>To him she extended not only her benevolent offices, but
          <lb/>her kind regard. Venerable at once for years and vir­
          <lb/>tues, he was respected both by the young and old. His
          <lb/>countenance displayed the characteristicks of the country
          <lb/>of his birth; and though his features might war with all
          <lb/>our ideas of beauty, yet their expression caused the eye
          <lb/>to rest on them with complacency. Seldom is matter
          <lb/>more completely modified by mind, than it was in this
          <lb/>case; where the mild eye, beaming love to mankind,
          <lb/>made the beholder forget the jutting forehead, and de­
          <lb/>pressed nostrils, by which it was encompassed. A gentle,
          <lb/>yet dignified deportment, a politeness which seemed nat­
          <lb/>ural to him, and the white blossoms of the grave, curling
          <lb/>closely around his temples, suffered not materially in their
          <lb/>effect, from the complexion which an <rs type="properAdjective">African</rs> sun had
          <lb/>burnt upon him. It was remarked, by children in the
          <lb/>streets, that on one bowed so low, or turned out their toes
          <lb/>so well as <persName>Primus</persName>; nor was their reverence for his char­

          <lb/>not coloured like their own.</quote> Early instructed in read­
          <lb/>ing, and the principles of religion, he had imbibed an ar­
          <lb/>dent love for the Scriptures, and stored his memory with a
          <lb/>surprising number of their passages. If the great <persName>Selden</persName>
          <lb/>merited the name of a <soCalled rend="pre(“)post(”)">walking dictionary,</soCalled> <persName>Primus</persName>
          <lb/>might have been styled a living concordance. At the pri­
          <lb/>vate religious meetings, which were occasionally held by
          <lb/>the pious, it was customary, when any text was under dis­
          <lb/>cussion, whose place was doubtful in the memory of the
          <lb/>speaker, to appeal to the venerable <name>African</name>. Then, from
          <lb/>some remote corner, a modest voice would be heard, to
          <lb/>pronounce with precision, respecting the chapter and
          <lb/>verse. This information, which humility generally
          <lb/>connected with some expression of doubt, was almost in­
          <lb/>variably found a <quote>sure word of testimony;</quote> for he had
          <lb/>made the Bible his sole study from his youth, exercising
          <lb/>his memory, not only on its substance, but on its links
          <lb/>of connexion and dependance, as the historian clings to
          <lb/>chronology, to systematize the facts, with which his mind
          <lb/>overflows.</p>
          <p><persName>Primus</persName> had been, for more than half a century, a mem­
          <lb/>ber of the <orgName>Congregational Church</orgName> in his vicinity. We

          <lb/>ties, and spiritual graces, were ever found so unmingled
          <lb/>with imperfection, as to justify such an epithet. At that

          <lb/>thy servant wash the feet of these servants of my Lord,</quote>

          <p>His home, which was comfortable, and comprised two
          <lb/>stories, more spacious than usually fall to the lot of <name>Afri­
          <lb/>cans</name> in this country, was provided for him by the family
          <lb/>whom he had served in his youth. They had become
          <lb/>justly attached to him for his excellent qualities, and for
          <lb/>them, he testified the zeal of an old feudal retainer.
          <lb/>Though four-score years had passed over him, he still
          <lb/>preferred supplying his moderate wants by occasional la­
          <lb/>bour in the gardens of his neighbours, to a dependance on
          <lb/>the industry of his daughters who resided with him. Their
          <lb/>habitation was situated near a ledge of dark, broken rocks;
          <lb/>between whose base and its walls, rose a School-house of
          <lb/>brick, which still remains, though no vestige is left of the
          <lb/>abode of the good <name>African</name>. The noisy inmates of that

          <lb/>dancing blood at their gay hearts be cold for a moment,
          <lb/>while he explained to them the only picture in his habita­
          <lb/>tion, the tearing of the forty and two children, who mock­
          <lb/>ed at the bald-head prophet. The furious deportment
          <lb/>of the two she-bears, the various attitudes of torture and
          <lb/>death in which the victims appeared, and the solemn
          <lb/>enunciation of that old, grey-headed man, made this part
          <lb/>of the bible better understood than others by the breath­
          <lb/>less listeners, and impressed on their minds the turpitude
          <lb/>of reviling age and piety, more than the formal instruc­
          <lb/>tion of the pulpit. Sometimes he would indulge them
          <lb/>with the story of his captivity, and many a little bosom
          <lb/>would beat indignantly, and tears would gush from many
          <lb/>a fair eye, at hearing that he was a child like themselves,
          <lb/>when he was torn from his native land to be made a slave.
          <lb/>His narrative, when divested of its vernacular, ran thus:—</p>
          <said rend="post()"><p rend="pre(“)">I was born in that part of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, which lies between
          <lb/>the Rivers <placeName>Gambia</placeName> and <placeName>Senegal</placeName>. The king of our tribe
          <lb/>possessed a small territory, about fifty miles from the
          <lb/>western coast. The dwelling of my parents was on a
          <lb/>branch of the river <placeName>Senegal</placeName>. Its humble roof was over­
          <lb/>shadowed by lofty palm-trees, and near it grew yams, and
          <lb/>plantains for our food. Orange trees, and shaddocks
          <lb/>were abundant there, and the pine-appple might be seen,
          <lb/>thrusting forth its head like a young cabbage, wherever
          <lb/>we trod. There was war, at the time I was captured, be­
          <lb/>tween our king, and the chief of a neighbouring nation. It
          <lb/>was begun, in order to obtain prisoners to sell to the deal­

          <lb/>ers in slaves. It is not one of the slightest evils of the
          <lb/>slave-trade, that it kindles war among tribes, who would
          <lb/>otherwise be at peace. The sight of an <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> sail is
          <lb/>the signal for dissension and robbery, and ere the ship has
          <lb/>arrived at its harbour, cottages have blazed, and blood has
          <lb/>flowed. Those, who were comparatively innocent, are
          <lb/>rendered sinful by those who have more light and know­
          <lb/>ledge than themselves, so that the <name>Africans</name> who inhabit the
          <lb/>shores, are worse than those in the interiour, who have
          <lb/>never seen a <name>Christian</name>. Nations, who deal in slaves, have
          <lb/>factors or merchants stationed along the coasts, to insti­
          <lb/>gate the avaricious and wicked natives to sell their own
          <lb/>countrymen. Thus private robberies, and civil wars add
          <lb/>to the desolations of <placeName>Africa</placeName>. The whites, also, sail in ves­
          <lb/>sels, or boats up the principal rivers, and make victims of
          <lb/>those who may escape the pursuit of their agents. They
          <lb/>sometimes march with considerable force into the country,
          <lb/>and seize whole families, leaving only the sick and the
          <lb/>aged. Alas! they have not always left these, to mourn
          <lb/>the loss of all their race. They have staid to destroy
          <lb/>those lives, which they deemed not worthy their capture.
          <lb/>When the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> ship arrived which bore me from <placeName>Afri­

          <lb/>were heard, and tears fell without measure. Chained to­

          <lb/>Our sufferings for want of air, in this confined prison, I

          <lb/>to stretch themselves out, which had been before denied
          <lb/>them. But it was upon rough boards, where the motion of
          <lb/>the ship tore the flesh from their bones. Soon, there were
          <lb/>spaces enough to be seen, but they were reddened with
          <lb/>the blood of the dead who had filled them. Every day,
          <lb/>the plunging of bodies into the ocean was heard, with no
          <lb/>more concern than if beasts were consigned to its depths.
          <lb/>Stern joy sat upon the faces of the sufferers. They com­

          <p>It has been mentioned that this good old <name>African</name>, had
          <lb/>a daughter who resided with him. She was the sole sur­
          <lb/>viving offspring of a wife who had been many years dead,
          <lb/>and bore no resemblance to her father, either in person or
          <lb/>mind. Without being decidedly vicious, she might be
          <lb/>ranked among those many personages who prove that merit
          <lb/>is not hereditary. Having but little employment at home,
          <lb/>she was by profession both spy and gossip; not that the
          <lb/>union of these departments is particular, or monopolized by
          <lb/>females of her colour and station. Seldom was any occur­
          <lb/>rence in the household of her neighbours, unknown to her.
          <lb/>The incipient designs of courtship and matrimony were
          <lb/>favourite subjects for her boasted discernment, or malig­
          <lb/>nant prediction, and it might be said of her that—
          <quote><lg type="indeterminate">

          <p rend="pre(“)">She was time-keeper, for all who came within the range

          <lb/>That portion of the affections, which Nature had intro­
          <lb/>duced into the system of this wayward dame, were more
          <lb/>liberally bestowed upon animals, than upon her own kind.
          <lb/>Cats were her principal favourites, and wandered around
          <lb/>her precincts, in every shade and diversity of colour.

          <lb/>Under her clement, they waxed fat, and multiplied
          <lb/>exceedingly. At her meals, she was the centre of a circle,
          <lb/>who, with lynx eyes, watched every movement of her
          <lb/>hand to her lips, and with discordant growling, grudged
          <lb/>every morsel which was not bestowed upon them. Some­
          <lb/>times she might be heard by those who passed her man­
          <lb/>sion, addressing her dependents with every appellation
          <lb/>of fondness; at others, with bitter vituperations; while
          <lb/>their shrill voices, now mingling with her cadence, and
          <lb/>anon leading the concert, gave notice that they were pay­
          <lb/>ing the penalty of some petty larceny on the larder. Fre­
          <lb/>quently she was seen, issuing from her habitation, her tall,
          <lb/>gaunt form clad in a sky-blue tammy petticoat, partially
          <lb/>concealed from view by a short, faded, scarlet cloak,
          <lb/>bearing a basket of kittens to display their beauty to some
          <lb/>amateur, or put them to service with some rat-infested
          <lb/>householder. Following, with distracted haste, the mother
          <lb/><name>Grimalkin</name> might be traced, tossing her whiskers, and
          <lb/>uttering piteous moans; occasionally infixing her claws,
          <lb/>in the stiff blue petticoat, that she might thereby climb to
          <lb/>her kidnapped offspring. The bereaved parent would be
          <lb/>either consoled with caresses, or distracted by a blow, as
          <lb/>the caprice of the dame might dictate.</p>
          <p>Another object claimed her attention, though in an in­
          <lb/>feriour degree. On the utmost limit of the parapet of rock,
          <lb/>which flanked her suburbs, was a solitary barberry-bush,
          <lb/>which possibly she felt bound to patronize, by virtue of
          <lb/>her name, as Goddess of Flowers. To this spot, the visits

          <lb/>of the children, from the adjacent temple of science,
          <lb/>wee constant as the advances of its fructification. Even
          <lb/>the leaves did not come amiss, as study is known to be an
          <lb/>provocative of appetite. When its drupes began to assume
          <lb/>their crimson tinge, dire were the labours, and sore the
          <lb/>watchings of <persName>Flora</persName>, between the depredations of the ur­
          <lb/>chins without, and the cats within. At this season of the
          <lb/>year, her irascible propensities predominated; and many
          <lb/>a little girl has vanished like a frighted bird from the
          <lb/>contested bush; and many a stout boy, with teeth on
          <lb/>edge from the rough acid of the unripe fruit, has lingered
          <lb/>to shout defiance at the threats which assailed him.</p>
          <p>Her principal amusement, amid the pressure of avoca­
          <lb/>tions like these, was to trace in the aspect of the sky,
          <lb/>signs of a portending storm. No mariner, whose life bal­
          <lb/>ances upon the cloud, transcended her in this species of
          <lb/>discernment; for she could gather amid the unsullied
          <lb/>brightness of a summer sky, omens of elemental conflict.
          <lb/>Her delight was amid the convulsions of nature, and the
          <lb/>deformities of character. This love of scandal led her
          <lb/>to dread the reproofs of <persName>Madam L――</persName>, and to avoid
          <lb/>her presence, except when she found it expedient to
          <lb/>solicit some favour. Her father was ever received with
          <lb/>kindness, and even with affection, as a <quote>brother in Christ,
          <lb/>notwithstanding his bonds.</quote> But when she made her visita­
          <lb/>tions to set forth her poverty, before this benevolent lady,
          <lb/>she invariably received, with her gift, some admonition

          <lb/>whose severity induced her to murmur as she returned to
          <lb/>her dwelling.</p>
          <p><said>It is well enough, for aught I know, for rich people
          <lb/>to be so mighty good; but poor folks have not had so
          <lb/>much <emph>eddecation</emph>, and must take the world as they find it.</said></p>
          <p>Yet she found that punishment invariably attends the
          <lb/>indulgence of unkind feelings, though conscience may
          <lb/>have become too obtuse to administer it. The terrours of
          <lb/>superstition haunted her, and the wakeful hours of night,
          <lb/>were rendered miserable by fears of ghosts and spectres.
          <lb/>No <name>Neapolitan</name> ever believed more firmly in the influence
          <lb/>of an evil eye, than she in the system of witchcraft. The
          <lb/>tragical scenes acted at <placeName>Salem</placeName>, in the preceding century,
          <lb/>had been rendered familiar to her, by the pages of a torn
          <lb/>book, which she perused on <name>Sundays</name>, as a substitute for
          <lb/>the bible. All things monstrous, or mysterious were trac­
          <lb/>ed by her to a similar source. The unknown stranger
          <lb/>who had sought refuge in the abode of old <persName>Zachary</persName> at
          <lb/><placeName>Mohegan</placeName>, was to her a meet subject for explanation dire.
          <lb/>She had no doubt, she was one of that race who held com­
          <lb/>munion with evil spirits. Her living among <name>Indians</name> was
          <lb/>a sure proof of that. She had heard that when people
          <lb/>were in pursuit of her, she would cast a mist before
          <lb/>their eyes, that they could not discover her. She be­
          <lb/>lieved that at her first arrival, there was a blue flame
          <lb/>and a strong scent of sulphur; and hinted that, if the
          <lb/><soCalled rend="pre(“)post(”)">Authority of the Town,</soCalled> were as strict as the ought to
          <lb/>be, old <persName>Zachary</persName> would be committed to prison, and the

          <lb/>creature whom nobody knew, tied in a sack, and thrown
          <lb/>into the river, to see if she would sink or swim. Then
          <lb/>lowering her voice, she would assert that other people,
          <lb/>as well as herself, were confident that she was a witch,
          <lb/>for that she had been seen to rise in the air upon a broom­
          <lb/>stick so high, that she appeared no larger than a night­
          <lb/>hawk. This mischievous narrator found listeners; for at
          <lb/>that period, low scandal, and the belief in the contracts of
          <lb/>man with evil demons, were popular among the vulgar.
          <lb/>Superstition has since vanished before the sway of supe­
          <lb/>riour illumination; but slander still thrives on the faults of
          <lb/>mankind. They are still forced into daily circulation,
          <lb/>though not always by those, whom society condemns as
          <lb/>ignorant, worthless, or malignant.</p>

          <p>It was often her custom, on the afternoons of their stated
          <lb/>release from school, to assemble around her the younger
          <lb/>children of the neighbourhood. An invitation of this sort
          <lb/>was viewed by them as an honour to be boasted of, as
          <lb/>well as a pleasure to be enjoyed. On those gala-days,
          <lb/>they might be seen, seated in groups around her feet,
          <lb/>watching with sparkling eyes the quick movements of her
          <lb/>scissors, producing for their amusement, groups of danc­
          <lb/>ing girls, dexterously cut from white paper, tall trees, with
          <lb/>prominent buds and leaves, and squirrels, apparently ready
          <lb/>to spring from bough to bough. When these fanciful crea­
          <lb/>tions had sufficed for a time, a small cabinet of curiosities
          <lb/>would often be produced, and sundry little heads might
          <lb/>be observed hanging over it in such close contact, that
          <lb/>the gold and chesnut of their locks blended in beautiful
          <lb/>irregularity. There, counters were considered as coins,

          <lb/>alloy, it is not to be feared that these privileges, through
          <lb/>Profusion, may frustrate their own design? If, through
          <lb/>their aid, no <quote>royal road to astronomy</quote> has been dis­
          <lb/>covered, has not something very like a dunce's avenue
          <lb/>to literature, been laid open? Will the mind, which is
          <lb/>released from the necessity of laborious research, obtain
          <lb/>that pre-eminence which habits of application can alone
          <lb/>bestow? Are we not in some danger of having more super­
          <lb/>ficial, than profound students? The superiour learning of
          <lb/>the ancients, has been resolved into a single circumstance,
          <lb/>—the scarcity of books. We would not willingly see a
          <lb/>return of that scarcity; yet it might be well for education
          <lb/>to impress on youth the importance of making itself
          <lb/>master of the necessary elementary works, as thoroughly
          <lb/>as if there were none beside. This might demand a per­
          <lb/>severance which would disturb the repose of indolence,
          <lb/>but it would strengthen the energies of intellect. The
          <lb/>respect, which, forty years since, was shewn to the ex­
          <lb/>trinsic value of books, did not diminish the sense of their
          <lb/>intrinsic worth. The maxim, then enforced, both by the
          <lb/>parent and pedagogue, that it was shameful to deface and
          <lb/>destroy them, heightened the estimation of their contents;
          <lb/>as, in monarchical governments, the sacredness of the per­
          <lb/>son of the King gives weight to his prerogative. Now,
          <lb/>the idler in school finds no method of escaping his lesson
          <lb/>more convenient, than to render it illegible, or to mislay,
          <lb/>and destroy his book.</p>
          <p><persName>Madam L――</persName>, educated in the sobriety and economy of

          <lb/>more ancient times, entrusted her volumes to the little
          <lb/>readers, with repeated injunctions not to tear, tarnish, or
          <lb/>turn down the leaves. These directions usually accom­
          <lb/>panied those also, which she gave as presents, and so well
          <lb/>were they obeyed, that it was a general remark, no books
          <lb/>retained their beauty so long as hers, whether lent, given
          <lb/>away, or retained in her own library.</p>
          <p>Some of these fairy forms might sometimes be descried
          <lb/>in closer contact with the Lady, displaying their powers
          <lb/>of recitation. Then, might be heard, in every variety of
          <lb/>emphasis and intonation, the standard pieces of the day,
          <lb/><quote>How doth the little busy bee,</quote>—<quote>Abroad in the mead­
          <lb/>ows to see the young lambs,</quote>—or, <quote>Though I am young,
          <lb/>a little one.</quote> Thus, an opportunity was afforded for in­
          <lb/>quiry into their different grades of improvement at school,
          <lb/>and for those admonitions, respecting the value of time,
          <lb/>industry, and correct habits, which she was as faithful to
          <lb/>impress as she was happy to adapt to different disposi­
          <lb/>tions, and degrees of improvement.</p>
          <p>These little groups could not be persuaded to seperate,
          <lb/>without a song from their kind patroness. Her memory,
          <lb/>well stored with songs which had been fashionable in her
          <lb/>youth, and her voice, of great melody and compass, were
          <lb/>always at the command of these lilliputian visitants; for
          <lb/>she felt that she not only thus gave them pleasure, but
          <lb/>cherished gentle, and virtuous sentiments. <title>The dis­
          <lb/>tracted Lady,</title> a tender and melancholy complaint of a

          <lb/>the auditors. So was <title>Indulgent parents dear,</title> an an­
          <lb/>cient ballad of considerable length, and most tragical
          <lb/>character. Many an eye, that sparkled with curiosity,
          <lb/>when the hero of the tale, moved by love, sought the
          <lb/>hand of a <quote>maid of low degree,</quote> was dilated with horrour,
          <lb/>when his proud mother took the life of the kneeling fair­
          <lb/>one; or was suffused with tears, when the unfortunate
          <lb/>youth, discovering the deed, and reproaching the guilty

          <p>The address of the <title>Ghost of <persName>Pompey</persName> to his wife <persName>Cor­

          <lb/>stronger curiosity. She would then direct them to proper
          <lb/>books for gaining requisite knowledge, and propose ques­
          <lb/>tions to be answered respecting it, at their next meeting.
          <lb/>Frequently, during the intervals of these parties, the in­
          <lb/>fant students might be heart asking each other, <said>do you
          <lb/>know perfectly where <placeName>Rome</placeName> was? and how large? and
          <lb/>who was its founder? and what were the characters of
          <lb/><persName>Pompey</persName> and <persName>Cæsar</persName>? and why <persName>Cynthia's</persName> beams are said
          <lb/>to be <quote rend="post()"><emph>borrow'd</emph> beams</quote>?</said> Each was anxious to render
          <lb/>the most clear account to their kind benefactress, who
          <lb/>often rewarded patient research, with some book adapted
          <lb/>to excite it anew. But, not satisfied with sowing the seeds
          <lb/>of knowledge in the soil of infancy, she sought to implant
          <lb/>the germs of piety. Her stock of devotional pieces of mu­
          <lb/>sic was large; many of them simple in their construction,
          <lb/>—all rendered delightful by her powers of voice, and
          <lb/>perfect elocution. One called <title rend="pre(“)post(”)">Solitude,</title> and commenc­
          <lb/>ing with <quote>What voice is this I hear?</quote> and another, which
          <lb/>the children familiarly styled <said>Ah me!</said> were earnestly
          <lb/>sought for, and seemed to inspire a mixture of softened
          <lb/>and solemn feeling. <title rend="pre(“)post(”)">While shepherds watch'd their
          <lb/>flocks by night,</title> was understood by them as a close of
          <lb/>their musical entertainment, or a signal that as much as
          <lb/>was proper had been accorded. Yet a few tender remarks
          <lb/>usually followed, on the character of that Saviour who was
          <lb/>thus represented as bringing peace and good will, with a
          <lb/>brief illustration of their duty in order to gain his love.
          <lb/>An early supper was given to these joyous guests, most of

          <lb/>whom were accustomed to retire to slumber with the birds.
          <lb/>Full of pleasure, which seemed more dignified than that
          <lb/>usually exemplified in childhood, because it was derived
          <lb/>from a higher source, they seperated, praising the benevo­
          <lb/>lent Lady, who expressed such an interest in their welfare.</p>
          <p>A description of scenes like these will doubtless be
          <lb/>condemned by many, as puerile. They will immediately
          <lb/>discern in it proofs of that mental dotage, which leads us,
          <lb/>in our second childhood, to cling tenderly to the most
          <lb/>minute traces of the first.</p>
          <p>They may perhaps inquire, of what consequence is it
          <lb/>if the children of another age were amused and improved
          <lb/>at the same time? Probably of none, to those who are
          <lb/>willing theirs should find amusement, at the expense of
          <lb/>improvement. But it was deemed of some importance,
          <lb/>in pourtraying a character which really existed, to repre­
          <lb/>sent things as they were. It was not thought improper
          <lb/>to follow the smaller streams, which might diverge from
          <lb/>so pure a fountain. The science of conferring happiness
          <lb/>depends less upon splendid achievements, and fortuitous
          <lb/>combinations of circumstance, than upon those smaller
          <lb/>occurrences, which vary the common lot of existence: as
          <lb/>the evidence of piety, is not so much in sustaining great
          <lb/>affliction, as in surmounting those slighter perplexities,
          <lb/>where, if we may use the expression, the soul imagines
          <lb/>herself to be out of sight of the Deity. Yet might this
          <lb/>simple delineation, of what one of the best of human
          <lb/>beings was, in the humbler walks of her benevolence, in­

          <lb/>over the welfare of the rising generation, cheerfully should
          <lb/>this volume sustain all the censure which the critic might
          <lb/>pronounce. More than one of those, who now bend
          <lb/>beneath the burdens of maturity, can look back to the
          <lb/>scenes of happy youthful instruction which have been
          <lb/>here depicted, then upward to the realm of glory, and

          <p>No heart ought more warmly to respond these senti­

          <lb/>the hand traces this feeble transcript of its benefactress.
          <lb/>That gratitude, which hovers round her bright image, re­
          <lb/>volts, both at the veil which conceals it, and at the faintness

          <lb/>sonal obligations, of the kindness that encouraged a lone­
          <lb/>ly spirit, and the monitions that strove to guide it in the
          <lb/>way to heaven. The still voice of memory is idle music
          <lb/>in the ear of the world. Thus far, the full heart has forc­
          <lb/>ed the pen to trespass. The reminder shall be inscrib­

          <lb/>Doubtless, much of excellence exists in modern times,
          <lb/>and my lot has been so graciously cast by heaven, as often

          <p><persName>Madam L――</persName> had often taken pleasure in his convers­

          <lb/>which seems the birthright of the <rs type="properAdjective">New-England</rs> farmer,
          <lb/>while the simplicity of his opinions on some subjects,
          <lb/>and the oddity of his dialect, administered to her enter­
          <lb/>tainment.</p>
          <p>Calling one morning on his patroness, for whom he
          <lb/>cherished a respect, almost bordering on adoration, he
          <lb/>was requested to walk into her parlour. This he had ever
          <lb/>refused to do, under pretence that his <said>shoes were clum­
          <lb/>sy, and he was afraid of meeting some of the gentlefolks,
          <lb/>whose ways he was not used to.</said> But she being some­
          <lb/>what indisposed, and declining to go into her kitchen, he
          <lb/>appeared at the door, with a well meant bow, which the
          <lb/>dandies of the present day, who deal principally in nods
          <lb/>and shrugs, might consider a semi-prostration. The rev­
          <lb/>olution, which in giving us liberty, obliterated almost
          <lb/>every vestige of the politenes of the <mcr rend="pre(“)post(”)">old school,</mcr> had
          <lb/>not then done its work completely. Individuals were
          <lb/>found, forty years since, in every grade of society, who
          <lb/>having been educated when a bow was not an offence to
          <lb/>fashion, nor respect for age a relic of monarchy, continued
          <lb/>the exercise of both, without being hooted at as aristo­

          <p><persName>Farmer Larkin</persName> was dressed in a suit of stout cloth,
          <lb/>whose deep brown colour was produced by an infusion of
          <lb/>the bark of the butternut. It had grown the preceding
          <lb/>summer upon his own sheep, and after sustaining many
          <lb/>processes of mutation in the domestic laboratory, now ap­

          <lb/>not more invulnerable than the shafts of the <name>Trojans</name>, than
          <lb/>this to the attacks of winter; and if a crevice ever ap­

          <p>A neat broad brimmed hat, which his father had worn
          <lb/>on great occasions for half a score of years, a drab colour­
          <lb/>ed great-coat, with deep cuffs, and huge buttons, both
          <lb/>taken from the <name>Sunday</name> wardrobe, out of reverence to

          <lb/>countenance, where the blasts of winter, and heats of sum­
          <lb/>mer had long set their seal, exhibited that decision, and
          <lb/>contempt of bodily hardship, which in ancient <placeName>Sparta</placeName>
          <lb/>was dignified as a virtue. It also displayed that mixture
          <lb/>of sobriety with contentment, resting on the basis of mod­
          <lb/>erated desires, and humble piety, which often gives the
          <lb/>agriculturalist of our country a dignity, which <placeName>Sparta</placeName> in
          <lb/>her pride never knew.</p>
          <p><persName>Mr. Larkin</persName>, at entering the apartment, seemed desirous
          <lb/>to make his way on that narrow stripe of the floor, which
          <lb/>in those days was always permitted to surround the car­
          <lb/>pet. At length a large table, which he doubted whether
          <lb/>it were decorous for him to move, obstructed his course,
          <lb/>and he exclaimed with some perplexity,—</p>
          <p><said>I <emph>must</emph> tread on the <distinct>kiverlid</distinct>.</said> The Lady suppress­

          <lb/>coverlet. It would save <persName>Beulah</persName> some labour, who prides
          <lb/>herself on the whiteness of the floor, which she daily
          <lb/>scours.</said></p>
          <p>Thus assured, he made one or two strides towards a
          <lb/>chair which she placed for him, walking on tiptoe,
          <lb/>and murmuring with some regret, as he rested his heels
          <lb/>upon the hearth,—</p>
          <p><said>Your ha-ath too, is clean as a <distinct>cheeny</distinct> tea-cup,

          <lb/>We are glad to get 'em to <distinct>kiver</distinct> us up with a nights.
          <lb/>This looks like a boughten one,</said> he added, examining
          <lb/>the figure, and feeling its texture. <said>'Tis exeedin' cu­

          <p>The Lady remarked that the use of carpets, like other
          <lb/>luxuries, was gaining ground too rapidly among those who
          <lb/>were often deficient in real comfort. <said>Silks and satins
          <lb/>put out the kitchen-fire, as a wise man has said.</said></p>

          <lb/>yourselves whole and neat. It's as much as I can do, to
          <lb/>get along, says I, in any comfortable kind of a way with
          <lb/>such a snarl on ye. And if there was'nt so many, says I,
          <lb/>and I was a monied man, ye should not go a flauntin'

          <p>The Lady expressed her approbation of his correct
          <lb/>judgement, and inquired after the welfare of his family.</p>
          <p><said>All stout and hearty, thank'e Ma'am. My wife sent
          <lb/>compliments to you, and <persName>Molly</persName> tell'd me to say, that she
          <lb/>was a thousand times beholden to you, for your good pre­

          <p><said>I thank them for their kind recollections. <persName>Molly</persName>, I

          <p><said>Why, as for that matter, they're all in the same situa­
          <lb/>tion, as plump as patridges, and swarmin' round like bees.
          <lb/><persName>Molly's</persName> the oldest on'em, and as fat as butter. She'll be
          <lb/>fourteen years old, come the <date when="--02-10">tenth day o' <name>February</name></date>—and
          <lb/>that will be Sabba-day arter next. She weighs about twice
          <lb/>as much as you do, Ma'am, I guess. She's rather more
          <lb/>stocky than her mother, and I hope will be as smart for
          <lb/>bizness. She'll spin her run o' tow-yarn, or woollen,
          <lb/>afore dinner; and she has wove six yards a day, of yard­
          <lb/>wide sheetin'. She takes in weavin', when any body will
          <lb/>hire it done, and so buys herself her bettermost cloes,
          <lb/>which is a help to me. <persName>Jehoiakim</persName>, the oldest boy—he's
          <lb/>named arter his grandaddy—and is a stout, stirrin' young­
          <lb/>ster. He'll hoe nearabout as much corn in an hour, as I
          <lb/>can; and cold winter days, he'll chop and sled wood
          <lb/>through the snow, without frettin' a bit. But I s'pose 'tant

          <lb/>right and fittin' to brag about my children, Ma'am. It
          <lb/>seems as if I thought my geese were all swans.</said></p>
          <p><said>It gives me pleasure, my good friend, to hear of the
          <lb/>welfare of your family, and the habits of industry in which
          <lb/>you are training them. I hope that you are also careful,
          <lb/>that their minds are stored with useful knowledge.</said></p>
          <p><said rend="post()">O yes Ma'am. They all go to the deestrict-school,
          <lb/>more than ha-af o' the winter; though it's nigh upon two
          <lb/>mild from the house. In the summer time, it's kept a lee­
          <lb/>tle spell by a woman—and then the younger ones go, to
          <lb/>keep 'em out o' the way o' them who are glad to work at
          <lb/>home. I s'pose they larn somethin' about sewin' and
          <lb/>readin'. But <persName>Tim</persName>, the third child, he's the boy for larn­
          <lb/>in'. He took a prodigious likin' to books, when he was a
          <lb/>baby; and if you only show'd him one, he'd put it rite into
          <lb/>his mouth, and stop squallin'. He 'ant but eleven year
          <lb/>old now; and when he gets a newspaper, there's no <emph>whoa</emph>
          <lb/>to him, no more than to our black ox when he sees the hay­
          <lb/>stack, till he's read it clear through, advertisements and
          <lb/>all. The Master says that he's the smartest of all the
          <lb/>boys about spellin', and now he takes to cypherin' mar­
          <lb/>vellously. So that I don't know but sometime or other,
          <lb/>he may be hired to keep our deestrict-school. But I
          <lb/>hope my heart, an't lifted up with pride, at sich great
          <lb/>prospects, for I know that <quote>God resisteth the proud, and

          <p><said>It's no wonder that ye don't Ma'am, there's such a
          <lb/>neest on 'em. They're as thick as hops round the fire
          <lb/>this winter. There's <persName>Roxey</persName> and <persName>Reuey</persName>, they're next to
          <lb/><persName>Tim</persName>, and look like twins. They pick the wool, and card
          <lb/>tow, and wind quills, and knit stockins and mittins for the
          <lb/>fokes in the house; and I've brought some down with me
          <lb/>to day, to see if they'll buy 'em to the marchants' shops,
          <lb/>and let 'em have a couple o' leetle small shawls. Then
          <lb/>there's <persName>Keziah</persName>, she 'ant but a trifle over six year old, and
          <lb/>I recken she has a kins of hard time on't; for she takes
          <lb/>most o' the care o' the three youngest ones. <persName>Jehu</persName> is about
          <lb/>as big as she is, and pretty obstopolous, so that I have to
          <lb/>take him in hand, once in a while. Then there's young
          <lb/><persName>Tryphena</persName>, and the baby <persName>Tryphosa</persName>, who's rather tend­
          <lb/>some, and <persName>Keziah's</persName> tied to 'em a'most every minute when
          <lb/>she 'ant abed. So her Mammy is able to see to the
          <lb/>cheese-tubs, for you know, sich a dairy as we have keeps
          <lb/>a woman pretty tight to't. There's nine o' the young
          <lb/>ones, Ma'am, and as I said afore, the oldest is but e'en a
          <lb/>just fourteen. Yet I shall be sorry to have one less,
          <lb/>though I should work off my, fingers' eends clear to the bone
          <lb/>to maintain 'em. I'm willin’ to slave for 'em, but I mean
          <lb/>they shall do their part, and not grow up in idleness to

          <p>The paternal narrative was interrupted by <persName>Cuffe</persName> bear­
          <lb/>ing refreshments; for the Lady seldom permitted any one
          <lb/>to leave her mansion, without partaking its hospitality.
          <lb/>A well warmed mynce-pye, and a mug of sparkling cider,
          <lb/>she had supposed would be useful in guarding the farmer
          <lb/>from the extreme cold of his ride; and he soon convinced
          <lb/>her, by his formidable attacks on both, that she had not
          <lb/>misjudged in the question of what was palatable. After
          <lb/>despatching his refection, and some business respecting
          <lb/>the farm, he hesitated slightly and said—</p>
          <p><said>I wonder now, if you'd take it hard, Ma'am, if I
          <lb/>should trouble you with some o' my own family consarns,
          <lb/>and ax your advice about 'em, seein' you've had more
          <lb/>years, and experunce than I?</said> The Lady assured him of
          <lb/>her willingness both to listen, and to serve him, according
          <lb/>to her ability.</p>
          <said><p>Well then, it's all about my nephew, <persName>Amariah Stut­

          <lb/>Why these people have hired a room rite over acrost the

          <p>But as I was sayin' of <persName>Amariah</persName>, he tells his expe­
          <lb/>runces a their meetin's, and sometimes at twelve o'clock
          <lb/>at night, he'll wake up in his bed, and scrame some o'

          <lb/>roarin', bein' scared, and no crutter in the house can get
          <lb/>one wink o'sleep till he's a mind to give over. Then if
          <lb/>I, or his A-ant, open our heads to say one word to him
          <lb/>about it, then he makes a towse, and is parsecuted, and I

          <lb/>minister, who is a terrible tonguey man.</p></said>
          <p><said rend="post()">Your situation, good <persName>Mr. Larkin</persName>, requires considera­
          <lb/>ble delicacy. Yet I can assure you, that <persName>Mr. Whitfield</persName>,
          <lb/>the leader of a great part of the sect of <name>Methodists</name>, was
          <lb/>a man of real excellence and piety. My husband, who
          <lb/>was educated in the same faith which we profess, and was
          <lb/>sincerely attached to its precepts, possessed that liberal­
          <lb/>ity of soul which I strive to imitate, and gave to differing
          <lb/>sects the praise of whatever virtue they displayed. <persName>Mr.
          <lb/>Whitfield</persName> was always an honoured guest at our house,
          <lb/>when he made his excursions through this part of the
          <lb/>country. I will relate a little anecdote of him, which
          <lb/>may prove to you, how much his thoughts were fixed upon
          <lb/>a future state. Soon after the death of our three little
          <lb/>sons, he breakfasted with us. Some Chocolate was

          <lb/>beverage, and of their recent burial, brought tears to my
          <lb/>eyes. My husband explained the emotion by saying,
          <lb/><said>she thinks of the olive-plans that once flourished around
          <lb/>our table, and in one week were smitted.</said> The Divine
          <lb/>for a moment raised his eyes upwards, then laying his
          <lb/>hand upon the head of my husband said, with a vivacity
          <lb/>and earnestness which characterized him, <said>My dear
          <lb/>Doctor! what a lift is this towards heaven.</said></said></p>
          <p><said>Well Ma'am, I s'pose that was clever enough since
          <lb/>you think so. But most folks would say it sounded des­
          <lb/>pate like want o' feelin', not to seem to be sorry for you,
          <lb/>nor nothin' sich-like. Now, what would ye have me to
          <lb/>do about <persName>Amariah's</persName> business, for it's high time for me to
          <lb/>be a gittin' under way, Ma'am.</said></p>
          <p><said><persName>Mr. Larkin</persName>, your own good sense will guard you
          <lb/>against any violent opposition to a young man who, if he
          <lb/>is deceived, deserves pity, if sincere, candour. This
          <lb/>strong excitement will be likely to pass away, if you do
          <lb/>not nourish it by waking angry passions. Extremes are
          <lb/>not apt to be lasting, and, in any case, moderation will be
          <lb/>most effectual. Remember, my friend, that contention
          <lb/>about doctrines, is neither that love which is the evidence
          <lb/>of the Spirit, not that holiness, without which no man
          <lb/>shall see God. And I doubt not that you will feel, after
          <lb/>a little more reflection, that, as long as we are so compass­
          <lb/>ed about with infirmity, we should dread to judge, lest
          <lb/>we also be judged, or to condemn, lest we be condemn­
          <lb/>ed.</said></p>

          <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> severity of the wintry season had apparently sub­
          <lb/>sided. The frosts had begun to evacuate their strong
          <lb/>holds, and through the intervals of dissolving snow, tufts
          <lb/>of soft green were visible. But, by one of those sudden
          <lb/>revolutions, to which the climate of <placeName>New-England</placeName> is sub­
          <lb/>ject, the approaches of spring were checked by the re­
          <lb/>turning ravage of winter. A violent storm from the north­
          <lb/>east arose, attended with great quantities of sleet and
          <lb/>snow. The trees bent heavily beneath their load, while
          <lb/>huge drifts covered the fences, and lay in banks against
          <lb/>the walls of houses. In some instances, much toil was re­
          <lb/>quired, ere the inmates could remove the rampart from
          <lb/>their doors and windows, and emerge into the light of
          <lb/>day. Heavy sleds, with each a score of oxen, traversed
          <lb/>the roads, beat a path for the imprisoned inhabitants.</p>
          <p>In <placeName>Mogehan</placeName>, most of the wigwams, which stood within
          <lb/>range of the winds, were hidden. Yet, in a few instan­
          <lb/>ces, the cone of the arbour-like dwelling, thatched with
          <lb/>matting, was seen like a dark hillock, breaking the daz­
          <lb/>zling and dreary surface. The habitants forcing their
          <lb/>way from their buried abodes, surveyed the change, which

          <lb/>the tempest of night had wrought, with that equanimity
          <lb/>which distinguishes the <name><rs type="properAdjective">North American</rs> Indian</name>. To
          <lb/>testify surprise, they considered as a betraying weakness</p>
          <p>An instance of this was exhibited among one of the tribes
          <lb/>in the vicinity of <placeName>Niagara</placeName>, during the total eclipse of the
          <lb/>Sun, in the <date when="1806">summer of 1806</date>. As they had heard no predic­
          <lb/>tion of the event, and a similar one had not occurred for
          <lb/>several centuries, it was believed that they would scarecely
          <lb/>be able to refrain from expressions of astonishment. When
          <lb/>the sky suddenly became dim, and the stars appeared at
          <lb/>noon-day, they were observed by some travellers, view­
          <lb/>ing the progress of the phenomenon with great attention;
          <lb/>but at the same time remarking, with their usual apathy,
          <lb/>that <said direct="false">they had seen such things before.</said></p>
          <p>On the present occasions, those natives of <placeName>Mohegan</placeName>, who
          <lb/>obtained egress more easily from their partially encum­
          <lb/>bered cells, were moved by sympathy to lend assistance
          <lb/>to their less fortunate neighbours. Night was approach­
          <lb/>ing, ere this labour, with their insufficient implements,
          <lb/>had been successfully accomplished. A party of these
          <lb/>pioneers met their minister, who had left his abode with
          <lb/>the same benevolent intention.</p>
          <p><said rend="post()">My children,</said> he said, <said rend="pre()">we must force our way to the
          <lb/>cave of old <persName>Maurice</persName>. Who knows that he perished not,
          <lb/>amid the storm, and cold of the past night?</said></p>
          <p>Animated by the words and example of their guide,
          <lb/>they commenced the difficult course. Often they strug­
          <lb/>gled through deep mounds, as the swimmer breasts the

          <lb/>wave, ere they saw the still distant pile of rock, rising like
          <lb/>the white turrets of a castle. <persName>Mr. Occom</persName>, though less
          <lb/>athletic than most of his companions, was the first to lay
          <lb/>his hand upon the stone door of the recluse, inquiring in a
          <lb/>gentle voice, <said><persName>Maurice</persName>, may your friends come in to
          <lb/>you?</said></p>
          <p>Precautions had been necessary at entering the cavern
          <lb/>when the door was closed, as it usually irritated the aus­
          <lb/>tere hermit. Thrice the question was repeated, and at
          <lb/>each interval the speaker betrayed emotion. Perchance
          <lb/>thus the <rs type="properAdjective">Median</rs> king trembled, when listening at the den
          <lb/>of lions, he feared that the prisoner had become a victim
          <lb/>to their rage. No sound was heard, and the minister,
          <lb/>extending his hand toward the closed entrance, said <said>who
          <lb/>shall roll us the stone, from the door of the sepulchre?</said></p>
          <p><persName>Robert Ashbow</persName> and <persName>John Cooper</persName> instantly advanced,
          <lb/>and removed the heavy fragment of the rock. The shock
          <lb/>brought a weight of snow from the roof of the cavern.
          <lb/>They forced their way through the low aperture, which
          <lb/>admitted scarcely a ray of light. Groping amid the
          <lb/>gloom, they percieved something like a low statue of
          <lb/>stone, with a hand resting against the wall. It was ri­
          <lb/>gid, and motionless as the rock, upon which it reclined.
          <lb/>It was in a kneeling posture. <persName>Robert</persName> raised it in his
          <lb/>arms, and with the aid of his companion, bore it from its
          <lb/>dismal abode. The glassy and immoveable eyes, seemed
          <lb/>to have started from their sockets, and their stony glare
          <lb/>was awful. The hand, in its stiffen'd grasp, enclosed a

          <lb/><persName>John Cooper</persName>, <said>that the feeble spark of life was almost

          <p><said>The dark Angel, who demands the spirit,</said> said <persName>Ro­

          <p><said>Happy is that servant,</said> replied <persName>Mr. Occom</persName>, <said>whom
          <lb/>his Lord when he cometh, shall find watching.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Zachary</persName>, who, notwithstanding his age, had been mov­
          <lb/>ed by warmth of heart, to join the search for the desolate
          <lb/>hermit, anxiously surveyed the body, pressing his hand al­
          <lb/>ternately upon the temples and the bosom. He then
          <lb/>wrapped it closely in the skins, which had formed its
          <lb/>miserable bed, and directed it to be borne with care to
          <lb/>the nearest habitation.</p>
          <p><said>Know ye, how deep is the dwelling of the soul?</said> he
          <lb/>exclaimed, <said>How long it may linger within its dark
          <lb/>house, when lips of clay pronounce it gone to the shades
          <lb/>of its fathers?</said></p>
          <p>The body was borne to the house of <persName>John Cooper</persName>, and
          <lb/>laid upon the bed. <persName>Zachary</persName> chafed the temples with
          <lb/>vinegar, immersed the limbs in cold water to expel the
          <lb/>frost, and rubbed them for a long time with an animal oil
          <lb/>to soften their rigidity of fibre. At short intervals, he
          <lb/>endeavoured to pass through the lips the decoction of a

          <p>A convulsive motion of the eye-lids, and at length a
          <lb/>deep, tremulous sob confirmed the hopes of the aged
          <lb/>warriour. Warmth, friction, and the exhibition of cor­
          <lb/>dials recalled the wandering spirit to its earthly abode,
          <lb/>just as the morning dawned. During the night, broken
          <lb/>exclamations attested the return of life, and his hands
          <lb/>grasped at something above his head, as if the flitting vi­
          <lb/>sions of a disordered intellect encompassed him.</p>
          <p><said>I know ye!</said> at length he uttered in a hollow voice,
          <lb/>rolling his eyes upward, <said>I know ye. That head was
          <lb/>cleft many a year since. Why have ye not healed the
          <lb/>wound? Ye bid it gape to torment me. Those locks
          <lb/>are bright. Why do ye shake them at me? They drop
          <lb/>hot blood upon my soul. Oh! here are hundreds of ac­
          <lb/>cursed spirits, reeking from the eternal lake. Avaunt!
          <lb/>I go not your way! <persName>Satan</persName> I know, but who are ye?</said></p>
          <p>During the agonies of resuscitation, his cried were fre­
          <lb/>quent, <said>Go your way! I know ye!</said> with menacing ges­
          <lb/>tures of the hands.</p>
          <p>At length, <persName>Mr. Occom</persName>, bending over him, said tender­

          <lb/>of wrath.</said> Soon, he made an ineffectual effort to kneel,
          <lb/>and was observed, by the motion of his lips, and occasion­
          <lb/>al elevation of the crucifix, to be in deep prayer. Af­
          <lb/>terwards, he lay more calmly, as if in meditation, but
          <lb/>resolutely refused the cordials which they presented to
          <lb/>him.</p>
          <p><said>No! No!</said> he vociferated, <said rend="pre()"><persName>Maurice</persName> hath vowed, that
          <lb/>nothing but water should pass his polluted lips, until that
          <lb/>glorious day, when <persName>Jesus</persName> brake the strong bars of the
          <lb/>tomb.</said></p>
          <p><said>What you call <name>Easter</name> has nearly arrived,</said> said <persName>John

          <p>The ascetic, fixing his withering eyes on the speaker,
          <lb/>said, <said>thou thinkest <persName>Maurice</persName> such a blasted tree that he
          <lb/>cannot compute times, and seasons. Know I not that sev­
          <lb/>enteen days of the period of humiliation yet remain?
          <lb/><persName>Maurice</persName> will keep his vow. If he enter into heaven ere
          <lb/>it be accomplished, he will fast and mourn there until
          <lb/><name>Lent</name> be past. He will not taste the new wine of the king­
          <lb/>dom, until the voices and thunderings around the throne
          <lb/>proclaim, Christ is risen, is risen.</said></p>
          <p>Observing the children of <persName>John Cooper</persName>, to speak in
          <lb/>low voices of his recovery, he addressed them in a milder
          <lb/>tone.</p>
          <p><said>To your young eyes <persName>Maurice</persName> seems as the dry tree,
          <lb/>whose roots quit the earth, that its head may rest there.

          <lb/>Yet has he numbered fewer years than many, whose hairs
          <lb/>are not white like his. He was young and full of vigour,
          <lb/>when <persName>Braddock</persName>, and his soldiers strewed the earth, like
          <lb/>autumn leaves. He saw <persName>Washington</persName> lay that proud war­
          <lb/>riour in his lowly grave—<persName>Washington</persName>, who was then pre­
          <lb/>paring like a bold, broad river, to run his course toward a
          <lb/>sea of glory. <persName>Maurice</persName> was then called the warriour <persName>Kehoran</persName>.
          <lb/>It was said of him, his eye is bright in battle, and his foot
          <lb/>fleet in the chase, like the deer upon the mountain-tops.
          <lb/><persName>Kehoran</persName> drew his first breath in this valley, and he lov­
          <lb/>ed it when his heart was young. He thought not then,
          <lb/>to die like the miserable <persName>Maurice</persName>. But he has grown
          <lb/>old before his time. Sorrow and penance have wast­
          <lb/>ed his strength. Yet in his bosom hath been a goad,
          <lb/>sharper than that of famine. Ask ye, what bows the
          <lb/>body sooner than age? what traces deeper furrows on the
          <lb/>forehead than care? what sheds snows upon the temples,
          <lb/>whiter than the frost of grief? I tell ye—it is <emph>guilt</emph>.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Mr. Occom</persName>, with that majesty which he well knew
          <lb/>how to assume, standing near the bed of the sufferer, said,</p>
          <p><said><persName>Maurice</persName>! I adjure thee by the living God, before

          <lb/>while there is space for repentance.</said></p>
          <p><said>Canst thou absolve me from my sin?</said> inquired a

          <p><said>Thou art weak as thy faith!</said> exclaimed the recluse
          <lb/>with scorn upon every feature. <said>How feeble would be
          <lb/>the penitence, thou shouldst prescribe! As miserable as
          <lb/>the hope, which thou canst offer. Holy Mother of God!
          <lb/>Would that <persName>Father Paul</persName> were near me. Oh! that my
          <lb/>soul may behold him, where he standeth amid the sera­
          <lb/>phim, when she shall have past the fires of purgatory.</said></p>
          <p>He lay for some time exhausted, as if in slumber, then
          <lb/>starting, said, <said>I know thee! Thou art Death! <persName>Mau­
          <lb/>rice</persName> hath never turned from thee in battle. He will go
          <lb/>with thee. Thou art sweeter than mortal life. Ha!
          <lb/>whom bringest thou? His dark wings overshadow thee.
          <lb/>He desireth to rend my soul in pieces! Is there none to
          <lb/>deliver? I see a fair woman! She stretcheth her hand
          <lb/>to save me. Take that hatchet from her head! alas! I
          <lb/>planted it deep there. She mocks at me. She is gone.
          <lb/>I sink in a sea of blood.</said></p>
          <p>Again he became absorbed in devotion, praying to the
          <lb/>holy Saints, and entreating the blessed Virgin to inter­
          <lb/>cede with her Son in his behalf. A sun-beam fell through
          <lb/>the casement upon his bed <said>This,</said> he said, more calm­
          <lb/>ly, <said>is my last morning upon the earth. A hand that ye
          <lb/>cannot see, beckons me away. Still it waits a little.
          <lb/>Know ye wherefore? That I may pour out the dregs of
          <lb/>my guilt. So shall the soul travel lighter upon her dreary
          <lb/>passage. Heard ye ever the name of <persName>M‘Rae</persName>? Yes!
          <lb/><persName>M‘Rae</persName>! <persName>M‘Rae</persName>! For years I have not dared to pro­
          <lb/>nounce that name. Even now, the demons shriek it in
          <lb/>my ears. They write it in flame upon the walls. It scorch­

          <lb/>es my heart. Avaunt! Avaunt! I tell ye, I will unbur­
          <lb/>den by soul, though ye bid the heavens cleave above,
          <lb/>and the earth beneath me.</said></p>
          <p>Pressing his hands upon his temples, he remained mo­
          <lb/>tionless for a short interval, apparently seeking to recover
          <lb/>strength for some great effort, and then proceeded.</p>
          <said><p>Before the war between these colonies, and the mother
          <lb/>who planted them, I led a wandering life, visiting the tribes
          <lb/>of <name>Indians</name>, who were scattered throughout the <placeName>Canadas</placeName>.
          <lb/>At length, I became stationary in one of the towns near the
          <lb/>frontier. Here, I was found by <persName>Father Paul</persName>, a priest of
          <lb/>the most holy order of the <name>Jesuits</name>. Moved by <rs type="properAdjective">Christian</rs>
          <lb/>compassion, he had for many years endeavoured to pour
          <lb/>the light of heavenly truth upon the benighted natives of
          <lb/>this country. Such benevolence he had, that the soul of
          <lb/>an <name>Indian</name> was precious in his eyes, as that of a prince
          <lb/>upon the throne. Grateful for his instructions, I daily at­
          <lb/>tended the mass. His eloquence was more than mortal.
          <lb/>He received me as his son in the most holy faith. When
          <lb/>the cloud of war arose, I wished to return to my kindred,
          <lb/>and join the standard of my tribe. He said, <said>God com­
          <lb/>mandeth thee to lift thy sword for the people, among
          <lb/>whom thou hast beheld the light from heaven.</said> I obeyed,
          <lb/>and went forth in battle for <placeName>England</placeName>, though often with a
          <lb/>heavy heart. Sometimes, at midnight, stood beside me
          <lb/>the form of my deceased king. Bending his dark brows,
          <lb/>he would upbraid me as a traitor. Cold dews hung upon
          <lb/>my forehead, and I lay trembling, and sleepless til

          <lb/>the morn. But the terrour of that unearthly frown was
          <lb/>forgotten, when the voice of <persName>Father Paul</persName> repeated, <said>God
          <lb/>commandeth thee.</said> When <persName>Burgoyne</persName> with his troops be­
          <lb/>gan to enter the provinces, I was placed with a band of
          <lb/>natives, under a young <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> officer. Proud of my
          <lb/>strength and valour, I sought the front of danger, and his
          <lb/>eye distinguished me. Once, at the dawn of day, he
          <lb/>sent for me  to his tent. He, whose heart was a stranger
          <lb/>to fear, trembled as he spoke—<said><persName>Maurice</persName>, thou hast a
          <lb/>true heart. I adjure thee to keep secret what I intrust to
          <lb/>thee, and lend me thine aid.</said> I promised to be his
          <lb/>friend; and often his tongue faltered with emotion, as he
          <lb/>proceeded. <said>We are within a league of <placeName>Fort Edward</placeName>.
          <lb/>It is to be attacked. The inhabitants have fled,—all, save
          <lb/>one whom I hold dearer than life. I loved her, long ere
          <lb/>this war made intercourse with the Provincials, rebellion.
          <lb/>My residence was near hers, when the mother-country,
          <lb/>and her children were at peace. She waits me there,
          <lb/>though all her household have departed. Such faith hath
          <lb/>she in my truth. But when the ravage commences, how
          <lb/>can I save her? She must be brought hither, and the
          <lb/>priest must unite us, ere we depart hence. Were I to go
          <lb/>for her, I should be condemned as a traitor to my king.
          <lb/>Thou mayest go with safety. I have chosen thee for this
          <lb/>embassy, so dear to my soul, because thy heart is true.
          <lb/>Take with thee ten associates, whom I will amply reward.
          <lb/>Lead for her my own horse. Give her this letter, and she
          <lb/>will put herself under thy care. She hath the heart of a

          <lb/>lion, though the glance of her eye is like that of the dove.
          <lb/>I will meet thee at the door of my tent with a holy man,
          <lb/>who, in making us both one, shall remove from my soul
          <lb/>every earthly fear. Have I said that her name is <persName>M‘Rae</persName>?
          <lb/>And now wilt thou be faithful to my trust?</said>—I replied,
          <lb/><said>The Holy Mother of God be my witness, that no hand
          <lb/>but mine shall present her unto thee.</said></p>
          <p>My heart was proud at this confidence of my chief. In­
          <lb/>stantly I prepared to execute his orders. Ten trusty na­
          <lb/>tives accompanied me. We soon arrived at the house of
          <lb/>the fair-one, which was forsaken by all but her, and one
          <lb/>servant maid. I held up the letter, as she first perceived
          <lb/>us, that the hand-writing of her lover might remove the
          <lb/>dread of our countenances. Her maiden shrieked, and
          <lb/>fled, when she saw us painted, and attired for war. But
          <lb/>that beautiful maiden, pressing to her lips the letter, and
          <lb/>taking from it a lock of his hair which it contained, waited
          <lb/>only to throw on her veil, and came forth to meet us. I
          <lb/>lifted her upon the noble steed, which curved his neck,
          <lb/>and moved more gently, as if he knew that he bore the
          <lb/>treasure of his master. Her long hair, black as the raven's
          <lb/>wing, was folded in braids around her head; and her full
          <lb/>eye, of the same colour, was perpetually looking out for
          <lb/>the tent of her lover. Her lips smiled fearlessly when she
          <lb/>spoke, and on her cheek trembled something, like the
          <lb/>glow of the morning sky when it expects the Sun. I be­
          <lb/>held her, and exulted in the joy of my commander. Half
          <lb/>our journey was already achieved. I led on slowly, lest

          <lb/>weariness should cast a shade over the tender, and beau­
          <lb/>tiful. Suddenly, issuing from the woods, a party of <rs type="properAdjective">Cana­
          <lb/>dian</rs> <name>Indians</name> intercepted our path. They had learnt, from
          <lb/>the imprudence of one of my followers, the ample reward
          <lb/>which had been promised for slight service, and determin­
          <lb/>ed themselves to obtain it. Cutlasses clashed, and blood
          <lb/>flowed upon the earth. Foemen fell, with their hatchets
          <lb/>each in the other's head. All my party, but two, were
          <lb/>slain. More had fallen of the enemy, yet they still out­
          <lb/>numbered us. Their chief took the bridle of the maiden,
          <lb/>to lead her away. My blood boiled that he should win
          <lb/>the prize, which I had vowed to deliver myself. She had
          <lb/>fainted, and her face, like marble, lay upon the neck of
          <lb/>the animal who bore her. The rage of hell inspired me.
          <lb/>I cleft that beautiful head with my hatchet. The light
          <lb/>grey of the horse was stained with blood, and he fled,
          <lb/>affrighted, dragging the body. My opponent pursued him,
          <lb/>and tore off the scalp of the victim, with its shining tress­
          <lb/>es. I fought with him a long, and furious contest. My
          <lb/>blood flowed, but I snatched the trophy from his dying
          <lb/>hand, and turned not away until I had cut him in pieces.
          <lb/>I seemed to accomplish the remainder of my journey in
          <lb/>an instant. The flames of passion consumed thought, and
          <lb/>bore me forward as on an eagle's wings.</p>
          <p>The sun arose as I returned to camp. The morn­
          <lb/>ing was bright, as the hopes of the bridegroom. I met
          <lb/>him, coming from his tent with the priest who was to
          <lb/>sanction his vows. Ere he could speak, I held the scalp

          <pb n="131"/><milestone unit="sig" n="11(6)r"/>

          <lb/>before him. He knew those dark locks, and fell to the
          <lb/>earth, as if in death. I was hurried to prison by enraged
          <lb/>soldiers, who wished to tear me in pieces on the spot.
          <lb/>So blinded had I been in the heat of battle, that I had ex­
          <lb/>pected my chief would commend me for courage, and
          <lb/>firmness in his cause, even amid his disappointment. I
          <lb/>believed that I had done my duty being faithful to my
          <lb/>vow, that no hand but mine should bring the maiden,
          <lb/>whether living or dead. Thus an apostle thought he was
          <lb/>doing God service, by persecuting and destroying the
          <lb/>saints. But, in my miserable dungeon, I had leisure for
          <lb/>reflection. There, I learned that <persName>General Burgoyne</persName> had
          <lb/>condemned to death all he survivers of both parties, and
          <lb/>that our execution was delayed only till two of the fugi­
          <lb/>tives were found, who had concealed themselves in the
          <lb/>forests. Two dreary nights passed over me in my loath­
          <lb/>some cell. On the third, <persName>Father Paul</persName> stood beside me.
          <lb/>The terrible deed had reached him, and he travelled
          <lb/>over the space that divided us, to visit a wretch in bonds.
          <lb/>I prostrated myself upon the earth before him, and made
          <lb/>my confession. <said>Knowest thou,</said> he said, <said>That the next
          <lb/>sun will rise upon thy corpse, hanging disgracefully be­
          <lb/>tween the earth and heaven? It must not be, that a son
          <lb/>of the holy Church, should thus be a spectacle for the
          <lb/>scorn of heretics. She commands thy rescue. I have
          <lb/>achieved it. With me is a <rs type="properAdjective">Canadian</rs> native, an obstinate
          <lb/>scoffer at the high mysteries of our faith. He is to enter
          <lb/>thy cell, and assume thy garb. Thou art to pass outward

          <lb/>strategem. The goaler is bribed to my interest, and ere
          <lb/>morning thou mayest be far from the steps of thy pursu­
          <lb/>ers.</said> <said>Life is sweet,</said> I answered,—ashamed of my own
          <lb/>weakness.<choice><sic>”</sic><corr/></choice> <said rend="pre()">But holy Father, what service have I render­
          <lb/>ed this man, that he should willingly give his life for

          <lb/>er Paul</persName>, <said>He is my servant, I have required him to re­
          <lb/>main in this cell, all night, and thou mayest go forth with
          <lb/>me to perform a vow. He thinks that, ere morning, I
          <lb/>shall liberate him. Long have I laboured for his conver­
          <lb/>sion in vain. <orgName>The Holy Inquisition</orgName> would condemn him
          <lb/>to the rack, for blasphemies against the mass. Merci­
          <lb/>fully I substitute a milder death. Thy execution is ap­
          <lb/>pointed at the hour, when the murder was committed.
          <lb/>At this early season, it is possible that the deception may

          <lb/>that he will be unable to make protestations of innocence,
          <lb/>perhaps will be unconscious of the scene. At any rate
          <lb/>thou must escape as far as possible, under cover of the
          <lb/>night. I shall commence, with equal speed, a tour of in­
          <lb/>struction among the uncivilized natives. Turn thy steps
          <lb/>toward thy kindred, and native country. And now,</said> he
          <lb/>added, with a deep solemnity, <said>kneel, and receive the
          <lb/>doom of penance, with which thine absolution is purchas­
          <lb/>ed. Throughout the war, lift thy hand upon neither side.
          <lb/>Seek out some lonely cell, and live like the imprisoned

          <lb/>don thy sins.</said> I departed, but my heart accused me, for
          <lb/>leaving behind the unsuspicious <name>Canadian</name>. Yet I knew
          <lb/>that <persName>Father Paul</persName> would command nothing but what was
          <lb/>right, and he was to me in the place of God. Every au­
          <lb/>tumn, when the harvest moon lifted her horn, I have gone
          <lb/>to him with my bleeding feet, beseeching him to absolve
          <lb/>me, and have returned to my cave when the white man
          <lb/>traces his first furrow on the earth. My last pilgrimage
          <lb/>was performed with difficulty. Thorns mangled my feet,
          <lb/>and the stormy blasts scattered my few white hairs. I
          <lb/>arrived, but he whom I sought was not there. Three
          <lb/>days and nights I lay upon his grave, until I saw high vis­
          <lb/>ions, and heard voices which I may not utter. Methought
          <lb/>I stood in the midst of a pale assembly, and was about
          <lb/>to speak. Chilling eyes gazed on me, and I saw that I
          <lb/>was surrounded by the dead. Yet they clamoured with
          <lb/>hollow voices, <said>he is one of us,</said> and a fearful tone from
          <lb/>beneath said,—<said>Come!</said> Then I knew I was to die. I
          <lb/>returned to my cavern, and increased my penance. With­
          <lb/>ered roots, and water were my sustenance, and every hour
          <lb/>in the day, and night, I told my beads. Ah! little do ye
          <lb/>know the torments of a sinful soul, propitating its Maker.
          <lb/>I have prayed, until my cavern was thick set with faces,
          <lb/>and with fiery eyes; so that midnight was light about me.
          <lb/>Sometimes they have deafened me with peals of hellish
          <lb/>laughter, but when they have tried to rivet their burning

          <p><persName>Maurice</persName> relapsed into deep silence, but resolutely re­
          <lb/>fused whatever they held to his lips. <persName>Mr. Occom</persName> lifted
          <lb/>his voice in earnest prayer for the sinful, and apparently
          <lb/>departing soul. His auditors pressed near to him, as the
          <lb/>flock in fear or danger surround their shepherd. During
          <lb/>the orison, the features of <persName>Maurice</persName> were convulsed, and
          <lb/>vehement, but unintelligible exclamations burst from his
          <lb/>quivering lips. Soon after its close, he started up in the
          <lb/>bed, throwing his hands into violent action, as if contend­
          <lb/>ing with enemies in the air. His eyes flamed with rage,
          <lb/>even when they were frozen in their sockets by the ice of
          <lb/>death. Large drops started over his distorted forehead,
          <lb/>but the horrible convulsion was short. Sinking down, he
          <lb/>set his teeth firmly, as if in mortal combat, and clenching
          <lb/>the crucifix in his rigid hand—expired.</p>

          <lb/>graceful circles upon a surface of ice, now resigned the
          <lb/>instruments of their favourite sports. Those, who had
          <lb/>been nurtured in the economical habits of their fathers,
          <lb/>restored to the accustomed peg in the barn, or tool-house,
          <lb/>their sled and skates, carefully anointed with oil, as a pre­
          <lb/>servative of the wood, and the metal, which was entered into
          <lb/>their composition, covered with paper, as an additional
          <lb/>security against the rust. Some there are, in these modern

          <lb/>days, who would sneer at the plebeian toil, which seeks to
          <lb/>give a longer date to objects of such trifling value. Yet
          <lb/>those, who are most forward to tax with the name of mean­
          <lb/>ness that <quote>saving knowledge</quote> which they are too indo­
          <lb/>lent to practise, are not always more elevated above mer­
          <lb/>cenary motives, or more accessible to the claims of charity,
          <lb/>than those who, in a consistent economy, lay the foundation
          <lb/>of both justice and liberality.</p>
          <p>But we return, from this digression, to our original plan
          <lb/>of attending <persName>Madam L――</persName> on an excursion to the house
          <lb/>of her agriculturalist. The roads had not yet attained that
          <lb/>settled state, when a ride may be considered a pleasure;
          <lb/>yet she did not hesitate whether on that account she should
          <lb/>defer the business which she wished to transact. She
          <lb/>had not been educated when it was a test of sensibility to
          <lb/>be alarmed at every imaginary danger, or a mark of re­
          <lb/>finement to magnify every trifling inconvenience.</p>
          <p>It was one of those fine mornings, in which a softer sea­
          <lb/>son makes its first effectual resistance against the lingering
          <lb/>claims of winter; like a buxom infant springing from the
          <lb/>arms of a wrinkled dame, whose caresses chill it. Still
          <lb/>the influence of the Sire of Storms was perceptible. The
          <lb/>small streams moved but torpidly, between margins of ice,
          <lb/>or beneath a thin veil which might have hidden their pro­
          <lb/>gress, had it not been revealed by a cold, subterranean
          <lb/>murmuring. Over the larger rivers small boats were seen
          <lb/>gliding, while their cheerful navigators repelled with long
          <lb/>poles those masses of ice which essayed too near an ap­

          <lb/>proach; or supporting themselves on their slippery sur­
          <lb/>face, collected the drift-wood which adhered to them.
          <lb/>Other labourers were busily employed in replacing
          <lb/>bridges, which the swollen waters had injured or destroy­
          <lb/>ed; for seldom did the spring-tide floods pass <placeName>N――</placeName>,
          <lb/>but the faces of the inhabitants gathered gloom from the
          <lb/>prospect of an additional weight of taxation. While the
          <lb/>solitary amateur admired the wrath of the resounding
          <lb/>streams, the richer, and less romantic burgher would
          <lb/>calculate the cost, like <persName>Marlow</persName> in the well-furnished inn,
          <lb/>apprehending, <quote type="paraphrase">how horridly a fine side-board, and mar­
          <lb/>ble chimney-piece would swell the reckoning.</quote> But the
          <lb/>labourers, who had nothing to pay, and foresaw gain from
          <lb/>being employed about broken bridges, and dilapitated
          <lb/>fences, contented themselves with lamenting, in a less
          <lb/>rueful tone, the evils of their almost insular situation. Con­
          <lb/>siderable loss and suffering had frequently been sustained
          <lb/>in the southern extreme of the town, which occupied the
          <lb/>ground at the junction of the two principal rivers. These
          <lb/>waters, when swollen by dissolving snows, and the in­
          <lb/>creased revenue of their tributaries, came rushing down
          <lb/>with great power. Inundated streets, merchants lament­
          <lb/>ing the loss of their goods, and sometimes of the ware­
          <lb/>houses which contained them; or millers gazing with up­
          <lb/>lifted hands after their floating fabrics, attested the ravages
          <lb/>of the triumphant flood. Here and there, the sharp eaves
          <lb/>of a fisherman's hut, or the upper story of some building
          <lb/>of larger dimensions would rise above the encompassing

          <mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">12*</mw>

          <lb/>element; while the boats employed to take from their
          <lb/>windows the sick, or the softer sex, encountered continual
          <lb/>obstacles from trees partly immersed, and fences planted
          <lb/>like <foreign xml:lang="fr" rend="slant(italic)">chevaux de frise</foreign>, beneath the treacherous waters.</p>
          <p>Occasionally, a bridge from some neighbouring town
          <lb/>has been borne along, a reluctant visiter; in one instance
          <lb/>a structure of this sort glided by, displaying in unbroken
          <lb/>majesty a toll-gate, upon whose top most bar, a red-wing'd
          <lb/>cockerel was perched. Having evinced his fidelity to his
          <lb/>favourite roost, by adhering to it during all the shocks of
          <lb/>its midnight disruption, morn beheld the undaunted bird,
          <lb/>clapping his wings as he passed the town, and sending
          <lb/>forth shrill notes of triumph, from excitement at his extra­
          <lb/>ordinary voyage of discovery.</p>
          <p>Once, an infant, in his cradle-ark, suddenly washed from
          <lb/>the cabin of his slumbering parents, glided over the bosom
          <lb/>of the pitiless surge. He was rescued—not by the daugh­
          <lb/>ter of Pharoah, and her maidens, but by the father urging
          <lb/>on his light boat with eager strokes, while the mother,
          <lb/>not standing <quote>among the flags by the river's brink,</quote> but
          <lb/>wading unconsciously into the cold, slippery channel,
          <lb/>received with extended arms, the babe smiling as he
          <lb/>awoke.</p>
          <p>But the Spring, which we describe, had witnessed no
          <lb/>uncommon accident. On the contrary, the breaking up
          <lb/>of the frosts of Winter had been peculiarly favourable.
          <lb/>The course of <persName>Madam L――</persName>, being directed toward the
          <lb/>west, led her gradually from the vicinity of the larger

          <lb/>rivers, into a country, beautifully peninsulated by small
          <lb/>winding streamlets. Already the turf, seen through melt­
          <lb/>ing snows, shewed the first tints of its mantle of green,
          <lb/>seemingly to promise early vegetation.</p>
          <p>The trees with their swelling buds confessed the action
          <lb/>of genial warmth, and the squirrel issuing from his nest at
          <lb/>their roots, eyed the traveller for a moment, ere he com­
          <lb/>menced his half aerial course. The blue-bird sent forth a
          <lb/>few clear notes, as if to remind his more tardy compan­
          <lb/>ions, that the <quote>time of the singing of birds has come.</quote></p>
          <p><persName>Madam L――</persName> was attentive to every change of nature,
          <lb/>whose works she loved. In her heart was a perpetual
          <lb/>spring of cheerfulness, which, throwing a charm over
          <lb/>every season, rendered her peculiarly susceptible to the
          <lb/>delights of that which was now unfolding, so redolent,
          <lb/>and full of the Creator's beauty. Her ride, which ex­
          <lb/>tended to the distance of about five miles, and which it
          <lb/>has been mentioned was directed to the house of her farm­
          <lb/>er, did not terminate until the sun had a little passed the
          <lb/>meridian. She had paused for some time at the abode of
          <lb/>good <persName>Mrs. Rawson</persName>, which was on the road; for, as usual,
          <lb/>charity constituted a part of the business which had led
          <lb/>her from home. Finding one of the children sick, she
          <lb/>had remained so long at the dwelling of poverty, that she
          <lb/>thought it probable she might reach <persName>Farmer Larkin's</persName> at
          <lb/>the time of his recess from labour at noon. Her equip­
          <lb/>age, which moved rather slowly, was a chaise, whose
          <lb/>form displayed none of the light and graceful elegance of

          <mw type="pageNum">140</mw>

          <lb/>modern times. Its heavy body was painted a dun yellow,
          <lb/>and studded thick at the sides, and edges with brass nails.
          <lb/>This supported a top, whose wide and low dimensions
          <lb/>jutted over in so portentous a manner, that had a person
          <lb/>of the height of six feet essayed to be benefitted by its
          <lb/>shelter, he must have persisted in maintaining that alti­
          <lb/>tude, which <persName>Dr. Franklin</persName> recommended to those who
          <lb/>would enter his study. Its clumsy footstep, and uncurved
          <lb/>shaft was so near the ground, as greatly to facilitate the
          <lb/>exploit of ascending, and likewise to diminish the danger
          <lb/>of a fall, in case of accident. This vehicle, which was of
          <lb/>venerable antiquity, was the first of its kind which had
          <lb/>been seen in the streets of <placeName>N――</placeName>. In those early days, it was
          <lb/>viewed as a lamentable proof of aristocratic pride, par­
          <lb/>ticularly as on the back might be traced the semblance of
          <lb/>a coat of arms. It was now so much reverenced by its
          <lb/>owner, that she could never consent to subject it to those
          <lb/>changes of fashion, which the taste of her younger friends
          <lb/>suggested. To her there was a sacredness, even in the
          <lb/>form of whatever had administered to the comfort of the
          <lb/>departed, and the beloved. She loved better to lay her
          <lb/>hand where theirs had lain, than to bury it amid the gar­
          <lb/>niture of a gorgeous coach. Such also was the good
          <lb/>sense of her <choice><sic>cotemporaries</sic><corr>contemporaries</corr></choice>, that they bowed not to her
          <lb/>with slighter respect, nor pointed her out to strangers with
          <lb/>less enthusiasm, because she declined to make her equip­
          <lb/>age the herald of her wealth, or the sole interpreter of
          <lb/>her merit. It was drawn by a heavy black steed, who,

          <pb n="141"/><milestone unit="sig" n="12(5)r"/>

          <lb/>some fifteen years before, had been in his prime, and who
          <lb/>had as much the habit of stopping at the abodes of pover­
          <lb/>ty, as <persName>Peveril's</persName> <name>Black Hastings</name> had of turning towards the
          <lb/>window of mourning.</p>
          <p>He was also cherished by his kind mistress, for the same
          <lb/>reason that she valued the vehicle to which he was har­
          <lb/>nessed.</p>
          <p><said>He is like me,</said> she would sometimes say, <said>in hav­
          <lb/>ing seen his best days, and I love to be reminded by that
          <lb/>faithful animal how deeply I have entered the vale of
          <lb/>years.</said></p>
          <p>Her attachment to this favoured servant seemed to be
          <lb/>reciprocal; for, when she occasionally visited him in his
          <lb/>abode, he would raise his long black visage from the
          <lb/>well-fill'd rack, and greet her with a loving sound, the
          <lb/>echo of the neigh of his better years. With his mane
          <lb/>some white hairs were mingling, and the elasticity of his
          <lb/>youthful step had changed into the heavy tramp of a load­
          <lb/>ed dray-horse; yet he was still strong and sure-footed,
          <lb/>and his clumsiness seemed as much the result of full feed­
          <lb/>ing, and want of exercise, as of the weight of age. In
          <lb/>summer, he was carefully guarded from the depredations
          <lb/>of flies by a net made of twine, while one of bleached cot­
          <lb/>ton with tassels and balls, exquisitely white, overshadow­
          <lb/>ed his huge frame, when he bore his load on <name>Sundays</name> to
          <lb/>the house of God.</p>
          <p>Such was the steed, and such was the equipage, which now
          <lb/>approached the abode of <persName>Mr. Larkin</persName>. It was a long, low

          <pb n="142"/><milestone unit="sig" n="12(5)v"/>
          <mw type="pageNum">142</mw>

          <lb/>unpainted house, with narrow casements, situated about
          <lb/>half a mile from the main road. Near it was a substan­
          <lb/>tial barn, surrounded by a large yard, where a number
          <lb/>of animals assembled exhibited an appearance of com­
          <lb/>fort, which denoted at once a kind and cheerful master.
          <lb/><persName>Cuffee</persName> alghting, removed the bars, which formed, or rath­
          <lb/>er obstructed, the rustic entrance to the demesne; and
          <lb/>then addressed a few soothing words to his horse, who ad­
          <lb/>vanced his head, and bent down his quivering ear, as if
          <lb/>the sounds of the human voice were either comprehend­
          <lb/>ed, or beloved.</p>
          <p>As <persName>Madam L――</persName> entered she heard, in the clattering
          <lb/>of knives and forks, the reason why she was not as usual
          <lb/>welcomed at the door. Unwilling to interrupt the re­
          <lb/>flection of the family, she took a seat unobserved. She
          <lb/>found herself in the best room of the mansion, but to this
          <lb/>the inhabitants of the neighbouring villages would assign,
          <lb/>neither the name of <soCalled rend="pre(“)post(”)">parlour, hall or drawing-room,</soCalled>
          <lb/>avoiding the example of their city acquaintance, as the
          <lb/>ancient reformers did the abominations of the <orgName>Church of
          <lb/>Rome</orgName>. Adhering to their habits of precision as tenacious­
          <lb/>ly as to their ideas of simplicity, they gave to this most
          <lb/>honourable room an appellation derived from its bearing
          <lb/>upon the cardinal points. The one under present consider­
          <lb/>ation, being visited by the latest beams of the setting sun,
          <lb/>and the first breathings of the summer breeze, was de­
          <lb/>nominated the <mcr rend="pre(“)post(”)">south-west room.</mcr> As the furniture of
          <lb/>this best apartment of <persName>Farmer Larkin</persName> may serve as a

          <lb/>sample of the interiour of most of the <foreign xml:lang="la">Sanctum Sancto­
          <lb/>rums</foreign> of the better sort of agriculturists at that early pe­
          <lb/>riod, it may be well to add a brief description.</p>
          <p>The bed, an indispensable appendage, was without ei­
          <lb/>ther curtains, or high posts, and decorated with a new
          <lb/>woollen coverlet, where the colour of red gorgeously pre­
          <lb/>dominated over the white and green, with which it was
          <lb/>intermingled. So small a space did it occupy, that if,
          <lb/>like <persName>Og</persName>, king of <placeName>Bashan</placeName>, whose gigantic height was pre­
          <lb/>dicated from his bedstead of nine cubits, the size of our
          <lb/>farmers should have been estimated by the dimensions of
          <lb/>their places of repose, posterity would do them immense
          <lb/>injustice.</p>
          <p>A buffet, or corner-cupboard was a conspicuous article,
          <lb/>in which were arranged a set of bright, pewter plates,
          <lb/>some red and white cups and saucers, not much larger
          <lb/>than what now belong to a doll's equipage, and a pyramidal
          <lb/>block-tin tea-pot. The lower compartment of this repos­
          <lb/>itory, which was protected by a door, furnished a recep­
          <lb/>tacle for the Sabbath-day hats and bonnets of the children,
          <lb/>each occupying its own place upon the shelves. In the
          <lb/>vicinity was what was denominated <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">a chist o' draws,</quote>
          <lb/>namely, a capacious vault of stained pine, which, opening
          <lb/>like a chest, contained the better part of the wardrobe of
          <lb/>the master and mistress of the family; while, beneath,
          <lb/>space was left for two or three drawers, devoted to the
          <lb/>accomodation of the elder children. But the master­
          <lb/>piece of finery was a tea-table, which, elevating its round

          <pb n="144"/><milestone unit="sig" n="12(6)v"/>

          <lb/>disk perpendicularly, evinced that it was more for show
          <lb/>than use.</p>
          <p>Its surface displayed a commendable lustre, protected
          <lb/>by a penal statute from the fingers of the children. But
          <lb/>an unruly kitten used to take delight in viewing, on the
          <lb/>lower extremity of that polished orb, a reflection of her
          <lb/>own round face, and formidable whiskers. Unhappily mis­
          <lb/>taking the appearance of these for an adversary, she im­
          <lb/>printed thereon the marks of her claws, too deeply for all
          <lb/>the efforts of the good housewife to efface, and soon after
          <lb/>expiated her crime upon the scaffold. A looking-glass,
          <lb/>much smaller than the broad expansion of the Farmer's
          <lb/>face, hung against the roughly plastered, yet unsullied
          <lb/>wall. A few high, strait-back'd chairs, and a pair of
          <lb/>small andirons nicely black'd, whose heads bore a rude
          <lb/>resemblance to the <quote>human form divine,</quote> completed the
          <lb/>inventory of goods and chattels. Over the low, wide fire­
          <lb/>place, hung in a black frame, without the superfluity of
          <lb/>a glass, the family record, legibly penned, with a space
          <lb/>very considerately left for future additions. The apart­
          <lb/>ment had an air of neatness, beyond what was then gener­
          <lb/>ally observed in the houses of those who made the dairy,
          <lb/>and spinning-wheel, their prime objects of attention.
          <lb/>The white floor was carefully sanded, and at each door a
          <lb/>broad mat, made of the husks of the <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> corn, claim­
          <lb/>ed tribute from the feet of those who entered. Where
          <lb/><persName>Madam L――</persName> was seated, she had a full view of the fam­
          <lb/>ily, surrounding their peaceful board, and so cordially en­

          <lb/>gaged in doing justice to its viands, that not a glance
          <lb/>wandered to the spot which she occupied.</p>
          <p>The table, covered with a coarse white cloth, bore at
          <lb/>the head a large supply of boiled beef, and pork, served
          <lb/>up in a huge dish of glazed ware, of a form between
          <lb/>platter and bowl, though it probably would rank with the
          <lb/>latter genus. A mass of very fine cabbage appeared in
          <lb/>the same reservoir, like  a broad, emerald islet, flanked
          <lb/>with parsnips and turnips, the favourite <quote rend="pre(“)post(”)">long and short
          <lb/>saace</quote> of the day. At the bottom of the board was an
          <lb/>enormous pudding of <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> meal, supported by its legit­
          <lb/>imate concomitants, a plate of butter, and jug of molas­
          <lb/>ses. Four brown mugs of cider, divided into equal
          <lb/>compartments the quadrangle of the board, and the wood­
          <lb/>ed trenchers, which each one manfully maintained, were
          <lb/>perfectly clean and comfortable.</p>
          <p><persName>Farmer Larkin</persName>, and his wife, not deeming it a point of
          <lb/>etiquette to seperate as far as the limits of the table would
          <lb/>permit, shared together the post of honour by the dish of
          <lb/>meat. At the left hand of the father, sat his youngest son,
          <lb/>and at the right hand of the mother, her youngest daugh­
          <lb/>ter. Thus the male line, beginning at <persName>Jehu</persName>, and touching
          <lb/>every one according to his age, passed over the heads of
          <lb/><persName>Timothy</persName> and <persName>Jehoiakim</persName>, ending in <persName>Amariah</persName>, the nephew,
          <lb/>and would-be <name>Methodist</name>. On the other hand, the female
          <lb/>line, from the mother, who held in her lap the chubbed
          <lb/><persName>Tryphosa</persName>, passed with geometrical precision through the
          <lb/>spaces allotted to <persName>Tryphena</persName>, <persName>Keziah</persName>, <persName>Roxey</persName> and <persName>Reuey</persName>,

          <lb/>terminating with buxom <persName>Molly</persName>. She was indeed a damsel
          <lb/>of formidable size, but of just proportions, and employ­
          <lb/>ed her brawny arm, in cutting slices from a large loaf of
          <lb/>brown bread, which she distributed with great exactness
          <lb/>by each trencher, as soon as her father had stocked it with
          <lb/>meat, and her mother garnished it with vegetables. There
          <lb/>was something pleasing in the sight of so many healthy
          <lb/>and cheerful faces, and in the domestic order which evi­
          <lb/>dently prevailed. The first course past in silence, except
          <lb/>that <persName>Farmer Larkin</persName> said to his wife,—</p>
          <p><said>Do pray, Mammy, put down <persName>Tryphosa</persName> on the floor,
          <lb/>and give her a crust o' bread to gnaw. I can't bear to
          <lb/>see ye always a carryin' some burden or other, so that ye
          <lb/>get no rest even at meal times.</said></p>
          <p>The wife obediently placed the plump infant in a hum­
          <lb/>bler station, who lifed up its broad blue eyes, as if it
          <lb/>thought itself aggrieved, until the father reaching it a piece
          <lb/>of bread, said,—<said>there, baby, larn to take care o' your­
          <lb/>self.</said></p>
          <p>It soon became so much absorbed with its fragment of
          <lb/>the staff of life, as to make no overtures to return to the
          <lb/>arms of <choice><sic>it</sic><corr>its</corr></choice> mother. In a short time, each trencher, neatly
          <lb/>scraped, was presented to <persName>Molly</persName> for a slice of the pudding
          <lb/>in her vicinity, to which <persName>Amariah</persName> carefully added the us­
          <lb/>ual condiments. When <persName>Tim's</persName> plate, in due rotation, was
          <lb/>replenished, the farmer said,—</p>
          <p><said><persName>Amariah</persName>, that boy did not do his ta-a-sk this mornin'.
          <lb/>Don't ye put any lasses on his puddin'. Lazy folks

          <lb/>sha-ant fare so well as others in my house. That's right
          <lb/>an't it <persName>Tim</persName>, to larn ye to be industrious?</said></p>
          <p><said>Yes Father,</said> said the boy, eating his dry pudding
          <lb/>without complaint, and with the air of one who intended
          <lb/>to profit by the justice which he acknowledged. The meal
          <lb/>was accompanied by a few questions from the parents, to
          <lb/>which the younger members returned brief answers; but
          <lb/>refrained from holding light conversation among them­
          <lb/>selves, with far greater sense of propriety, than is always
          <lb/>witnessed at the tables of the professedly polite. At the
          <lb/>close of the repast, the Father, bowing his head, uttered
          <lb/>brief but hearty thanks to the Giver of all Mercies, during
          <lb/>which even the youngest children stood as if in an act of
          <lb/>devotion. They had been taught that the food of each
          <lb/>day, however homely, was a favour; that it was both a
          <lb/>duty and pleasure to thank Him who bestowed it; and
          <lb/>that it was sinful to do this with a light, irreverent deport­
          <lb/>ment. <persName>Madam L――</persName>, touched at this scene of domestic
          <lb/>order, harmony and devotion, though that the careless,
          <lb/>the proud, or the epicure, who would scorn these humble
          <lb/>inmates, might still receive from them a salutary lesson.
          <lb/>Perchance, in her mind was a train of thought, similar to
          <lb/>what inspired the ploughman-poet, when he exclaimed—

          <lb/>As she came forward from the apartment, where she had

          <lb/>cordial delight by every individual. The good Farmer
          <lb/>approached with a fervent welcome tempered with re­
          <lb/>spect, and the matron with an apology for not having met
          <lb/>her at the door, little imagining that she had so long been
          <lb/>their guest. Bows and court'sies multiplied among the
          <lb/>junior class, as they were kindly addressed by the Lady.
          <lb/><persName>Molly</persName> produced with great rapidity a plate of <mcr rend="slant(italic)">nut-cakes</mcr>
          <lb/>and cheese, a basket of fine apples, and a glass of metheg­
          <lb/>lin. <persName>Roxey</persName> and <persName>Reuey</persName> ran to add a <said>saacer of presarved
          <lb/>barberries,</said> from the jar, which was filled with fruit
          <lb/>gathered and prepared by their own hands, for a dessert
          <lb/>on extraordinary occasion. <persName>Jehoiakim</persName> also hastened to
          <lb/>convey refreshments to <persName>Cuffee</persName>, who in turn presented him
          <lb/>with some grafts from the <name>Vergaloue</name>, the <name>Bennet</name>, and the
          <lb/><name>Winter Pear</name>, eulogizing their respective merits; and not
          <lb/>forgetting to add, that his Mistress had <said>eight bery large
          <lb/>fine tree, most hundred year old.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Mrs. Larkin</persName>, after the Lady had concluded her business
          <lb/>with her husband, was anxious to shew her dairy, where
          <lb/>the large cheeses, turned and rubbed daily by her own
          <lb/>hands, and the stores of gold-coloured butter, arranged
          <lb/>with perfect neatness, attested her industry, and good
          <lb/>housewifery. <persName>Madam L――</persName> took pleasure in conversing
          <lb/>with this worthy family, where each fulfilled their part,
          <lb/>with such faithfulness, and harmony. She distributed to
          <lb/>each of the children some little present adapted to their
          <lb/>age. To the older ones she gave books, after questioning
          <lb/>them on the contents of those which she had last present­

          <lb/>ed, and expressing satisfaction that they had been pre­
          <lb/>served with so much attention. To <persName>Amariah</persName> she gave a
          <lb/><title>New Testament</title>, saying with kindness, that she had
          <lb/>marked with a pencil some passages which she thought
          <lb/>applicable to him, and doubted not that he would per­
          <lb/>ceive that religion was confined to no particular sect, but
          <lb/>was valued in the eye of the Almighty according to its
          <lb/>effects upon the heart and life. Amid expressions of
          <lb/>sincere gratitude and affection from all, she took her
          <lb/>leave, with more heartfelt satisfaction that is found among
          <lb/>the courtly pomp of a ceremonious party;

          <p>Such, forty years since, were most of the agriculturalists,
          <lb/>who tenanted the lands of others in the villages of <placeName>Con­
          <lb/>necticut</placeName>. Uncorrupt integrity, and reverence for religion
          <lb/>were their distinguishing characteristics; and their fami­
          <lb/>lies were nurtured in that industry, and subordination,
          <lb/>which are the germs of the strength and peace of commu­
          <lb/>nities. By no profession might that beautiful passage of
          <lb/>inspiration be with more justice assumed as a motto, <quote>in
          <lb/>simplicity, and godly sincerity we have our conversation
          <lb/>in the world.</quote></p>
          <p>Since that period, those luxuries and refinements, which
          <lb/>spread so rapidly in our cities, have pervaded, in some
          <lb/>degree, the abodes of the tillers of the earth. They are
          <lb/>becoming a more enlightened race than their fathers, and
          <lb/>from their habitations have issued some of our most dis­

          <lb/>tinguished merchants, statesmen and divines. Their sons
          <lb/>have been distinguished in our seminaries of science, for
          <lb/>the zeal with which they have pursued knowledge, and
          <lb/>the indefatigable application with which they have suppli­
          <lb/>ed the defects of early culture. When the sons of rich men,
          <lb/>languid from indulgence, have shrunk from mental effort
          <lb/>as insupportable hardship, and fallen a prey to those vices
          <lb/>which indolence creates, the offspring of those who hold
          <lb/>the plough have wrested from their feeble hands the prize
          <lb/>of honour, and pressed on in the path of their country's
          <lb/>praise and pride. There is, in the pursuits of agriculture,
          <lb/>a salutatory discipline both for the body and mind, as they
          <lb/>are gradually developed. That hardihood of frame, which
          <lb/>despises privation, or change of elements, is more conge­
          <lb/>nial to elevation of character, than the enervating nurture
          <lb/>of patrician families, where animal tastes are pampered,
          <lb/>at the expense of vigour and intellect, and ease of body
          <lb/>promoted, even to the bondage of the free spirit. Possi­
          <lb/>bly also, in the simplicity of man's primeval occupation,
          <lb/>there may be, like the angels hovering over <placeName>Eden</placeName>, natural
          <lb/>and invisible guards around the avenues of innocence,
          <lb/>cheerfulness, and that religion which springs from a view
          <lb/>of the Creator in his works.</p>
          <p>Agriculture has been, in the <placeName>New-England States</placeName>, a
          <lb/>source of wealth, less splendid indeed than some others,
          <lb/>but far less fluctuating. It has been a fountain, not always
          <lb/>as profuse in its streams as avarice or ambition might de­
          <lb/>sire, but perennial when sought by industry and pru­

          <lb/>dence. How frequently does it happen, in our republican
          <lb/>government, that a fortune, acquired by the economical
          <lb/>agriculturalist, furnishes the means of vanity and pride to
          <lb/>his son; who, removing to the city, and educating his
          <lb/>children in indolence, prepares them to squander the in­
          <lb/>heritance of their ancestors. The next generation, born
          <lb/>in poverty, seek an antidote in labour, and find that <quote>tide
          <lb/>in the affairs of men, which taken at the flood leads on to
          <lb/>fortune.</quote></p>
          <p>Many such instances had fallen under the observation
          <lb/>of <persName>Madam L――</persName>, and her silent reflections upon them
          <lb/>were not interrupted, until her approach to the Turnpike,
          <lb/>a few miles from her residence. There she saw an un­
          <lb/>usual bustle, and heard the tones of the red-faced gate­
          <lb/>keeper, elevated like the hoarse croak of a raven. But
          <lb/>these were overpowered by the loud brogue of an <name>Irish­
          <lb/>man</name> of enormous stature, who mounted on a pony ready
          <lb/>to sink beneath the weight of the rider, contested the rate
          <lb/>of toll:—</p>
          <p><said>I tell ye, I'll not be paying nine-pence for travel­

          <p><said>Zounds!</said> roared the sturdy, square shouldered <name>Eng­
          <lb/>lishman</name>, lifting up his shoemaker's hammer, by the aid of

          <p><said>Of what use, my <distinct>dair</distinct>,</said> said <persName>Paddy</persName> without regard­
          <lb/>ing the threat, <said>of what use is that sort of a whirligig
          <lb/>thing, which bears some indifferent likeness to the cross of
          <lb/><persName>St. Patrick</persName>?</said></p>
          <p><said>It is the wicket, where people on foot go through for
          <lb/>nothing,</said> replied the toll-keeper, approaching to shut the
          <lb/>gate, which, not apprehending any contention, he had
          <lb/>thrown open at the arrival of the passenger. But <persName>Paddy</persName>,
          <lb/>dismounting with as much haste, as <persName>Lord Marmion</persName> dis­
          <lb/>played in clearing the falling portcullis of the indignant
          <lb/><persName>Earl of <placeName>Douglas</placeName></persName>, threw his arms round his shadow of a
          <lb/>steed, and lifted him fairly over the debateable ground.
          <lb/>Then turning about, he walked through the wicket, and
          <lb/>resuming his seat upon the wretched animal, shouted to
          <lb/>the amazed toll-keeper,—</p>
          <p><said>If a man may walk through your limboes by himself,
          <lb/>without any burden at all, for nothing, my jewel, should
          <lb/>not he be desarving of some pay, when he carries a
          <lb/>baste upon his shoulders? And so, ye're so covetous in

          <lb/>and in the world, just to be travelling through this wilder­
          <lb/>ness among thieves, and lubberly pickpockets.</said></p>
          <p>Without waiting to hear the torrent of recrimination,
          <lb/>which burst from the lips of the baffled toll-gatherer, he
          <lb/>pursued his journey, with a peal of laughter, which echo­
          <lb/>ed from the surrounding rocks and woods, as if a colony
          <lb/>of <name>Hiberians</name> were mocking from beneath their canopy.

          <lb/>found a kind reception at the mansion of <persName>Madam L――</persName>.
          <lb/>They were accustomed to point it out at a distance, as the
          <lb/>weary traveller recognizes the house of refreshment, and
          <lb/>repose. Here they knew that their wants would be re­
          <lb/>lieved, and their simple industry promoted. It might be
          <lb/>said that they were encouraged here to hold an annual
          <lb/>convention. A custom was established by our pious an­
          <lb/>cestors, immediately after the settlement of <placeName>New-England</placeName>,
          <lb/>of setting apart a day in Autumn, for publick and private
          <lb/>gratitude to the Giver of all good. This, which might
          <lb/>originally have been intended as an imitation of the <rs type="properAdjective">Israel­
          <lb/>itish</rs> festival of in-gathering, had been gradually lowered,
          <lb/>by the interpretations of their descendants, from a day of
          <lb/>sacred gratitude, to one of good eating and drinking. Still
          <lb/>there were connected with it many cheerful, and interest­
          <lb/>ing associations; the return of absent children, the union
          <lb/>of dispersed families around the domestick altar, and the
          <lb/>offering of praise, by the ministers of religion, to the Fa­
          <lb/>ther of all. This was a season, when anciently the rich
          <lb/>remembered the poor, and sent portions from their own

          <lb/>tables to the needy. It was the practice in the house­
          <lb/>hold of <persName>Madam L――</persName> to make a large quantity of pastry,
          <lb/>expressly for the natives of <placeName>Mohegan</placeName>. This secured an
          <lb/>almost universal attendance of the females, who holding
          <lb/>a neat basket of their own manufacture, would thankfully
          <lb/>receive it in the luxury for their expectant families. It
          <lb/>was pleasant to <persName>Madam L――</persName> to see their dark red brows
          <lb/>beam with gentle feelings, and to hear them speaking in

          <lb/>who accompanied them. She knew each by name, and
          <lb/>they would gaze upon her, with the most reverent, and
          <lb/>trusting affection, when she addressed them. This peo­
          <lb/>ple are reserved on the subject of their necessities. They
          <lb/>view the wealth of the whites, without envy, or desire of
          <lb/>personal appropriation. If they have been denominated
          <lb/>the <soCalled rend="pre(“)post(”)">nation of poverty,</soCalled> they could never have been
          <lb/>justly styled a nation of beggars. Their little store they
          <lb/>freely impart to the wants of another, and cultivate hospi­
          <lb/>tality as faithfully as they cherish gratitude. By that
          <lb/>sympathy with which a benevolent female enters into the
          <lb/>hearts of her own sex, <persName>Madam L――</persName> became so well ac­
          <lb/>quainted with the respective characters of her pensioners,

          <lb/>or other useful articles, which at this season she prepared
          <lb/>for them. They possessed so humble a spirit of gratitude
          <lb/>for the gifts bestowed, that none was disposed to cavil if
          <lb/>the portion of her neighbour seemed more valuable; or to
          <lb/>doubt the wisdom of the giver, in doing <quote>what she would

          <lb/>bounty, and in that which was allotted to others; and
          <lb/>venerated, as a benefactress, her who regarded with inter­

          <p>One morning, <persName>Mr. Occom</persName>, and <persName>Robert Ashbow</persName> were
          <lb/>announced, the minister and chieftain of the tribe. After
          <lb/>a little conversation, the former said—</p>
          <p><said>I come, Madam, to take leave of you, and in the
          <lb/>name of my nation, who depart with me, to give you
          <lb/>thanks for your continued kindness. A large part of them
          <lb/>have consented to accompany me to a tract of land, given
          <lb/>them by their brethren of the <name>Oneida</name> tribe, on the condi­
          <lb/>tion of their removing thither, and cultivating it.</said></p>
          <p><said>Is there not already land enough in their possession,
          <lb/>in this vicinity,</said> said the Lady, <said>for their subsistence,
          <lb/>if they would attend to its culture?</said></p>
          <p><said>Alas! Madam,</said> he replied, <said>my brethren are de­
          <lb/>generate plants. They are but shadows of their ancestors.
          <lb/>I wish to associate their broken spirits with others less
          <lb/>degraded. Peradventure the Almighty, upon this hum­
          <lb/>ble foundation, may yet build a temple to his praise.</said></p>
          <p><said>Do you accompany these emigrants?</said> inquired the
          <lb/>Lady of the Chief. His melancholy brow seemed to
          <lb/>gather darkness, as he answered haughtily—</p>
          <p><said>Ask the mother, if <emph>she</emph> forsakes the cradle of her son,
          <lb/>because disease hath wasted him? Does the bear scorn
          <lb/>to defend her cub, because the arrow of the hunter hath
          <lb/>wounded it? Does the bird hate her nest, while her

          <lb/>offspring are unfledg'd, and helpless? And should not man
          <lb/>be more merciful than beasts of the field, and wiser
          <lb/>than the fowls of heaven?</said></p>
          <p><said>You are not willing then,</said> she replied, <said>that your
          <lb/>tribe should seperate from the home of their Fathers.</said></p>
          <p><said>Lady!</said> said the chieftain sternly, <said><emph>that man</emph> hath
          <lb/>stood before me, day after day, urging, like the prophet
          <lb/>of <placeName>Israel</placeName>, let this people go. Like him of <placeName>Egypt</placeName> with the
          <lb/>harden'd heart, I long answered, I will <emph>not</emph> let them go.
          <lb/>But a decree was made plain to my soul. The terrible
          <lb/>blackness of prophecy unfolded itself. I saw written, the
          <lb/>dispersion of all our race. I was dumb. I opened not my
          <lb/>mouth for many days. Then in my bitterness I said—let
          <lb/>them go forth! Such as are for the sword, to the sword;
          <lb/>and such as are for the famine; to the famine; or to the
          <lb/>pestilence; or to the wild beast of the forest. Each, his
          <lb/>own way to the grave—let him go!</said></p>
          <p>There was a pause of some emotion, and the Chief
          <lb/>added mournfully—</p>
          <p><said>Long ere our doom was revealed to us, if began to be
          <lb/>accomplished. Where are the <name>Pequots</name>, once numerous
          <lb/>as the stars, whose strong holds ruled the waves of the
          <lb/>sea-coast? Where are the <name>Narragansetts</name>, the natural
          <lb/>enemies of our tribe? They vanished long before our nation,
          <lb/>as we now sink beneath yours. All are gone. All—save
          <lb/>a little chaff for the winds to sweep away. I would have
          <lb/>prevented this division of my perishing people. I would
          <lb/>have lifted my voice against it. The words of their Chief

          <pb n="159"/><milestone unit="sig" n="14(2)r"/>
          <mw type="pageNum">159</mw>

          <lb/>should have prevailed over those of the man of God. But
          <lb/>I saw that Fate had determined evil against us. The
          <lb/>shades of our fallen kings uttered in my ears. In the
          <lb/>darkness of night-visions, their voice hath entered my
          <lb/>soul. I heard it, as if winds murmured from some hollow
          <lb/>cave—<said rend="post()">Our people are water scattered upon the ground.
          <lb/>None shall gather it.</said></said></p>
          <p>There was an interval of silence, and then the Lady
          <lb/>expressed, to the unhappy chief, her good will for his
          <lb/>people. Not heeding the remark, he continued in the
          <lb/>same voice, as if pursuing an unbroken current of thought—</p>
          <p><said>Who shall break the chain that binds our race to de­
          <lb/>struction? Once, it might have been cut by the sword.
          <lb/>But where now is the arm of the warriour? Strength hath
          <lb/>perished from among the people. The avenging spirit
          <lb/>hath lifted his hand against us. Who can stay it? What
          <lb/>matters it, <emph>where</emph> he shall overtake us, whether upon
          <lb/>the mountain tops, or in the wilderness, or the forest,
          <lb/>where no ray hath penetrated? Wherever we flee, he will
          <lb/>follow, and fulfill the curse. Therefore have I consent­
          <lb/>ed to let my people go, whom else I would have com­
          <lb/>manded to shed the last drop of their blood on the tombs
          <lb/>of their fathers. But for me, though I should be left
          <lb/>alone, as a blasted tree upon the desolate rock, yet will I
          <lb/>stay, and pour my last breath where the death-sigh of
          <lb/>my kings arose.</said></p>
          <p><said>It would seem at first view,</said> said <persName>Mr. Occom</persName> <said>as

          <lb/>our race, as that of dispersion was executed upon the pe­
          <lb/>culiar people. Yet we hope in the mercy of Him, who
          <lb/><quote>hateth nothing that he has made.</quote> We pray that his
          <lb/>goodness may yet be manifested in the calling of us, <name>Gen­
          <lb/>tiles</name>. We trust, Madam, that your favoured race, who
          <lb/>are exalting the country to a glory which under us it could
          <lb/>never have known, will yet impress with civilization and
          <lb/><name>Christianity</name>, the features of our roving and degraded char­
          <lb/>acter. Then it will be but a small matter to have yield­
          <lb/>ed to you these perishable possessions, if through you,
          <lb/>we become heirs to the kingdom of heaven.</said></p>
          <p><said>Why are those,</said> said the Chief, <said>who expect an in­
          <lb/>heritance in the skies, so ready to quarrel about the earth,
          <lb/>their mother? Why are <name>Christians</name> so eager to wrest
          <lb/>from others lands, when they profess that it is <emph>gain</emph> for
          <lb/>them to leave all, and die? Ah! what hath been the sin
          <lb/>of our nation, above that of all other nations, that our
          <lb/>name must be blotted from among the living? For what
          <lb/>crime is our heritage taken away, and given to another
          <lb/>people? On the land which our fathers gave us, we may
          <lb/>not set our feet, except as strangers. Like shadows we
          <lb/>flee away to our sepulchres. Even these are no longer
          <lb/>ours. Monuments of those whom our fathers knew not,
          <lb/>are there, and the dust of the <name>Indian</name> is scattered by the
          <lb/>winds. Ere long, white men will cease to crush us, for

          <p><said>Did <emph>all</emph> our kings, and chiefs,</said> he inquired, <said>offend
          <lb/>the God of <name>Christians</name>? Why does he thus draw out his
          <lb/>anger to the latest generations? Are <emph>we</emph> sinners above all
          <lb/>men, that we are made as driven stubble before our ene­
          <lb/>mies?</said></p>
          <p><said>My brother speaks like a native,</said> said the minister
          <lb/>addressing the Lady. <said>Oh! that he may yet say as a
          <lb/><name>Christian</name>, though clouds and darkness are round about
          <lb/><name>Jehovah</name>, justice and judgement are the foundations of his
          <lb/>throne.</said></p>
          <p><said>God forbid!</said> said the Chief, <said>that <persName>Robert</persName> should
          <lb/>blame the religion of <name>Christians</name>. Shall the snow-wreath
          <lb/>lift itself against the sun-beam? But that religion is for
          <lb/>white men. The God, who ordained it, is angry at the
          <lb/>red man of the forest. He will frown upon him until he
          <lb/>die. Let him pray then to that Great Spirit who watched
          <lb/>over his fathers, whether his throne be amid the roll of
          <lb/>mighty waters, or where the tempest folds its wings.
          <lb/>The white man may seek the God who loveth him, who
          <lb/>hath given him a book from heaven, and continually call­
          <lb/>eth to the torn that he will heal, to the smitten that he
          <lb/>will bind him up. But where shall the poor <name>Indian</name> turn

          <lb/>him on through darkness, all his life long? He was hun­
          <lb/>gry, and his bow satisfied him. Thirsty, and drank of
          <lb/>the brook. He dies, and will <emph>He</emph>, who nourished his body,
          <lb/>slay his soul? <emph>Can</emph> the spirit, which <emph>He</emph> breathed into
          <lb/>clay, perish like the gale which sighs once, and is not?
          <lb/>Doth not the smoke <emph>ascend</emph>, and the cinders go downward
          <lb/>to the earth, when the fuel that fed the flame is consum­
          <lb/>ed?</said></p>
          <p><said>Connect your natural religion, with that which is re­
          <lb/>vealed from above,</said> said the Pastor. <said>Whether you
          <lb/>call <emph>Him</emph> who ruleth over all, the Great Spirit, or <name>Jeho­

          <lb/>promises of the gospel address themselves with more force,
          <lb/>than to a race like ours, homeless and despised?</said></p>
          <p><said>I know that the shades of my fathers live,</said> he repli­
          <lb/>ed, <said>but not in the white man's Heaven. On earth they
          <lb/>lived not as brothers, though <emph>ye say</emph> that one Father
          <lb/>created them. Ye say that in your Heaven, they <quote rend="post()">go

          <lb/>tells of the great city in Heaven, the <placeName>New-Jerusalem</placeName>,
          <lb/>which is built of pure gold. It is described with gates of
          <lb/>pearl, and the streets of transparent glass. <emph>Our</emph> Heaven is not
          <lb/>so. The poor <name>Indian</name> would fear to enter such a glorious
          <lb/>place. He is contented to lie down in the forest, whose
          <lb/>lofty columns prop the blue arch of the skies, and to see
          <lb/>the moon look forth in brightness from her midnight throne.

          <lb/>This is splendour enough for his untutor'd soul. He loves
          <lb/>not the pomp of cities. He loves better to stand on the

          <lb/>ocean, while the voice of its storms dies beneath his feet.
          <lb/>He loves to feel himself to be but a drop in its bosom,
          <lb/>swallowed up in the vast and awful creation. Ye say that
          <lb/>your <persName>Jehovah</persName> is a God of wisdom. Will he then carry to
          <lb/><emph>one place</emph> souls, which like contending elements, can have

          <lb/>Yet there is written a book of remembrance, and the right­

          <lb/>score and ten years were appointed him, yet but a short
          <lb/>time has elapsed, since he spoke to us from the pulpit.
          <lb/>The tones of his voice were dear to me, and his counten­
          <lb/>ance ever restored the memory of scenes of happiness, in
          <lb/>which his friendship had participated, or of affliction, in
          <lb/>which his piety had administered consolation.</said></p>
          <p><said>How majestic was his presence,</said> he answered,
          <lb/><said>when he enforced the obligations of conscience, and he
          <lb/>terrours of the law. He spoke with a power that forced
          <lb/>the guilty to tremble. With what an overflowing fullness
          <lb/>would his mind illustrate points, which the thoughtless had
          <lb/>deemed of minor importance? In prayer his solemnity
          <lb/>was so striking, that I think none could listen to him,
          <lb/>without revering that devotion by which he was inspir­
          <lb/>ed.</said></p>
          <p><said>I have been peculiarly impressed with this, my broth­
          <lb/>er, during the exciting events of our recent war. In his
          <lb/>humility for our occasional defeat, his gratitude for deliv­
          <lb/>erances, his thanksgiving at the result, he seemed to pour
          <lb/>out his whole soul, in that variety of sacred language,

          <lb/>undoubtedly be some to object to the strain of his devo­
          <lb/>tion. I have heard our departed minister censured for
          <lb/>credulity, because in one or two instances, he gave thanks
          <lb/>for victory, which afterwards proved a defeat. But, amid
          <lb/>the variety of rumours which, during our long war, often
          <lb/>deceived professed politicians, how could he be expected
          <lb/>always to discern between correct and false information;
          <lb/>he, whose integrity of soul would render him one of the
          <lb/>last to suspect others. I have recently heard, also, some
          <lb/>uneasiness expressed at the length of his sermons. It
          <lb/>seems that some of our audience have tutored their minds
          <lb/>to perform so skilfully the office of an hour-glass, that they
          <lb/>can ascertain the moment, when the speaker passes the
          <lb/>limit of sixty minutes. All beyond is to them weariness
          <lb/>and vanity. They are not indifferent to any other species
          <lb/>of gain; but <quote>goodly pearls without price</quote> are scorned
          <lb/>if they are presented in large numbers, or in a capacious
          <lb/>casket. Yet these cavillers are principally among the
          <lb/>younger part of our auditors, who have not yet attained
          <lb/>the piety of their fathers. They feel the winter's cold,
          <lb/>or the summer's heat, more sensibly than the peril of their
          <lb/>souls. If the stoves and furs of <placeName>Russia</placeName> could be intro­
          <lb/>duced into our places of worship, changing an inclement
          <lb/>season into the softness of <name>Spring</name>, I fear that even then
          <lb/>they would scarcely listen, without murmuring, to a dis­
          <lb/>course of an hour and a half in length. Ah! I fear that
          <lb/>days are coming, when sound doctrine must be stinted,
          <lb/>both in weight and measure; and when it will be thought

          <lb/>necessary, so to refine and gild truth, as to destroy its
          <lb/>specific nature. So that there yet may be a time, when
          <lb/>the <emph>spirit</emph> of the gospel will be held secondary to the
          <lb/>vehicle in which it is presented, and men will hear ser­
          <lb/>mons, not for the purpose of laying conscience open to
          <lb/>their <emph>power</emph>, but to employ the mind in criticism upon
          <lb/>their construction. Our aged Pastor might have had the
          <lb/>satisfaction of reflecting, that he never curtailed the copi­
          <lb/>ousness of his theme, or allayed its pungency, for the ac­
          <lb/>commodation of <said rend="post()">ears polite.</said></said></p>
          <p><said>To me,</said> she replied, <said>his performances were ever
          <lb/>consistent with each other, and with the holy dignity of
          <lb/>one appointed to lead <quote>the sacramental host of God's
          <lb/>elect.</quote> And it has given me great pleasure, in my visits
          <lb/>to him during his decline, to perceive, that his strenuous­
          <lb/>ness about particular doctrines had become absorbed in
          <lb/>the sublimity of the great plan of salvation. While we
          <lb/>are ascending the hill of life, little obstructions or aids seem
          <lb/>of great importance; but when we reach the summit, if
          <lb/>the Sun of Glory beams there, the whole journey appears
          <lb/>but as one path of light. His happy spirit wondered
          <lb/>where were the obstacles that had impeded its course.
          <lb/>They vanished, when it sat so peacefully on the threshold
          <lb/>of the gate of Heaven.</said></p>
          <p><said>This I have also observed, my sister, in recent con­
          <lb/>versation with him. Undoubtedly, many of those opin­
          <lb/>ions, which we now defend with asperity, will appear
          <lb/>divested of importance, when the light of another world

          <lb/>shines upon them. Our clergyman seemed to gather gen­
          <lb/>tleness and charity, while he went downward to the grave,
          <lb/>as the sun sheds a more serene lustre, when <quote>he trem­
          <lb/>bles at the gates of the west.</quote> I witnessed an affecting
          <lb/>occurrence of this nature, in the chamber of his sickness.
          <lb/>The Divine of a neighbouring township differed from him,
          <lb/>in the interpretation of a particular doctrine, and a dis<choice><sic>_</sic><corr>­</corr></choice>
          <lb/>pute on this point had been conducted with considerable
          <lb/>acrimony. Like the strife between <persName>Paul</persName> and <persName>Barnabas</persName>, it
          <lb/>caused a suspension of their accustomed intercourse. For
          <lb/>many years, their friendly exchange of pulpits had ceas­
          <lb/>ed. A meeting between them was effected, by <persName>Mr. S――</persName>,
          <lb/>the young colleague, and successor of our departed guide.
          <lb/>They pressed each other's hands, and tears fell down like
          <lb/>rain. <said>Brother!</said> said the dying clergyman, raising him­
          <lb/>self on his couch, <said>underneath thee be the everlasting
          <lb/>arms. <emph>One thing</emph> is needful. I trust that we both have
          <lb/>faith in our Redeemer, and shall dwell together eternally,
          <lb/>where <emph>one</emph> spirit of love pervadeth all.</said> Those who know
          <lb/>with what tenacity learned men of ardent temperament
          <lb/>adhere to their favourite theories, will fully estimate the
          <lb/>extent of this sacrifice.</said></p>
          <p><said>It does more honour to his piety,</said> she answered,
          <lb/><said>than all the books of controversy, which he could have
          <lb/>written. To contend, is the dictate of our nature; to
          <lb/>desist from strife, the victory of a divine motive. This
          <lb/>reconciliation must have been highly satisfactory to the
          <lb/>benevolent feelings of our young minister. His filial

          <lb/>deportment towards this patriarch in the Church, and the
          <lb/>solemnity with which he adminsters the appointed ordi­
          <lb/>nances, reflect honour upon the religion which he professes.
          <lb/>In prayer, he <emph>condenses</emph>, as it were, the spirit of devotion,
          <lb/>and gives it force even among the inattentive. I have
          <lb/>seldom heard any thing more pathetic than his perform­
          <lb/>ances in the house which Death has entered, where there
          <lb/>is such an expressive adaptation of manner, countenance,
          <lb/>and supplication, to the sorrows of the mourner, and the
          <lb/>desires of the penitent heart.</said></p>
          <p><said>These excellencies,</said> said <persName>Dr. L――</persName>, <said>he possesses
          <lb/>in an eminent degree; and his union, with one of our most
          <lb/>ancient and respectable families, affords reason to hope
          <lb/>that he will continue with us. In length of days, and in
          <lb/>exemplary piety, may he equal his reverend predecessor,
          <lb/>that <said>mighty man so eloquent in the Scriptures.</said> To
          <lb/>us, who are going down into the dust, many would deem it
          <lb/>of little importance, who shall stand as watchman upon
          <lb/>the walls of <placeName>Zion</placeName>. Yet it ought never to be a matter of
          <lb/>indifference, who shall be the spiritual guide of our chil­
          <lb/>dren. Those, who desire religion to be honoured when
          <lb/>they are no more, should not only teach their descendants
          <lb/>to obey its precepts, but to revere its ministers.</said></p>

          <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">On</hi> the ensuing <name>Sunday</name>, <persName>Mr. Occom</persName> gave his farewell
          <lb/>discourse to the separating tribe. It was founded on
          <lb/>that part of Scripture, which describes the division of land
          <lb/>among the people brought out of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and the depar­
          <lb/>ture of the half tribe of <name>Manasseh</name>, to a distant inheritance
          <lb/>with the <name>Reubenites</name>, and <name>Gadites</name>—<said>Now to one-half of
          <lb/>this tribe, <persName>Moses</persName> had given possession in <placeName>Bashan</placeName>: but
          <lb/>unto the other half thereof, gave <persName>Joshua</persName> a possession,
          <lb/>among their brethren on the other side of <placeName>Jordan</placeName> west­
          <lb/>ward.</said> The object of his address was to calm the cur­
          <lb/>rent of perturbed feelings, to strengthen the ground of
          <lb/>confidence in <emph>Him</emph> <sic>who</sic> <quote>who appointeth the bounds of
          <lb/>man's habitation</quote> and to enforce the motives of a faithful
          <lb/>obedience to his commands. The following day, all <name>Mo­
          <lb/>hegan</name> were assembled upon the banks of the river. There
          <lb/>lay the boats, prepared to convey to their distant abode
          <lb/>the emigrants, whose number was about two hundred
          <lb/>there were sorrowful countenances, and solemn partings,
          <lb/>and mutual good wishes, and blessings. Amid the throng,
          <lb/>the lofty figure of the young warriour <persName>Ontologon</persName> was seen,

          <lb/>ed each other, and she would have joined his enterprize,
          <lb/>but the sickness of an infirm mother incited duty to con­
          <lb/>quer love.</p>
          <p><said>Would to God, that I might lead thee by the hand to
          <lb/>my boat,</said> said the dark eyed youth. <said>I would throw
          <lb/>over thee an awning of the deer-skin, and neither wind
          <lb/>or rain should visit thee. Our voyage should be prosper­
          <lb/>ous, because thou wert with me, and in storms the Great
          <lb/>Spirit would have mercy upon me for thy sake. I would
          <lb/>build thee a cabin in our new country, and thou shouldest
          <lb/>be all the world to me.</said></p>
          <p><said><persName>Ontologon</persName>,</said> said the maiden, <said>thou art young, and
          <lb/>thy arm is strong. Thou art sufficient to thine own sub­

          <lb/>sick—who shall feed her? If I depart with thee, who shall
          <lb/>comfort her? Hath she any other child, to make the corn
          <lb/>grow around her habitation, or to seek in the woods those
          <lb/>roots which ease her pains? Her groans would raise
          <lb/>from its sepulchre the spirit of my father. It would
          <lb/>curse the daughter who could forsake, for her own pleas­
          <lb/>ures, the cry of misery in that home, where her own infant
          <lb/>cries were soothed. It would frown on her who could bid
          <lb/>to make her own grave that mother whose breast had giv­
          <lb/>en her nourishment. That frown would wither my soul,
          <lb/>even while thy love cherished it. Tempt me no more

          <lb/>was uncovered, and traces of emotion were visible on his
          <lb/>brow. Waving his hand the throng seperated, those who
          <lb/>were to depart, from those who were to remain. There
          <lb/>was a brief and heavy silence, during which he past his
          <lb/>hand over his eyes. Then, gathering firmness as he pro­
          <lb/>ceeded, he spoke with the tenderness of a father, who
          <lb/>sees the children, whom he has reared, departing from
          <lb/>the paternal abode; yet with the solemnity of a spiritual

          <lb/>not <emph>Him</emph> who speaketh from Heaven; for there remaineth

          <lb/>beams remember the broken tree thou leavest behind
          <lb/>thee. Saith not his holy word <quote>that there is hope of a
          <lb/>tree, if it be cut down that it will sprout again, and that
          <lb/>the tender branch thereof will not cease?</quote> Thus may it
          <lb/>be with our people—with our Church. Though the root
          <lb/>thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in
          <lb/>the ground, yet through the scent of water may it bud,
          <lb/>and bring forth boughs as a plant.</said> Amen! said their
          <lb/>Pastor, and bowing himself to the people, turned his steps
          <lb/>downward to the water. This was understood as the signal
          <lb/>for departure, and every emigrant entered his boat. It
          <lb/>had been concerted that a parting hymn should be sung,
          <lb/>expressive of their sympathies and devout hopes. It rose
          <lb/>in deep and solemn melody from the waters, while the
          <lb/>measured stroke of the oar gave it energy, as it softened
          <lb/>in distance. From the shore the response swelled fit­
          <lb/>fully, and in its cadence were heard the voices of those
          <lb/>that wept. It was like the music on the coast of <placeName>Labra­
          <lb/>dor</placeName>, where, amid the cold blasts, the poor <name>Esquimaux</name>
          <lb/>raises his anthem, at the departure of their yearly mis­
          <lb/>sion ship, which brings relief to his poverty, and sheds
          <lb/>light on his darkness. It was like the music of the <name>Jews</name>,

          <lb/>of cymbal and trumpet, could not be distinguished from

          <lb/>the glory of their <emph>first</emph> holy and beautiful house. At length

          <lb/>all was silent. The echo died upon the waters, and the
          <lb/>sob upon the shore. Each might be seen, slowly taking
          <lb/>his way to his respective abode, yet often lingering to try
          <lb/>if, amid the diminishing throng, the brother could dis­
          <lb/>tinguish the boat of his brother, or the father of his
          <lb/>son. Last of all <persName>Zenelasie</persName> was seen, wrapping her head
          <lb/>in her mantle, and flying like a young roe to the habitation
          <lb/>of her mother.</p>
          <p>But long after her departure, the form of <persName>Robert</persName>, the
          <lb/>mournful Chief, was discovered slowly pacing the bank
          <lb/>of the river. He had spoken a few words, with animat­
          <lb/>ed gesture to the remainder of his tribe, ere they dispers­
          <lb/>ed, and had then sought to conceal himself from them.
          <lb/>His pride would not permit his heart to unburden itself
          <lb/>in their presence, or to reveal to his inferiours how deeply
          <lb/>it was pierced. He wandered silently onward, his head
          <lb/>declined upon his breast, until he reached the solitary
          <lb/>recess, which still bears the name of <soCalled rend="pre(“)post(”)">the chair of <persName>Uncas</persName>.</soCalled>
          <lb/>It is a rude seat, formed by Nature in the rock, and so en­
          <lb/>compassed with masses of the same material, and embo­
          <lb/>somed in the thicket, as to be almost impervious to the eye,
          <lb/>except from the water. When, in the seventeenth centu­
          <lb/>ry, the fort of that monarch was invested by the <name>Narra­
          <lb/>gansetts</name>, and his people perishing with famine, he took
          <lb/>measures to inform the <name>English</name> of their perilous situation,
          <lb/>and was found seated in this rude recess, anxiously watch­
          <lb/>ing the river, when those supplies arrived which rescued
          <lb/>him from destruction. These were conveyed in a large

          <lb/>canoe from <placeName>Saybrook</placeName>, under cover of darkness, by an en­
          <lb/>terprising man of the name of <persName>Leffingwell</persName>, to whom <persName>un­
          <lb/>cas</persName>, as a testimony of gratitude, gave a large tract of land,
          <lb/>comprising the whole of the present town of <placeName>N――</placeName>.
          <lb/>There the king sat, on the throne furnished by Nature, with
          <lb/>no guard, but the shapeless columns of stone, whose mossy
          <lb/>helmets waved over him, and no canopy but the midnight
          <lb/>cloud, listening with throbbing heart, for the dash of that
          <lb/>oar, on which hung his only hope. At a distance were his
          <lb/>famishing people, and his besieging foes holding the war­
          <lb/>dance, which preceded their morning battle, and their ex­
          <lb/>pected victory. On the same seat, after the lapse of more
          <lb/>than a hundred years, reclined this lonely Chief of a di­
          <lb/>minished and dispersed tribe. Behind him was no fort,
          <lb/>no warriours. Upon the still waters, where his eye rest­
          <lb/>ed, was no hope. The setting Sun threw his lustre over
          <lb/>them for a moment, as if they were an expanse of liquid
          <lb/>silver, and illumined the bold, broad forehead of the
          <lb/>Chieftain, half-hidden by his dark clustering locks, over
          <lb/>which a slight tinge of snow had been scattered, not by
          <lb/>time, but by sorrow. He watched the last rays, and as
          <lb/>they faded into twilight exclaimed in agony, <said>Thou
          <lb/>shalt rise again in glory:—but for us there is no returning,
          <lb/>—no dawn.</said> He concealed his brow with his hands, and
          <lb/>his bursts of grief were long, and passionate. None were
          <lb/>there to report, <said>I saw my Chief mourning.</said> Day, at
          <lb/>her return, found him in the same spot—in the same atti­

          <lb/>had borne the burdens of our revolution. It was one of
          <lb/>her favourite maxims, that their services would be better
          <lb/>estimated when the blessings, won by their toil, were
          <lb/>more widely diffused, and more fully realized. Could she

          <lb/>feeble, and hoary, yet bending less beneath the burdens
          <lb/>of age, than those of poverty, going forth like the widow
          <lb/>of <placeName>Zarepta</placeName>, to gather sticks to dress a handful of meal, that
          <lb/>they might eat it and die; she would scarcely have been

          <lb/>Had she seen, in vision, a mother redeemed from servi­

          <p>The place of her residence had furnished many of those
          <lb/>veterans who, during a war of eight years, had rarely tast­
          <lb/>ed the <said>charities of home, and sweet domestick life.</said>
          <lb/>Some had fallen while the fields were sown with blood,
          <lb/>others had returned to share the blessings of their harvest.
          <lb/>A few survived with broken frames, and debilitated con­
          <lb/>stitutions, living spectacles of woe to their disconsolate
          <lb/>families. To these that charitable Lady extended her
          <lb/>unwearied friendship. Medicine for their sicknesses, food
          <lb/>for their tables, and condescending kindness to their
          <lb/>sorrowful spirits, she distributed with that judgment
          <lb/>which accompanies a discriminating mind.</p>
          <p>One of these unfortunate beings, who frequently came
          <lb/>to sit an hour with her when she was at leisure, used to
          <lb/>style himself the Captain of her band of pensioners. He
          <lb/>was a man of powerful frame, strong features, and ardent
          <lb/>character. His good right hand which had so often toiled
          <lb/>to procure bread for the lambs of his household, had been
          <lb/>cleft from his body by a sabre, as he raised it to ask for
          <lb/>quarter in an unsuccessful combat. A crutch, which his
          <lb/>left hand had painfully wrought out, and inscribed with
          <lb/>the date of his last battle, supplied the loss of a limb,
          <lb/>which had been amputated in consequence of a neglect­
          <lb/>ed wound. Pain, sickness, and the untold miseries of a
          <lb/>prison-ship, had destroyed the vigour of a muscular frame,
          <lb/>and given the wrinkles of age to one who had not seen
          <lb/>half a century.</p>

          <p><persName>Madam L――</persName> listened with interest to his narratives,
          <lb/>and often wondered at the elasticity with which his spirit
          <lb/>soared above the ruins of his frame. One morning as he
          <lb/>was seated with her, his only hand resting upon the crutch
          <lb/>that stood by his side, he said—</p>
          <p><said>I should take more pleasure in coming to this house,
          <lb/>Madam, if I could but forget that the traitor <persName>Arnold</persName> used
          <lb/>to reside in it. I don't like to sit in seats, where he sat.</said></p>
          <p><said>I am sorry, <persName>Anderson</persName>,</said> replied the Lady, <said>that any
          <lb/>such image should interfere with the comfort of your vis­
          <lb/>its. I have no particular satisfaction in retracing the con­
          <lb/>nection of <persName>Benedict</persName> with our family. He was received
          <lb/>by my husband, more from the solicitations of a widowed
          <lb/>mother, than from any prepossessing traits of character.
          <lb/>He evinced, at the age of twelve, those qualities which
          <lb/>distinguished his manhood. He possessed a courage, and
          <lb/>contempt of hardship, which would have been interesting,
          <lb/>had they not been associated with dispositions delighting
          <lb/>to inflict pain. His intellect was rapid and powerful, but
          <lb/>he was impatient of controul, and devoid of integrity.</said></p>
          <p><said>I remember him,</said> said the soldier, <said>in his boyish
          <lb/>days. He loved to cut young birds to pieces, and to
          <lb/>laugh at the mourning of their parents, and to torture eve­
          <lb/>ry thing that was weaker than himself. There is nothing
          <lb/>that I check my boys sooner for than cruelty to animals. It
          <lb/>will make you like <persName>Arnold</persName>, I say to them, and no traitor
          <lb/>shall be son of mine. I once met him when a boy at the
          <lb/>mill, where we both came with corn. He quarrelled with

          <lb/>the miller for making him wait, and then amused himself
          <lb/>by clinging to the wheel, and going with it fearlessly as it
          <lb/>turned in the water. I wondered at his dangerous sport,
          <lb/>and his bold words. I knew not then that I should live to
          <lb/>see his strive to plunge his country into perdition.</said></p>
          <p>The Lady, ever intent to find <quote>some soul of goodness
          <lb/>in things evil,</quote> replied,—</p>
          <p><said><persName>Arnold</persName> possessed courage, and presence of mind, in
          <lb/>an eminent degree. At his unsuccessful attack on <placeName>Canada</placeName>,
          <lb/>with the lamented <persName>Montgomery</persName>, he displayed superiour
          <lb/>valour. You know also, that he sustained extreme hard­
          <lb/>ship, in his march through the wilderness from <placeName>Kenne­
          <lb/>beck</placeName>. Beside the labour of travelling over pathless
          <lb/>mountains, and swamps, he and his men were reduced to
          <lb/>the necessity of feeding on the vilest substances, even on
          <lb/>the remnants of their own shoes. That he possessed ac­
          <lb/>tive, as well as enduring courage has often been proved.
          <lb/>In his battle with <persName>Sir Guy Carleton</persName> on <placeName>Lake Champlain</placeName>,
          <lb/>after signalizing his valour, he was so solicitous about a
          <lb/>point of honour, as to prefer blowing up his own frigate to
          <lb/>striking the <rs type="properAdjective">American</rs> flag to the enemy. His radical
          <lb/>faults were want of feeling, and of moral principle. His
          <lb/>fondness for pomp, and splendid equipage led him to the
          <lb/>meanest acts of fraud, when in command at <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>.
          <lb/>His vindictive spirit never forgave the reprimand which
          <lb/>was there given him by <persName>Washington</persName>, in pursuance of the
          <lb/>decree of the court, appointed to investigate his conduct.
          <lb/>From that period, revenge, and treason employed his

          <lb/><placeName>West-Point</placeName>, with the deliberate design of delivering to
          <lb/>the foe that <said rend="post()">rock of our military salvation.</said></said></p>
          <p><persName>Anderson</persName> who could scarcely endure to yield the traitor
          <lb/>that measure of fame which he had earned, felt particu­
          <lb/>larly uneasy to hear it from lips that he revered, and an­
          <lb/>swered with warmth—</p>
          <p><said>I have heard his courage doubted, Madam. At <placeName>Sara­
          <lb/>toga</placeName>, where he so madly defied danger, he was known to
          <lb/>have been intoxicated. I recollect how angry he was,
          <lb/>at the battle of <placeName>Bemis-heights</placeName>, because the command was
          <lb/>not given to him instead of <persName>General Gates</persName>. He came upon
          <lb/>the field in very ill-humour, and brandished his sword so
          <lb/>carelessly, that he wounded in the head an officer who
          <lb/>stood near. Then plunging foolishly into the most peril­
          <lb/>ous scenes of action, he had his leg fractured; and I heard
          <lb/>the surgeon of the hospital say, that he was so peevish, and
          <lb/>furious at his confinement, and pain, that no one liked to
          <lb/>be near him.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Madam L――</persName>, perceiving that the object of honest <persName>An­

          <lb/>thought.</p>
          <p><said>There is a story,</said> she said, <said>which I always hear
          <lb/>from you, with peculiar satisfaction. I refer to the battle

          <lb/>But the name is of little consequence, as long as the vic­

          <lb/>in a quick-set hedge. We did not arrive on the ground
          <lb/>till near midnight. Then we commenced our labours,
          <lb/>and it seemed as if the Almighty prospered us. Before
          <lb/>day-light our fortifications were completed. At dawn, the

          <lb/>the evil-minded <persName>Saul</persName> was not more dismayed, when the
          <lb/>stripling <persName>David</persName> displayed, from a neighbouring hill, the
          <lb/>spear, and the cruse of water, which he had stolen from
          <lb/>his head while he slept. They acknowledged that <name>Yan­
          <lb/>kees</name> could work well, and afterwards found that they
          <lb/>were able to fight as well. Early the next spring, when
          <lb/>we threw up fortifications with great despatch on <placeName>Dor­

          <lb/>hill</placeName>, the war-ships, and floating batteries, so that we might
          <lb/>pick up shot, and bombs, wherever we turned. We were
          <lb/>much fatigued after the severe toil of a sleepless night,
          <lb/>but none of us could think of taking rest; and what was
          <lb/>worse, we were poorly supplied with provisions. I can

          <lb/>labours, directing and bearing a part. While the morn­
          <lb/>ing was yet gray, a detachment of somewhat more than
          <lb/>an hundred men was despatched, under <persName>Captain Knowl­
          <lb/>ton</persName>, to take post on the left hand of the breast-work. I

          <lb/>station it would prove. Yet if I had, I should not have
          <lb/>drawn back, for my heart was high. When we reached
          <lb/>the spot, we were employed in placing one rail-fence par­
          <lb/>allel with another, and filling the interval with the new-
          <lb/>mown hay which strewed the field,—that field where men
          <lb/>were soon to lie thick as herbs beneath the sharp sithe.
          <lb/>In the course of the forenoon, a few more soldiers arrived,
          <lb/>increasing our numbers to about 1500. We made but a
          <lb/>scanty dinner, though those of us who had watched all
          <lb/>night, and got no breakfast, were rather sharp-set. Yet
          <lb/>it seemed as if no man thought of food, or of rest, so full
          <lb/>was his heart of those liberties, which he was about to de­
          <lb/>fend. At one o'clock, a thick, dark smoke spread over
          <lb/>the skirts of the hill. We had scarcely time to exclaim—
          <lb/><said>See! <placeName>Charlestown</placeName> with its fair houses, and beautiful
          <lb/>spire burning,</said> ere we saw our foes marching toward us.
          <lb/>Soon the smoke of the town, and that of the cannon
          <lb/>mingled, rising in heavy volumes towards the sky. <persName>Pres­

          <lb/>back-woodsmen, took deadly aim as if in their own forests.
          <lb/>The <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> lines, partly wrapt in smoke, marched up with
          <lb/>colours flying. At their head, came Generals <persName>Howe</persName>, and
          <lb/><persName>Pigot</persName>, with a contemptuous, yet noble demeanour.
          <lb/>Three thousand well-disciplined men followed them, sup­
          <lb/>ported by field artillery. First marched the grenadiers,
          <lb/>with their lofty caps, and glittering bayonets. We were
          <lb/>commanded to reserve our fire, until they were within a
          <lb/>few yards of us. When they reached that spot, it was
          <lb/>wonderful how many plumed heads fell. Dismayed at our

          <lb/>tately towards their boats.</p>
          <p rend="pre(“)">Their officers pursued, menacing them with drawn

          <lb/>suffered terrible slaughter, and retreated. The officers,

          <lb/>seen, hurrying with distracted steps to unite with <persName>Howe</persName>,
          <lb/>and his council. Then they increased the fire from their
          <lb/>ships of war, changed the position of their cannon so as
          <lb/>to rake the inside of our breast-work, and advanced with
          <lb/>fresh resolution, attacking our redoubt on three sides at
          <lb/>once. The carnage became dreadful. At this important
          <lb/>crisis, our ammunition was exhausted, and that decided the
          <lb/>fate of the day. Could we but have obtained the materi­
          <lb/>als of defence, the <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> would never have driven us
          <lb/>from that hill. Perhaps they might have buried us in its

          <p rend="pre(“)">When it was found necessary for us to retire, the ene­

          <lb/>in order to cut off the retreat of the main body. This they
          <lb/>found no such easy matter. We fought till not a cartridge
          <lb/>was left, and then gave them a parting salute with the but-
          <lb/>end of our muskets, as they leaped into our entrench­
          <lb/>ments. Half our number lay lifeless, or wounded among
          <lb/>us. Yet even the dying forbore to groan, listening for
          <lb/>our cry of victory. Four comrades were shot beside me.
          <lb/>Their warm blood poured over my feet. One of them
          <lb/>was my brothers, whom I loved as my own soul. Falling

          <lb/>cartridges from his quivering hand, and paused not a mo­
          <lb/>ment to mourn. I cannot tell how many times I fired,
          <lb/>with the same aim that I have taken at the fox in his speed,
          <lb/>and the pigeon in the air, when they have fallen. My
          <lb/>musket burst, and I snatched another from the dead hand
          <lb/>of a comrade. The Almighty have mercy on the souls,
          <lb/>who were sent by me to their last account. When we
          <lb/>were compelled to retire, not having a round of powder
          <lb/>left, and being unprovided with bayonets, our only path
          <lb/>was over a neck of land, where we were exposed to a
          <lb/>cross-fire from a man of war, and two floating batteries.</p>
          <p rend="pre(“)">Our loss, in that perilous combat, was less severe than

          <p><said>I knew him,</said> said the Lady, <said>as a friend of my hus­

          <lb/>dared to follow,</quote> his energetic soul was gentle in its

          <lb/>ready to recount the virtues of those who have aided in

          <lb/>the period of this sketch. The latter years of his life had

          <lb/>whose noble form the military habit well became, and
          <lb/>whose countenance was considered as a model of manly
          <lb/>beauty. While yet a boy, pursuing his studies at <name>Yale

          <lb/>in mixed society threw around the somewhat of the en­
          <lb/>chantment of the age of chivalry. It produced a cast of
          <lb/>manners, which was peculiarly admired among females;
          <lb/>who found an almost irresistible charm in the graceful
          <lb/>condescension of those, so long accustomed to command.
          <lb/>This deportment distinguished both these visitants of

          <lb/>save the elder had more gentleness of soul, and the
          <lb/>younger less ambition for popularity, than their ancient
          <lb/>prototypes. After offering their respects to the Lady,
          <lb/>whom from childhood they had honoured as an epitome of
          <lb/>all that was noble in woman, they spoke kindly to the
          <lb/><choice><sic>the </sic><corr/></choice>poor soldier, who had risen at their entrance.</p>

          <p><said>Sit down, my good fellow,</said> said <persName>General ――</persName>, <said rend="pre()"><choice><sic>”</sic><corr>“</corr></choice> I
          <lb/>am sorry that you have lost so much, by your country's
          <lb/>gain.</said></p>
          <p><said>General,</said> he answered, unconsciously elevating his
          <lb/>crutch to his shoulder, as if it had been a musket, <said>I have
          <lb/>lost only a hand and a leg. Many have lost more, and
          <lb/>seen their country enslaved beside. I had rather this
          <lb/>head should have gone likewise, than to have heard
          <lb/>that shout of victory when <persName>Burgoyne</persName> was taken.</said></p>
          <p>The piercing eye of <persName>Colonel ――</persName> flashed with a war­
          <lb/>riour's pleasure. The recollection of that event was dear
          <lb/>to his soul. He knew not then how conspicuous his own
          <lb/>noble form should appear in later times, on the canvas of
          <lb/>the illustrious <persName>Trumbull</persName>; deputed both to witness, and
          <lb/>pourtray the brilliant events which led to his country's lib­
          <lb/>erty. But the picture of the memory was, at that mo­
          <lb/>ment, more vivid in the eye of <persName>Colonel ――</persName>, than it
          <lb/>could have been rendered by the pencil of the artist.</p>
          <p>Glowing recollections, and proud feeling, retouched the
          <lb/>traces of the scene; and in an instant countless images
          <lb/>thronged around him. The deeply marked, and interest­
          <lb/>ing countenance of <persName>Burgoyne</persName>, the ill-concealed melan­

          <lb/>choly of his officers, amid the formalities of their capitu­
          <lb/>lation, the martial demeanour of <persName>Gates</persName>, the energetic,
          <lb/>open countenance of <persName>Knox</persName>, the sullen faces of the <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs>
          <lb/>soldiery, the half-suppressed rage with which they
          <lb/>grounded their arms, produced a combination of joy and
          <lb/>rapturous gratitude, softened by pity, which can scarcely
          <lb/>be imagined but by an actor in those tumultuous scenes.
          <lb/>The very tones of the music, which guided their march,
          <lb/>seemed again to vibrate on his year, and the foliage of the
          <lb/><placeName>Saratoga</placeName> forests, bright with the opposing hues of autumn,
          <lb/>to wave in accordance.</p>
          <p>Interesting groups filled the back ground of this mental
          <lb/>picture. The funeral of <persName>General Frazer</persName>, the incessant
          <lb/>cannonade upon his grave; the uncovered head of the
          <lb/>clergyman, who absorbed in the services of heaven, heed­
          <lb/>ed not the war upon earth; the pale, delicate, beautiful
          <lb/>countenance of <persName>Lady Ackland</persName>, committing herself to the
          <lb/>waters in an open boat, amid the darkness and storms of
          <lb/>night, or presenting to <persName>General Gates</persName> the open and wet
          <lb/>letter of <persName>Burgoyne</persName>, in which her protection was supplicat­
          <lb/>ed, or entreating with the exquisite tones of female forti­
          <lb/>tude in anguish, permission to attend her imprisoned and
          <lb/>desperately wounded husband; the magnanimous <persName>Schuy­
          <lb/>ler</persName>, as he took in his arms the three little children of the
          <lb/><persName>Baroness Reidesel</persName>, reassuring the spirits of the stranger,
          <lb/>and the captive, by his tenderness to her helpless off­

          <lb/>ed forth by the allusion of the disabled soldier to the
          <lb/>surrender of <persName>Burgoyne</persName>.</p>
          <p>The transient reverie of <persName>Colonel ――</persName> was dispelled by
          <lb/>the voice of the Lady, kindly mentioning <persName>Anderson</persName>, who
          <lb/>had been the last speaker.</p>
          <p><said>I take so much pleasure,</said> she said, <said>in his narratives,
          <lb/>that I sincerely regret any draw-back should exist to his
          <lb/>part of the satisfaction in visiting me. So strong are his
          <lb/>patriotic feelings, that he likes not to be long in a house,
          <lb/>which, for so many years, gave shelter to <persName>General Ar­
          <lb/>nold</persName>.</said></p>
          <p><said>I feel strongly indignant,</said> said <persName>Colonel ――</persName>, <said>that
          <lb/>my native place should have given birth to the only
          <lb/>traitor, who ever existed among the officers of the <placeName>United
          <lb/>States</placeName>.</said></p>
          <p><said>When we recollect,</said> replied <persName>Madam L――</persName>, <said>that
          <lb/>our contest had, at first, all the repulsive features of a civil
          <lb/>war—when we balance the labours, the privations, the dis­
          <lb/>couragements of our officers, with the infirmities of human
          <lb/>nature, I have often been surprized, and always grateful
          <lb/>to God, that this instance of treason was solitary.</said></p>
          <p><said>There was,</said> said <persName>General ――</persName>, <said rend="post()" xml:id="s003" next="#s004">a circumstance
          <lb/>connected with the history of <persName>Arnold</persName>, with which, Madam,

          <lb/>known only to a few, who possessed the confidence of
          <lb/><persName>Washington</persName>. The treason was discovered by him, on his
          <lb/>arrival at <placeName>West-Point</placeName>, from <placeName>Hartford</placeName> in <date when="1781">1781</date>. He was

          <lb/>ing that <persName>Arnold</persName> was absent, whom he expected would have
          <lb/>received him at the fortress. Recrossing the <placeName>Hudson</placeName>, he
          <lb/>went to the General's house, and found <persName>Mrs. Arnold</persName> in a
          <lb/>state of sudden, and violent distraction. Tearing her
          <lb/>hair, she could scarcely be restrained by her women, and
          <lb/>the two aids-de-camp of her husband, from rushing into
          <lb/>the streets. At the sight of <persName>Washington</persName>, her frenzy was
          <lb/>redoubled, with cries of <said>Depart! depart! thou demon,
          <lb/>sent to torment me.</said> Then a horrible suspicion of trea­
          <lb/>son first entered the mind of the Commander in Chief.
          <lb/>Soon the circumstances of the traitor's escape were made
          <lb/>known, by the men who returned from rowing him on
          <lb/>board the <name>Vulture</name>. He had endeavoured to bribe them
          <lb/>also to desertion, by promises of promotion, and <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs>
          <lb/>gold. Finding them resolute, he forced them to trust their
          <lb/>lives to a miserable boat, retaining for his own use, the
          <lb/>barge in which they had innocently conveyed him to the
          <lb/>enemy. Intelligence arrived of the capture of <persName>André</persName>, and
          <lb/><persName>Washington</persName>, inexpressibly afflicted, hastened to the army
          <lb/>which, under the command of <persName>General Greene</persName>, was en­
          <lb/>camped in the vicinity of <placeName>Tappan</placeName>. He immediately sum­
          <lb/>moned to his presence <persName>Major Lee</persName>, of the celebrated
          <lb/>legion of <rs type="properAdjective">Virginia</rs> horse, an intrepid officer, and worthy
          <lb/>the confidence of his Chief. When he came, <persName>Washington</persName>
          <lb/>was alone, and writing in his tent. The glimmering light
          <lb/>of the camp displayed a countenance, pale with anxiety
          <lb/>and watching. His noble, and commanding appearance
          <lb/>seemed to derive new interest from the grief which shaded

          <lb/>as perchance might mark the brow of some guardian angel,
          <lb/>who saw the object of his affectionate tutelage, plunging
          <lb/>into perdition. He rose as <persName>Major Lee</persName> entered, and said
          <lb/>in a voice whose deep, and manly tones were softened into
          <lb/>exquisite modulation—</said></p>

          <lb/>will be found inflexible. I know not how far it is the will
          <lb/>of your Excellency, that his honour should be put to the
          <lb/>proof.</said></p>
          <p rend="pre(“)">The cloud passed from the forehead of <persName>Washington</persName>, as

          <p rend="pre(“)">He then gave him his instructions with that minuteness,
          <lb/>and accuracy, which he ever preserved even in the most
          <lb/>perplexing, and dreadful exigencies. <persName>Lee</persName> returned to the
          <lb/>camp, and summoned to a private conference his faithful
          <lb/>officer. As he entered, his tall, finely proportioned form,
          <lb/>in the imposing dress of the <rs type="properAdjective">Virginia</rs> cavalry, exhibited a
          <lb/>commanding appearance. His grave countenance betok­
          <lb/>ened a character, enduring, and undaunted, such as ad­
          <lb/>versity sometimes forms. His black eye, keen in its
          <lb/>glances, but almost melancholy when at rest, indicated a
          <lb/>man dexterous to read the secrets of others, and cautious
          <lb/>to conceal his own. His black hair, cut according to the
          <lb/>military fashion, still evinced some disposition to wreathe
          <lb/>itself into those close curls, which had given his youth a
          <lb/>cast of romantic beauty. His broad shoulders, and joints

          <p rend="pre(“)">Indignant at his indifference, the officer replied—</p>
          <p><said>The deserter is believed to be no less a person than
          <lb/>your sergeant-major. His horse, and arms are missing
          <lb/>from their quarters. I have to request immediate or­
          <lb/>ders for pursuit.</said></p>
          <p rend="pre(“)">These <persName>Lee</persName> was compelled to grant, after prolonging the
          <lb/>conversation as much as possible. Immediately a band
          <lb/>equipped for pursuit appeared in front of his tent. On
          <lb/>inspecting them, he said to the lieutenant at their head—</p>
          <p><said>I have a particular service for you in the morning.
          <lb/>Call <persName>Cornet Middleton</persName> to the command of this party.</said></p>
          <p rend="pre(“)">This arrangement was partly to create delay, that the
          <lb/>fugitive might have more the advance of his pursuers; and
          <lb/>partly from a knowledge of the tenderness of <persName>Middleton's</persName>
          <lb/>disposition, which he thought would prevent him from in­
          <lb/>flicting personal injury on his victim. The design of de­
          <lb/>lay was soon frustrated by the appearance of <persName>Cornet
          <lb/>Middleton</persName>, spurring his horse in front of his associates.
          <lb/>Such command of countenance had <persName>Lee</persName>, that not a mus­
          <lb/>cle moved, as he delivered his orders in a distinct, delib­
          <lb/>erate tone—</p>
          <p><said>Pursue as far as you can with safety <persName>Sergeant Cham­
          <lb/>pé</persName>, who is suspected of desertion to the enemy. He has
          <lb/>been seen to take the road leading to <placeName>Paulus-hook</placeName>. Bring

          <p>The tramp of the horses, put to full speed, instantly
          <lb/>succeeded his words. He strained his eyes after them,
          <lb/>in agony. It was midnight, and rain fell in protracted
          <lb/>showers. <persName>Champé</persName> had the advance of his pursuers scarce­
          <lb/>ly one hour.</p>
          <p><said>He will be overtaken,</said> exclaimed <persName>Lee</persName>. <said>I have
          <lb/>destroyed a brave, and honourable man.</said></p>
          <p rend="pre(“)">Securing the entrance of his tent, he threw himself upon
          <lb/>the earth, in bitterness of soul. Groans burst from his
          <lb/>manly bosom, and deeply he execrated the perfidy of <persName>Ar­
          <lb/>nold</persName>, which had been the cause of all this woe.</p>
          <p rend="pre(“)">Rain had fallen soon after the departure of <persName>Champé</persName>,
          <lb/>which enabled his pursuers, with the aid of the lights
          <lb/>they bore, to discern his track. It was for him an unfor­
          <lb/>tunate circumstance, that the front shoes of the horses of
          <lb/>those dragoons had a private mark by which their impres­
          <lb/>sion was distinctly known to each other. This precau­
          <lb/>tion, which had often proved useful, now greatly enhanced
          <lb/>his danger. <persName>Middleton</persName>, with his men, occasionally dis­
          <lb/>mounted to examine these impressions; and as no other
          <lb/>horse had past since the shower, mistake was impossible.
          <lb/>Day broke when they were several miles north of the
          <lb/>village of <placeName>Bergen</placeName>. Ascending an eminence, just before
          <lb/>reaching the <placeName>Three Pigeons</placeName>, they descried <persName>Champé</persName> not half
          <lb/>a mile in front. Vigilant and active, he also, at the same
          <lb/>moment descried them. Putting spurs to his horse, he de­
          <lb/>termined to outstrip them. <persName>Middleton</persName>, calling on his men
          <lb/>to imitate him, urged his horse to breathless speed. Re­

          <lb/>collecting a shorter route through the woods, to the bridge
          <lb/>below <placeName>Bergen</placeName>, which diverged from the great road near
          <lb/>the <placeName>Three Pigeons</placeName>, he directed a sergeant with five dra­
          <lb/>goons to take it, and obtain possession of the bridge.
          <lb/><persName>Champé</persName> also recollected this shorter road, but, thinking it
          <lb/>probable that <persName>Middleton</persName> would avail himself of it, felt con­
          <lb/>strained to avoid it. He also knew that it was generally
          <lb/>preferred  by those parties of our men who were returning
          <lb/>from the neighbourhood of the enemy, on account of the
          <lb/>concealment which the shade of its trees afforded.</p>
          <p rend="pre(“)">Fruitful in expedients, he with great presence of mind
          <lb/>resolved to relinquish his original destination to <placeName>Paulus-
          <lb/>hook</placeName>, and seek refuge from two <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> gallies, which usu­
          <lb/>ally lay a few miles east of <placeName>Bergen</placeName>. Entering this village,
          <lb/>he turned to his right, and disguising his track as much
          <lb/>as possible, by choosing the beaten roads, directed his
          <lb/>course towards <placeName>Elizabeth-town Point</placeName>. The sergeant,
          <lb/>with his dragoons, concealed himself at the bridge, ex­
          <lb/>pecting every moment to dart upon his prey. Thither
          <lb/><persName>Cornet Middleton</persName> also soon arrived, and found, to his ex­
          <lb/>treme mortification, that the victim had eluded his strata­
          <lb/>gem. Returning a short distance, he inquired of the
          <lb/>villagers of <placeName>Bergen</placeName>, if a dragoon had been seen that morn­
          <lb/>ing, alone, and preceding him. They answered in the
          <lb/>affirmative, but their information of his route varied.
          <lb/>The pursuers, in great chagrin, dispersed through the
          <lb/>whole village to search for the track of his horse. It was
          <lb/>discovered just at the spot where, leaving the village, he

          <lb/>the speed of lightning. Again the fugitive was descried.
          <lb/>His eye was also bent upon them; and they perceived
          <lb/>that, notwithstanding the rapidity of his course, he had
          <lb/>lashed his valice to his shoulders, and that he carried his
          <lb/>drawn sword in his hand. The pursuit was rapid, and
          <lb/>close. Not more swiftly does the eagle pursue the dove
          <lb/>through the air.</p>
          <p rend="pre(“)">They were within a few hundred yards of him. They
          <lb/>shouted with eager joy. The heart of the fugitive beat
          <lb/>with tumultuous sensation, lest the gallies where he sought
          <lb/>refuge might not be there. In an instant, he perceived
          <lb/>their white sails; and for the first time blest the flag of
          <lb/>his country's foe.</p>
          <p rend="pre(“)">A long marsh, and the deep waters lay between him,
          <lb/>and the ark of safety. He sprang from his horse, and
          <lb/>plunged into the morass. His pursuers arrived, and dis­
          <lb/>mounted also.</p>
          <p rend="pre(“)"><persName>Champé</persName>, struggling with the tenacious and deceitful
          <lb/>footing, and sometimes sinking in the slimy pool, still held
          <lb/>his glittering sword high above his head. Reaching the
          <lb/>brink of the river, he threw away his cloak, and scab­
          <lb/>bard, lest they might obstruct his desperate enterprize.
          <lb/>He threw his broad breast upon the waters, and divided
          <lb/>them with <rs type="properAdjective">Herculean</rs> strokes. But, in his extremity, his
          <lb/>trusty sword escaped from his grasp, and the head of the
          <lb/>bold dragoon sunk for a moment, as if in despondency,
          <lb/>or sorrow.</p>

          <lb/>the cavalry on shore, some of whom, like the horsemen of
          <lb/>Pharoah, were preparing to plunge in after him, who thus
          <lb/>boldly made for himself a path through the deep. But
          <lb/>a light boat, with rapid oar, approached him, and bore
          <lb/>him on board the gallies.</p>

          <p rend="pre(“)"><persName>Cornet Middleton</persName> collected his scattered band, and

          <lb/>three in the afternoon ere they arrived, yet <persName>Lee</persName> had not
          <lb/>yet left his tent. So sorely did the agitation of his mind
          <lb/>affect physical energy, that he almost seemed the victim
          <lb/>of intermittent fever. He was roused by a shout. It was
          <lb/>universal and prolonged—</p>
          <p><said>The traitor is slain. The second <persName>Arnold</persName> has met his

          <lb/>on, with his cloak, and the scabbard of his trusty sword.
          <lb/>The eye of the fiery animal was rolling, and blood-shot,
          <lb/>and his sides heaved deeply, more in anger, than from toil.
          <lb/>To <persName>Lee</persName> it seemed that he was mourning for his master.</p>

          <lb/>found him in one of those elegant mansions, which suffer­
          <lb/>ed so much from the wantonness of abuse by the <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs>
          <lb/>soldiery. Fond of pomp, and elated by it, he regarded
          <lb/>the dragoon with an arrogant, inquisitorial look. The
          <lb/><name><rs type="properAdjective">Virginia</rs> cavalry</name> had borne such a high reputation for intre­

          <lb/>some dead poultry. A basket of eggs, as if for the market
          <lb/>of the next day, stood near him on a bench. He started at

          <lb/>impatience of a lover. At length it arrived, and with a
          <lb/>party of dragoons he repaired to <placeName>Hoboken</placeName>. Three led-

          <lb/>The beautiful steed of <persName>Champé</persName> was one of the number,

          <lb/>from their barracks to ships, destinied for some secret expe­
          <lb/>dition. This was afterwards ascertained to be for the shores
          <lb/>of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>. Thither poor <persName>Champé</persName> was obliged to ac­

          <lb/>the severity of famine, he at length joined the army which

          <lb/>for one moment. Letters written to a mother, and the

          <p><said>It can never be necessary,</said> said the Lady, <said>to add

          <lb/>them. In the character of <persName>Washington</persName>, sympathies and

          <lb/>secret trials which he endured, are most sensible how far
          <lb/>beneath his merits is the meed of fame. While to a dis­
          <lb/>tant observer he might seem the most fortunate of men,
          <lb/>hidden darts were piercing him. His disinterested labours
          <lb/>were not always correctly estimated. Congress some­
          <lb/>times blamed, often opposed his wisest measures. It con­
          <lb/>cealed within its bosom, a faction, anxious to supplant him.

          <lb/>vindictive, and unprincipled <persName>Charles Lee</persName>, their object was
          <lb/>to supersede him, and elevate <persName>Gates</persName> upon the ruin of his
          <lb/>reputation. His perplexities were greatly increased, by

          <lb/>soldiers; so that often, on the eve of some important ac­
          <lb/>tion, when all his effective strength was required, his army
          <lb/>would be disbanding, and vanishing like a shadow.</said></p>
          <p><said>The wants of the soldiers,</said> said <persName>Gen. ――――</persName>, <said>were
          <lb/>also to him a source of continual sorrow. Ill-clothed, ill-
          <lb/>fed, and scantily provided with ammunition, he was com­
          <lb/>pelled to struggle with his pity, and enforce that rigid dis­
          <lb/>cipline and subordination, without which an army is an
          <lb/>unmixed evil. In their winter-quarters, particularly at
          <lb/><placeName>Valley-Forge</placeName>, and <placeName>Morristown</placeName>, where, through the crevi­
          <lb/>ces of the miserable log-huts which they had themselves
          <lb/>constructed, they were heard complaining for food, for
          <lb/>want of which their half-naked, emaciated forms were
          <lb/>famishing; when the traces of their feet upon the snow
          <lb/>and ice, were red with their own blood, how did <persName>Washing­
          <lb/>ton</persName> strive to relieve their comfortless condition. With
          <lb/>what fatherly compassion would he listen to their com­
          <lb/>plaints; yet with what firmness decree justice to their
          <lb/>offences. How would he sooth them into patience, while
          <lb/>his own heart was bleeding. Yet, in the midst of his sor­
          <lb/>rows, with what dignity and serenity of soul, would he
          <lb/>meet the darkest vicissitudes, and be prepared for the
          <lb/>most unforeseen exigencies. It was to his officers a source
          <lb/>of wonder, as well as of admiration, that when the most
          <lb/>important transactions were committed to his guidance,
          <lb/>he never neglected the most minute attentions.</said></p>
          <p><said>I have been surprised</said> said the Lady, <said>at his
          <lb/>power of uniting calm and deliberative wisdom, with

          <lb/>formance of difficult and daring deeds. But he, whom
          <lb/>Heaven raised up for its own great purpose, seemed to
          <lb/>combine, without contradiction, opposing qualities.</said></p>
          <p><said>I shall never forget,</said> said <persName>Colonel ――</persName>, <said>that
          <lb/>mixture of noble feeling with urbanity, with which, in the
          <lb/>early stage of the contest, he refused to treat with the
          <lb/>commissioners from <persName>Lord and Admiral Howe</persName>, because
          <lb/>they studiously avoided the acknowledgement of those
          <lb/>titles, with which the independence of his country demanded.
          <lb/>To his expanded mind, those titles were less than nothing
          <lb/>and vanity. But he would not dispense with the respect,
          <lb/>which was due to his nation through her representa­
          <lb/>tive. How firm and dignified was his demeanour when,
          <lb/>in the winter of <date when="1776">1776</date>, the despondence of the people ap­
          <lb/>peared in every imaginable form, when the enlistments of
          <lb/>his insufficient army were expiring every month, and they
          <lb/>could be induced neither to remain, nor to contend. How
          <lb/>bright was the glance of his eye when, after performing
          <lb/>prodigies of valour at <placeName>Monmouth</placeName>, and enduring without
          <lb/>complaint the excessive heat of that terrible day, he lay
          <lb/>down upon the earth his cloak for a short repose that
          <lb/>night, expecting to renew the battle ere the dawn of morn­
          <lb/>ing. But his countenance has, at no period, made a more
          <lb/>indelible impression upon my mind, than at the passage
          <lb/>of the <placeName>Delaware</placeName>; when by a brilliant strategem, he re­
          <lb/>vived the hopes of a dejected nation. I think I again see

          <lb/>tense cold of that <rs type="properAdjective">Christmas</rs> night. Seated upon his noble
          <lb/>horse, and attended by <persName>General Greene</persName>, he superintended
          <lb/>the hazardous embarkation, with the serenity of a superi­
          <lb/>our being. In retracing this group, the athletic form and
          <lb/>open countenance of his black servant <persName>Bill</persName> always recurs
          <lb/>to my memory, with his upturned eye fixed affectionately
          <lb/>upon his master, as if he were the arbiter of his fate. On a
          <lb/>slippery and steep eminence at some distance, the intrepid
          <lb/><persName>Knox</persName> directed the passage of the artillery. His steed
          <lb/>seemed to tread in air, and he displayed the same firmness,
          <lb/>with which he continued to stand, as one of the pillars of
          <lb/>the temple of Liberty, until the storm which rocked her
          <lb/>foundations had past. The soldiers forced the horses, with
          <lb/>their baggage, down the slippery banks, and the slight
          <lb/>boats, in which they encountered the masses of ice borne
          <lb/>down by the river, seemed emblematical of the strug­
          <lb/>gles of an infant nation with one, whose armour, and whose
          <lb/>tone threatened destruction.</said></p>
          <p>Could <persName>Colonel ――</persName> have anticipated the events of

          <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">Spring</hi>, with her varying charms, was now every day
          <lb/>dispensing some new gift to the earth. The tardiness of
          <lb/>her first advance was compensated by the rapidity with
          <lb/>which she changed every thing subject to her influence;
          <lb/>as a timid child, ripening into the loveliness of woman­
          <lb/>hood, glides gracefully through those paths, which her
          <lb/>feet at first trembled to approach. The period was arriv­
          <lb/>ing, when the two most delightful seasons of the year
          <lb/>stand, as it were, on each other's boundary, blend their
          <lb/>unfinish'd work, dip their pencils in each other's dies, and
          <lb/>like the rival goddesses, contend before the sons of earth
          <lb/>for the palm of beauty. Even the rude settlement of the
          <lb/>children of the forest put on its beautiful garments. They,
          <lb/>whom their more fortunate brethren scarcely admitted
          <lb/>within the scale of humanity, were not shut out by pity­
          <lb/>ing nature from her smiles, or her exuberance. Through
          <lb/>the rich green velvet of her fields, the pure fountains look­
          <lb/>ed up with chrystal eyes, in silent joy. Bolder streams
          <lb/>murmured over rocky beds, occasionally falling in cas­
          <lb/>cades, like a restless spirit afflicted with the turmoils, and
          <lb/>tossings of the world. Wild flowers expanded their petals,

          <lb/>trees their blossoms, birds filled their retreats with harmo­
          <lb/>ny, or soared high, poured louder tones of transport, until
          <lb/>it seemed that every thicket, and every wave of air uttered
          <lb/>the strain, <quote><emph>Thou</emph> makest the outgoings of the morning,
          <lb/>and of the evening to rejoice.</quote></p>
          <p>The abode of old <persName>Zachary</persName> and <persName>Martha</persName> felt the influence
          <lb/>of this enlivening season. Already their aromatic herbs
          <lb/>yielded a pure essence to the busy inhabitants of the hives,
          <lb/>and their cow cropped with delight the juicy food of her
          <lb/>little pasture. A rose-bush near their door displayed its
          <lb/>swelling buds, and the woodbine protruded its young ten­
          <lb/>drils, to reach the window of the invalid. But within the
          <lb/>walls, was Age which knew no spring, and Youth, fading
          <lb/>like a blasted flower; night that could know no dawning,
          <lb/>and a morn that must never ascend to noon. The day had
          <lb/>closed over the inhabitants of that peaceful habitation.
          <lb/>The old warriour, and his wife were seated in the room
          <lb/>appropriated to their mysterious guest. Reclining in a
          <lb/>chair, which the ingenuity of <persName>Zachary</persName> had so constructed
          <lb/>as to answer the purposes of both seat and couch, and wrap­
          <lb/>ped in a loose dress of light calico, she watched the rising
          <lb/>of the full, round, silver moon, like one who loves its
          <lb/>beams, yet feels that he must soon bid it a returnless fare­
          <lb/>well. The bright, brown locks of that beautiful being,
          <lb/>twined in braids around a head of perfect symmetry, and
          <lb/>falling in profuse curls over her brow, formed a strong
          <lb/>contrast to the snow of her cheek, and seemed to deepen
          <lb/>the hue of her soft, blue eye. But the snows of her cheek

          <lb/>were now tinted with that ominous flush, whose brief
          <lb/>loveliness Death lends, as a signal of his approaching tri­
          <lb/>umph. Sometimes, it gave to her eye a ray of such un­
          <lb/>earthly brightness, that the tender-hearted <persName>Martha</persName> could
          <lb/>not gaze on it without a tear. She had remarked with
          <lb/>grief to her husband, that the form of the uncomplaining
          <lb/>victim was becoming rapidly emaciated, and respiration
          <lb/>feeble and laborious, and that all her culinary arts were
          <lb/>exerted in vain to stimulate appetite. The invalid gazed
          <lb/>long at the moon, with her forehead resting on a hand of
          <lb/>purest whiteness, which, partially shaded by the rich curls
          <lb/>that hung over it, seemed to display the flexile fingers of
          <lb/>childhood. Turning her eyes from the beautiful orb, she
          <lb/>observed those of the aged couple bent upon her with in­
          <lb/>tense earnestness. A long pause ensued. Something, that
          <lb/>refused utterance, seemed to agitate her. But they, mark­
          <lb/>ing the emotion which varied a countenance usually so
          <lb/>serene and passionless, forebore to break the silence lest
          <lb/>they should interrupt her musings, and dreaded to hear her
          <lb/>speak, lest it should be of separation. At length, a voice
          <lb/>tremulous and musical as the tones of a broken harp, was
          <lb/>heard to say—</p>
          <p><said>Father! you may recollect hearing me mention that
          <lb/>I was educated a child of the <orgName>Church of <placeName>England</placeName></orgName>. I love
          <lb/>her sacred services, though I have long been divided
          <lb/>from them. A clergyman of that order lives within a
          <lb/>few miles of us. I feel a desire to see him, and once

          <lb/>more to partake of the holy Sacrament. Will you bear
          <lb/>my request to him, Father?</said></p>
          <p><said>The feet of <persName>Zachary</persName> shall travel any where for the
          <lb/>comfort of his daughter,</said> said the old warriour, rising to
          <lb/>receive a letter which she held towards him.</p>
          <p><said>I knew it would be necessary to give some explana­
          <lb/>tion of my birth and education, before I could expect the
          <lb/>favour which my heart desires. You see now, Father,
          <lb/>why I requested you to procure a few sheets of paper
          <lb/>from the town. I have written in few words, for my hand
          <lb/>is weak. Perhaps I may yet intrust to the man of God
          <lb/>all my history, if I shall be strengthened to record it.</said>
          <lb/>Pausing, she added, <said>But it must not meet his eye, till
          <lb/>mine is closed.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Martha</persName> rose, with that undefinable sensation which moves
          <lb/>us to shrink from any subject by which our feelings are
          <lb/>agonized, and throwing up the casement for a moment,
          <lb/>through which the soft, humid air of Spring breathed,
          <lb/>said—</p>
          <p><said>Have you seen, <persName>Oriana</persName>, how your woodbine grows?
          <lb/>Soon it will be raising its young blossoms to look at
          <lb/>you, through the window.</said></p>
          <p><said>It will remind you of me, kind Mother,</said> she said,
          <lb/><said>and may its fragrance be soothing to you, even as your
          <lb/>tenderness has been to the lonely, and withering heart.</said></p>
          <p>Again there was silence, and then the aged man, raising
          <lb/>his head from his bosom where it had declined, spake in

          <mw type="pageNum">231</mw>

          <lb/>a voice which, as he proceeded, grew more calm, and
          <lb/>distinct.</p>
          <p><said>Daughter! I understand thee. It is vain that we
          <lb/>strive to conceal from each other a truth, with which we
          <lb/>are all acquainted. I am glad that thou hast spoken thy
          <lb/>mind to us. Yet is my soul at this moment weak as that
          <lb/>of an infant, though in battle no eye hath seen me turn to
          <lb/>shun the death, which I dealt to others. My daughter!
          <lb/><persName>Zachary</persName> could lie down in his grave, and not tremble.
          <lb/>Yet his heart is soft, when he sees one so young, and beau­
          <lb/>tiful, falling like the green leaf before the blast. <persName>Zacha­
          <lb/>ry</persName> is old, but his mind is selfish. He had desired to look
          <lb/>on thy brow, during the short space that he hath yet to
          <lb/>measure. He hath prayed the Eternal, that his ears might
          <lb/>continue to hear thy voice; for it was sweet to them.
          <lb/>His heart wished to have something to love, which should
          <lb/>not be as himself, every day decaying like the tree strip­
          <lb/>ped of its branches, and mouldering at the root. But
          <lb/>he must humble his heart. Thou hast told him that God
          <lb/>giveth grace unto the humble. Thou hast read unto
          <lb/>him, from thine holy book, till he has bowed in peni­
          <lb/>tence, and sought with tears in the silent midnight for
          <lb/>salvation through Christ. What shall he, and <persName>Martha</persName>
          <lb/>do, when thou art taken from them? Who will have
          <lb/>patience with their ignorance, as thou hast done? Who
          <lb/>will kindly teach them the way of life? Ask I what
          <lb/>we shall do, as if we had yet an hundred years to dwell

          <pb n="232"/><milestone unit="sig" n="20(2)v"/>
          <mw type="pageNum">232</mw>

          <lb/>on earth? We shall soon sleep in that grave, to which
          <lb/>thou art hastening.</said></p>
          <p><said>Whither I go, ye know,</said> answered the same sweet,
          <lb/>solemn voice, <said>and the way ye know. Hope in <emph>Him</emph>
          <lb/>who ye have believed. Like me, ye must soon slum­
          <lb/>ber in the dust; but <emph>His</emph> power shall raise ye up at the
          <lb/>last say. The Eternal, in whose sight shades of complex­
          <lb/>ion, and distinctions of rank are as nothing, <emph>He</emph> who look­
          <lb/>eth only upon the heart, bless you for your love to the
          <lb/>outcast, and lead you to that abode, where all which is be­
          <lb/>nevolent, and pure shall be gathered, and sundered no
          <lb/>more.</said></p>
          <p>She then laid her hand on her Prayer-book, which with
          <lb/>a small bible was always near her on the table, and <persName>Mar­
          <lb/>tha</persName> rose to light the lamp, which had hithero been neg­
          <lb/>lected.</p>
          <p><said>It is in vain, Mother!</said> she said, <choice><sic>“</sic><corr/></choice> with a lamb-like
          <lb/>smile. <said>I am too much exhausted to say with you my
          <lb/>evening prayer. Pray for yourselves, and for me, that we
          <lb/>may meet where is no infirmity or pain, and where sorrow
          <lb/>fleeteth away.</said></p>
          <p>Then, as if regretting that the night should draw over
          <lb/>them without their accustomed devotions, looking upward
          <lb/>she repeated with deep pathos, a few verses from the

          <p>The old warriour rising to take his leave for the night,
          <lb/>held his hands over her head, and pronounced in deep tones
          <lb/>the blessing of his nation. This he retained probably
          <lb/>from early associations, though he was now the disciple
          <lb/>of a better faith.</p>
          <p><said>The Great Spirit, who dwelleth where the Sun hideth
          <lb/>himself, and where the tempest is born, guide thee with
          <lb/>strength. He who maketh the earth fruitful, and the sky
          <lb/>bright, and the heart of man glad, smile on thee, and give
          <lb/>thee rest.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Martha</persName> remained to render some attentions to the suffer­
          <lb/>er. She removed her gently from her reposing seat to
          <lb/>the bed, gave her an infusion which was useful to repel in­
          <lb/>flammation, and quiet restlesness. But she dared not trust
          <lb/>her voice beyond a whisper, lest it should yield wholly
          <lb/>to her emotion. After her services were completed, she
          <lb/>lingered, as if unwilling to leave the pillow of the sufferer.</p>
          <p><said>Mother!</said> said the broken voice, <said>kind, tender moth­
          <lb/>er, go to thy rest. <persName>Oriana</persName> hath now no pain. Sleep will
          <lb/>descend upon her. She will not leave thee this night.
          <lb/>But soon she must begin her journey to the land of souls.
          <lb/>What then? She hath hope in her death, to pass from dark­
          <lb/>ness to eternal sunshine. Weep not, mother! but lift
          <lb/>your heart to the Father of consolation. I believe that
          <lb/>whither I go, thou shalt come also. I shall return no
          <lb/>more; but thou and thy beloved shall come unto me.
          <lb/>There will be scarcely time to mourn, ere, like the glid­
          <lb/>ing of a shadow, the parents shall follow their child.</said></p>

          <p>A celestial smile was upon her brow, which would have
          <lb/>cheered the grief of the aged woman, but for the reflec­
          <lb/>tion she must so soon behold it no more. So strongly did
          <lb/>her affectionate heart cling to this cherished object, that
          <lb/>sorrow shuddered at the thought that the beautiful taber­
          <lb/>nacle must be dissolved, even while Faith shadowed forth
          <lb/>the joy of the liberated spirit.</p>
          <p>The first rays of the sun found <persName>Zachary</persName> on the way to
          <lb/>the clergyman whom <persName>Oriana</persName> had designated. He paused
          <lb/>not on his weary journey. Travellers who passed him,
          <lb/>had they thought it fitting to bestow so much attention on
          <lb/>an <name>Indian</name>, might have perceived the tears occasionally
          <lb/>rolled over the furrows of his cheek, or hung upon his eye­
          <lb/>lashes, which like a fringe of silver, resembled in colour
          <lb/>the few hairs which were scattered upon his temples.</p>
          <p><said><persName>Zachary's</persName> heart is proud,</said> he would say, in com­
          <lb/>muning with himself. <said>The good prophet, when the de­
          <lb/>sire of his eyes was removed with a stroke, wept not,
          <lb/>neither made lamentation. It was so, for she read it to
          <lb/>me. She, who will soon open her blessed bible no more.
          <lb/>And <persName>Martha</persName>, she will grieve more than <persName>Zachary</persName>, for her
          <lb/>heart is weaker. Be strong, old warriour, that thou may­
          <lb/>est comfort the woman. Thou, whose heart did never
          <lb/>shrink in battle, what aileth thee, that it is now dissolved?
          <lb/>Thou art <emph>old</emph>, <persName>Zachary</persName>, and thy hairs are like snow;
          <lb/>wherefore shouldst thou mourn any more, for what the

          <lb/>man resided. Presenting the letter, the reverend man
          <lb/>perused it, and said with affectionate feeling—</p>
          <p><said>My brother, I will come to-morrow to your house.</said></p>
          <p>The afternoon of the succeeding day, the clergyman
          <lb/>was seen fastening his horse to the fence that enclosed the
          <lb/>garden of <persName>Zachary</persName>. He approached with the slow step,
          <lb/>and benevolent countenance, which were indicative of his
          <lb/>character. Firmness in the truth and mildness in the ex­
          <lb/>pression of it distinguished his conversation among men.
          <lb/>Filial trust in his God taught him to consider all as breth­
          <lb/>ren, and no hand raised the bruised reed more ten­
          <lb/>derly than his. When a child, the amusements of that
          <lb/>giddy period had no charms for him, in comparison with
          <lb/>those studies which nourish intellect. Thirteen sum­
          <lb/>mers had not past over him ere he made his election in
          <lb/>favour of that Church to which he faithfully devoted the
          <lb/>remainder of his life. So uninfluenced was this determi­
          <lb/>nation, that his parents and friends, who belonged to a
          <lb/>different sect, were ignorant of the arguments by which
          <lb/>his belief was fortified until he adduced them as a reason
          <lb/>of <quote>the hope that was in him.</quote> After spending his
          <lb/>youth in collegiate studies, he found that the sect to which
          <lb/>he had devoted himself was so far from enjoying popu­
          <lb/>larity, that not a single person existed in this country, to
          <lb/>administer to him the vows of ordination. He crossed the
          <lb/><placeName>Atlantic</placeName>, and received holy orders from the <persName>Bishop of
          <lb/><placeName>London</placeName></persName>, in <date when="1768">1768</date>. From that period he had been con­

          <lb/>nected with the parish in which he now resided; and his
          <lb/>attachment to the flock, and to the faith which he had
          <lb/>taught it, was among the warmest affections of his heart.
          <lb/>During the reign of those strong passions which our revo­
          <lb/>lutionary struggle excited, the single circumstance of his
          <lb/>adherence to the <orgName>Church of <placeName>England</placeName></orgName> created him ene­
          <lb/>mies among the more violent partizans, both political and
          <lb/>puritanical. His amiable virtues, and pious life were as
          <lb/>dust in the balance which the hand of enmity poised. For
          <lb/>three years the doors of his church were closed; but, from
          <lb/>house to house, he broke the bread of life to his little
          <lb/>flock, exhorting them to submit to <quote>principalities and
          <lb/>powers.</quote> In this day of darkness, he was pressed to re­
          <lb/>ceive a lucrative clerical establishment in <placeName>England</placeName>; but
          <lb/>he chose to adhere to the little community which he had
          <lb/>planted, through <quote>evil report and good report.</quote> Now
          <lb/>the rage of contest had subsided, and he again led his be­
          <lb/>loved followers to the sanctuary to pay their stated ser­
          <lb/>vices to the God of peace and consolation. When, on the
          <lb/>first <name>Sunday</name> after their exile, they convened in their con­
          <lb/>secrated temple, such was the saintly expression of his
          <lb/>countenance, and such the effect of his remarkably melo­
          <lb/>dious voice, as he uttered <said>From the rising of the sun,
          <lb/>even unto the going down of the same, my name shall be
          <lb/>great among the Gentiles, and in every place incense shall
          <lb/>be offered unto my name, and a pure offering,</said> and such
          <lb/>were the recollections, tender, melancholy, and soothing,
          <lb/>which arose at the appearance of their venerated pastor

          <lb/>again in his much loved pulpit, that a burst of tears min­
          <lb/>gled with their devotions, and sobs ascended with their
          <lb/>praises.</p>
          <p>Such was the man who, like a shepherd seeking his
          <lb/>sheep in remote places, now entered the abode of <persName>Zach­
          <lb/>ary</persName> and <persName>Martha</persName>. He received their respectful saluta­
          <lb/>tions with that smile for which he was distinguished—a
          <lb/>smile which seemed the irradiation of a spirit, whose
          <lb/>light was not kindled beneath the stars. He appeared
          <lb/>struck with the exceeding beauty of the stranger; and,
          <lb/>comparing it with the rude apartment, and the dark faces
          <lb/>of her aged attendants, he could scarcely forbear ex­
          <lb/>claiming, <said>verily we have this treasure in earthen ves­
          <lb/>sels, but the excellency of the power is of God, and not
          <lb/>of man.</said> After a conversation of considerable length
          <lb/>with the invalid, during which he became fully satisfied of
          <lb/>her religious education, correct belief, and happy spirit­
          <lb/>ual state, he prepared to administer to her that most holy
          <lb/>rite which her soul desired. Exhausted by the efforts of
          <lb/>discourse, and by the warmth of her gratitude for the ap­
          <lb/>proaching privilege, she laid herself on her couch, as a
          <lb/>pale lilly surcharged with dew reclines its head upon the
          <lb/>stalk. <persName>Zachary</persName> and <persName>Martha</persName> rose to depart.</p>
          <p><said>These are <name>Christians</name></said>, <persName>Oriana</persName> remarked, <said>In heart
          <lb/>and in life. They have been baptized many years since,
          <lb/>by <persName>Mr. Occom</persName>, their departed minister. I can bear wit­
          <lb/>ness that they know, and love the truth. May they not
          <lb/>partake with us, to the edification of their souls?</said></p>

          <pb n="238"/><milestone unit="sig" n="20(5)v"/>
          <mw type="pageNum">238</mw>

          <p>The clergyman, regarding them steadfastly, but kindly,
          <lb/>inquired—</p>
          <p><said>Are ye in perfect charity with all men?</said></p>
          <p>Bowing himself down, the old warriour replied solemn­
          <lb/>ly—</p>
          <p><said>We are. Your religion has taught even us <name>Indians</name>, to
          <lb/>forgive our enemies.</said></p>
          <p><said>Approach then,</said> said the minister of Heaven, <said>ap­
          <lb/>proach, ye who do truly, and earnestly repent you of your
          <lb/>sins, and are in love and charity with your neighbours, and
          <lb/>intend to lead a new life, following the commandments of
          <lb/>God.</said></p>
          <p>They kneeled by the bed of the sufferer. Often did
          <lb/>the tears roll in tides over the face of old <persName>Martha</persName>, and the
          <lb/>strong frame of the warriour tremble with emotion, as
          <lb/>that voice so deep-ton'd, so sweet, so solemn poured, in
          <lb/>its varying modulation, the sublime language of the most
          <lb/>holy office of religion, through the breathless silence of
          <lb/>their abode. But she, who, reduced to the weakness of
          <lb/>infancy, might have been supposed to be the most agitat­
          <lb/>ed, was as calm and unmoved as the lake, on which shines
          <lb/>nothing but the beam of heaven. Raised above every
          <lb/>cause of earthly excitement, she seemed to have a fore­
          <lb/>taste of the happy consummation that awaited her. And,
          <lb/>when the clergyman, with uplifted eyes, pronounced the
          <lb/><quote xml:lang="la">Gloria in excelsis,</quote> a voice of such thrilling, exquisite
          <lb/>melody warbled from couch, <quote>Glory to God in the
          <lb/>highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men,</quote>

          <lb/>that in the devotion of that moment one might have fanci­
          <lb/>ed that the harp of angels, was once more pouring the ad­
          <lb/>vent melody over the vallies of <placeName>Bethlehem</placeName>. The heart
          <lb/>of the good man was touched, and a tear starting to his
          <lb/>mild eye, attested the accordance of his soul with the
          <lb/>sympathies of the scene. His voice faltered as he utter­
          <lb/>ed the benediction, to which the aged warriour, bowing
          <lb/>his face to the earth, pronounced distinctly, Amen.</p>
          <p>A pause of several minutes ensued after this holy ordi­
          <lb/>nance. Each seemed fearful of interrupting the medita­
          <lb/>tion of another; and all felt as if a human voice would be
          <lb/>almost profanation amidst the heavenly calmness which
          <lb/>had descended upon them. Every <name>Christian</name>, who has
          <lb/>participated with sincere, and elevated devotion in this
          <lb/>sacred banquet, must have been sensible how empty, and
          <lb/>even painful are the first approaches of worldly conversa­
          <lb/>tion to the sublimated spirit. Like <persName>Moses</persName>, admitted to
          <lb/>the mysterious mountain, she dreads too suddenly to min­
          <lb/>gle with the multitude at its base; happy if, like him, she
          <lb/>may illumine the brow with celestial brightness, as a wit­
          <lb/>ness of her communion with the Eternal.</p>
          <p>The clergyman at length broke the silence by inquiring,
          <lb/>with his native benevolence, if there were not some article
          <lb/>of comfort which might alleviate her sufferings, and which
          <lb/>she would permit him to procure; or if she would not
          <lb/>wish to consult a physician on the nature of her dis­
          <lb/>ease.</p>
          <p><said>I desire nothing,</said> she added, <said>but what the care of
          <lb/>these kind beings provide for me. Their knowledge of

          <lb/>medicine is considerable, and they prepare with skill as­
          <lb/>suasive and soothing remedies, drawn from the bosom of
          <lb/>that earth to which I am returning. With the nature of
          <lb/>my disease I am acquainted. I saw all its variations in
          <lb/>my mother, for whom the utmost exertions of profes­
          <lb/>sional skill availed nothing. I feel upon my heart a cold
          <lb/>hand, and where it will lead me, I know. You, reverend
          <lb/>Father, can give me all that my brief earthly pilgrimage
          <lb/>requires. You can speak to me of the hope of Heaven,
          <lb/>when my ear is closed to the sound of other voices; and,
          <lb/>when my eye grows dim in death, it will brighten to be­
          <lb/>hold, and bless you.</said></p>
          <p>Pressing her hand, the servant of peace and consolation
          <lb/>took his leave, promising frequently to visit her, and en­
          <lb/>treating her to rely upon his friendship. <persName>Zachary</persName> and
          <lb/><persName>Martha</persName> followed him. Even the skirts of his garment
          <lb/>were dear to them, since he had imparted comfort to their
          <lb/>beloved one. Shaking hands with each, as he mounted
          <lb/>his horse, he said, <said>I see that she will not long tarry with
          <lb/>you. She is ready to commune with angels, and hasten to
          <lb/>join them. What a privilege have you enjoyed in her in­
          <lb/>structions! Pray that ye may tread in her steps.</said> They
          <lb/>stood gazing at him, till his form faded in distance, and
          <lb/>the warriour, whose retentive memory was stored with ma­
          <lb/>ny passages of scripture, gathered from the daily readings
          <lb/>of <persName>Oriana</persName>, repeated as he returned to her—<said>How beau­
          <lb/>tiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger,
          <lb/>that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace, that
          <lb/>saith unto <placeName>Zion</placeName>, thy God reigneth.</said></p>

          <p><hi rend="case(allcaps)">Three</hi> weeks had elapsed since the first interview of
          <lb/>the good clergyman with <persName>Oriana</persName>, during which period he
          <lb/>had frequently seen her. He was one who found leisure
          <lb/>both for duties, and for pleasures, because he systemati­
          <lb/>cally divided his time; and in his duties, his pleasures
          <lb/>lay. Complaints of the toil which his profession impos­
          <lb/>ed, of the drudgery of writing sermons, and the labour of
          <lb/>instructing the young, were never heard from him; for
          <lb/>he loved to be about his Master's business. Content with
          <lb/>a stipend, which the effeminacy of modern times would
          <lb/>pronounce insufficient for the necessaries of life, he taught
          <lb/>his family by example the art of cheerfully sustaining
          <lb/>privations, and of sacrificing their own wishes to the good
          <lb/>of others. He never studied to disjoin self-denial from
          <lb/>benevolence; and his conduct, and even his countenance
          <lb/>was an illustration of the inspired direction, respecting
          <lb/>the sons of <persName>Levi</persName>—<quote>Ye shall give them no possession in
          <lb/><placeName>Israel</placeName>, I am their possession; ye shall mete out to them
          <lb/>no inheritance, I am their inheritance.</quote> In his intercourse

          <lb/>with <persName>Oriana</persName>, his spiritual consolations were ever mingled
          <lb/>with solicitude for her earthly comfort. His wife, to
          <lb/>whom he had communicated what he knew of the inter­
          <lb/>esting invalid, continually sent by him cordials, and little
          <lb/>delicacies, which it was her pleasure to prepare for the
          <lb/>sick. His little children, moved by kindness at once
          <lb/>hereditary, and impressed by education, would add, what
          <lb/>she always received with peculiar gratitude, a bouquet of
          <lb/>the flowers, which their own hands had cultivated. He
          <lb/>had occasionally proposed to <persName>Oriana</persName> a removal to his
          <lb/>residence, hoping that a change of habitation might be
          <lb/>beneficial to her health. But the idea was painful to her.
          <lb/>She could not think of parting from those, who had cher­
          <lb/>ished her with such undivided tenderness, and whose
          <lb/>happiness had become interwoven with her presence.
          <lb/>Thanking him for his fatherly solicitude, she would say—</p>
          <p><said>The pomp and circumstance of life, to one about to
          <lb/>leave it, reveal their own emptiness. To have our neces­
          <lb/>sities ministered unto by hands which are never weary,
          <lb/>our pains mitigated by hearts which are never cold, is all
          <lb/>which a disease fatal like mine can ask. Fear not that I
          <lb/>am entirely burdensome to their poverty. My small stock
          <lb/>is not yet expanded, nor will it be until my animal wants
          <lb/>are at an end. Yet more than the perishable part is pro­
          <lb/>vided for. Your prayers, your instructions, Father,
          <lb/>strengthen my soul for her approaching flights. More than
          <lb/>contented, grateful, and happy, she waiteth till her change
          <lb/>come. Sometimes, when I lie sleepless, yet composed,

          <lb/>thoughts so serene pass over me, that I almost think I
          <lb/>hear the voice of my Redeemer, saying through the
          <lb/>silence of midnight, <quote rend="post()">when I sent ye forth without purse,
          <lb/>or scrip, lacked ye any thing?</quote> and I answer, <said rend="pre()post()">nothing
          <lb/>Lord,</said></said></p>
          <p>The gentle sufferer requested of her spiritual guide
          <lb/>that her history might not be mentioned among his ac­
          <lb/>quaintance. Visits of curiosity, she remarked, would only
          <lb/>interrupt the short space allotted her, which she wished to
          <lb/>employ in preparations for her departure; and those of
          <lb/>charity were unnecessary to a being, whose ties to the
          <lb/>world were so broken that her dependence upon it was
          <lb/>annihilated.</p>
          <p><said>It can now give me nothing,</said> she said, <said>but it may
          <lb/>take something away.</said></p>
          <p>He perceived that she wished to detach her mind from
          <lb/>surrounding objects, and cultivate a deep acquaintance
          <lb/>with her heart; as <persName>Cosmo de Medici</persName>, in his last sickness,
          <lb/>closed his eyes that he might see more clearly. <emph>He</emph>
          <lb/>could understand a desire, which some would be in dan­
          <lb/>ger of mistaking for affectation, or perverseness, or enthu­
          <lb/>siasm. He could sympathize in the aspirations of a soul,
          <lb/>desiring to be alone with its God. He prevailed on her,
          <lb/>however, to admit the attentions of a physician, who came,
          <lb/>and inquired minutely into the progress of her disease,
          <lb/>and the mode of treatment to which it had been subject­
          <lb/>ed. He approved the light nutriment of milk, and fruits,
          <lb/>which she had adopted, examined the herbs, and plants,

          <mw type="pageNum">244</mw>

          <lb/>whose infusions she had used, and seemed surprized at
          <lb/>their judicious adaptation to the different stages of her
          <lb/>malady. The knowledge professed by our natives of the
          <lb/>virtues of medicinal plants was not at that period under­
          <lb/>stood. <persName>Barton</persName> had not then given the world his research­
          <lb/>es or enriched our <name>Pharmacopoeïa</name> with the discoveries
          <lb/>of the children of the forest.</p>
          <p>The physician recommended the continuance of the re­
          <lb/>gimen which had been pursued, prescribing only some
          <lb/>simple additions; and, on his return, told his reverend
          <lb/>companion that the case of the invalid was beyond the
          <lb/>reach of medicine.</p>
          <p><said>She probably has derived from her parents the poison
          <lb/>which feeds on her vitals. Nature cannot long cope with
          <lb/>an enemy, who has already entered her citadel. But, if
          <lb/>I mistake not, there will be no struggle of the soul, when
          <lb/>its tabernacle is dissolved.</said></p>
          <p><said>No,</said> answered his friend, <said>she has long been con­
          <lb/>vinced, that to depart, and to be with Christ is far better.
          <lb/>It would seem as if this must always be the effect of mor­
          <lb/>tal disease upon the <name>Christian</name>. Yet such is the weakness
          <lb/>of faith, such the infirmity of man at his best estate, that
          <lb/>sometimes fear predominates most, when hope is about to
          <lb/>be changed into glory. I have supposed that your pro­
          <lb/>fession, which familiarizes man at once with the mystery
          <lb/>of his own construction, and the indefinite varieties of suf­
          <lb/>fering to which it is liable, would have a strong affinity
          <lb/>with that piety, which points the mortal part to its Ma­

          <lb/>ker, and the immortal to its home. Why is it then that,
          <lb/>among our many healers of the body, we find so few
          <lb/>qualified to act as physicians to the soul?</said></p>
          <p>The disciple of <persName>Esculapius</persName>, who was also a follower of
          <lb/>Christ, replied—</p>
          <p><said>Whoever penetrates into the secret springs of his
          <lb/>frame, must be constrained to acknowledge that he is
          <lb/><quote>fearfully and wonderfully made.</quote> <name>Anatomy</name>, like <name>As­
          <lb/>tronomy</name>, points the eye of an infinite Architect. But sim­
          <lb/>ply to acknowledge the existence of a God is far from being
          <lb/>the whole of <name>Christianity</name>. Thus far the devils believe,
          <lb/>while they tremble. You have thought, Sir, that a con­
          <lb/>stant view of the pains, and infirmities of our race ought
          <lb/>to awaken piety. Thus the most eloquent apostle assert­
          <lb/>ed, that the <emph>goodness</emph> of God ought to lead men to repent­
          <lb/>ance. But the perverseness, which in one case produces
          <lb/>ingratitude, in the other generates pride. He boasts that
          <lb/>his science can arrest the ravages of disease, and tear the
          <lb/>victory from death. So that <quote><emph>Him</emph>, in whose hand is his
          <lb/>breath, hath he not glorified.</quote> Besides, our familiarity
          <lb/>with all the modifications of distress blunts the sensibili­
          <lb/>ty, through which alone it can convey a lesson to the heart.
          <lb/>Our danger is of materialism, of resting in natural reli­
          <lb/>gion, or of elevating the pride of science into the place
          <lb/>of God. From all these His Spirit can deliver us.</said></p>
          <p>This excellent man, who happily blended piety with
          <lb/>professional skill, resided in the northern part of the town,
          <lb/>and was the writer of that epitaph on a son of the depart­

          <lb/>ed royalty of <name>Mohegan</name>, which appeared at the close of
          <lb/>the third chapter. His memory is still revered, and the
          <lb/>celebrity which he acquired in the science of medicine,
          <lb/>is still enjoyed by his descendants. Soon after the con­
          <lb/>versation which has been related, he stopped on a visit of
          <lb/>charity, ti which he was so much accustomed, that it was
          <lb/>said his horse turned involuntarily towards the abodes of
          <lb/>poverty. The divine, thanking him for his attention to the
          <lb/>mysterious invalid, pursued his homeward journey.</p>
          <p>Exhausted in body, but confirmed in faith, <persName>Oriana</persName> wait­
          <lb/>ed her dissolution. Such was the wasting of her frame,
          <lb/>that she seemed reduced to a spiritual essence, trembling,
          <lb/>and ready to be exhaled. Every pure morning, she de­
          <lb/>sired the casement to be thrown open, that the fresh air
          <lb/>might visit her. But at length, this from an occasional
          <lb/>gratification became an object of frequent necessity, to aid
          <lb/>laborious respiration. The couch, which she had been
          <lb/>resolute in leaving while her strength permitted, was now
          <lb/>her constant refuge. The febrile symptoms of that terri­
          <lb/>ble disease, which delights to prey on the most fair and
          <lb/>excellent, gradually disappeared but debility increased
          <lb/>to an almost insupportable degree. Smiles now constant­
          <lb/>ly sat upon her face, and seemed to indicate that the bit­
          <lb/>terness of death had already passed. The irritation of
          <lb/>pain, which had marked her features, subsided into a tran­
          <lb/>quil loveliness, which sometimes brightened into joy, as
          <lb/>one who felt that <quote>redemption draweth nigh.</quote> One night,
          <lb/>sleep had not visited her eyes; for, whenever her sense

          <lb/>began to be lulled into transient repose, the spirit in its
          <lb/>extasy seemed to revolt against such oppression, desirous
          <lb/>to escape to that region, where it should slumber no more,
          <lb/>through fullness of bliss.</p>
          <p>Calling to her bedside, at the dawn of morning, the old
          <lb/>warriour, for her mother for several nights had watched
          <lb/>beside her, she said—</p>
          <p><said>Knowest thou, Father, that I am now about to leave
          <lb/>thee?</said></p>
          <p>Fixing his keen glance upon her for a moment, and
          <lb/>kneeling at her side, he answered—</p>
          <p><said>I know it, my daughter. Thy blue eye hath already
          <lb/>the light of that sky to which thou art ascending. Thy
          <lb/>brow hath the smile of the angels who wait for thee.</said></p>
          <p><persName>Martha</persName> covered her face with her hands, and hid it on
          <lb/>the couch, fearful lest she might see agony in one so be­
          <lb/>loved. Yet she fixed on that pallid countenance another
          <lb/>long, tender gaze, as the expiring voice said—</p>
          <p><said>I go, where is no shade of complexion—no trace of
          <lb/>sorrow. I go to meet my parents, who died in faith; my
          <lb/><persName>Edward</persName>, whose trust was in his Redeemer. I shall see thy
          <lb/>daughter, and she will be my sister, where all is love.
          <lb/>Father! Mother! that God, whom you have learned to
          <lb/>worship, whose spirit dwells in your hearts, guide you
          <lb/>thither also.</said></p>
          <p>Extending to each a hand, cold as marble, she said—</p>
          <p><said>I was a stranger, and ye took me in: sick, and ye

          <lb/>ministered unto me. And now I go unto Him, who hath
          <lb/>said <quote rend="post()">the merciful should obtain mercy.</quote></said></p>
          <p>They felt that the chilling clasp of her fingers relaxed,
          <lb/>and saw that her lips moved inaudibly. They knew that
          <lb/>she was addressing <emph>Him</emph>, who was taking her unto himself.
          <lb/>A smile not to be described passed, like a gleam of sun­
          <lb/>shine, over her countenance; and they heard the words
          <lb/><quote>joy unspeakable, and full of glory.</quote> Something more
          <lb/>was breathed in the faintest utterance, but she closed not
          <lb/>the sentence—it was finished in Heaven.</p>
          <p>There was long silence in the apartment, save the sobs
          <lb/>of the bereaved <persName>Martha</persName>, and at long intervals a deep sigh,
          <lb/>as if bursting from the bottom of the breast of the aged
          <lb/>warriour. Then he rose from the earth where he had
          <lb/>stooped his forehead, and took the hand of his companion.</p>
          <p><said>We have heard,</said> he said, <said>before we were <name>Chris­
          <lb/>tians</name>, that too much grief is displeasing to the Great Spirit.
          <lb/>Let us pray to that God, to whom she has returned. She
          <lb/>hath taught us to call <emph>Him</emph> Father, who was once terrible
          <lb/>to our thought. She was as the sun in our path. But she
          <lb/>hath set behind the dark mountains. Hath <emph>set</emph> did I say?
          <lb/>No. She  hath risen to a brighter sky, and beams of her
          <lb/>light will sometimes visit us. Thou hast wept for two
          <lb/>daughters, <persName>Martha</persName>. One, thou didst nurse upon thy breast.
          <lb/>But was she dearer than this? Did not the child of our
          <lb/>adoption lie as near to our heart, as she to whom we gave
          <lb/>life? Henceforth, we shall be made childless no more.
          <lb/>Let us dry up the fountain of our sorrows. Let us pray

          <lb/>together to Him who maketh the heart soft, and bindeth
          <lb/>it up.</said></p>
          <p>The day seemed of indeterminable length to the aged
          <lb/>mourners, who, long accustomed to measure time by the
          <lb/>varieties of solicitude, felt that the loss of the sole object
          <lb/>of their care had given to the hours a weight, under which
          <lb/>they heavily moved.</p>
          <p>In the afternoon, the clergyman, who for several days
          <lb/>had not visited their habitation, was seen to approach it.
          <lb/><persName>Zachary</persName> went to meet him. The agitation, which had so
          <lb/>long marked the manner of the grief-stricken warriour,
          <lb/>had subsided; and he moved with the calm dignity which
          <lb/>was natural to him. His deportment seemed an illustra­
          <lb/>tion of the words of the king of <placeName>Israel</placeName>, when his child was
          <lb/>smitten:—</p>
          <p><said>She is dead. Wherefore should I mourn? Can I
          <lb/>bring her back again? I shall go to her, but she shall not
          <lb/>return to me.</said></p>
          <p>Bowing to the clergyman, he said—</p>
          <p><said>She, whom you seek, is not here. She arose ere the
          <lb/>sun looked upon the morning. Come, see the place where
          <lb/>she lay.</said></p>
          <p>Departing from the distant respect bordering upon awe,
          <lb/>which he had been accustomed to testify towards the guide
          <lb/>of <persName>Oriana</persName>, he led him by the hand to the apartment, as if
          <lb/>he felt that in the house of death all distinctions were lev­
          <lb/>elled, and all men made equal.</p>

          <pb n="250"/><milestone unit="sig" n="21(5)v"/>
          <mw type="pageNum">250</mw>

          <p><persName>Martha</persName> lifted up a white sheet, and discovered the life­
          <lb/>less form clad in a robe and cap of the purest cambrick,
          <lb/>which those beautiful hands had prepared, and preserved
          <lb/>for the occasion. Rich and profuse curls still clustered
          <lb/>round an oval forehead, which bore no furrow of care, or
          <lb/>trace of pain. Long, silken eye-lashes fringed the im­
          <lb/>moveable lids, which concealed, in their marble caskets,
          <lb/>gems forever sealed from the gaze of man. But whoever
          <lb/>has beheld beauty, which Death has blanched but not
          <lb/>destroyed; or has hung over the ruins of the Creator's
          <lb/>fairest workmanship, deserted by life, but not by love;
          <lb/>may have realized that moment of thrilling tenderness, of
          <lb/>speechless awe, which he should in vain attempt to de­
          <lb/>scribe.</p>
          <p><said>It is finished!</said> said the divine, lowering his head;
          <lb/>but no tear stole over his placid countenance. He be­
          <lb/>lieved that if there is joy among the angels in Heaven
          <lb/>over one sinner that repenteth, there ought at least to be
          <lb/>resignation on earth, when a saint is admitted to their glo­
          <lb/>rious company. Kneeling down he prayed with the
          <lb/>mourners, and after the orison, said—</p>
          <p><said>Great is the blessing which has been lent to you, my
          <lb/>friends. Her prayers, her instructions, her example, how
          <lb/>precious were they all to you! May thee, through the
          <lb/>aid of the Holy Spirit, lead you where she has gone.</said></p>
          <p><said>My heart is sorrowful,</said> said old <persName>Martha</persName>, <said>because
          <lb/>my ears hear no more the sound of her voice. Every

          <lb/>place, in which she has sat, speaks the name of <persName>Oriana</persName>. I
          <lb/>go to it, but she is not there.</said></p>
          <p>The clergyman spoke kind words of comfort to them,
          <lb/>as to his bretheren; <choice><sic>andere</sic><corr>and ere</corr></choice> he departed, made arrange­
          <lb/>ments for the funeral solemnities, that the bones of the
          <lb/>stranger might rest in consecrated earth. Two days elaps­
          <lb/>ed, and the scene changed to the burial ground of the re­
          <lb/>ligious community, to which he ministered. An open
          <lb/>grave was seen there, and a few forms flitting among the
          <lb/>shades which environed the spot, as if watching for some
          <lb/>funeral train. The passing-bell, echoing from rock to
          <lb/>rock, fell with its solemn, measured sound upon their ear,
          <lb/>as they roved amid the mouldering remains of their fellow
          <lb/>creatures. There was here but few monuments, and
          <lb/>none whose splendour could attract the attention of the
          <lb/>traveller. It might seem as if those, who here slumber­
          <lb/>ed, had realized the fallacy of those arts, by which man
          <lb/>strives to adhere to the remembrance of his kind.</p>
          <p>Perhaps, among this group, were some recent mourn­
          <lb/>ers, who felt their wounds bleed afresh at the sight of an
          <lb/>open grave. Perhaps some parent might there be seen,
          <lb/>bowing in agony over the newly covered bed of his child;
          <lb/>some daughter, kneeling to kiss the green turf upon the
          <lb/>breast of her mother; some lover, weeping amid the ru­
          <lb/>ins of his hope, or casting an unopened rose bud on the
          <lb/>grave of her who had perished in beauty. Alas! how
          <lb/>many varieties of grief had that narrow spot witnessed,
          <lb/>since it cast a heavy mantle over the head of its first ten­

          <pb n="252"/><milestone unit="sig" n="21(6)v"/>
          <mw type="pageNum">252</mw>

          <lb/>ant. How many hearts had there laid the idol of their
          <lb/>worship, and withered over the broken altar. How many
          <lb/>sad spirits had there buried the roses that adorned their
          <lb/>bower; and passed the remainder of their pilgrimage un­
          <lb/>der the cloud.</p>
          <p>Here too, with the sigh of mourning perhaps mingled
          <lb/>the pang of compunction: for how few can say, when the
          <lb/>earth covers their beloved ones, between us, nothing has
          <lb/>transpired at which memory should blush—nothing been
          <lb/>omitted, on which regret can feed—nothing done, which
          <lb/>tenderness would wish to alter—nothing left undone, which
          <lb/>duty, or religion could supply? Perhaps some, amid that
          <lb/>group, might realize that the thorn of the conscience can
          <lb/>rankle, long after the wound of God's visitation had been
          <lb/>healed. Others might there have wandered, in whose
          <lb/>hearts Time had blunted the arrow of Grief. The shrine,
          <lb/>once empty in the sanctuary of their soul, filled by some
          <lb/>other image; and were it possible that the tomb should
          <lb/>restore to their arms that tenant whom they once
          <lb/>thought to lament with eternal tears, might there not be
          <lb/>some barrier to joy, some change in love, wrought by
          <lb/>the silent mutation of years? Yet of whatever nature
          <lb/>were the reflections of the group, who circled with light
          <lb/>footstep, the <quote>cold turf-altar of the dead,</quote> they were soon
          <lb/>interrupted by the approach of a procession. It was first
          <lb/>seen indistinctly through trees—the winding over the
          <lb/>bridge—then pacing, with solemn step, and slow, the base
          <lb/>of one of the principal streets. Then turning obliquely,

          <lb/>it entered the western road, which, skirting the banks of
          <lb/>the river, led directly to that narrow house, where the
          <lb/>pale assembly slumbered. As they pursued their course,
          <lb/>the rough, broken rocks, towering on their right hand, and
          <lb/>in their rear the bustle of the town, might seem an emblem
          <lb/>of the paths and pursuits of the worldling: while, on their
          <lb/>left, the pure, placid current, reflecting the brightness of
          <lb/>a sun already approaching the horizon, typified the re­
          <lb/>pose of the saint, when he <quote>resteth from his labours, and
          <lb/>his works follow him.</quote></p>
          <p>Next to the bier, walked the aged wariour, and his
          <lb/>wife; like the patriarch, who would go down to the grave
          <lb/>to his son mourning. The <persName>Chieftain Robert</persName>, and <persName>John
          <lb/>Cooper</persName> followed, with heads declined; as those who had
          <lb/>testified friendship for the deceased, without having been
          <lb/>acquainted with her history. Many of the natives of <name>Mo­
          <lb/>hegan</name>, two and two, in decent dresses, next appeared,
          <lb/>wishing to shew respect to old <persName>Zachary</persName>, whom they all
          <lb/>loved. A number of the inhabitants of the town were
          <lb/>seen to close the procession. They had heard, from the
          <lb/>benevolent clergyman, some notice of the departed; and
          <lb/>had walked out a mile to meet those who came to discharge
          <lb/>the last offices of respect to the mysterious stranger. He,
          <lb/>ascending the steps, where he had so often preceded the
          <lb/>trains of sorrow, uncovered a head where care had already
          <lb/>begun to shed its snows. The peculiar melody of his
          <lb/>voice was never more apparent, than when its soothing,
          <lb/>and impressive tones poured forth on the silence of the

          <lb/>funeral scene, <said><quote>I am the resurrection, and the life, saith
          <lb/>the Lord.</quote></said> The attention of the natives to this solemn
          <lb/>service was almost breathless. It seemed as if their hum­
          <lb/>bled, dejected countenances were an illustration of that
          <lb/>pathetic portion of it, <said><quote>Man that is born of a woman, is
          <lb/>of few days, and full of misery.</quote></said> Tears rolled over the
          <lb/>face of old <persName>Martha</persName> at the words, <said><quote>He cometh up and is
          <lb/>cut down like a flower, he fleeth as it were a shadow,
          <lb/>and never continueth in one stay.</quote></said> The hollow sound of
          <lb/>the clods falling upon the lid of the coffin, and the voice,
          <lb/><said><quote>earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust,</quote></said> drew a
          <lb/>deep groan from the hoary warriour. <persName>John Cooper</persName>, who,
          <lb/>strongly attached to the customs of <persName>Mr. Occom</persName>, had list­
          <lb/>ened with some touch of sectarian feeling, was so much
          <lb/>affected at the introduction of the passage, <quote>write! bless­
          <lb/>ed are the dead, who die in the Lord,</quote> that, forgetting he

          <lb/>sponded fervently, <said rend="pre()post()">Amen.</said> At the close of the service,
          <lb/>the divine approached old <persName>Zachary</persName>, and took him by the
          <lb/>hand. He stood like some tall tree in the forest firm at
          <lb/>the root, but whose boughs are marked by a winter which

          <lb/>when on the threshold of His presence, who <quote>hateth
          <lb/>every false way.</quote></p>

          <p>I was born in <placeName>Blackburn</placeName>, in the county of <placeName>Lancashire</placeName>,
          <lb/>in <placeName>England</placeName>, and descended of obscure, but virtuous ances­
          <lb/>tors. My father, whose name was <persName>Selden</persName>, was devoted
          <lb/>to the pursuits of agriculture. He married rather late in
          <lb/>life, and died while I was yet a child. With the profits
          <lb/>of his industry, my mother purchased a neat cottage in a
          <lb/>retired spot, where she devoted herself to my welfare.
          <lb/>Her education had been superiour to what is usually found
          <lb/>among those of her rank; and the few books which she
          <lb/>possessed, aided by the force of her example, excited in
          <lb/>me an early taste for reading. I can scarcely imagine a
          <lb/>lot more congenial with happiness than ours. Our income
          <lb/>was adequate to our wants; and that industry, which pre­
          <lb/>served our health, gave us the power of administering to
          <lb/>the necessities of others. When my daily share of labour
          <lb/>was completed, my recreations were to tend my flowers,
          <lb/>to read, to converse with my mother while we were both
          <lb/>employed with our needles, or to join my voice to that of
          <lb/>the birds who surrounded our habitation. I was under
          <lb/>the pastoral charge of the <persName>Rev. Mr. Owen</persName>, of the <orgName>Estab­
          <lb/>lished Church</orgName>, a man of the most ardent piety, and inde­
          <lb/>fatigable zeal in the instruction of his flock. By him I
          <lb/>was baptized in infancy, and weekly catechized in my
          <lb/>knowledge of those doctrines, which he explained with
          <lb/>simplicity, and illustrated by example. I have often re­
          <lb/>flected with gratitude that by him I was prepared for the

          <lb/>vows of confirmation, and by his hand led to that holy
          <lb/>sacrament which our Saviour has instituted for the peni­
          <lb/>tent believer. It was impossible to attend to his injunc­
          <lb/>tions without cultivating that close acquaintance with the
          <lb/>heart, that scrutiny into its springs of action, which in­
          <lb/>duce deep humility, and a renunciation of merit, save
          <lb/>through the mediation of Him, <quote>who offered himself
          <lb/>without spot to God.</quote> To the blessing of the Holy
          <lb/>Spirit on the instructions of this beloved guide do I im­
          <lb/>pute, that the foundation of my faith was laid even in
          <lb/>childhood so strong, that it does not fail me now, in my
          <lb/>hour of trial. Mingled also with the pursuits of piety,
          <lb/>was a thirst for knowledge. But to this my lot afforded on­
          <lb/>ly a limited gratification. <persName>Edward Merton</persName>, the son of a
          <lb/>family of distinction in the vicinity, became interested to
          <lb/>teach me what wealth afforded him the means of acquir­
          <lb/>ing. His noble mind, enlarged by the circle of the sci­
          <lb/>ences, took pleasure in imparting to others its own riches.
          <lb/>Most of his evenings were passed at our cottage, in reading
          <lb/>to us the works of authors, which we had no other means
          <lb/>of obtaining. That joy seemed to animate him, with
          <lb/>which the benevolent mind gives food to the hungry, or
          <lb/>opens a fountain to the thirsty soul. To my simple mind,
          <lb/>he seemed as a pure spirit bowing from the skies to ele­
          <lb/>vate an inferiour race. At length it became evident that
          <lb/>he loved the mind which he had himself adorned; like him
          <lb/>who, imparting fire from heaven to an inert mass, became
          <lb/>its adorer. Authorized in cherishing a virtuous attach­

          <lb/>ment, it increased every day, and every night I thanked
          <lb/>my Creator with exuberant gratitude, for the fullness of
          <lb/>my joy. Yet my heart too much exulted, too exclusively
          <lb/>trusted to the earth, and at the moment when I thought
          <lb/>my sky the brightest, it was involved in a cloud of woe.
          <lb/><persName>Edward's</persName> only surviving parent was a father, a proud, and
          <lb/>mercenary man. Two sons were his sole offspring, and
          <lb/>the idea that one should marry a cottager was insupporta­
          <lb/>ble. With the threat of disinheritance, he commanded
          <lb/>him to relinquish the design; and I, educated with high
          <lb/>ideas of filial obedience, entreated him to submit, though
          <lb/>my heart felt that it must break at his desertion. Nothing,
          <lb/>however, was able to destroy the inviolable affection of
          <lb/>that exalted being. To me, a novice in the school of sor­
          <lb/>row, this trial appeared too much for endurance, until it
          <lb/>was appointed to be swallowed up in a greater affliction.
          <lb/>My mother, whose health had been delicate from her
          <lb/>youth, and who had long been subject to symptoms of dis­
          <lb/>ease, which she laboured to conceal from me, now rapid­
          <lb/>ly declined. I watched in agony, day and night, the
          <lb/>struggles of a gentle spirit, disengaging itself from clay.
          <lb/>Her resignation to the divine will was scarcely shaded by
          <lb/>maternal anxiety; for she trusted to leave her orphan to
          <lb/>the protection of one, who loved the orphan's God.
          <lb/>Sometimes she would join our hands, as we kneeled to­
          <lb/>gether by her couch, saying with a smile, <said>My children,
          <lb/>you will be happy, though I am gone. Yet forget not to
          <lb/>seek greater happiness; for ah! if you come not to me,

          <lb/>at last, there will be mourning in Heaven.</said> I had forborne
          <lb/>to communicate to her the opposition of <persName>Edward's</persName> father
          <lb/>to our union, lest it might embitter her parting moments.
          <lb/>But as her sickness approached its fatal termination, he
          <lb/>was himself summoned to his last account. He had been
          <lb/>for some time absent, superintending an estate in <placeName>Ireland</placeName>,
          <lb/>and encountering a storm in the Channel, was drowned
          <lb/>on his homeward passage. He gave by will all his pos­
          <lb/>sessions to his eldest son, to whom he was partial, and
          <lb/>who resembled him in character. <persName>Edward</persName> came to us
          <lb/>depressed at the depth of his poverty. But my heart
          <lb/>with deep gratitude thanked the Eternal Sire, that I might
          <lb/>now return his affection without the imputation of merce­
          <lb/>nary motives, and relieved from the dread of a father's
          <lb/>malediction. He departed for a few days to seek some
          <lb/>prospect of maintenance, and returned only in time to
          <lb/>support me to my mother's grave. The fatal disease,
          <lb/>which has set its seal upon me, triumphed over both my
          <lb/>parents. The bitterness of my orphanage was consoled
          <lb/>by the voice of love as pure, as ardent, as holy, as ever
          <lb/>dwelt in the breast of man. So firmly was it returned,
          <lb/>that I heard, without repining, that the only resource
          <lb/>which remained was to join the army, then about to em­
          <lb/>bark for <placeName>America</placeName> under <persName>Earl Cornwallis</persName>.</p>

          <p>We were married, and my little patrimony, which in
          <lb/>consequence of my mother's sickness had become some­
          <lb/>what encumbered with debt, was sold. Hand in hand,
          <lb/>we parted from that sweet cottage, to encounter the perils

          <lb/>of ocean, and war in a foreign land. Methought that little
          <lb/>retreat never looked so beautifully as when we were leav­
          <lb/>ing it. Its roses, and woodbines breathed fragrantly, and
          <lb/>the smooth-shorn grass before it was like the richest vel­
          <lb/>vet. With the warmth of seventeen, I was attached to
          <lb/>every spot which had ministered to the joy of a childhood
          <lb/>whose traces were yet recent in my memory. I gazed on
          <lb/>the white roof of the home, hallowed by the last breath of
          <lb/>my mother, until trees hid it from my view. Yet all
          <lb/>the attractions of my native country vanished, as shadows,
          <lb/>before my vow'd affection to him, for whose sake I was
          <lb/>willing to become a wanderer. He was my all, and the
          <lb/>idolatry of my soul was perfect. Therefore its altar of
          <lb/>earth was removed, and the image to which it offered in­
          <lb/>cense was broken.</p>

          <p>I will not detain you, Reverend Sir, with the dangers
          <lb/>of our voyage, or the hardships of a life in camps. Like
          <lb/>the servitude of <persName>Jacob</persName>, they seemed to me as nothing
          <lb/><quote>for the love I bare him.</quote> But in time of battle, my
          <lb/>wretchedness was extreme. It was then that, imploring
          <lb/>protection for my husband, I first learned what was meant
          <lb/>by <quote>the agony of prayer</quote>. Of a daring, and invincible
          <lb/>spirit, he was ambitious to stand foremost in the ranks of
          <lb/>danger. His intrepidity gained the attention of his offi­
          <lb/>cers, and led to his promotion. This stimulated his mili­
          <lb/>tary enthusiasm, and when I entreated him to be careful
          <lb/>of his life <emph>for my sake</emph>, he would answer firmly, but with
          <lb/>tenderness, <said>In the scenes to which my duty calls me

          <pb n="263"/><milestone unit="sig" n="22(6)r"/>
          <mw type="pageNum">263</mw>

          <lb/>there can be no protector but the God of battles. Is he
          <lb/>not also a God of the widow?</said></p>

          <p rend="pre()">But from the details of war I have ever shrunk, and now
          <lb/>my trembling hand, and fluttering heart admonish me to
          <lb/>be brief. Seldom has one, who possessed such native
          <lb/>aversion from all varieties of strife, such an instinctive
          <lb/>horrour at the sight of blood-shed, been appointed to share
          <lb/>the fortunes of a soldier. During the investment of <placeName>York­
          <lb/>town</placeName>, in the autumn of <date when="1781">1781</date>, he was almost constantly
          <lb/>divided from me, either on some post of fatigue, or expos­
          <lb/>ure. The minute scenes of that eventful period are en­
          <lb/>graved on my memory, as with the point of a diamond.
          <lb/>Often have I retraced the circumstances of the last night
          <lb/>which I passed in that fatal spot. The atmosphere was
          <lb/>faintly lighted by stars, shedding that dim, doubtful beam,
          <lb/>which disposes the mind to melancholy contemplation.
          <lb/>I was alone, and the heaviness of my solitude in a strange
          <lb/>land oppressed my heart like a physical weight. The
          <lb/>works of the allied <name>French</name> and <name>Americans</name> were every day
          <lb/>brought more nearly to us. In the form of a crescent they
          <lb/>spread themselves before us, cutting off our communica­
          <lb/>tion with the neighbouring country. The ships of <placeName>France</placeName>,
          <lb/>anchored at the mouth of <placeName>York River</placeName>, prevented our re­
          <lb/>ceiving supplies from thence, or aid from <persName>Sir Henry Clin­
          <lb/>ton</persName>, who in <placeName>New-York</placeName> awaited our fate with anxiety. A
          <lb/>fixed gloom might be seen on the countenance of <persName>Corn­
          <lb/>wallis</persName>; and <persName>Tarleton</persName>, who had hithero poured his bold
          <lb/>soul into the enterprise, was suffering pain, and dejection

          <lb/>from a wound. The prospects of our army were dark in
          <lb/>the extreme, and I was continually agitated with fears for
          <lb/>my sole earthly stay. To dissipate the melancholy im­
          <lb/>pressions which thronged my soul, I ascended to the top
          <lb/>of the house to take a view of that glorious firmament,
          <lb/>which had so often led my thoughts from the woes of earth
          <lb/>to the tranquillity of heaven. But the thunder of a terrible
          <lb/>cannonade drew my attention to the surrounding scene.
          <lb/>The whole peninsula seemed to tremble beneath the en­
          <lb/>gines of war. Bombs, from the batteries of both parties,
          <lb/>were continually crossing each others path. Like blazing
          <lb/>meteors their luminous trains traversed each other, with
          <lb/>awful sublimity. Sometimes I heard that hissing sound,
          <lb/>when in their fall they excavate the earth, and rend in
          <lb/>atoms whatever opposes them. Once I saw the severed,
          <lb/>mangled limbs of several <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> soldiers thrown into the
          <lb/>air, by their explosion. I fancied that I heard a groan of
          <lb/>agony in the voice that I loved, and listened till sensation
          <lb/>almost forsook me. Suddenly, a flame sprang forth from
          <lb/>the bosom of the river. It was a column of ineffable
          <lb/>brightness. The waters seemed to feed it, and every mo­
          <lb/>ment it rose higher, and extended wider, as if uncertain
          <lb/>whether first to enfold the earth, or the heavens. Then
          <lb/>two smaller furnaces burst forth near it, breathing intense
          <lb/>fires in spiral forms, beautiful and dreadful. I gazed, till
          <lb/>the waters glowed in one dazzling expanse, and I know
          <lb/>not but the Almighty in anger at the crimes of man, was
          <lb/>kindling around him an ocean of flame; as He once pour­

          <lb/>ed over him a deluge of waters. But nothing could hush
          <lb/>the incessant roar of these engines of death; and I thought
          <lb/>that man would continue to pursue his brother with hatred,
          <lb/>even to the conflagration of the day of doom. When the
          <lb/>influence of an excited imagination had subsided, I found
          <lb/>that this splendid and fearful pageant was the burning of the
          <lb/><name>Charon</name>, one of our ships of war, with two smaller vessels
          <lb/>at anchor in the river, which had been set on fire by a
          <lb/>heated shell from the <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> battery. Chilled with the
          <lb/>damps of evening, I descended, and threw myself upon
          <lb/>my sleepless couch. My health had for some time suffer­
          <lb/>ed for want of exercise in the open air, from which I was
          <lb/>precluded by the impossibility of enjoying the company,
          <lb/>and protection of my husband. On the afternoon of the
          <lb/>following day, he entered his apartment. It was <name>Sunday</name>,
          <lb/><date when="1781-10-14"><name>October</name> 14th</date>, for misery stamped the date indelibly on
          <lb/>my soul. He told me that he was to remain with me, until
          <lb/>evening should call him forth to his watch upon the ram­
          <lb/>parts. He requested me to read the service for the day
          <lb/>from the Prayer-book; for we had endeavoured, as far as
          <lb/>possible amid the privations of our existence, to hallow the
          <lb/>day of God by private devotion. As I closed the volume,
          <lb/>the sun forsook the horizon, leaving a beautifully serene
          <lb/>sky. He proposed a walk, to which I gladly assented;
          <lb/>and as the means of prolonging it, without attracting par­
          <lb/>ticular attention in streets filled with soldiers, desired me
          <lb/>to wear a suit of his military apparel. Yielding to his rea­
          <lb/>soning, I consented thus to array  myself; and we strolled

          <lb/><rs type="properAdjective">American</rs> climate, is so peculiarly brilliant. We indulged
          <lb/>in a conversation, which selected from the past the most
          <lb/>soothing recollections, and gilded the future with the pen­
          <lb/>cil of hope. We followed the course of the fortifications
          <lb/>until we had passed, almost unconsciously, the last re­
          <lb/>doubt. The shadows of evening were beginning to con­
          <lb/>ceal the landscape, when we heard the trampling of many
          <lb/>feet. The white uniform of the <name>French</name>, and presently
          <lb/>that of the <name>Americans</name> were seen, through the trees which
          <lb/>skirted our path. My husband had scarcely time to draw
          <lb/>his sword, when a volley of shot was poured upon us. A
          <lb/>bullet pierced his breast, and he fell without life. I fell
          <lb/>with him, senseless as himself. I recovered from my
          <lb/>swoon to mourn that I lived, and to feel more than the bit­
          <lb/>terness of death. Sometimes I fancied that he clasped
          <lb/>my hand; but it was only the trickling of his blood through
          <lb/>my own. I imagined that he sighed; but it was the
          <lb/>breathing of the hollow wind through the reeds where his
          <lb/>head lay. I heard the horrible uproar of war in the neigh­
          <lb/>bouring redoubts, the roar of cannon, the clashing of
          <lb/>swords, and the cry of men. I knew that the enemy was
          <lb/>in the town, but I made no attempt to escape. Whither
          <lb/>should I have flown? Among my own people I was a
          <lb/>stranger, and were it possible that I should reach <placeName>England</placeName>,
          <lb/>who would succour me there? An hour passed in the
          <lb/>madness of grief, while I was clasping the lifeless form,
          <lb/>and supplicating to be made like unto it. A small party

          <lb/>passed, speaking with uncouth voices. I saw that they
          <lb/>were <name><rs type="properAdjective">American</rs> Indians</name>, and wished to escape. I forgot, in
          <lb/>my inconsistency, that I had a moment before exclaimed
          <lb/>with the prophet, who mourned his smitten gourd, <said>take
          <lb/>now away my life, I pray thee; it is better for me to
          <lb/>die, than to live.</said> My movements betrayed me, and they
          <lb/>took me prisoner. They were leaving the town, and I
          <lb/>expected to have been conveyed to the <rs type="properAdjective">American</rs> camp.
          <lb/>But they continued to journey throughout the night, and
          <lb/>from their conversation I learned that two redoubts had
          <lb/>been taken by the <name>Americans</name> and <name>French</name>, with desperate
          <lb/>valour. This was the daring action, in which <persName>La Fayette</persName>
          <lb/>led on the <name>Americans</name>, and <persName>De Viomenil</persName> the <name>French</name>, which
          <lb/>preceded but four days the surrender of <persName>Earl Cornwallis</persName>.
          <lb/>The party which had slain my husband, was the advance-
          <lb/>guard, under the command of <persName>Colonel Hamilton</persName>; and
          <lb/>those who had taken me captive, were a small number of
          <lb/>natives led by a <rs type="properAdjective">Delaware</rs> Chief. They were connected
          <lb/>with some embassy which had been sent, as far as I could
          <lb/>understand their broken explanations, to discover the state
          <lb/>of affairs at <placeName>Yorktown</placeName>; and being there at the time of this
          <lb/>encounter, had joined the <name>Americans</name>, partly as actors, and
          <lb/>partly as spies. Thus was I in the power of beings, whom
          <lb/>I had ever contemplated as the most savage of mankind.
          <lb/>I followed them, as we rove in a terrible dream unable
          <lb/>either to resist, or to awake. Stupified with grief, I was
          <lb/>for many days unequal to the sense of my misery. Yet the
          <lb/>captors, so far from testifying the cruelty I had anticipa­

          <pb n="268"/><milestone unit="sig" n="23(2)v"/>
          <mw type="pageNum">268</mw>

          <lb/>ted, were attentive to my wants. Of their food, which
          <lb/>was principally game shot as they travelled, and roasted
          <lb/>before fires kindled in the forest, they always presented
          <lb/>me an ample share, even when they were themselves but
          <lb/>scantily supplied. When I was weary, they would con­
          <lb/>struct a kind of litter, and carry me for a time upon their
          <lb/>shoulders. I exerted myself to endure hardship as cour­
          <lb/>ageously as possible, fearing they might suspect my dis­
          <lb/>guise; but they appeared to consider my effeminacy as
          <lb/>the result of that civilization which they constantly de­
          <lb/>cried. <said>A <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> soldier,</said> said they, <said>is never so good
          <lb/>on a march, as an <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> squaw.</said></p>

          <p rend="pre()">But as I began to arouse from the stupor, which the
          <lb/>overwhelming rapidity of my affections had occasioned,
          <lb/>a horrible idea took possession of my mind. I imagined
          <lb/>they were protecting my life with such care, in order to
          <lb/>sacrifice it in that savage manner, of which I had frequent­
          <lb/>ly heard descriptions. This terrour obtained predomi­
          <lb/>nance over grief. When I lay down to sleep in the forest,
          <lb/>wrapped closely in my blanket, and surrounded by the
          <lb/>dark-brow'd warriours, no slumber visited me; for before
          <lb/>my diseased imagination swam continually images of the
          <lb/>prisoner at the stake, the flame, the death-song, and all
          <lb/>the features of savage vengeance, and exultation. Plans
          <lb/>of escape occupied every night, and every day revealed
          <lb/>their impracticability. During this season of excitement,
          <lb/>I felt no fatigue. My strength was more than equal to
          <lb/>the labour imposed: so much is the mind capable of mod­

          <lb/>ifying its terrestrial companion. I hoped that, as our route
          <lb/>led through a more populous country, we should occasion­
          <lb/>ally lodge in towns; where I fancied greater facility of
          <lb/>escape might be offered. But they avoided suffering me
          <lb/>to pass through the more populous settlements, and uni­
          <lb/>formly preferred the shelter of forests, to the abodes of
          <lb/>white men, whom I found they still considered as intrud­
          <lb/>ers, and doubtful friends. On our arrival at a large town
          <lb/>in <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>, they made me, as usual, travel through
          <lb/>the outskirts with a guard of four men. Those, who en­
          <lb/>tered, perceived demonstrations of extravagant joy, and
          <lb/>were informed that the surrender of <persName>Cornwallis</persName> had taken
          <lb/>place on the <date when="1781-10-18">18th of <name>October</name></date>, and that peace was confi­
          <lb/>dently expected. They made no stay at this place, ex­
          <lb/>cept to purchase a large quantity of whiskey; and pres­
          <lb/>sing on with great rapidity, prepared to pass the night
          <lb/>within the borders of an extensive, and lofty forest.
          <lb/>Here they made a fire, and proceeded to strip the bark
          <lb/>from some young saplings. Their words were in their
          <lb/>own language, but their gestures were mysterious; and
          <lb/>their eyes were often directed towards me, with an expres­
          <lb/>sion of fierceness. The black shade of the forest, whose
          <lb/>top seemed to reach the skies, the glare of the wide, red
          <lb/>flame, falling upon the giant forms of those warriours,
          <lb/>with their uncouth habits, wild locks, and savage counten­
          <lb/>ances, formed a picture, which I cannot even now retrace
          <lb/>without shuddering. Loud words arose, as if a contest
          <lb/>was about to begin. The party contained a few <name>Mohe­

          <lb/>gans</name>; but the principal numbers were <name>Delawares</name>, or <name>Len­
          <lb/>ni-Lenape</name>, as they styled themselves. I believed that
          <lb/>my hour was come, and that the strife was between the
          <lb/>two nations, respecting different modes of torture. An
          <lb/>old warriour of the former tribe sat solitary, taking no
          <lb/>part in the conflict, but observing its progress with great
          <lb/>attention. He avoided the spirituous liquors, with which
          <lb/>all were becoming inflamed, and seemed to reserve <choice><sic>him­
          <lb/>felf</sic><corr>him­<lb/>self</corr></choice> for action in some important juncture. I thought
          <lb/>that I had previously seen him regarding me with the eyes of
          <lb/>pity, and said mentally, is it possible that Heaven will
          <lb/>raise up in my extremity, a friend in this aged man? I
          <lb/>remembered that he was called <persName>Arrowhamet</persName>, and was
          <lb/>treated with respect for his courage and wisdom. When
          <lb/>the strife grew violent, he arose, and approached the <rs type="properAdjective">Dela­
          <lb/>ware</rs> Chief. They conversed together, during which
          <lb/>both parties preserved silence. Then they parted, and
          <lb/>the <name>Lenni-Lenape</name> murmured aloud. Their Chief calmed
          <lb/>them, with the simple expressions, <said><persName>Arrowhamet</persName> is old.
          <lb/>He has fought bravely. His temples are white as the
          <lb/>snows of the <placeName>Allegheny</placeName>. Young men must submit to the
          <lb/>warriour, who wears the crown of time.</said> They then
          <lb/>commenced their war-dance, and in the violence of that
          <lb/>amusement, and the fumes of intoxication, merged their
          <lb/>anger <choice><sic>at</sic><corr>and</corr></choice> disappointment. It was long past midnight, ere
          <lb/>they all lay down to sleep. <persName>Arrowhamet</persName> approached me,
          <lb/>and throwing over me his blanket, said, <said>The night is
          <lb/>chill. All now will be quiet. Compose your mind, that

          <lb/>himself at some distance, between me, and the slumber­
          <lb/>ing group. It was impossible for me to find repose, and I
          <lb/>saw that my aged guardian also slept not. His eyes were
          <lb/>raised upward, as if he contemplated the Maker of that
          <lb/>majestic blue arch, where a few stars faintly twinkled. I
          <lb/>said silently, can it be that <emph>an <name>Indian</name></emph> thinks of God? Ah!
          <lb/>I knew not then, of what deep devotion their souls were
          <lb/>susceptible. Judge, into what fearful surprize I was start­
          <lb/>led from my reverie, when a low voice uttered, <said><persName>Oriana</persName>!
          <lb/>Is thy mind wakeful? Fear not to sleep. Thou art re­
          <lb/>deemed from torture. No flame shall touch you. Be­
          <lb/>lieve what the old warriour has spoken, and rest in
          <lb/>peace.</said></p>

          <p><said>Why do you call me <persName>Oriana</persName>?</said> I inquired, trembling
          <lb/>with astonishment.</p>

          <p><said>Didst thou then think the eye of <persName>Arrowhamet</persName> was
          <lb/>so dim that it could not read thy brow? that his heart
          <lb/>was so cold as to forget the hand that gave him bread?</said></p>

          <p><said>Am I known then to your comrades?</said> I asked.</p>

          <p><said>No thought but mine has comprehended thee. <persName>Arrow­
          <lb/>hamet</persName> shall be as the bars of the grave to thy secret.
          <lb/>To all but me, thou appearest as if thy disguise were
          <lb/>truth.</said></p>

          <p><said>How have you acquired knowledge, above all your
          <lb/>companions, and what have you spoken about my giving
          <lb/>you food?</said></p>

          <p><said>I knew that face,</said> he answered tenderly, <said xml:id="s010" next="#s011">when the
          <lb/>torches first glared upon it, and the cry of war was around.
          <lb/>It was deadly pale, but I knew it was the face of her who
          <lb/>had given me bread. Thou sayest, when have I fed
          <lb/>thee? So will the righteous ask at the last day. Thou
          <lb/>writest the traces of thy charity in the sand, but the fam­
          <lb/>ished prisoner graves them in the rock forever. I was
          <lb/>with the men of <persName>Colonel Buford</persName>, on the waters of the
          <lb/><placeName>Santee River</placeName>, where out of four hundred, only fifty-three
          <lb/>escaped the sword of <persName>Tarleton</persName>. I saw an hundred hands
          <lb/>of brave men raised to implore mercy. They were
          <lb/>stricken off by the sabres of the horsemen, who soon
          <lb/>trampled upon their bodies. But why tell I <emph>thee</emph> tales of
          <lb/>blood? whose heart is tender as that of an infant. I have
          <lb/>said that few were saved. With them I went into cap­
          <lb/>tivity. Some pined away, and died in their sorrows.
          <lb/>Seventeen moons have since beamed upon their graves.</said></p>

          <p><said xml:id="s011" prev="#s010">Remember thou an old <name>Indian</name>, who leaned against a

          <lb/>for food, yet thou gavest it to him. Thou rememberest
          <lb/>him not? Well! Thou wilt never forget the youth, who
          <lb/>was near, in the door of thy tent. His voice was like the

          <p><said>Was I then right in supposing myself destined to the

          <lb/>from among the captives, whom the fortune of war gives
          <lb/>into the hands of his nation. This is called the rite of
          <lb/>adoption. It has snatched the prisoner from the stake,
          <lb/>when the fire was scorching his vitals. Without the force
          <lb/>of this claim I could not have saved thee from the raging
          <lb/>passions of my countrymen; for the footstep of death
          <lb/>was nearer to thee than mine.</said> Pausing, he added, in a

          <lb/>tone of tenderness, <said>I had once a daughter. An
          <lb/>only one, as the apple of my eye. But she faded. She
          <lb/>went down to the grave, ere she blossomed in womanhood.</said></p>

          <p>There was silence; and afterwards I expressed with
          <lb/>warmth, my gratitude to my deliverer. The solemn hour
          <lb/>of midnight had long passed; yet the forest seemed to
          <lb/>assume a still darker hue, and the decaying fires, scarcely
          <lb/>cast a feeble ray upon the scattered forms of the slumber­
          <lb/>ing warriours.</p>

          <p><said>Daughter!</said> said the aged man, <said>rest in peace. I
          <lb/>watch over thee. I have prayed the Great Spirit that I
          <lb/>may lead thee in safety to my home, and put thy hand in­
          <lb/>to the hand of my wife. Knowest thou why she will love
          <lb/>thee? Why the tears will cover her face, when she look­
          <lb/>eth upon thine? Because thou wilt remind her heart of the
          <lb/>blossom whose growth she nursed, whose blasting she be­
          <lb/>moaned. Be not angry at what I say. She had a dark
          <lb/>brow, and her garb was like the children of red men.
          <lb/>Yet, as she went down into the dust, there was upon her
          <lb/>lips a smile, and in her eye a tender melancholy, like
          <lb/>thine.</said> He ceased, oppressed with emotion. Pressing
          <lb/>his hands upon his forehead, he laid it on the earth. Pres­
          <lb/>ently raising his head, I saw that his eyes was dazzling,
          <lb/>but tearless.</p>

          <p><said>Wilt thou accept my adoption?</said> he inquired. <said>Wilt
          <lb/>thou bow thyself, for a time, to be called the daughter of
          <lb/>old <persName>Arrowhamet</persName>? I have said that it need be but for a
          <lb/>time. My home is near the shores of the great waters.

          <lb/>acceptance, in such terms as an outcast ought to address
          <lb/>to his sole earthly benefactor. Apparently gratified, he
          <lb/>raised his lofty form erect, and laying one hand upon my
          <lb/>head, while he lifted the other towards heaven, ratified
          <lb/>with great solemnity his rite of adoption.</p>

          <p>He added a few words in his native language, and

          <lb/>art convinced that our God is the same.</said></p>

          <p>Lost in wonder, in gratitude, in praise, to the Al­
          <lb/>mighty Preserver, I made my own orison with many tears, and
          <lb/>sank into such a refreshing sleep, as had not visited me
          <lb/>since my captivity. I awoke not, till the Sun, like a
          <lb/>globe of gold, was burnishing the crowns of the kings of
          <lb/>the forest.</p>

          <p>Nothing worthy of narration occurred, on the remain­
          <lb/>der of our journey. The supernatural strength, which
          <lb/>had hitherto sustained me, gradually vanished; and du­

          <lb/>ring a great part of the distance, I was borne on the shoul­
          <lb/>ders of the natives. In a short time, the <name>Mohegans</name>
          <lb/>separated from the <name>Lenni-Lenape</name>, to return to their hab­
          <lb/>itations, having completed the period of their engage­
          <lb/>ment. In passing through a considerable town, I sold a
          <lb/>valuable watch and necklace, gifts of my <persName>Edward</persName> in his
          <lb/>happiest days. The sum which they produced, is not
          <lb/>yet expended. It will probably suffice for the purposes
          <lb/>of my interment.</p>

          <p>My reception from old <persName>Martha</persName> was soothing to my
          <lb/>weary heart. From that moment to this, her maternal
          <lb/>kindness has never slumbered. With the most watchful
          <lb/>care, she has suited my aliment to my situation; and by
          <lb/>her knowledge of the virtues of plants, has mitigated my
          <lb/>pain. Kindness, from whatever hand, is dear to the iso­
          <lb/>lated and suffering heart. At my first admission into
          <lb/>this humble abode, I cherished a hope of returning to
          <lb/><placeName>England</placeName>. Yet to what should I have returned? Only to
          <lb/>the graves of my parents. With the disconsolate and elo­
          <lb/>quent <persName>Logan</persName>, I might say, <said>there runs not a drop of my
          <lb/>blood in the veins of any living creature. Who is there
          <lb/>to mourn for me? Not one.</said></p>

          <p>Throughout the whole range of my native country, was
          <lb/>there a cottage to afford me shelter, or friends to minis­
          <lb/>ter to me, day and night, like these aged beings? But
          <lb/>with whatever attractions the land, where I first drew
          <lb/>breath, would sometimes gleam upon my exiled eye, all
          <lb/>hope of again sharing them has been long since extinguish­

          <lb/>ed. The disease, to which my early youth evinced a
          <lb/>predisposition, and which I probably inherit from both
          <lb/>parents, soon revealed itself. Its progress was at first
          <lb/>slow; but every month, I became conscious of its latent
          <lb/>ravages. My retreat, which to most beholders would
          <lb/>have seemed as comfortless as it is obscure, so accorded
          <lb/>with my subdued feelings, that, like the disciple who de­
          <lb/>sired a tabernacle upon the mountain of mystery, I have
          <lb/>often exclaimed, <said>Master! it is good to be here.</said> Here,
          <lb/>I have learned to estimate a race, to which I had ever
          <lb/>done injustice. Those, whom I had previously stigma­
          <lb/>tized as the slaves of barbarity, ignorance, and obduracy,
          <lb/>were appointed to exhibit to my view continually traces
          <lb/>of philanthropy, intellect, and devotion, inviolable attach­
          <lb/>ment, and deathless gratitude for trivial kindness; which,
          <lb/>however the civilized world may affect to scorn in the
          <lb/>cabin of the red man, she does not often find in the pala­
          <lb/>ces of kings. Here I have felt, how vain is that impor­
          <lb/>tance which we attach to shades of complexion, and
          <lb/>gradations of rank; how less than nothing the pageantry
          <lb/>of pomp, and the tinsel of wealth appear, when <quote>God
          <lb/>taketh away the soul.</quote> The Almighty has here appoint­
          <lb/>ed me to realize the nature of those phantoms which had
          <lb/>often held me in bondage, that renouncing all other domin­
          <lb/>ion, my affections might own supreme allegiance to him.
          <lb/>It was necessary that the pride of my heart should be
          <lb/>subdued by affliction: and affliction having had per­
          <lb/>fect work, has terminated in peace. Yet I quit not this

          <lb/>existence, like the ascetic for whom it has no allurements.
          <lb/>Its opening was gilded by what the world calls happiness,
          <lb/>and its close with a joy to which that world is a stranger.
          <lb/>For your instructions, your prayers, my Father, receive
          <lb/>the blessings of one who will soon have neither name, nor
          <lb/>memorial among men. Your last benevolent office, will
          <lb/>be to lay her wasted frame where saints slumber. May
          <lb/>she meet you at their resurrection in light. Her last re­
          <lb/>quest is that you would sometimes grant a visit, and a
          <lb/>prayer to those, who were parents to her without the bonds
          <lb/>of affinity; philanthropists, without hope of the world's
          <lb/>applause; <name>Christians</name>, though proscribed as the heritors of
          <lb/>a savage nature; and who will also, she trusts, be heirs
          <lb/>of heaven, through faith in Him who hath promised that
          <lb/>the merciful shall obtain mercy.</p></quote>
