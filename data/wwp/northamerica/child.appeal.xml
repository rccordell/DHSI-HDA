	  <lb/>prejudices will allow, for the very truth's sake:—If I have
	  <lb/>the most trifling claims upon your good will, for an hour's
	  <lb/>amusement to yourself, or benefit to your children, read
	  <lb/>it for <emph>my</emph> sake:—Read it, if it be merely to find fresh oc­

	  <lb/>attend to her household concerns) will say upon such a sub­
	  <lb/>ject:—Read it, on <emph>any</emph> terms, and my purpose will be gained.</p>
        <p>The subject I have chosen admits of no encomiums on my
	  <lb/>country; but as I generally make it an object to supply what
	  <lb/>is most needed, this circum<unclear>s</unclear>tance is unimportant; the market
	  <lb/>is so glutted with flattery, that a little truth may be acceptable,
	  <lb/>were it only for its rarity.</p>
        <p>I am fully aware of the unpopularity of the task I have
	  <lb/>undertaken; but though I <emph>expect</emph> ridicule and censure, I
	  <lb/>cannot <emph>fear</emph> them.</p>
        <p>A few years hence, the opinion of the world will be a
	  <lb/>matter in which I have not even the most transient interest;

        <p>Should it be the means of a<supplied reason="flawed-reproduction">d</supplied>vancing, even one single hour,

	  <lb/>early as <date when="1503">1503</date>. Those who bought and those who sold
	  <lb/>were alike prepared to trample on the rights of their
	  <lb/>fellow beings, by that most demoralizing of all influences,
	  <lb/>the accursed love of gold.</p>
        <p><persName>Cardinal Ximenes</persName>, while he administered the govern­
	  <lb/>ment, before the accession of <persName>Charles the Fifth</persName>, was peti­
	  <lb/>tioned to allow a regular commerce in African negroes.
	  <lb/>But he rejected the proposal with promptitude and firmness,
	  <lb/>alike honorable to his head and heart. This earliest friend
	  <lb/>of the <name>Africans</name>, living in a comparatively unenlightened
	  <lb/>age, has peculiar claims upon our gratitude and reverence.
	  <lb/>In <date when="1517">1517</date>, <persName>Charles the Fifth</persName> granted a patent for an annual
	  <lb/>supply of four thousand negroes to the <placeName>Spanish islands</placeName>.
	  <lb/>He probably soon became aware of the horrible, and ever-
	  <lb/>increasing evils, attendant upon this traffic; for twenty­
	  <lb/>five years after he emancipated every negro in his domin­
	  <lb/>ions. But when he resigned his crown and retired to
	  <lb/>a monastery, the colonists resumed their shameless
	  <lb/>tyranny.</p>
        <p><persName>Captain Hawkins</persName>, afterward <persName>Sir John Hawkins</persName>, was
	  <lb/>the first <name>Englishman</name>, who disgraced himself and his 
	  <lb/>country by this abominable trade. Assisted by some rich
	  <lb/>people in <placeName>London</placeName>, he fitted out three ships, and sailed to
	  <lb/>the <placeName>African coast</placeName>, where he burned and plundered the
	  <lb/>towns, and carried off three hundred of the defenceless
	  <lb/>inhabitants to <placeName>Hispaniola</placeName>.</p>
        <p><persName>Elizabeth</persName> afterwards authorized a similar adventure
	  <lb/>with one of her own vessels. <quote>She expressed her concern
	    <lb/>lest any of the <name>Africans</name> should be carried off without
	    <lb/>their free consent; declaring that such a thing would be
	    <lb/>detestable, and call down the vengeance of Heaven
	    <lb/>upon the undertakers.</quote> For this reason, it has been
	  <lb/>supposed that the Queen was deceived — that she imag­
	  <lb/>ined the negroes were transported to the <placeName>Spanish colonies</placeName>
	  <lb/>as voluntary laborers. But history gives us slight rea­
	  <lb/>sons to judge <persName>Elizabeth</persName> so favorably. It was her system
	  <lb/>always to preserve an <soCalled rend="slant(italic)">appearance</soCalled> of justice and virtue.
	  <lb/>She was a shrewd, far-sighted politician; and had in
	  <lb/>perfection the clear head and cold heart calculated to
	  <lb/>form that character. Whatever she might believe of the
	  <lb/>trade at its beginning, she was too deeply read in human

	  <lb/>nature, not to foresee the inevitable consequence of
	  <lb/>placing power in the hands of avarice.</p>
        <p>A Roman priest persuaded <persName>Louis the Thirteenth</persName> to
	  <lb/>sanction slavery for the sake of converting the negroes to
	  <lb/><name>Christianity</name>; and thus this bloody iniquity, disguised
	  <lb/>with gown, hood, and rosary, entered the fair dominions
	  <lb/>of <placeName>France</placeName>. To be violently wrested from his home, and
	  <lb/>condemnded to toil without hope, by <name>Chistians</name>, to whom
	  <lb/>he had done no wrong, was, methinks, a very odd
	  <lb/>beginning to the poor negro's course of religious in­
	  <lb/>struction!</p>
        <p>When this evil had once begun, it, of course, gathered
	  <lb/>strength rapidly; for all the bad passions of human na­
	  <lb/>ture were eagerly enlisted in its cause. The <name>British</name>
	  <lb/>formed settlements in <placeName>North America</placeName>, and in the <placeName>West
	  <lb/>Indies</placeName>; and these were stocked with slaves. From <date when="1680">1680</date>
	  <lb/>to <date when="1786">1786</date> <emph>two million, one hundred and thirty thousand</emph>
	  <lb/>negroes were imported into the <placeName>British colonies</placeName>!</p>
        <p>In almost all great evils there is some redeeming fea­
	  <lb/>ture — <emph>some</emph> good results, even where it is not intend­
	  <lb/>ed: pride and vanity, utterly selfish and wrong in them­
	  <lb/>selves, often throw money into the hands of the poor, and
	  <lb/>thus tend to excite industry and ingenutity, while they
	  <lb/>produce comfort. But slavery is <emph>all</emph> evil — within and
	  <lb/>without — root and branch, — bud, blossom and fruit!</p>
        <p>In order to show how dark it is in every aspe<supplied reason="flawed-reproduction">ct</supplied> — how
	  <lb/>invariably injurious both to nations and individuals, —I
	  <lb/>will select a few facts from the mass of evidence now
	  <lb/>before me.</p>
        <p>In the first place, its effects upon <placeName rend="slant(italic)">Africa</placeName> have been
	  <lb/>most disastrous. All along the coast, intercourse with
	  <lb/><name>Europeans</name> has deprived the inhabitants of their primitive
	  <lb/>simplicity, without substituting in its place the order,
	  <lb/>refinement, and correctness of principle, attend<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">a</unclear>nt upon
	  <lb/>true civilization. The soil of <placeName>Africa</placeName> is rich in native
	  <lb/>productions, and honorable commerce might have been
	  <lb/>a blessing to her, to <placeName>Europe</placeName>, and to <placeName>America</placeName>; but instead
	  <lb/>of that, a trade has been substituted, which o<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">pera</unclear>tes like
	  <lb/>a withering curse, upon all concerned in it.</p>
        <p>There are green and sheltered valleys in <placeName>Africa</placeName>,—
	  <lb/>broad and beautiful rivers, — and vegetation in its love­

	  <lb/>liest and most magnificent forms. — But no comfortable
	  <lb/>houses, no thriving farms, no cultivated gardens; — for
	  <lb/>it is not safe to possess permanent property, where each
	  <lb/>little state is surrounded by warlike neighbors, continu­
	  <lb/>ally sending out their armed bands in search of slaves.
	  <lb/>The white man offers his most tempting articles of mer­
	  <lb/>chandize to the negro, as a price for the flesh and blood
	  <lb/>of his enemy; and if we, with all our boasted knowledge
	  <lb/>and religion, are seduced by money to do such grievous
	  <lb/>wrong to those who have never offended us, what can
	  <lb/>we expect of men just emerging from the limited wants
	  <lb/>of savage life, too uncivilized to have formed any habits
	  <lb/>of steady industry, yet earnestly coveting the productions
	  <lb/>they know not how to earn? The inevitable consequence
	  <lb/>is, that war is made throughout that unhappy continent,
	  <lb/>not only upon the slightest pretences, but often without
	  <lb/>any pretext at all. Villages are set on fire, and those
	  <lb/>who fly from the flames rush upon the spears of the enemy.
	  <lb/>Private kidnapping is likewise carried on to a great ex­
	  <lb/>tent; for he who can catch a neighbor's child is sure to
	  <lb/>find a ready purchaser; and it sometimes happens that
	  <lb/>the captor and his living merchandize are both seized by
	  <lb/>the white slave-trader. Houses are broken open in the 
	  <lb/>night, and defenceless women and children carried away
	  <lb/>into captivity. If boys, in the unsuspecting innocence of
	  <lb/>youth, come near the white man's ships, to sell vegeta­
	  <lb/>bles or fruit, they are ruthlessly seized and carried to
	  <lb/>slavery in a distant land. Even the laws are perverted
	  <lb/>to this shameful purpose. If a chief wants European
	  <lb/>commodities, he accuses a parent of witchcraft; the vic­
	  <lb/>tim is tried by the ordeal of poisoned water;<anchor xml:id="a01" corresp="#n01" rend="pre(*)"/> and if he
	  <lb/>sicken at the draught, the king claims a right to punish
	  <lb/>him by selling his whole family. In African legislation,
	  <lb/>almost all crimes are punished with slavery; and, thanks
	  <lb/>to the white man's rapacity, there is always a very pow­
	  <lb/>erful motive for finding the culprit guilty. He must be
	  <lb/>a very good king indeed, that judges his subjects impar­
	  <lb/>tially, when he is sure of making money by doing other­
	  <lb/>wise!</p>

        <p>The king of <placeName>Dahomy</placeName>, and other despotic princes, do
	  <lb/>not scruple to seize their own people and sell them, with­
	  <lb/>out provocation, whenever they happen to want anything,
	  <lb/>which slave-ships can furnish. If a chief has conscience
	  <lb/>enough to object to such proceedings, he is excited by
	  <lb/>presents of gun-powder and brandy. One of these men,
	  <lb/>who could not resist the persuasions of the slave traders
	  <lb/>while he was intoxicated, was conscience-stricken when
	  <lb/>he recovered his senses, and bitterly reproached his
	  <lb/><soCalled rend="slant(italic)"><name>Christian</name></soCalled> seducers. One negro king, debarred by his
	  <lb/>religion from the use of spiritous liquors, and therefore
	  <lb/>less dangerously tempted than others, abolished the slave
	  <lb/>trade throughout his dominions, and exerted himself to
	  <lb/>encourage honest industry; but his people must have
	  <lb/>been as sheep among wolves.</p>
        <p>Relentless bigotry brings its aid to darken the horrors
	  <lb/>of the scene. The <name>Mohammedans</name> deem it right to subject
	  <lb/>the heathen tribes to perpetual bondage. The <name>Moors</name>
	  <lb/>and <name>Arabs</name> think <name>Alla</name> and the Prophet have given them
	  <lb/>an undisputed right to the poor <name>Caffre</name>, his wife, his
	  <lb/>children, and his goods. But mark how the slave-trade
	  <lb/>deepens even the fearful gloom of bigotry! The <name>Mo­
	  <lb/>hammedans</name> are by no means zealous to enlighten their
	  <lb/>Pagan neighbors — they do not wish them to come to
	  <lb/>a knowledge of what they consider the true religion —
	  <lb/>lest they should forfeit the only ground, on which they
	  <lb/>can even pretend to the right of driving them by thou­
	  <lb/>sands to the markets of <placeName>Kano</placeName> and <placeName>Tripoli</placeName>.</p>
        <p>This is precisely like our own conduct. We say the
	  <lb/>negroes are so ignorant that they must be slaves; and we
	  <lb/>insist upon keeping them ignorant, lest we spoil them for
	  <lb/>slaves. The same spirit that dictates this logic to the
	  <lb/><name>Arab</name>, teaches it to the <name>European</name> and the <name>American</name>: —
	  <lb/>Call it what you please — it is certainly neither of heaven
	  <lb/>nor of earth.</p>
        <p>When the slave ships are lying on the coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName>,
	  <lb/>canoes well armed are sent into the inland country, and
	  <lb/>after a few weeks they return with hundreds of negroes,
	  <lb/>tied fast with ropes. Sometimes the white men lurk
	  <lb/>among the bushes, and seize the wretched beings who
	  <lb/>incautiously venture from their homes; sometimes they

	  <lb/>paint their skins as black as their hearts, and by this de­
	  <lb/>ception suddenly surprise the unsuspecting natives; at
	  <lb/>other times the victims are decoyed on board the vessel,
	  <lb/>under some kind pretence or other, and then lashed to
	  <lb/>the mast, or chained in the hold. Is it not very natural
	  <lb/>for the <name>Africans</name> to say <quote>devilish white</quote>?</p>
        <p>All along the shores of this devoted country, terror and
	  <lb/>distrust prevail. The natives never venture out without
	  <lb/>arms, when a vessel is in sight, and skulk through their
	  <lb/>own fields, as if watched by a panther. All their worst
	  <lb/>passions are called into full exercise, and all their kind­
	  <lb/>lier feelings smothered. Treachery, fraud and violence
	  <lb/>desolate the country, rend asunder the dearest relations,
	  <lb/>and pollute the very fountains of justice. The history
	  <lb/>of the negro, whether national or domestic, is written
	  <lb/>in blood. Had half the skill and strength employed in
	  <lb/>the slave-trade been engaged in honorable commerce,
	  <lb/>the native princes would long ago have directed their
	  <lb/>energies toward clearing the country, destroying wild
	  <lb/>beasts, and introducing the arts and refinements of civil­
	  <lb/>lized life. Under such influences, <placeName>Africa</placeName> might become
	  <lb/>an earthly paradise; — the white man's avarice has made
	  <lb/>it a den of wolves.</p>
        <p>Having thus glanced at the miserable effects of this
	  <lb/>system on the condition of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, we will now follow the
	  <lb/>poor <emph>slave</emph> through his wretched wanderings, in order to
	  <lb/>give some idea of his physical suffering, his mental, and
	  <lb/>moral degradation.</p>
        <p>Husbands are torn from their wives, children from
	  <lb/>their parents, while the air is filled with the shrieks and
	  <lb/>lamentations of the bereaved. Sometimes they are
	  <lb/>brought from a remote country; obliged to wander over
	  <lb/>mountains and through deserts; chained together in
	  <lb/>herds; driven by the whip; scorched by a tropical
	  <lb/>sun; compelled to carry heavy bales of merchandize;
	  <lb/>suffering with hunger and thirst; worn down with
	  <lb/>fatigue; and often leaving their bones to whiten in the
	  <lb/>desert. A large troop of slaves, taken by the Sultan of
	  <lb/><placeName>Fozzan</placeName>, died in the desert for want of food. In some
	  <lb/>places, travellers meet with fifty or sixty skeletons in a
	  <lb/>day, of which the largest proportion were no doubt slaves,

	  <lb/>on their way to European markets. Sometimes the poor
	  <lb/>creatures refuse to go a step further, and even the lacer­
	  <lb/>ating whip cannot goad them on; in such cases, they
	  <lb/>become the prey of wild beasts, more merciful than
	  <lb/>white men.</p>
        <p>Those who arrive at the sea-coast, are in a state of
	  <lb/>desperation and despair. Their purchasers are so well
	  <lb/>aware of this, and so fearful of the consequences, that
	  <lb/>they set sail in the night, lest the negroes should know
	  <lb/>when they depart from their native shores.</p>
        <p>And here the scene becomes almost too harrowing to
	  <lb/>dwell upon. But we must not allow our nerves to be
	  <lb/>more tender than our consciences. The poor wretches
	  <lb/>are stowed by hundreds, like bales of goods, between the
	  <lb/>low decks, where filth and putrid air produce disease,
	  <lb/>madness, and suicide. Unless they die in <emph>great</emph> num­
	  <lb/>bers, the slave captain does not even concern himself
	  <lb/>enough to fret; his live stock cost nothing, and he is
	  <lb/>sure of such a high price for what remains at the end of
	  <lb/>the voyage, that he can afford to lose a good many.</p>
        <p>The following account is given by <persName>Dr Walsh</persName>, who ac­
	  <lb/>companied <persName>Viscount <placeName>Strangford</placeName></persName>, as chaplain, on his
	  <lb/>embassy to <placeName>Brazil</placeName>. The vessel in which he sailed chased
	  <lb/>a slave ship; for to the honor of <placeName>England</placeName> be it said, she
	  <lb/>has asked and obtained permission from other govern­
	  <lb/>ments to treat as pirates such of their subjects as are
	  <lb/>discovered carrying on this guilty trade north of the
	  <lb/>equator. <persName>Doctor Walsh</persName> was an eye witness of the scene
	  <lb/>he describes; and the evidence given, at various times,
	  <lb/>before the <placeName>British House of Commons</placeName>, proves that the
	  <lb/>frightful picture is by no means exaggerated.</p>

	    <lb/>mometer, expo<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">s</unclear>ed to the open sky, was standing, in the
	    <lb/>shade on our deck, at eightynine degrees.</p>
          <p>The space between decks was divided into two com­
	    <lb/>partments, three feet three inches high. Two hundred and
	    <lb/>twentysix women and girls were thrust into one space two
	    <lb/>hundred and eightyeight feet square; and three hundred
	    <lb/>and thirtysix men and boys were crammed into another
	    <lb/>space eight hundred feet square; giving the whole an av­
	    <lb/>erage of twentythree inches; and to each of the women not
	    <lb/>more than thirteen inches; though several of them were
	    <lb/>in a state of health, which peculiarly demanded pity.—
	    <lb/>As they were shipped on account of different individuals,
	    <lb/>they were branded like sheep, with the owner's marks of
	    <lb/>different forms; which, as the mate informed me with
	    <lb/>perfect indifference, had been burnt in with red-hot iron.
	    <lb/>Over the hatch-way stood a ferocious looking fellow, the
	    <lb/>slave-driver of the ship, with a scourge of many-twisted
	    <lb/>thongs in his hand; whenever he heard the slightest
	    <lb/>noise from below, he shook it over them, and seemed
	    <lb/>eager to exercise it.</p>
          <p>As soon as the poor creatures saw us looking down at
	    <lb/>them, their melancholy visages brightened up. They
	    <lb/>perceived something of sympathy and kindness in our
	    <lb/>looks, to which they had not been accustomed; and
	    <lb/>feeling instinctively that we were friends, they immedi­
	    <lb/>ately began to shout and clap their hands. The women
	    <lb/>were particularly excited. They all held up their arms,
	    <lb/>and when we bent down and shook hands with them,
	    <lb/>they could not contain their delight; they endeavored to
	    <lb/>scramble upon their knees, stretching up to kiss our
	    <lb/>hands, and we understood they knew we had come to
	    <lb/>liberate them. Some, however, hung down their heads
	    <lb/>in apparently hopeless dejection; some were greatly 
	    <lb/>emaciated; and some, particularly children, seemed
	    <lb/>dying. The heat of these horrid places was so great,
	    <lb/>and the odor so offensive, that it was quite impossible to
	    <lb/>enter them, even had there been room.</p>
          <p rend="pre()">The officers insisted that the poor, suffering creatures
	    <lb/>should be admitted on deck to get air and water. This 
	    <lb/>was opposed by the mate of the slaver, who (from a feeling

	    <lb/>dered. The officers, however, persisted, and the poor
	    <lb/>beings were all turned out together. It is impossible to
	    <lb/>conceive the effect of this eruption — five hundred and
	    <lb/>seventeen fellow-creatures, of all ages and sexes, some chil­
	    <lb/>dren, some adults, some old men and women, all entirely
	    <lb/>destitute of clothing, scrambling out together to taste the
	    <lb/>luxury of a little fresh air and water. They came swarm­
	    <lb/>ing up, like bees from a hive, till the whole deck was
	    <lb/>crowded to suffocation from stom to stern; so that it was
	    <lb/>impossible to imagine where they could all have come
	    <lb/>from, or how they could have been stowed away. On
	    <lb/>looking into the places where they had been cra<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">mm</unclear>ed,
	    <lb/>there were found some children next the sides of the
	    <lb/>ship, in the places most remote from light and air<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">,</unclear> they
	    <lb/>were lying nearly in a torpid state, after the rest had 
	    <lb/>turned out. The little creatures seemed indifferent as to
	    <lb/>life or death; and when they were carried on deck,
	    <lb/>many of them could not stand. After enjoying for a
	    <lb/>short time the unusual luxury of air, some water was
	    <lb/>brought; it was then that the extent of their sufferings
	    <lb/>was exposed in a fearful manner. They all rushed like
	    <lb/>maniacs towards it. No entreaties, or threats, or blows,
	    <lb/>could restrain them; they shrieked, and struggled, and
	    <lb/>fought with one another, for a drop of this precious <unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">liq</unclear>uid,
	    <lb/>as if they grew rabid at the sight of it. There is nothing
	    <lb/>from which slaves in the mid-passage suffer so much as
	    <lb/>want of water. It is sometimes usual to take out casks
	    <lb/>filled with sea-water as ballast, and when the slaves are
	    <lb/>received on board, to start the casks, and re-fill them  with
	    <lb/>fresh. On one occasion, a ship from <placeName>Bahia</placeName> neglected to
	    <lb/>change the contents of their casks, and on the mid-pas­
	    <lb/>sage found, to their horror, that they were filled with
	    <lb/>nothing but salt water. All the slaves on board perished!
	    <lb/>We could judge of the extent of their sufferings from the
	    <lb/>afflicting sight we now saw. When the poor creatures
	    <lb/>were ordered down again, several of them came, and
	    <lb/>pressed their heads against our knees, with looks of the
	    <lb/>greatest anguish, with the prospect of returning to the
	    <lb/>horrid place of suffering below.</p>

        <p>Arrived at the place of destination, the condition of

        <p>From the moment the slave is kidnapped, to the last
	  <lb/>hour he draws his miserable breath, the white man's
	  <lb/>influence directly cherishes ignorance, fraud, treachery,
	  <lb/>theft, licentiousness, revenge, hatred and murder. It
	  <lb/>cannot be denied that human nature thus operated upon,
	  <lb/><emph>must</emph> necessarily yield, more or less, to  all these evils. —
	  <lb/>And thus do we dare to treat beings, who, like ourselves,
	  <lb/>are heirs of immmortality!</p>
        <p>And now let us briefly inquire into the influence of
	  <lb/>slavery on the <emph>white man's</emph> character; for in this evil
	  <lb/>there is a mighty re-action. <quote>Such is this constitution of
	    <lb/>things, that we cannot inflict an inquiry without suffering
	    <lb/>from it ourselves: he, who blesses another, benefits him­
	    <lb/>self; but he, who sins against his fellow creature, does
	    <lb/>his own soul a grievous wrong.</quote> The effect produced
	  <lb/>upon <emph>slave captains</emph> is absolutely frightful. Those who
	  <lb/>wish to realize it in all its awful extent, may find abun­
	  <lb/>dant information in <persName>Clarkson's</persName> <title>History of Slavery</title>: the
	  <lb/>authenticity of the facts there given cannot be doubted;
	  <lb/>for setting aside the perfect honesty of <persName>Clarkson's</persName> char­
	  <lb/>acter, these facts were principly accepted as evidence
	  <lb/>before the <orgName>British Parliament</orgName>, where there was a very
	  <lb/>strong party of slave owners desirous to prove them false.</p>
        <p>Indeed when we reflect upon the subject, it cannot
	  <lb/>excite surprise that slave-captains become as hard<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction"> </unclear>hearted
	  <lb/>and fierce as tigers. The very first step in their business
	  <lb/>is a deliberate invasion of the rights of others; its pur­
	  <lb/>suit combines every form of violence, bloodshed, tyranny
	  <lb/>and anguish; they are accustomed to consider their vic­
	  <lb/>tims as cattle, or blocks of wood;<anchor xml:id="a03" corresp="#n03" rend="pre(*)"/> and they are invested
	  <lb/>with perfectly despotic powers.</p>
        <p>There is a great waste of life among white seamen

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">12</mw>
	  <lb/>punishment they receive, and diseases originating in the
	  <lb/>unwholesome atmosphere on board. <persName>Clarkson</persName>, after a
	  <lb/>long and patient investigation, came to the conclusion
	  <lb/>that two slave voyages to <placeName>Africa</placeName>, would destroy more
	  <lb/>seamen than eightythree to <placeName>Newfoundland</placeName>; and there is
	  <lb/>this difference to be observed, that the loss in one trade 
	  <lb/>is generally occasioned by weather or accident, in the 
	  <lb/>other by cruelty or disease. The instances are exceed­
	  <lb/>ingly numerous of sailors on board slave-ships, that have
	  <lb/>died under the lash or in consequence of it. Some of
	  <lb/>the particulars are so painful that it has made me sicken
	  <lb/>to read them; and I therefore forbear to repeat them.
	  <lb/>Of the <name>Alexander's</name> crew, in <date when="1785">1785</date>, no less than eleven
	  <lb/>deserted at <placeName>Bonny</placeName>, on the <placeName>African coast</placeName>, because life had
	  <lb/>become insupportable. They chose all that could be en­
	  <lb/>dured from a most inhospitable climate, and the violence
	  <lb/>of the natives, rather than remain in their own ship.
	  <lb/>Nine others died on the voyage, and the rest were ex­
	  <lb/>ceedingly abused. This state of things was so universal
	  <lb/>that seamen were notoriously averse to enter the hateful
	  <lb/>business. In order to obtain them it became necessary 
	  <lb/>to resort to force or deception. (Behold how many
	  <lb/>branches there are to the tree of crime!) Decoyed to
	  <lb/>houses where night after night was spent in dancing,
	  <lb/>rioting and drunkenness, the thoughtless fellows gave
	  <lb/>themselves up to the merriment of the scene, and in a
	  <lb/>moment of intoxication the fatal bargain was sealed.
	  <lb/>Encouraged to spend more than they owned, a jail or the
	  <lb/>slave-ship became the only alternatives. The superiority
	  <lb/>of wages was likewise a strong inducement; but this
	  <lb/>was a cheat. The wages of the sailors were half paid 
	  <lb/>in the currency of the country where the vessel carried
	  <lb/>her slaves; and thus they were actually lower than in
	  <lb/>other trades, while they were nominally higher.</p>
        <p>In such an employment the morals of the seamen of
	  <lb/>course became corrupt, like their masters; and every
	  <lb/>species of fraud was thought allowable to deceive the
	  <lb/>ignorant <name>Africans</name>, by means of false weights, false mea­
	  <lb/>sures, adulterated commodities, and the like.</p>
        <p>Of the cruelties on board slave-ships, I will mention

          <quote xml:id="a04" rend="post(”*)" corresp="#n04">A child on board a slave-ship, of about ten months
	    <lb/>old, took sulk and would not eat; the captain flogged it
	    <lb/>with a cat-o'-nine-tails; swearing that he would make it
	    <lb/>eat, or kill it. From this, and other ill-treatment, the
	    <lb/>limbs swelled. He then ordered some water to be made
	    <lb/>hot to abate the swelling. But even his tender mercies
	    <lb/>were cruel. The cook, on putting his hand into the 
	    <lb/>water, said it was too hot. Upon this the captain swore
	    <lb/>at him, and ordered the feet to be put in. This was
	    <lb/>done. The nails and skin came off. Oiled cloths were
	    <lb/>then put around them. The child was at length tied to 
	    <lb/>a heavy log. Two or three days afterwards, the captain
	    <lb/>caught it up again, and repeated that he would make it
	    <lb/>eat, or kill it. He immediately flogged it again, and in 
	    <lb/>a quarter of an hour it died. And after the babe was
	    <lb/>dead, whom should the barbarian select to throw it over­
	    <lb/>board, but the wretched mother! In vain she tried to
	    <lb/>avoid the office. He beat her, till he made her take up

        <p>Some people speculate in what are called refuse slaves;
	  <lb/>i. e. the poor diseased ones. Many of them die in the
	  <lb/>piazzas of the autioneers; and sometimes, in the
	  <lb/>agonies of death, they are sold as low as a dollar.</p>
        <p>Even this is better than to be unprotected on the wide
	  <lb/>ocean in the power of such wild beasts as I have de­
	  <lb/>scribed. It may seem incredible to some that human
	  <lb/>nature is capable of so much depravity. But the con­
	  <lb/>fessions of pirates show how habitual scenes of blood
	  <lb/>and violence harden the heart of man; and history
	  <lb/>abundantly proves that despotic power produces a
	  <lb/>fearful species of moral insanity. The wanton cru­

	  <lb/>officers of the <orgName rend="slant(upright)">Inquisition</orgName>, seem like the frantic acts of
	  <lb/>madmen.</p>
        <p>The public has, however, a sense of justice, which
	  <lb/>can never be entirely perverted. Since the time when
	  <lb/><persName>Clarkson</persName>, <persName>Wilberforce</persName> and <persName>Fox</persName> made the horros of the
	  <lb/>slave trade understood, the slave captain, or slave jockey
	  <lb/>is spontaneously and almost universally regarded with
	  <lb/>dislike and horror. Even in the slave-holding States it is
	  <lb/>deemed disreputable to associate with a professed slave-
	  <lb/>trader, though few perhaps would think it any harm to
	  <lb/>bargain with him. This public feeling makes itself felt
	  <lb/>so strongly, that men engaged in what is called the
	  <lb/>African traffic, kept it a secret, if they could, even be­
	  <lb/>fore the laws made it hazardous.</p>
        <p>No man of the least principle could for a moment
	  <lb/>think of engaging in such enterprises; and if he have
	  <lb/>any feeling, it is soon destroyed by familiarity with
	  <lb/>scenes of guilt and anguish. The result is, that the
	  <lb/>slave-trade is a monopoly in the hands of the very
	  <lb/>wicked; and this is one reason why it has always been
	  <lb/>profitable.</p>
        <p>Yet even the slave <emph>trade</emph> has had its champions — of

	  <lb/>Politicians have boldly said that it was a profitable branch
	  <lb/>of commerce, and ought not to be discontinued on ac­
	  <lb/>count of the idle dreams of benevolent enthusiasts. They
	  <lb/>have argued before the <orgName>House of Commons</orgName>, that others
	  <lb/>would enslave the negroes, if the <name>English</name> gave it up—as
	  <lb/>if it were allowable for one man to commit a crime be­
	  <lb/>cause another was likely to do it! They tell how merciful
	  <lb/>it is to bring the <name>Africans</name> away from the despotism and
	  <lb/>wars, which desolate their own continent; but they do
	  <lb/>not add that the white man is himself the cause of those
	  <lb/>wars, nor do they prove our right to judge for another
	  <lb/>man where he will be the happiest. If the <name>Turks</name> or the
	  <lb/><name>Algerines</name> saw fit to exercise this right, they might
	  <lb/>carry away captive all the occupants of our prisons and

        <p>Some of the advocates of this traffic maintained that
	  <lb/>the voyage from <placeName>Africa</placeName> to the slave-market, called the

	  <lb/>existence. One went so far as to declare it <quote>the happiest
	    <lb/>part of a negro's life.</quote> They aver that the <name>Africans</name>, on
	  <lb/>their way to slavery, are so merry, that they dance and sing.
	  <lb/>But upon a careful examination of witnesses, it was found
	  <lb/>that their singing consisted of dirge-like lamentations for
	  <lb/>their native land. One of the captains threatened to flog
	  <lb/>a woman, because the mournfulness of her song was too
	  <lb/>painful to him. After meals they jumped up <supplied reason="flawed-reproduction">i</supplied>n their
	  <lb/>irons for exercise. This was considered so necessary
	  <lb/>for their health, that they were whipped, if they refused
	  <lb/>to do it. And this was their dancing! <quote xml:id="caq01">I,</quote> said one of
	  <lb/>the witnesses, <quote xml:id="caq02">was employed to dance the men, while
	    <lb/>another person danced the women.</quote></p>
        <p>Those pretences, ridiculous as they appear, are worth

	  <lb/>no old people are admitted, so that those shipped are at
	  <lb/>the firmest period of life, the annual mortality is forty­
	  <lb/>three in a hundred. In vessels that sail from

	  <lb/><placeName>Benin</placeName>, and the <placeName>Calabars</placeName>, whence a large proportion

	  <lb/>good opportunities for observation, and who certainly
	  <lb/>had no <placeName>New England</placeName> prejudices: <quote>There must, doubt­
	    <lb/>less, be an unhappy influence on the manners of the
	    <lb/>people, produced by the existence of slavery among us.
	    <lb/>The whole commerce between master and slave is a per­
	    <lb/>petual exercise of the most boisterous passions; the most
	    <lb/>unremitting despotism on the one part, and degrading 
	    <lb/>submission on the other. Our children see this, and learn
	    <lb/>to imitate it; for man is an imitative animal. The parent
	    <lb/>storms; the child looks on, catches the lineaments
	    <lb/>of wrath, puts on the same airs in a circle of smaller
	    <lb/>slaves, gives loose to the worst of passions; and thus
	    <lb/>nursed, educated, and daily exercised in tyranny, cannot
	    <lb/>but be stamped by it with odious peculiarities. The man
	    <lb/>must be a prodigy, who can retain his morals and man­
	    <lb/>ners undepraved in such circumstances.</quote></p>
        <p>In a community where all the labor is done by one
	  <lb/>class, there must of course be another class, who live in
	  <lb/>indolence; and we all know how much people that have
	  <lb/>nothing to do are tempted by what the world calls
	  <lb/>pleasures; the result is, that slave-holding states and
	  <lb/>colonies are proverbial for dissipation. Hence too the
	  <lb/>contempt for industry, which prevails in such a state of
	  <lb/>society. Where none work but slaves, usefulness be­
	  <lb/>comes degradation. The wife of a respectable mechanic,
	  <lb/>who accompanied her husband from <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> to
	  <lb/>the South, gave great offence to her new neighbors by
	  <lb/>performing her usual household avocations; they begged
	  <lb/>her to desist from it, (offering the services of their own
	  <lb/>blacks,) because the sight of a white person engaged in
	  <lb/>any labor was extremely injurious to the slaves; they
	  <lb/>deemed it very important that the negroes should be
	  <lb/>taught, both by precept and example, that they alone
	  <lb/>were made to work!</p>
        <p>Whether the undue importance attached to merely
	  <lb/>extenal gentility, and the increasing tendency to indo­
	  <lb/>lence and extravagance throughout this country, ought
	  <lb/>to be attributed, in any degree, to the same source, I am
	  <lb/>unable to say; if <emph>any</emph> influence comes to us from the
	  <lb/>example and ridicule of the slave-holding States, it cer­
	  <lb/>tainly must be of this nature.</p>

        <p>There is another view of this system, which I cannot
	  <lb/>unveil so completely as it ought to be. I shall be
	  <lb/>called bold for saying so much; but the facts are so
	  <lb/>important, that it is a matter of conscience not to be
	  <lb/>fastidious.</p>
        <p>The negro woman is unprotected either by law or
	  <lb/>public opinion. She is the property of her master, and
	  <lb/>her daughters are his property. They are allowed to
	  <lb/>have no conscientious scruples, no sense of shame, no
	  <lb/>regard for the feelings of husband, or parent; they must
	  <lb/>be entirely subservient to the will of their owner, on
	  <lb/>pain of being whipped as near unto death as will com­
	  <lb/>port with his interest, or quite to death, if it suit his
	  <lb/>pleasure.</p>
        <p>Those who know human nature would be able to con­
	  <lb/>jecture the unavoidable result, even if it were not
	  <lb/>betrayed by the amount of mixed population. Think
	  <lb/>for a moment, what a degrading effect must be produced
	  <lb/>on the morals of both blacks and whites by customs like
	  <lb/>these!</p>
        <p>Considering we live in the <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth century</date>, it is
	  <lb/>indeed a strange state of society where the father sells
	  <lb/>his child, and the brother puts his siter up at auc­
	  <lb/>tion! Yet these things are often practised in our re­
	  <lb/>public.</p>
        <p><persName>Doctor Walsh</persName>, in his account of <placeName>Brazil</placeName>, tells an anec­
	  <lb/>dote of one of these fathers, who love their offspring at
	  <lb/>market price. <quote>For many years,</quote> says he, <quote>this man 
	    <lb/>kept his son in slavery, and maintained the right to dis­
	    <lb/>pose of him, as he would of his mule. Being <supplied reason="damaged">i</supplied>ll, how­
	    <lb/>ever, and near to die, he made his will, left his child
	    <lb/>his freedom, and apprised him of it. Some time after,
	    <lb/>he recovered, and having a dispute with the young man,
	    <lb/>he threatened to sell him with the rest of his stock.
	    <lb/>The son, determined to prevent this, assassinated his
	    <lb/>father in a wood, got possession of the will, demanded his
	    <lb/>freedom, and obtained it. This circumstance was per­
	    <lb/>fectly well known in the neighborhood, but no process
	    <lb/>was instituted against him. He was not chargeable, as
	    <lb/>I could hear, with any other delinquency than <supplied reason="damaged">t</supplied>he hor­
	    <lb/>rible one of murdering his father to obtain his freedom.</quote>

	  <lb/>This forms a fine picture of the effects of slavery upon
	  <lb/>human relations!<anchor xml:id="a06" corresp="#n06" rend="pre(*)"/></p>
        <p>I have more than once heard people, who had just
	  <lb/>returned from the South, speak of seeing a number of
	  <lb/>mulattoes in attendance where they visited, whose re­
	  <lb/>semblance to the head of the family was too striking not
	  <lb/>to be immediately observed. What sort of feeling must
	  <lb/>be excited in the minds of those slaves by being con­
	  <lb/>stantly exposed to the tyranny or caprice of their own
	  <lb/>brothers and sisters, and by the knowledge that these
	  <lb/>near relations will, on a division of the estate, have power
	  <lb/>to sell them off with the cattle?</p>
        <p>But the vices of white men eventually provide a
	  <lb/>scourge for themselves. They increase the negro race,
	  <lb/>but the negro can never increase theirs; and this is one
	  <lb/>great reason why the proportion of colored population is
	  <lb/>always so large in slave-holding countries. As the ratio
	  <lb/>increases more and more every year, the colored people
	  <lb/>must eventually be the stronger party; and when this
	  <lb/>result happens, slavery must either be abolished, or gov­
	  <lb/>ernment must furnish troops, of whose wages the free
	  <lb/>States must pay their proportion.</p>
        <p>As a proof of the effects of slavery on the temper, I
	  <lb/>will relate but very few anecdotes.</p>
        <p>The first happened in the <placeName>Bahamas</placeName>. It is extracted

	      <lb/>she remained in them night and day. During this period
	      <lb/>she was flogged repeatedly, one of the overseers thinks 
	      <lb/>about six times; and red pepper was rubbed upon her
	      <lb/>eyes, to prevent her sleeping. Tasks were given her,
	      <lb/>which, in the opinion of the same overseer, she was in­
	      <lb/>capable of performing; sometimes because they were
	      <lb/>beyond her powers, at other times because she could not
	      <lb/>see to do them, on account of the pepper having been
	      <lb/>rubbed on her eyes; and she was flogged for failing to
	      <lb/>accomplish these tasks. A violent distemper had pre­

	      <lb/>complained of fever; and that one of the floggings she
	      <lb/>received was the day after she made the complaint.
	      <lb/>When she was taken out of the stocks, she appeared to
	      <lb/>be cramped, and was then again flogged. The very day
	      <lb/>of her release, she was sent to field labor (though hereto­

	      <lb/>ensuing was brought before her owners, as being ill, and
	      <lb/>refusing to work; and she then again complained of
	      <lb/>having fever. They were of opinion that she had none

        <p>The following account was originally written by the
	  <lb/><persName>Rev. William Dickey</persName> of <placeName>Bloomingsburgh</placeName>, to the <persName>Rev.

	  <lb/>slavery, by the <persName>Rev. Mr Rankin</persName>, who assures us that
	  <lb/><persName>Mr Dickey</persName> was well acquainted with the circumstances
	  <lb/>he describes.</p>
        <p><quote>In the country of <placeName>Livington</placeName>, <placeName>Kentucky</placeName>, near the mouth
	    <lb/>of <placeName>Cumberland river</placeName>, lived <persName>Lilburn Lewis</persName>, the son of
	    <lb/><persName>Jefferson's</persName> sister. He was the wealthy owner of a con­
	    <lb/>siderable number of slaves, whom he drove constantly,
	    <lb/>fed sparingly, and lashed severely. The consequence
	    <lb/>was, they would run away. Among the rest was an ill-
	    <lb/>grown boy, about seventeen, who, having just returned
	    <lb/>from a skulking spell, was sent to the spring for water,
	    <lb/>and, in returning, let fall an elegant pitcher, which dashed
	    <lb/>to shivers on the rocks. It was night, and the slaves
	    <lb/>were all at home. The master had them collected into
	    <lb/>the most roomy negro-house, and a rousing fire made.</quote><lb/>(Reader, what follows is very shocking; but I have al­

	  <lb/>sensitive than our consciences. If such things are done
	  <lb/>in our country, it is important that we should know of
	  <lb/>them, and seriously reflect upon them.) <quote>The door was
	    <lb/>fastened, that none of the negroes, either through fear or
	    <lb/>sympathy, should attempt to escape; he then told them

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">23</mw>
	    <lb/>that the design of this meeting was to teach them to
	    <lb/>remain at home and obey his orders. All things being
	    <lb/>now in train, <persName>George</persName> was called up, and by the assist­
	    <lb/>ance of his younger brother, laid on a broad bench or
	    <lb/>block. The master then cut off his ancles with a broad 
	    <lb/>axe. In vain the unhappy victim screamed. Not a
	    <lb/>hand among so many dared to interfere. Having cast
	    <lb/>the feet into the fire he lectured the negroes at some
	    <lb/>length. He then proceeded to cut off his limbs below 
	    <lb/>the knees. The sufferer besought him to begin with his
	    <lb/>head. It was in vain — the master went on thus, until
	    <lb/>trunk, arms, and head, were all in the fire. Still pro­
	    <lb/>tracting the intervals with lectures, and threatenings of
	    <lb/>like punishment, in case any of them were disobedient,
	    <lb/>or ran away, or disclosed the tragedy they were compel­
	    <lb/>led to witness. In order to comsume the bones, the fire
	    <lb/>was briskly stirred until midnight: when, as if heaven
	    <lb/>and earth combined to show their detestation of the
	    <lb/>deed, a sudden shock of earthquake threw down the 
	    <lb/>heavy wall, composed of rock and clay, extinguished the 
	    <lb/>fire, and covered the remains of <persName>George</persName>. The negroes
	    <lb/>were allowed to disperse, with charges to keep the secret,
	    <lb/>under the penalty of like punishment. When his wife
	    <lb/>asked the cause of the dreadful screams she had heard,
	    <lb/>he said that he had never enjoyed himself so well at a
	    <lb/>ball as he had enjoyed himself that evening. Next
	    <lb/>morning, he ordered the wall to be rebuilt, and he him­
	    <lb/>self supeintended, picking up the remains of the boy,
	    <lb/>and placing them within the new wall, thus hoping to
	    <lb/>conceal the matter. But some of the negroes whispered
	    <lb/>the horrid deed; the neighbors tore down the wall, and
	    <lb/>finding the remains, they testified against him. He was
	    <lb/>bound over to await the sitting of the court; but before
	    <lb/>that period arrived, he committed suicide.</quote></p>

        <p><persName>Mr Rankin</persName> adds, there was little probability that <persName>Mr

        <p>Another instance of summary punishment inflicted on
	  <lb/>a runaway slave, is told by a respectable gentleman from
	  <lb/><placeName>South Carolina</placeName>, with whom I am acquainted. He was
	  <lb/>young, when the circumstance occurred, in the neigh­
	  <lb/>borhood of his home; and it filled him with horror. A
	  <lb/>slave being missing, several planters united in a negro
	  <lb/>hunt, as it is called. They set out with dogs, guns, and
	  <lb/>horses, as they would to chase a tiger. The poor fel­
	  <lb/>low, being discovered, took refuge in a tree; where he
	  <lb/>was deliberately shot by his pursuers.</p>
        <p>In some of the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>, blood-hounds are employed
	  <lb/>to hunt negroes; and this fact is the foundation of one
	  <lb/>of the most painfully interesting scenes in <persName>Miss Mar­
	    <lb/>tineau's</persName> <title>Demerara</title>. A writer by the name of <persName>Dallas</persName>
	  <lb/>has the hardihood to assert that it is mere sophistry to
	  <lb/>censure the practice of training dogs to devour men.
	  <lb/>He asks, <quote>Did not the <name>Asiatics</name> employ elephants in
	    <lb/>war? If a man were bitten by a rabid dog, would he
	    <lb/>hesitate to cut off the wounded part, in order to save his
	    <lb/>life?</quote></p>
        <p>It is said that when the first pack of blood-hounds
	  <lb/>arrived in <placeName>St Domingo</placeName>, the white planters delivered to
	  <lb/>them the first negro they found, merely by way of exper­
	  <lb/>iment; and when they saw him immediately torn in
	  <lb/>pieces, they were highly delighted to find the dogs so
	  <lb/>well trained to their business.</p>
        <p>Some authentic records of female cruelty would seem
	  <lb/>perfectly incredible, were it not an established law of
	  <lb/>our nature that tyranny becomes a habit, and the scenes of
	  <lb/>suffering, often repeated, render the heart callous.</p>
        <p>A young friend of mine, remarkable for the kindness
	  <lb/>of his disposition and the courtesy of his manners, told
	  <lb/>me that he was really alarmed at the change produced
	  <lb/>in his character by a few months' residence in the <placeName>West
	  <lb/>Indies</placeName>. The family who owned the plantation were
	  <lb/>absent, and he saw nothing around him but slaves; the
	  <lb/>consequence was that he insensibly acquired a dictato­
	  <lb/>rial manner, and habitual disregard to the convenience
	  <lb/>of his inferiors. The candid admonition of a friend
	  <lb/>made him aware of this, and his natural amiability was
	  <lb/>restored.</p>

        <p>The ladies who remove from the free States into the
	  <lb/>slave-holding ones almost invariably write that the sight
	  <lb/>of slavery was at first exceedingly painful; but that they
	  <lb/>soon become habituated to it; and after a while, they are
	  <lb/>very apt to vindicate the system, upon the ground that it is
	  <lb/>extremely convenient to have such submissive servants.
	  <lb/>This reason was actually given by a lady of my acquaint­
	  <lb/>ance, who is considered an unusually fervent <name>Christian</name>.
	  <lb/>Yet <name>Christianity</name> expressly teaches us to love our neigh­
	  <lb/>bor as ourselves. This shows how dangerous it is,
	  <lb/>for even the best of us, to become <soCalled rend="slant(italic)">accustomed</soCalled> to what is
	  <lb/>wrong.</p>
        <p>A judicious and benevolent friend lately told me the
	  <lb/>story of one of her relatives, who married a slave owner,
	  <lb/>and removed to his plantation. The lady in question
	  <lb/>was considered very amiable, and had a serene, affection­
	  <lb/>ate expression of countenance. After several years'
	  <lb/>residence among her slaves, she visited <placeName>New England</placeName>.
	  <lb/><said>Her history was written in her face,</said> said my friend;
	  <lb/><said>its expression had changes into that of a fiend. She
	    <lb/>brought but few slaves with her; and those few were of
	    <lb/>course compelled to perform additional labor. One
	    <lb/>faithful negro woman nursed the twins of her mistress,
	    <lb/>and did all the washing, ironing, and scouring. If, after
	    <lb/>a sleepless night with the restless babies (driven from the
	    <lb/>bosom of their own mother,) she performed her toilsome
	    <lb/>avocations with diminished activity, her mistress, with
	    <lb/>her own lady-like hands, applied the cow-skin, and the
	    <lb/>neighborhood resounded with the cries of her victim.
	    <lb/>The instrument of punishment was actually kept hang­
	    <lb/>ing in the entry, to the no small disgust of her <placeName>New
	    <lb/>England</placeName> visitors. For my part,</said> continued my friend,
	  <lb/><said>I did not try to be polite to her; for I was not hypo­
	    <lb/>crite enough to conceal my indignation.</said></p>
        <p>The following occured near <placeName>Natchez</placeName>, and was told to
	  <lb/>me by a highly intelligent man, who, being a diplomat<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">i</unclear>st
	  <lb/>and a courtier, was very likely to make the best of <unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">na</unclear>­
	  <lb/>tio<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">n</unclear>al evils; A planter had occasion to send a female
	  <lb/>slave some distance on an errand. She did not return so
	  <lb/>soon as he expected, and he grew angry. At last he gave
	  <lb/>orders that she should be severely whipped when she came

	  <lb/>back. When the poor creature arrived, she pleaded for
	  <lb/>mercy, saying she had been so very ill, that she was
	  <lb/>obliged to rest in the fields; but she was ordered to
	  <lb/>receive another dozen of lashes, for having had the im­
	  <lb/>pudence to speak. She died at the whipping post; nor
	  <lb/>did she perish alone — a new born baby died with her.
	  <lb/>The gentleman who told me this fact, witnessed the poor
	  <lb/>creature's funeral. It is true, the master was univer­
	  <lb/>sally blamed and shunned for the cruel deed; but the 
	  <lb/>laws were powerless.</p>
        <p>I shall be told that such examples as these are of rare
	  <lb/>occurence; and I have no doubt that instances of ex­
	  <lb/>cessive severity are far from being common. I believe
	  <lb/>that a large proportion of masters are as kind to their
	  <lb/>slaves as they can be, consistently with keeping them in
	  <lb/>bondage; but it must be allowed that this, to make the
	  <lb/>best of it, is very stinted kindness. And let it never be
	  <lb/>forgotten that the negro's fate depends entirely on the
	  <lb/>character of his master; and it is a mere matter of
	  <lb/>chance whether he fall into merciful or unmerciful hands;
	  <lb/>his happiness, nay, his very life, depends on chance.</p>
        <p>The slave owners are always telling us that the ac­
	  <lb/>counts of slave misery are abominably exaggerated; and
	  <lb/>their plea is supported by many individuals, who seem to
	  <lb/>think that charity was made to <emph>cover</emph> sins, not to <emph>cure</emph>
	  <lb/>them. But without listening to the zealous opposers of
	  <lb/>slavery, we shall find in the judicial reports of the South­
	  <lb/>ern States, and in the ordinary details of their news­
	  <lb/>papers, more than enough to startle us; besides, we must
	  <lb/>not forget that where one instance of cruelty comes to
	  <lb/>our knowledge, hundreds are kept secret; and the more
	  <lb/>public attention is awakened to the subject, the more
	  <lb/>caution will be used in this respect.</p>
        <p>Why should we be deceived by the sophistry of those
	  <lb/>whose interest it is to gloss over iniquity, and who from
	  <lb/>long habit have learned to believe that it is no iniquity?
	  <lb/>It is a very simple process to judge rightly in this matter.
	  <lb/>Just ask yourself the question where you could find a set
	  <lb/>of men, in whose power you would be willing to place
	  <lb/>yourself, if the laws allowed them to sin against you with
	  <lb/>impunity?</p>

        <p>But it is urged that it is the interest of planters to
	  <lb/>treat their slaves well. This argument no doubt has
	  <lb/>some force; and it is the poor negro's only security.
	  <lb/>But it is likewise the interest of men to treat their cattle
	  <lb/>kindly; yet we see that passion and short-sighted avar<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">ice</unclear>
	  <lb/>do overcome the strongest motives of interest. Cattle
	  <lb/>are beat mercifully, sometimes unto death; they are
	  <lb/>ruined by being over-worked; weakened by want of
	  <lb/>sufficient food; and so forth. Besides, it is sometimes
	  <lb/>directly <emph>for</emph> the interest of the planter to work his slaves
	  <lb/>beyond their strength. When there is a sudden rise in
	  <lb/>the prices of sugar, a certain amount of labor in a given
	  <lb/>time is of more consequence to the owner of a planta­
	  <lb/>tion, than the price of several slaves; he can well <emph>afford</emph>
	  <lb/>to waste a few lives. This is no idle hypothesis — such
	  <lb/>calculations are gravely and openly made by planters.
	  <lb/>Hence, it is the slave's prayer that sugars may be cheap.
	  <lb/>When the negro is old, or feeble from incurable disease,
	  <lb/>is it his master's <emph>interest</emph> to feed him well, and clothe him
	  <lb/>comforably? Certainly not: it then becomes desira­
	  <lb/>ble to get rid of the human brute as soon as convenient.
	  <lb/>It is a common remark, that it is not quite safe, in most
	  <lb/>cases, for even parents to be entirely dependent on the
	  <lb/>generosity of their children; and if human nature be
	  <lb/>such, what has the slave to expect, when he becomes a
	  <lb/>mere bill of expense?</p>
        <p>It is a common retort to say that <name>New Englanders</name>,
	  <lb/>who go to the South, soon learn to patronize the system
	  <lb/>they have considered so abominable, and often become
	  <lb/>proverbial for their severity. I have not the least doubt
	  <lb/>of the fact; for slavery contaminates all that comes
	  <lb/>within its influence. It would be very absurd to imagine
	  <lb/>that the inhabitants of one State are worse than the in­
	  <lb/>habitants of another, unless some peculiar circumstances,
	  <lb/>of universal influence, tend to make them so. Human
	  <lb/>nature is everywhere the same; but developed different­
	  <lb/>ly, by different incitements and temptations. It is the
	  <lb/>business of wise legislation to discover what influences
	  <lb/>are most productive of good, and the least conducive to
	  <lb/>evil. If we were educated at the South, we should no
	  <lb/>doubt vindicate slavery, and inherit as a birthright all
<pb n="028"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="3(2)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">28</mw>
	  <lb/>the evils it engrafts upon the character. If they lived on
	  <lb/>our rocky soil, and under our inclement skies, their
	  <lb/>shrewdness would sometimes border upon knavery, and
	  <lb/>their frugality sometimes degenerate into parsimony.
	  <lb/>We both have our virtues, and our faults, induced by the
	  <lb/>influences under which we live, and, of course, totally
	  <lb/>different in their character. <emph>Our</emph> defects are bad enough;
	  <lb/>but they cannot, like slavery, affect the destiny and rights
	  <lb/>of millions.</p>
        <p>All this mutual recrimination about horse-jockeys,
	  <lb/>gamblers, tin-pedlers, and venders of wooden nutmegs,
	  <lb/>is quite unworthy of a great nation. Instead of calmly
	  <lb/>examining this important subject on the plain grounds of
	  <lb/>justice and humanity, we allow it to degenerate into a
	  <lb/>mere question of <emph>sectional</emph> pride and vanity. [Pardon
	  <lb/>the Americanism, would we had less <emph>use</emph> for the word!]
	  <lb/>It is the <emph>system</emph>, not the <emph>men</emph>, on which we ought to be­
	  <lb/>stow the full measure of abhorrence. If we were wil­
	  <lb/>ling to forget ourselves, and could, like true republicans,
	  <lb/>prefer the common good to all other considerations, there
	  <lb/>would not be a slave in the <placeName>United States</placeName>, at the end of
	  <lb/>half a century.</p>
        <p>The arguments in support of slavery are all hollow
	  <lb/>and deceptive, though frequently very specious. No one
	  <lb/>thinks of finding a foundation for the system in the prin­
	  <lb/>ciples of truth and justice; and the unavoidable result
	  <lb/>is, that even in <emph>policy</emph> it is unsound. The monstrous
	  <lb/>fabric rests on the mere <emph>appearance</emph> of present expedi­
	  <lb/>ency; while, in fact, all its tendencies, individual and
	  <lb/>national, present and remote, are highly injurious to the
	  <lb/>true interests of the country. The slave owner will not
	  <lb/>believe this. The stronger the evidence against his fa­
	  <lb/>vorite theories, the more strenuously he defends them.
	  <lb/>It has been widely said, <quote>Honesty <emph rend="slant(italic)">is</emph> the best policy; but
	    <lb/>policy without honesty never finds that out.</quote></p>
        <p>I hope none will be so literal as to suppose I intend to 
	  <lb/>say that no planter can be honest, in the common accep­
	  <lb/>tation of that term. I simply mean that all who ground
	  <lb/>their arguments in policy, and not in duty and plain
	  <lb/>truth, are really blind to the highest and best interests of
	  <lb/>man.</p>

        <p>Among other apologies for slavery, it has been as­
	  <lb/>serted that the Bible does not forbid it. Neither does it
	  <lb/>forbid the counterfeiting of a bank-bill. It is the <emph>spirit</emph>
	  <lb/>of the Holy Word, not its particular <emph>expressions</emph>, which
	  <lb/>must be a rule for our conduct. How can slavery be
	  <lb/>reconciled with the maxim, <quote>Do unto others, as ye would
	    <lb/>that others should do unto you</quote>? Does not the com­
	  <lb/>mand, <quote>Thou shalt not <emph>steal</emph>,</quote> prohibit <emph>kidnapping</emph>?
	  <lb/>And how does whipping men to death agree with the
	  <lb/>injunction, <quote>Thou shalt do no <emph>murder</emph></quote>? Are we not
	  <lb/>told <quote>to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the
	    <lb/>heavy burdens, to let the oppressed go free, and to break
	    <lb/>every yoke</quote>? It was a Jewish law that he who stole a
	  <lb/>man, or sold him, or he in whose hand the stolen man
	  <lb/>was found, should suffer death; and he in whose house a
	  <lb/>fugitive slave sought an asylum was forbidden to give
	  <lb/>him up to his master. Modern slavery is so unlike He­
	  <lb/>brew servitude, and its regulations are so diametrically
	  <lb/>opposed to the rules of the Gospel, which came to bring
	  <lb/>deliverance to the captive, that it is idle to dwell upon
	  <lb/>this point. The advocates of this system seek for argu­
	  <lb/>ments in the history of every age and nation; but the
	  <lb/>fact is, negro slavery is totally different from any other
	  <lb/>form of bondage that ever existed; and if it were not so,
	  <lb/>are we to copy the evils of bad governments and be­
	  <lb/>nighted ages?</p>
        <p>The difficulty of subduing slavery, on account of the
	  <lb/>great number of interests which become united in it, and
	  <lb/>the prodigious strength of the selfish passions enlisted in
	  <lb/>its support, is by no means its least alarming feature.
	  <lb/>This Hydra has ten thousand heads, every one of which
	  <lb/>will bite or growl, when the broad daylight of truth lays
	  <lb/>open the secrets of its hideous den.</p>
        <p>I shall perhaps be asked why I have said so much
	  <lb/>about the slave <emph>trade</emph>, since it was long ago abolished in
	  <lb/>this country? There are several good reasons for it. In
	  <lb/>the first place, it is a part of the system; for if there
	  <lb/>were no slaves, there could be no slave trade; and while
	  <lb/>there are slaves, the slave trade <emph>will</emph> continue. In the
	  <lb/>next place, the trade is still briskly carried on in <placeName>Africa</placeName>,
	  <lb/>and slaves are smuggled into these States through the

	  <lb/><placeName>Spanish colonies</placeName>. In the third place, a very extensive in­
	  <lb/>ternal slave trade is carried on in this country. The
	  <lb/>breeding of negro cattle for the foreign markets, (of
	  <lb/><placeName>Louisiana</placeName>, <placeName>Georgia</placeName>, <placeName>Alabama</placeName>, 
	  <placeName>Arkansas</placeName>, and <placeName>Missouri</placeName>,)
	  <lb/>is a very lucrative branch of business. Whole coffles of
	  <lb/>them, chained and manacled, are driven through our
	  <lb/>Capital on their way to auction. Foreigners, particu­
	  <lb/>larly those who come here with enthusiastic ideas of

	  <lb/>thus: <quote rend="post()">About forty black men were chained together;
	    <lb/>each of them was handcuffed, and they were arranged
	    <lb/>rank and file. A chain, perhaps forty feet long, was
	    <lb/>stretched between the two ranks, to which short chains
	    <lb/>were joined, connected with the hand-cuffs. Behind

	    <lb/>countenance wore a solemn sadness; and the dismal
	    <lb/>silence of despair was only broken by the sound of two
	    <lb/>violins. Yes — as if to add insult to unjury, the fore­
	    <lb/>most couple were furnished with a violin apiece; the
	    <lb/>second couple were ornamented with cockades; while
	    <lb/>near the centre our national standard was carried by
	    <lb/>hands literally in chains. I may have mistaken some of
	    <lb/>the punctilios of the arrangement, for my very soul was
	    <lb/>sick. My landlady was sister to the man who owned
	    <lb/>the drove; and from her I learned that he had, a few

        <p>But <placeName>Washington</placeName> is the great e<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">m</unclear>porium of the internal

        <p>A free man of color is in constant danger of being
	  <lb/>seized and carried off by these slave dealers. <persName>Mr
	    <lb/>Cooper</persName>, a Representative in <orgName>Congress</orgName> from <placeName>Delaware</placeName>,
	  <lb/>told <persName>Dr Torrey</persName> of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, that he was often afraid to
	  <lb/>send his servants out in the evening, lest they should be
	  <lb/>encountered by kidnappers. Wherever these notorious
	  <lb/>slave jockeys appear in our Southern States, the free peo­
	  <lb/>ple of color hide themselves, as they are obliged to do on
	  <lb/>the coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName>.</p>
        <p>The following is the testimony of <persName>Doctor Torrey</persName>,
	  <lb/>of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, published in <date when="1817">1817</date>:</p>

	    <lb/>clubs, gagged and bound, and dragged into distant and
	    <lb/>hopeless captivity, leaving no traces behind, except the
	    <lb/>blood from their wounds.</p>

	    <lb/>the mother escaped from their merciless grasp, while on
	    <lb/>their way to the state of <placeName>Maryland</placeName>. The plunderers, of
	    <lb/>whom there were nearly half a dozen, conveyed their
	    <lb/>prey upon horses; and the woman being placed on one
	    <lb/>of the horses, behind, improved an opportunity, as they
	    <lb/>were passing a house, and sprang off. Not daring to
	    <lb/>pursue her, they proceeded on, leaving her youngest
	    <lb/>child a little farther along, by the side of the road, in
	    <lb/>expectation, it is supposed, that its cries would attract the
	    <lb/>mother; but she prudently waited until morning, and
	    <lb/>recovered it again in safety.</p>
          <p>I consider myself more fully warranted in particular­
	    <lb/>izing this fact, from the circumstances of having been at
	    <lb/><placeName>Newcastle</placeName>, at the time that the woman was brought
	    <lb/>with her child, before the grand jury, for examination;
	    <lb/>and of having seen several of the persons against whom
	    <lb/>bills of indictment were found, on the charge of be­
	    <lb/>ing engaged in the perpetration of the outrage; and
	    <lb/>also that one or two of them were the same who
	    <lb/>were accused of assisting in seizing and carrying off
	    <lb/>another woman and child whom I discovered at <placeName>Wash­
	    <lb/>ington</placeName>. A monster in human shape, was detected in
	    <lb/>the city of <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, pursuing the occupation of
	    <lb/>courting and marrying mulatto women, and selling
	    <lb/>them as slaves. In his last attempt of this kind,
	    <lb/>the fact having come to the knowledge of the Afri­
	    <lb/>can population of this city, a mob was immediately
	    <lb/>collected, and he was only saved from being torn in
	    <lb/>atoms, by being deposited in the city prison. They
	    <lb/>have lately invented a method of attaining their ob­
	    <lb/>ject, through the instrumentality of the laws: — Hav­
	    <lb/>ing selected a suitable free colored person, to make a
	    <lb/><emph>pitch</emph> upon, the kidnapper employs a confederate, to
	    <lb/>ascertain the distinguishing marks of his body; he 
	    <lb/>then claims and obtains him as a slave, before a ma­
	    <lb/>gistrate, by describing those marks, and proving the
	    <lb/>truth of his assertions, by his well-instructed accom­
	    <lb/>plice.</p>
          <p>From the best information that I have had oppor­
	    <lb/>tunities to collect, in travelling by various routes through
	    <lb/>the states of <placeName>Delaware</placeName> and <placeName>Maryland</placeName>, I am fully con­

	    <lb/>vinced that there are, at this time, within the juris­
	    <lb/>diction of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, several thousands of
	    <lb/>legally free people of color, toiling under the yoke of
	    <lb/>involuntary servitude, and transmitting the same fate
	    <lb/>to their posterity! If the probability of this fact could
	    <lb/>be authenticated to the recognition of the <orgName>Congress

	    <lb/>for the restoration of those unhappy victims of violence
	    <lb/>and avarice, to their freedom and constitutional personal
	    <lb/>rights. The work, both from its nature and magni­
	    <lb/>tude, is impracticable to individuals, or benevolent
	    <lb/>societies; besides, it is perfectly a national business,

        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">Between</hi> ancient and modern slavery there is this
	  <lb/>remarkable distinction — the former originated in mo­
	  <lb/>tives of humanity; the latter is dictated solely by avarice.
	  <lb/>The ancients made slaves of captives taken in war, as
	  <lb/>an amelioration of the original custom of indiscriminate
	  <lb/>slaughter; the moderns attack defenceless people, with­
	  <lb/>out any provocation, and steal them, for the express
	  <lb/>purpose of making them slaves.</p>
        <p>Modern slavery, indeed, in all its particulars, is more
	  <lb/>odious than the ancient; and it is worthy of remark
	  <lb/>that the condition of slaves has always been worse just
	  <lb/>in proportion to the freedom enjoyed by their masters.
	  <lb/>In <placeName>Greece</placeName>, none were so proud of liberty as the <name>Spar­
	  <lb/>tans</name>; and they were a proverb among the neighboring
	  <lb/>States for their severity to slaves. The slave code of the
	  <lb/>Roman republic was rigid and tyrannical in the extreme;
	  <lb/>and cruelties became so common and excessive, that the
	  <lb/>emperors, in the latter days of Roman power, were
	  <lb/>obliged to enact laws to restrain them. In the modern
	  <lb/>world, <placeName>England</placeName> and <placeName>America</placeName> are the most conspicuous

	  <lb/>slave laws have been framed as bad as they were in Pagan,
	  <lb/>iron-hearted <placeName>Rome</placeName>; and the customs are in some respects
	  <lb/>more oppressive; —<emph>modern</emph> slavery unquestionably wears
	  <lb/>its very worst aspect in the Colonies of <placeName>England</placeName> and the
	  <lb/><placeName>United States</placeName> of <placeName>North America</placeName>. I hardly know how
	  <lb/>to decide their respective claims. My countrymen are
	  <lb/>fond of preëminence, and I am afraid they deserve
	  <lb/>it here — especially if we throw into the scale their
	  <lb/>loud boasts of superiority over all the rest of the world
	  <lb/>in civil and religious freedom. The slave codes of the 
	  <lb/><placeName>United States</placeName> and of the <placeName>British West Indies</placeName> were orig­
	  <lb/>inally almost precisely the same; but <emph>their</emph> laws have
	  <lb/>been growing milder and milder, while <emph>ours</emph> have in­
	  <lb/>creased in severity. The <name>British</name> have the advantage
	  <lb/>of us in this respect — they long ago dared to describe
	  <lb/>the monster as it is; and they are now grappling with it,
	  <lb/>with the overwhelming strength of a great nation's con­
	  <lb/>centrated energies.—The <name>Dutch</name>, those sturdy old friends
	  <lb/>of liberty, and the <name>French</name>, who have been stark mad for
	  <lb/>freedom, rank next for the severity of their slave laws
	  <lb/>and customs. The <name>Spanish</name> and <name>Portuguese</name> are milder
	  <lb/>than either.</p>
        <p>I will give a brief view of some of our own laws on
	  <lb/>this subject; for the correctness of which, I refer the
	  <lb/>reader to <persName>Stroud's</persName> <title>Sketch of the Slave Laws of the <placeName>United
	      <lb/>States of America</placeName></title>. In the first place, we will inquire
	  <lb/>upon what ground the negro slaves in this country are
	  <lb/>claimed as property. Most of them are the descendants
	  <lb/>of persons kidnapped on the coast of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, and
	  <lb/>brought here while we were British Colonies; and as
	  <lb/>the slave trade was openly sanctioned more than twenty
	  <lb/>years after our acknowledged independence, in <date when="1783">1783</date>,
	  <lb/>and as the traffic is still carried on by smugglers, there
	  <lb/>are, no doubt, thousands of slaves, now living in the
	  <lb/><placeName>United States</placeName>, who were actually stolen 
	  from <placeName>Africa</placeName>.<anchor xml:id="a11" corresp="#n11" rend="pre(*)"/></p>
        <p>A provincial law of <placeName>Maryland</placeName>, enacted that any white
	  <lb/>woman who married a negro slave should serve his mas­
	  <lb/>ter during her husband's lifetime, and that all their
<pb n="037"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="4(1)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">37</mw>
	  <lb/>children should be slaves. This law was not repealed
	  <lb/>until the end of eighteen years, and it then continued in
	  <lb/>full force with regard to those who had contracted such
	  <lb/>marriages in the intermediate time; therefore the de­
	  <lb/>scendants of white women so situated may be slaves unto
	  <lb/>the present day. The doctrine of the common law is
	  <lb/>that the offspring shall follow the condition of the <emph>father</emph>;
	  <lb/>but the slave law (with the above temporary exception) re­
	  <lb/>verses the common law, and provides that children shall
	  <lb/>follow the condition of the <emph>mother</emph>. Hence mulattoes
	  <lb/>and their descendants are held in perpetual bondage,
	  <lb/>though the <emph>father</emph> is a free white man. <quote>Any person
	    <lb/>whose <emph>maternal</emph> ancestor, even in the <emph>remotest</emph> degree of
	    <lb/>distance, can be shown to have been a negro, <name>Indian</name>,
	    <lb/>mulatto, or a mestizo, <emph>not</emph> free at the ime this law was
	    <lb/>introduced, although the <emph>paternal</emph> ancestor at each suc­
	    <lb/>cessive generation may have been a <emph>white free</emph> man, is
	    <lb/>declared to be the subject of perpetual slavery.</quote> Even
	  <lb/>the code of <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, is on this head, more liberal than
	  <lb/>ours; by an express law, slavery ceases at the <emph>fourth</emph> de­
	  <lb/>gree of distance from a negro ancestor: and in the other
	  <lb/><placeName>British West Indies</placeName>, the established custom is such, that
	  <lb/>quadroons or mestizoes (as they call the second and
	  <lb/>third degrees) are rarely seen in a state of slavery. Here,
	  <lb/>neither law nor public opinion favors the mulatto de­
	  <lb/>scendants of free white men. This furnishes a conven­
	  <lb/>ient game to the slave-holder — it enables him to fill
	  <lb/>his purse by means of his own vices; — the right to sell
	  <lb/>one half of his children provides a fortune <unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">fo</unclear>r the 
	  <lb/>remainder. Had the maxim of the common law been
	  <lb/>allowed, — i. e. that the the offspring follows the condition
	  <lb/>of the <emph>father</emph>, — the mulattoes, almost without exception,
	  <lb/>would have been free, and thus the prodigious and alarm­
	  <lb/>ing increase of our slave population might have been
	  <lb/>prevented. The great augmentation of the servile class
	  <lb/>in the Southern States compared with the <placeName>West India</placeName>
	  <lb/>colonies, has been thought to indicate a much milder
	  <lb/>form of slavery; but there are other causes, which
	  <lb/>tend to produce the result. There are much fewer white
	  <lb/>men in the <placeName>British West Indies</placeName> than in our slave States;
	  <lb/>hence the increase of the <emph>mulatto</emph> population is less rapid.

        <p>The negro act of <placeName>South Carolina</placeName> contains the follow­
	  <lb/>ing language: <quote>Whereas many owners of slaves, and

	    <lb/>cretion of the justice before whom complaint shall be
	    <lb/>made.</quote></p>
        <p>In <placeName>Louisiana</placeName> it is enacted, that <quote>the slaves shall be

	    <lb/>ized to abridge, by half an hour a day, the time fixed for
	    <lb/>their rest.</quote></p>
        <p>All these laws, <emph>apparently</emph> for the protection of the
	  <lb/>slave, are rendered perfectly null and void, by the fact,
	  <lb/>that the testimony of a negro or mulatto is <emph>never</emph> taken
	  <lb/>against a white man. If a slave be found toiling in the
	  <lb/>field on the <name>Sabbath</name>, who can <emph>prove</emph> that his master com­
	  <lb/>manded him to do it?</p>
        <p>The law of <placeName>Louisiana</placeName> stipulates that a slave shall have
	  <lb/><emph>one</emph> linen shirt,<anchor xml:id="a12" corresp="#n12" rend="pre(*)"/> and a pair of pantaloons for the sum­
	  <lb/>mer, and <emph>one</emph> linen shirt and a woollen great coat and

	  <lb/>pantaloons for the winter; and for food, one pint of salt,
	  <lb/>and a barrel of Indian corn, rice, or beans, every month.
	  <lb/>In <placeName>North Carolina</placeName>, the law decides that a quart of corn
	  <lb/>per day is sufficient. But, if the slave does not receive
	  <lb/>this poor allowance, who can <emph>prove</emph> the fact. The with­
	  <lb/>holding of proper sustenance is absolutely incapable
	  <lb/>of proof, unless the evidence of the sufferer himself be
	  <lb/>allowed; and the law, as if determined to obstruct the
	  <lb/>administration of justice, permits the master to excul­
	  <lb/>pate himself by an oath that the charges against him are
	  <lb/>false. Clothing may, indeed, be ascertained by <emph>inspec­
	    <lb/>tion</emph>; but who is likely to involve himself in quarrels
	  <lb/>with a white master because a poor negro receives a few
	  <lb/>rags less than the law provides? I apprehend that a per­
	  <lb/>son notorious for such gratuitous acts of kindness, would
	  <lb/>have little peace or safety, in any slave-holding country.</p>
        <p>If a negro be compelled to toil night and day, (as it is
	  <lb/>said they sometimes are,<anchor xml:id="a13" corresp="#n13" rend="pre(*)"/> at the season of sugar-making)
	  <lb/>who is to <emph>prove</emph> that he works more than his fourteen or
	  <lb/>fifteen hours? No slave can be a witness for himself, or
	  <lb/>for his fellow-slaves; and should a white man happen to
	  <lb/>know the fact, there are ninetynine chances out of a
	  <lb/>hundred, that he will deem it prudent to be silent. And
	  <lb/>here I would remark that even in the island of <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>,
	  <lb/>where the laws have given a most shocking license to
	  <lb/>cruelty, — even in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>, the slave is compelled to
	  <lb/>work but <emph>ten</emph> hours in the day, beside having many holi­
	  <lb/>days allowed him. In <placeName>Maryland</placeName>, <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, <placeName>Georgia</placeName>,
	  <lb/><placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>, and <placeName>New Jersey</placeName>, the <emph>convicts</emph> condemnded
	  <lb/>to hard labor in the penitentiaries, are required by law to
	  <lb/>toil only from <emph>eight</emph> to <emph>ten</emph> hours a day, according to the
	  <lb/>season of the year; yet the law providing that the inno­
	  <lb/>cent slave should labor but <emph>fourteen</emph> or <emph>fifteen</emph> hours a
	  <lb/>day, professes to have been made as a merciful ameliora­
	  <lb/>tion of his lot! — In <placeName>Rome</placeName>, the slaves had a yearly festival
	  <lb/>called the <name>Saturnalia</name>, during which they were released
	  <lb/>from toil, changed places with their masters, and indulg­
	  <lb/>ed in unbounded merriment; at first it lasted but one
	  <lb/>day; but its duration afterwards extended to two, three,

	  <lb/><placeName>Georgia</placeName>, there is a law which fobids any congregation
	  <lb/>or company of negroes to assemble themselves con­
	  <lb/>trary to the act regulating patrols. Every justice of the

        <p>These, and various similar regulations, are obviously

	  <lb/>This is a striking proof how closely <name>Christianity</name> and

        <p>A French planter of <placeName>St Domingo</placeName>, in a book which he

	  <lb/>rable to have negroes know enough of religion to make

	  <lb/>but he considers it very wrong to load their weak minds
	  <lb/>with a belief in supernatural dogmas, such as a belief
	  <lb/>in a future state. He says, <quote>such knowledge is apt
	    <lb/>to render them intractable, averse to labor, and induces
	    <lb/>them to commit suicide on themselves and their chil­

        <p>Our slave holders, in general, seem desirous to have
	  <lb/>the slave just religious enough to know that insurrec­
	  <lb/>tions and murder are contrary to the maxims of <name>Chris­
	  <lb/>tianity</name>; but it is very difficult to have them learn just
	  <lb/>so much as this, without learning more. In <placeName>Georgia</placeName>,
	  <lb/>I have been told, that a very general prejudice pre­
	  <lb/>vails against white missionaries. To avoid this dan­
	  <lb/>ger, old domestic slaves, who are better informed than
	  <lb/>the plantation slaves, are employed to hear sermons
	  <lb/>and repeat them to their brethren; and their repetitions
	  <lb/>are said to be strange samples of pulpit eloquence. One
	  <lb/>of these old negroes, as the story goes, told his hearers
	  <lb/>that the Bible said slaves ought to get their freedom;
	  <lb/>and if they could not do it in any other way, they must
	  <lb/>murder their masters. The slaves had never been al­
	  <lb/>lowed to learn to read, and of course they could not dis­

        <p>In <placeName>South Carolina</placeName>, the law is the same.</p>
        <p>The city of <placeName>Savannah</placeName>, in <placeName>Georgia</placeName>, a few years ago,

        <p>From these facts it is evident that legislative power

	  <lb/>but no matter — <quote>it is the jailer's duty to interrogate
	    <lb/>and whip, as aforesaid.</quote></p>
        <p>The last authorized edition of the laws of <placeName>Maryland</placeName>,
	  <lb/>comprises the following: <quote>If any slave be convicted of
	    <lb/>any petit treason, or murder, or wilully burning of
	    <lb/>dwelling houses, it may be lawful for the justices to give
	    <lb/>judgment against such slave to have the right hand cut
	    <lb/>off, to be hanged in the usual manner, the head severed
	    <lb/>from the body, the body divided into four quarters, and
	    <lb/>the head and quarters set up in the most public places of
	    <lb/>the county,</quote> &amp;c.</p>
        <p>The laws of <placeName>Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName>Missouri</placeName> are comparatively
	  <lb/>mild; yet in <placeName>Missouri</placeName> it is <emph>death</emph> to prepare or adminis­
	  <lb/>ter medicine without the master's consent, unless it can
	  <lb/>be <emph>proved</emph> that there was no evil intention. The law in
	  <lb/><placeName>Virginia</placeName> is similar; it requires proof that there was no
	  <lb/>evil intention, and that the medicine produced no bad
	  <lb/>consequences.</p>
        <p>To estimate fully the cruel injustice of these laws, it
	  <lb/>must be remembered that the poor slave is without reli­
	  <lb/>gious instruction, unable to read, too ignorant to com­
	  <lb/>prehend legislation, and holding so little communication
	  <lb/>with any person better informed than himself, that the
	  <lb/>chance is, he does not even know the <emph>existence</emph> of half the
	  <lb/>laws by which he suffers. This is worthy of <persName>Nero</persName>, who
	  <lb/>caused his edicts to be placed so high that they could
	  <lb/>not be read, and then beheaded his subjects for disobey­
	  <lb/>ing them.</p>

        <p>Free people of color, like the slaves, are excluded by

	  <lb/>to be a slave, till it can be proved otherwise; this rule
	  <lb/>prevails in all the slave States, except <placeName>North Carolina</placeName>,
	  <lb/>where it is confined to negroes. <persName>Stephens</persName> supposes this
	  <lb/>harsh doctrine to be peculiar to the <name>British Colonial
	    <lb/>Code</name>; but in this he is again mistaken — the <placeName>American
	    <lb/><emph>republics</emph></placeName> share the honor with <placeName>England</placeName>.</p>
        <p>A law passed in <date when="1822-12"><name>December</name>, 1822</date>, in <placeName>South Carolina</placeName>,
	  <lb/>provides that any free colored persons coming into port
	  <lb/>on board of any vessel shall be seized and imprisoned
	  <lb/>during the stay of the vessel; and when she is ready to
	  <lb/>depart, the captain shall take such free negroes and pay
	  <lb/>the expenses of their arrest and imprisonment; and in
	  <lb/>case of refusing so to do, he shall be indicted and fined
	  <lb/>not less than one thousand dollars, and imprisoned not
	  <lb/>less than two months; and such free negroes shall be
	  <lb/>sold for slaves. The <orgName>Circuit Court of the United States</orgName>,
	  <lb/>adjudged the law unconstitutional and void. Yet nearly
	  <lb/><emph>two years</emph> after this decision, four colored English sea­
	  <lb/>men were taken out of the brig <name>Marmion</name>. <placeName>England</placeName>
	  <lb/>made a formal complaint to our Government. <persName>Mr Wirt</persName>
	  <lb/>the Attorney General gave the opinion that the law was
	  <lb/>unconstitutional. This, as well as the above mentioned
	  <lb/>decision, excited strong indignation in <placeName>South Carolina</placeName>.
	  <lb/>Notwithstanding the decision, the law still remains in
	  <lb/>force, and other States have followed the example of
	  <lb/><placeName>South Carolina</placeName>, though with a more cautious observance
	  <lb/>of appearances.</p>
        <p>In <placeName>South Carolina</placeName>, if any free negro harbor, conceal,
	  <lb/>or entertain, any runaway slave, or a slave charged with
	  <lb/><emph>any</emph> criminal matter, he forfeits ten pounds for the first
	  <lb/>day, and twenty shillings for every succeeding day. In
	  <lb/>case of inability to pay, the free negro is sold at auction,
	  <lb/>and if any overplus remain, after the fines and attendant
	  <lb/>expenses are paid, it is put into the hands of the public
	  <lb/>treasurer.</p>
        <p>The free negro may entertain a slave without <emph>knowing</emph>
	  <lb/>that he has done anything wrong; but his declaration
	  <lb/>to that effect is of no avail. Where every effort is made
	  <lb/>to prevent colored people from obtaining any money, they
	  <lb/>are of course unable to pay the penalties imposed.</p>
        <p>If any omission is made in the forms of emancipation

	  <lb/>established by law, <emph>any person whatsoever</emph> may seize the
	  <lb/>negro so manumitted, and appropriate him to their own
	  <lb/>use.</p>
        <p>If a free colored person remain in <placeName>Virginia</placeName> twelve
	  <lb/>months after his manumission, he can be sold by the
	  <lb/>overseers of the poor for the benefit of the <emph>literary fund!</emph></p>
        <p>In <placeName>Georgia</placeName>, a free colored man, except a regular arti­
	  <lb/>cled seaman, is fined one hundred dollars for coming
	  <lb/>into the State; and if he cannot pay it, may be sold at
	  <lb/>public outcry. This act has been changed to one of in­
	  <lb/>creased severity. A free colored person cannot be a
	  <lb/>witness against a white man. They may therefore be
	  <lb/>robbed, assaulted, kidnapped and carried off with impu­
	  <lb/>nity; and even the legislatures of the old slave States
	  <lb/>adopt it as a maxim that it is very desirable to get rid of
	  <lb/>them. It is of no avail to <emph>declare</emph> themselves free; the 
	  <lb/>law <emph>presumes</emph> them to be slaves, unless they can <emph>prove</emph> to
	  <lb/>the contrary. In many instances written documents of
	  <lb/>freedom have been wrested from free colored people and
	  <lb/>destroyed by kidnappers. A lucrative internal slave
	  <lb/>trade furnishes constant temptation to the commission of
	  <lb/>such crimes; and the <emph>new</emph> States of <placeName>Alabama</placeName>, <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>,
	  <lb/><placeName>Missouri</placeName>, and the territories of <placeName>Arkansas</placeName>, and the <placeName>Flor­
	  <lb/>idas</placeName>, are not likely to be glutted for years to come.</p>
        <p>In <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, though remote from a slave market,
	  <lb/>it has been ascertained that <emph>more than thirty</emph> free per­
	  <lb/>sons of color, were stolen and carried off within <emph>two</emph>
	  <lb/>years. <persName>Stroud</persName> says: <quote>Five of these have been restored
	    <lb/>to their friends, by the interposition of humane gentle­
	    <lb/>men, though not without great expense and difficulty.
	    <lb/>The others are still in bondage; and if rescued at all, it
	    <lb/>must be by sending <emph>white</emph> witnesses a journey of more
	    <lb/>than a thousand miles.</quote></p>
        <p>I know the names of four colored citizens of <placeName>Massa­
	    <lb/>chusetts</placeName>, who went to <placeName>Georgia</placeName> on board a vessel, were
	  <lb/>seized under the laws of that State, and sold as slaves.
	  <lb/>They have sent the most earnest exhortations to their
	  <lb/>families and friends to do something for their relief;
	  <lb/>but the attendant expenses require more money than
	  <lb/>the friends of negroes are apt to have, and the poor fel­
	  <lb/>lows as yet remain unassisted.</p>

        <p>A <placeName>New York</placeName> paper, <date when="1829-11"><name>November</name>, 1829</date>, contains the
	  <lb/>following caution:</p>
        <p>
          <quote><emph>Beware of kidnappers!</emph> — It is <emph>well understood</emph> that
	    <lb/>there is at present in this city, a gang of kidnappers, bu­
	    <lb/>sily engaged in their vocation of stealing colored child­
	    <lb/>ren for the Southern market! It is believed that three
	    <lb/>or four have been stolen within as many days. A little
	    <lb/>negro boy came to this city from the country three or
	    <lb/>four days ago. Some strange white persons were very
	    <lb/>friendly to him, and yesterday morning he was mightily
	    <lb/>pleased that they had given him some new clothes. And
	    <lb/>the persons pretending thus to befriend him, entirely se­
	    <lb/>cured his confidence. This day he cannot be found. —
	    <lb/>Nor can he be traced since seen with one of his new
	    <lb/>friends yesterday. There are suspicions of a foul na­
	    <lb/>ture, connected with some who serve the police in sub­
	    <lb/>ordinate capacities. It is hinted that there may be
	    <lb/>those in some authority, not altogether ignorant of these
	    <lb/>diabolical practices. Let the public be on their guard!
	    <lb/>It is still fresh in the memories of all, that a cargo, or
	    <lb/>rather drove, of negroes was made up from this city and
	    <lb/><placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, about the time that the emancipation of
	    <lb/>all the negroes in this State took place under our present
	    <lb/>constitution, and were taken through <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, the <placeName>Car­
	      <lb/>olinas</placeName>, and <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>, and disposed of in the state of
	    <lb/><placeName>Mississippi</placeName>. Some of those who were taken from <placeName>Phil­
	    <lb/>adelphia</placeName> were persons of intelligence, and after they had
	    <lb/>been driven through the country in chains, and disposed
	    <lb/>of by sale on the <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>, wrote back to their friends,
	    <lb/>and were rescued from bondage. The persons who
	    <lb/>were guilty of this abominable transaction are known,
	    <lb/>and now reside in <placeName>North Carolina</placeName>; they may, very prob­
	    <lb/>bably, be engaged in similar enterprises at the present
	    <lb/>time — at least there is reason to believe that the system
	    <lb/>of kidnapping free persons of color from the Northern
	    <lb/>cities has been carried on more extensively than the
	    <lb/>public are generally aware of.</quote>
        </p>
        <p>This, and other evils of the system, admit of no radi­
	  <lb/>cal cure but the utter extinction of slavery. To enact
	  <lb/><emph>laws</emph> prohibiting the slave traffic, and at the same time

	  <lb/>tempt avarice by the allurements of an <emph>insatiable market</emph>,
	  <lb/>is irreconcilable and absurd.</p>
        <p>To my great surprise, I find that the free States of
	  <lb/><placeName>Ohio</placeName> and <placeName>Indiana</placeName> disgrace themselves by admitting the
	  <lb/>same maxim of law, which prevents any black or mu­
	  <lb/>latto from being witness against a white man!</p>
        <p>It is naturally supposed that free negroes will sympa­
	  <lb/>thize with their enslaves brethren, and that, notwith­
	  <lb/>standing all exertions to the contrary, they will become
	  <lb/>a little more intelligent; this excites a peculiar jealousy
	  <lb/>and hatred in the white population, of which it is im­
	  <lb/>possible to enumerate all the hardships. Even in the
	  <lb/><emph>laws</emph>, slaves are always mentioned before free people of
	  <lb/>color; so desirous are they to degrade the latter class
	  <lb/>below the level of the former. To complete the wrong,
	  <lb/>this unhappy class are despised in consequence of the
	  <lb/>very evils we ourselves have induced — for as slavery
	  <lb/>inevitably makes its victims servile and vicious, and as
	  <lb/>none but negroes are allowed to be slaves, we, from our
	  <lb/>very childhood, associate everything that is degraded
	  <lb/>with the <emph>mere color</emph>; though in fact the object of our
	  <lb/>contempt may be both exemplary and intelligent. In
	  <lb/>this way the <name>Africans</name> are doubly the victims of our in­
	  <lb/>justice; and thus does prejudice <quote><emph>make</emph> the meat it
	    <lb/>feeds on.</quote></p>
        <p>I have repeatedly said that our slave laws are contin­
	  <lb/>ually increasing in severity: as a proof of this I will
	  <lb/>give a brief view of some of the most <emph>striking</emph>, which
	  <lb/>have been passed since <persName>Stroud</persName> published his compendium
	  <lb/>of slave laws, in <date when="1827">1827</date>. In the first class are contained
	  <lb/>those enactments <emph>directly</emph> oppressive to people of color;
	  <lb/>in the second are those which injure them <emph>indirectly</emph>, by
	  <lb/>the penalties or disabilities imposed upon the whites,
	  <lb/>who instruct, assist, or employ them, or endeavor, in any
	  <lb/>way, to influence public opinion in their favor.</p>
        <p><label rend="slant(italic)">Class First</label>. — The <orgName>Legislature of Virginia</orgName> passed a
	  <lb/>law in <date when="1831">1831</date>, by which any free colored person who un­
	  <lb/>dertakes to preach, or conduct any religious meeting, by
	  <lb/>day or night, may be whipped not exceeding thirtynine
	  <lb/>lashes, at the discretion of <emph>any</emph> justice of the peace;
	  <lb/>and anybody may apprehend any such free colored per­

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">67</mw>
	  <lb/>son without a warrant. The same penalty, adjudged
	  <lb/>and executed in the same way, falls upon any slave, or
	  <lb/>free colored person, who attends such preaching; and
	  <lb/>any slave who listens to any <emph>white</emph> preacher, in the night
	  <lb/>time, receives the same punishment. The same law pre­
	  <lb/>vails in <placeName>Georgia</placeName>, and <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>. A master may permit
	  <lb/>a slave to preach on <emph>his</emph> plantation, to none but <emph>his</emph> slaves.</p>
        <p>There is a <mcr rend="slant(italic)">naiveté</mcr> in the following preamble to a law
	  <lb/>passed by <placeName>North Carolina</placeName>, in <date when="1831">1831</date>, which would be
	  <lb/>amusing, if the subject were not too serious for mirth:
	  <lb/><quote><emph>Whereas teaching slaves to read and write has a ten­
	      <lb/>dency to excite dissatisfaction in their minds,</emph> and to pro­
	    <lb/>duce insurrection and rebellion,</quote> therefore it is enacted
	  <lb/>that teaching a slave to read or write, or giving or sell­
	  <lb/>ing to a slave <emph>any</emph> book, or pamplet, shall be punished
	  <lb/>with thirtynine lashes, if the offender be a free black, or
	  <lb/>with imprisonment at the discretion of the court; if a
	  <lb/>slave, the <soCalled rend="slant(italic)">offence</soCalled> is punishable with thirtynine lashes, on
	  <lb/>his or her bare back, on conviction before a justice of
	  <lb/>the peace.</p>
        <p>In <placeName>Georgia</placeName>, any slave, or free person of color, is for a
	  <lb/>similar offence, fined or whipped, or fined <emph>and</emph> whipped
	  <lb/>at the discretion of the court.</p>
        <p>In <placeName>Louisiana</placeName>, twelve months' imprisonment is the pen­
	  <lb/>alty for teaching a slave to read or write.</p>
        <p>For publishing, or circulating, in the state of <placeName>North
	  <lb/>Carolina</placeName>, any pamphlet or paper having an <emph>evident ten­
	    <lb/>dency</emph> to excite slaves, or free persons of color, to insur­
	  <lb/>rection or resistance, imprisonment not less than one
	  <lb/>year, <emph>and</emph> standing in the pillory, <emph>and</emph> whipping, at the
	  <lb/>discretion of the court for the first offence; and death
	  <lb/>for the second. The same offence punished with death
	  <lb/>in <placeName>Georgia</placeName>, without any reservation. In <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>, the
	  <lb/>same as in <placeName>Georgia</placeName>. In <placeName>Louisiana</placeName>, the same offence
	  <lb/>punished either with imprisonment for life, or death, at
	  <lb/>the discretion of the court. In <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, the first offence
	  <lb/>of this sort is punished with thirtynine lashes, the second 
	  <lb/>with death.</p>
        <p>With regard to publications having a <soCalled rend="slant(italic)">tendency</soCalled> to pro­
	  <lb/>mote discontent among slaves, their masters are so very
	  <lb/>jealous, that it would be difficult to find <emph>any</emph> book, that
<pb n="068"/>

	  <lb/>would not come under their condemnation. The Bible,
	  <lb/>and the <title>Declaration of Independence</title> are certainly un­
	  <lb/>safe. The preamble to the <placeName>North Carolina</placeName> law
 declares<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">,</unclear>
	  <lb/>that the <emph>Alphabet</emph> has a tendency to excite dissatisfac­
	  <lb/>tion; I suppose it is because <mentioned rend="slant(italic)">freedom</mentioned> may be spelt out
	  <lb/>of it. A store keeper in <placeName>South Carolina</placeName> was nearly
	  <lb/>ruined by having unconsciously imported certain printed
	  <lb/><emph>handkerchiefs</emph>, which his neighbors deemed seditious. A
	  <lb/>friend of mine asked, <said>Did the handkerchiefs contain
	    <lb/>texts from scripture? or quotations from the <title>Constitution
	      <lb/>of the <placeName>United States</placeName></title>?</said></p>
        <p>Emancipated slaves must quit <placeName>North Carolina</placeName> in ninety
	  <lb/>days after their enfranchisement, on pain of being sold
	  <lb/>for life. Free persons of color who shall <emph>migrate into</emph>
	  <lb/>that State, may be seized and sold as runaway slaves;
	  <lb/>and if they <emph>migrate out</emph> of the State for more than ninety
	  <lb/>days, they can never return under the same penalty.</p>
        <p>This extraordinary use of the word <mentioned rend="slant(italic)">migrate</mentioned> furnishes
	  <lb/>a new battering ram against the free colored class, which
	  <lb/>is everywhere so odious to slave owners. A <emph>visit</emph> to rela­
	  <lb/>tions in another State may be called <soCalled rend="slant(italic)">migrating</soCalled>; being
	  <lb/>taken up and detained by <emph>kidnappers</emph>, over ninety days,
	  <lb/>may be called <soCalled rend="slant(italic)">migrating</soCalled>; — for where neither the evi­
	  <lb/>dence of the sufferer nor any of his own color is allowed,
	  <lb/>it will evidently amount to this.</p>
        <p>In <placeName>South Carolina</placeName>, if a free negro cross the line of the
	  <lb/>State, he can <emph>never</emph> return.</p>
        <p>In <date when="1831">1831</date>, <placeName>Mississippi</placeName> passed a law to expel all colored
	  <lb/>persons under sixty and over sixteen years of age from
	  <lb/>the State, within ninety days<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">,</unclear> unless they could prove
	  <lb/>good characters, and obtain from the court a certificate
	  <lb/>of the same, for which they paid three dollars; these
	  <lb/>certificates might be revoked at the discretion of the
	  <lb/>county courts. If such persons do not quit the State
	  <lb/>within the time specified, or if they return to it, they may
	  <lb/>be sold for a term not exceeding five years.</p>
        <p>In <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>, slaves are not allowed to be emancipa­
	  <lb/>ted unless they leave the State forthwith. Any free
	  <lb/>colored persons emigrating into this State, is fined from
	  <lb/>ten to fifty dollars, and hard labor in the penitentiary
	  <lb/>from one to two years.</p>
        <p><placeName>North Carolina</placeName> has made a law subjecting any vessel

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">69</mw>
	  <lb/>with <emph>free</emph> colored persons on board to thirty days quaran­
	  <lb/>tine; as if freedom were as bad as the cholera! Any person
	  <lb/>of color coming on shore from such vessels is seized and
	  <lb/>imprisoned, till the vessel departs; and the captain is fined
	  <lb/>five hundred dollars; and if he refuse to take the colored
	  <lb/>seaman away, and pay all the expenses of his imprison­
	  <lb/>ment, he is fined five hundred more. If the sailor do
	  <lb/>not depart within ten days after his captain's refusal, he
	  <lb/>must be whipped thirtynine lashes; and all colored per­
	  <lb/>sons, bond or free, who <emph>communicate</emph> with him, receive
	  <lb/>the same.</p>
        <p>In <placeName>Georgia</placeName>, there is a similar enactment. The pro­
	  <lb/>hibition is, in both States, confined to <emph>merchant</emph> vessels,
	  <lb/>(it would be imprudent to meddle with <emph>vessels of war</emph><unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">;</unclear>)
	  <lb/>and any colored person communicating with such sea­
	  <lb/>men is whipped not exceeding <emph>thirty</emph> lashes. If the cap­
	  <lb/>tain refuse to carry away seamen thus detained, and
	  <lb/><emph>pay the expenses of their imprisonment</emph>, he shall be fined
	  <lb/>five hundred dollars, and also imprisoned, not exceeding
	  <lb/>three months.</p>
        <p>These State laws are a direct violation of the Laws of
	  <lb/>Nations, and our treaties; and may involve the <placeName>United
	  <lb/>States</placeName> in a foreign war.</p>
        <p>Colored seamen are often employed in Spanish, Portu­
	  <lb/>guese, French, and English vessels. These nations are
	  <lb/>bound to know the <placeName>United States</placeName> Laws; but can they
	  <lb/>be expected to know the enactments of particular States
	  <lb/>and cities? and if they know them, are they bound to
	  <lb/>observe them, if they interfere with the established rules
	  <lb/>of nations? When <persName>Mr Wirt</persName> pronounced these laws un­
	  <lb/>constitutional, great excitement was produced in <placeName>South
	  <lb/>Carolina</placeName>. The Governor of that State in his Message to

	  <lb/>was the only remedy, if the laws of the Southern States

        <p>The upholders of slavery will in vain contend with the
	  <lb/>liberal spirit of the age; it is too strong for them. —
	  <lb/>They may as well try to bottle up the sunshine for their
	  <lb/>own exclusive use, as to attempt to keep knowledge
	  <lb/>and freedom to themselves. We all know that such an
	  <lb/>experiment would result in bottling up darkness for them­
	  <lb/>selves, while exactly the same amount of sunshine re­
	  <lb/>mained abroad for the use of their neighbors.</p>
        <p>In <placeName>North Carolina</placeName>, free negroes are whipped, fined,
	  <lb/>and imprisoned at the discretion of the court, for inter­
	  <lb/>marrying with slaves.</p>
        <p>In <placeName>Georgia</placeName>, free colored persons when unable to pay
	  <lb/><emph>any</emph> fine, may be sold for a space of time not exceeding
	  <lb/>five years. This limitation does not probably avail
	  <lb/>much; if sold to another master before the five years
	  <lb/>expired, they would never be likely to be free again.</p>
        <p>Several other laws have been passed in <placeName>Georgia</placeName>, pro­
	  <lb/>hibiting slaves from living apart from their master, either
	  <lb/>to labor for other persons, or to sell refreshments, or to
	  <lb/>carry on any trade or business although with their mas­
	  <lb/>ter's consent. Any person of color, bond or free, is
	  <lb/>forbidden to occupy any tenement except a <emph>kitchen</emph> or
	  <lb/>an <emph>outhouse</emph>, under penalty of from twenty to fifty lashes.
	  <lb/>Some of these laws are applicable only to particular
	  <lb/>cities, towns, or counties; others to several counties.</p>
        <p>Sundry general laws of a penal nature have been made
	  <lb/>more penal; and the number of offences, for which a
	  <lb/>colored person may suffer <emph>death</emph>, is increased.</p>
        <p>A law passed in <placeName>Tennessee</placeName>, in <date when="1831">1831</date>, provides that ne­
	  <lb/>groes for conspiracy to rebel, shall be punished with
	  <lb/>whipping, imprisonment and pillory, at the discretion of
	  <lb/>the court; it has this curious proviso — <quote>Householders

        <p>In <placeName>Georgia</placeName>, a similar offence is fined not exceeding

        <p>In <placeName>North Carolina</placeName>, if a white person teach a slave to

        <p>In <placeName>Louisiana</placeName>, any white person, who teaches a slave to

	  <lb/>having a <emph>tendency</emph> to promote discontent among free col­

	  <lb/>be imprisoned at hard labor, not less than three, nor
	  <lb/>more than twentyone years; or he may suffer death — at
	  <lb/>the discretion of the court.</p>
        <p>In <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>, a white man, who prints or circulates
	  <lb/>doctrines, sentiments, advice, or <emph>innuendoes</emph>, likely to pro­
	  <lb/>duce discontent among the colored class, is fined from
	  <lb/>one hundred to a thousand dollars, and imprisoned from
	  <lb/>three to twelve months.</p>
        <p>All the States which have pronounced an anathema
	  <lb/>against books and alphabets, have likewise forbidden
	  <lb/>that any colored man shall be employed in a printing
	  <lb/>office, under the penalty of ten dollars for every offence.</p>
        <p>In <placeName>Mississippi</placeName>, any white who employs, or receives a
	  <lb/>free colored person, without a certificate of freedom,
	  <lb/>written on parchment, forfeits <emph>one thousand dollars</emph>.</p>
        <p>If any master, in that State, allows his slaves to sell
	  <lb/>any wares or merchandiese out of the incorporated towns,
	  <lb/>he is liable to a fine of from fifty to five hundred dollars.</p>
        <p>In <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, any person who buys of a slave any arti­
	  <lb/>cle belonging to his master, forfeits from ten to fifty dol­
	  <lb/>lars; if the purchase be made on <name>Sunday</name>, ten dollars
	  <lb/>more are added to the fine for each article.</p>
        <p>This enactment is evidently made to prevent a slave
	  <lb/>from obtaining any money, or holding communication
	  <lb/>with freemen; a particular proviso is made against Sun­
	  <lb/>day, because the slave has usually more leisure on that
	  <lb/>day. It is to be remembered that all a slave has belongs

        <p>In travelling over this dreary desert, it is pleasant to

	  <lb/>slaves brought into that State for sale, shall forthwith be
	  <lb/>set free; but they must be sent out of the State.</p>
        <p>It is worthy of remark that <placeName>England</placeName> pursues a totally
	  <lb/>different course with regard to allowing slaves to com­
	  <lb/>municate with free people. Their recent laws are all
	  <lb/>calculated to make it easy for the slave to obtain a fair
	  <lb/>hearing from people who have no interest to suppress his
	  <lb/>complaints. He may go upon any plantation, and com­
	  <lb/>municate with any person; and whoever tries to prevent
	  <lb/>his going to a magistrate is guilty of a misdemeanor.</p>
        <p>They have abolished all distinction between white and
	  <lb/>colored witnesses.</p>
        <p>The law expressly stipulates the quality and quantity
	  <lb/>of provisions.</p>
        <p>Inquest is held upon the bodies of slaves dying sud­
	  <lb/>denly, or from any suspected violence.</p>
        <p>Use of the cart whip prohibited; and no female to be
	  <lb/>punished except by order of the court.</p>
        <p>Only fifteen lashes allowed as a punishment to men
	  <lb/>for one offence, and in one day; two kinds of punish­
	  <lb/>ment never allowed for one offence.</p>
        <p>When a slave is punished, two competent witnesses
	  <lb/>must be present.</p>
        <p>The owner is obliged to keep a record of domestic
	  <lb/>punishments and the causes.</p>

        <p>Marriages among slaves are encouraged, and husband
	  <lb/>and wife are not allowed to be sold separately. Children
	  <lb/>under sixteen years old cannot be separated from their
	  <lb/>parents.</p>
        <p>Masters illegally punishing their slaves, are subject to
	  <lb/>fine, imprisonment, and loss of the slave, for the first
	  <lb/>offence; for the second offence, sequestration of all their
	  <lb/>slaves.</p>
        <p>Free colored representatives are allowed to take their
	  <lb/>seat in the legislature, and share all the other privileges of
	  <lb/>British subjects.</p>
        <p>Yet these humane laws, so carefully framed in favor of
	  <lb/>the defenceless, have been found insufficient to protect
	  <lb/>the slave. Experience proves, what reason clearly points
	  <lb/>out, that the force of good laws must be weakened by the
	  <lb/>very nature of this unholy relation. Where there is
	  <lb/>knowledge and freedom on one side, and ignorance and
	  <lb/>servitude on the other, evasions and subterfuges will of
	  <lb/>course be frequent. Hence English philanthropists have
	  <lb/>universally come to the conclusion that nothing effectual
	  <lb/>can be done, unless slavery itself be destroyed.</p>
        <p>The limits of this work compel me to pass by many
	  <lb/>enactments in our slave-holding States, which would
	  <lb/>throw still more light on this dark subject.</p>
        <p>I have laid open some of the laws which do actually
	  <lb/>exist, and are constantly enforced in this free country;
	  <lb/>and knowing all this, and still more, to be true, I blush
	  <lb/>and hang my head, whenever I hear any one boast of our
	  <lb/><soCalled rend="pre(“)post(”)">glorious institutions.</soCalled></p>
        <p>The slave-holders insist that their <soCalled rend="slant(italic)">humanity</soCalled> is so
	  <lb/>great, as to render all their ferocious laws perfectly
	  <lb/>harmless. Are the laws then made on purpose to urge
	  <lb/>tender-hearted masters to be so much worse than they
	  <lb/>really desire to be? The <name>democrats</name> of the South appear
	  <lb/>to be less scrupulous about the liberties of others, than

        <p>It is utter nonsense to say that generosity of disposi­
	  <lb/>tion is a protection against tyranny, where all the power
	  <lb/>is on one side. It may be, and it no doubt is so, in
	  <lb/>particular instances; but they must be exceptions to the
	  <lb/>general rule.</p>
        <p>We all know that the Southerners have a high sense of
	  <lb/>what the world calls honor, and that they are brave, hos­
	  <lb/>pitable, and generous to people of their own color; but
	  <lb/>the more we respect their virtues, the more cause is
	  <lb/>there to lament the demoralizing <emph>system</emph>, which produces
	  <lb/>such unhappy effects on all who come within its baneful
	  <lb/>influence. Most of them may be as kind as can be ex­
	  <lb/>pected of human nature, endowed with almost unlimited
	  <lb/>power to do wrong; and some of them may be even
	  <lb/>more benevolent than the warmest friend of the negro
	  <lb/>would dare to hope; but while we admit all this, we
	  <lb/>must not forget that there is in every community a class
	  <lb/>of men, who will not be any better than the laws compel
	  <lb/>them to be.</p>

	    <lb/>and even tortures. This is no picture of the imagina­

        <p>When the slave owners talk of their gentleness and
	  <lb/>compassion, they are witnesses in their own favor, and
	  <lb/>have strong motives for showing the fairest side. But
	  <lb/>what do the laws themselves imply? Are enactments
	  <lb/>ever made against exigencies which do not exist? If
	  <lb/>negroes have never been scalded, burned, mutilated, &amp;c.
	  <lb/>why are such crimes forbidden by an express law, with
	  <lb/>the marvellous proviso, except said slave <emph>die</emph> of <quote><soCalled rend="slant(italic)">moderate</soCalled><lb/>punishment</quote>? If a law sanctioning whipping to any
	  <lb/>extent, incarceration at the discretion of the master, and
	  <lb/>the body loaded with irons, is called a <soCalled rend="slant(italic)">restraining</soCalled> law,
	  <lb/>let me ask what crimes must have been committed, to
	  <lb/>require <emph>prohibition</emph>, where so much is <emph>allowed</emph>? The
	  <lb/>law, which declares that slaves shall be compelled to
	  <lb/>labor <emph>only</emph> fourteen or fifteen hours a day, has the follow­
	  <lb/>ing preamble: <quote>Whereas <emph>many</emph> owners of slaves, man­
	    <lb/>agers, &amp;c. <emph>do</emph> confine them so closely to hard labor that
	    <lb/>they have not sufficient time for natural rest,</quote> &amp;c. <persName>Mr
	  <lb/>Pinckney</persName>, in a public argument, speaking of slaves mur­
	  <lb/>dered by severe treatment, says: <quote>The <emph>frequency</emph> of the
	    <lb/>crime is no doubt owing to the nature of the punishment.</quote>
	  <lb/>The reader will observe that I carefully refrain from
	  <lb/>quoting the representations of party spirit, and refer to
	  <lb/><emph>facts</emph> only for evidence.</p>
        <p>Where the laws are made by the people, a majority of
	  <lb/>course approve them; else they would soon be changed.
	  <lb/>It must therefore in candor be admitted, that the <emph>laws</emph>
	  <lb/>of a State speak the prevailing <emph>sentiments</emph> of the inhabi­
	  <lb/>tants.</p>
        <p>Judging by this rule, what inference must be drawn
	  <lb/>from the facts stated above? <quote>At <placeName>Sparta</placeName>, the freeman
	    <lb/>is the freest of all men, and the slave is the greatest of
	    <lb/>slaves.</quote></p>
        <p>Our republic is a perfect <persName>Pandora's</persName> box to the negro,
	  <lb/>only there is no <emph>hope</emph> at the bottom. The wretchedness
	  <lb/>of his fate is not a little increased by being a constant
	  <lb/>witness of the unbounded freedom enjoyed by others:
	  <lb/>the slave's labor must necessarily be like the labor of
	  <lb/><persName>Sisiphus</persName>; and here the torments of <persName>Tantalus</persName> are added.</p>
        <p>Slavery is so inconsistent with free institutions, and
	  <lb/>the spirit of liberty is so contagious under such institu­

	  <lb/>tions, that the system must either be given up, or sus­
	  <lb/>tained by laws outrageously severe; hence we find that
	  <lb/>our slave laws have each year been growing more harsh
	  <lb/>than those of any other nation.</p>
        <p>Shall I be told that all these regulations are necessary
	  <lb/>for the white man's safety? What then, let me indig­
	  <lb/>nantly ask, what must the system be that <emph>requires</emph> to be
	  <lb/>supported by such unnatural, such tyrannical means! The
	  <lb/>very apology pronounces the condemnation of slavery —
	  <lb/>for it proves that it cannot exist without producing
	  <lb/>boundless misery to the oppressed, and perpetual terror
	  <lb/>to the oppressor.</p>
        <p>In our <date when="--07-04">fourth of <name>July</name></date> orations, we are much in the
	  <lb/>habit of talking about the tyranny of <placeName>England</placeName>! and there
	  <lb/>is no doubt that broad and deep stains do rest upon her
	  <lb/>history. But there is a vulgar proverb that <quote>those who
	    <lb/>live in glass houses should not throw stones.</quote> In judg­
	  <lb/>ing of national, as well as individual wrong, it is fair to
	  <lb/>consider the amount of temptation. <placeName>England</placeName> has had
	  <lb/>power, more extensive and permanent than any nation
	  <lb/>since the decline of <placeName>Rome</placeName>: the negroes and the <name>Indians</name>
	  <lb/>are the only people who have been dependent on <emph>our</emph> jus­
	  <lb/>tice and generosity — and how have we treated <emph>them</emph>?</p>
        <p>It is a favorite argument that we are not to blame for
	  <lb/>slavery, because the <name>British</name> engrafted it upon us, while
	  <lb/>we were colonies. But did we not take the liberty to
	  <lb/><emph>change</emph> English laws and customs, when they did not
	  <lb/>suit us? Why not put away <emph>this</emph>, as well as other evils of
	  <lb/>much less consequence? It could have been done easily,
	  <lb/>at the time of our confederation; it <emph>can</emph> be done now. —
	  <lb/>Have not other nations been making alterations for the
	  <lb/>better, on this very subject, since we became indepen­
	  <lb/>dent? Is not <placeName>England</placeName> trying with all her might to atone
	  <lb/>for the wrong she has done? Does not the <title>constitution of
	  <lb/>the <placeName>United States</placeName></title>, and the constitution of each individual
	  <lb/>State, make provision for such changes as shall tend to
	  <lb/>the public good?</p>
        <p>The plain truth is, the continuation of this system is a
	  <lb/>sin; and the sin rests upon us: It has been eloquently
	  <lb/>said that <quote>by this excuse, we try to throw the blame upon

	  <lb/>them last three times as long. The free man will be
	  <lb/>honest for reputation's sake; but reputation will make
	  <lb/>the slave none the richer, nor invest him with any of the
	  <lb/>privileges of a human being — while his poverty and
	  <lb/>sense of wrong both urge him to steal from his master.
	  <lb/>A salary must be paid to an overseer to compel the slave
	  <lb/>to work; the free man is impelled by the desire of in­
	  <lb/>creasing the comforts of himself and family. Two hired
	  <lb/>laborers will perform as much work as three slaves; by
	  <lb/>some it is supposed to be a more correct estimate that
	  <lb/>slaves perform only <emph>half</emph> as much labor as the same num­
	  <lb/>ber of free laborers. Finally, <emph>where</emph> slaves are employed,
	  <lb/>manual industry is a degradation to white people, and
	  <lb/>indolence becomes the prevailing characteristic.</p>
        <p>Slave owners have indeed frequently shown great
	  <lb/>adroitness in defending this bad system; but, with few
	  <lb/>exceptions, they base their arguments upon the necessity
	  <lb/>of continuing slavery because it is already begun. Many
	  <lb/>of them have openly acknowledged that it was highly
	  <lb/>injurious to the prosperity of the State.</p>
        <p>The Hon. <persName>Henry Clay</persName>, in his address before the <orgName>Coloni­
	    <lb/>zation Society of <placeName>Kentucky</placeName></orgName>, has given a view of the causes
	  <lb/>affecting, and likely to affect, slavery in this country,
	  <lb/>which is very remarkable for its completeness, its dis­
	  <lb/>tinctness, and its brevity. The following sentences are
	  <lb/>quoted from this address: <quote xml:id="q007" rend="post()" next="#q008">As a mere laborer, the slave
	    <lb/>feels that he toils for his master, and not for himself;
	    <lb/>that the laws do not recognize his capacity to acquire
	    <lb/>and hold property, which depends altogether upon the
	    <lb/>pleasure of his proprietor, and that all the fruits of his ex­
	    <lb/>ertions are reaped by others. He knows that, whether
	    <lb/>sick or well, in times of scarcity or abundance, his master
	    <lb/>is bound to provide for him by the all powerful influence
	    <lb/>of self-interest. He is generally, therefore, indifferent to
	    <lb/>the adverse or prosperous fortunes of his master, being
	    <lb/>contented if he can escape his displeasure or chastisement,

	  <lb/>South suffered in consequence of <emph>slavery</emph>; he maintained
	  <lb/>that the slave holding States were prosperous, and the
	  <lb/>principal cause of all the prosperity in the <name>Union</name>. He
	  <lb/>laughed at the idea of any danger, however distant, from
	  <lb/>an overgrown slave population, and supported the posi­
	  <lb/>tion by the fact that slaves had always been kept  in
	  <lb/>entire subjection in the <placeName>British West Indies</placeName>, where the
	  <lb/>white population is less than ten per cent of the whole.

	  <lb/>Yet such is the fact. This system is so closely entwined

	  <lb/>ed it. There is genuine wisdom in the following remark,
	  <lb/>extracted from the petition of <orgName>Cambridge University</orgName> to
	  <lb/>the <orgName>Parliament of England</orgName>, on the subject of slavery: <quote>A
	    <lb/>firm belief in the Providence of a benevolent Creator as­
	    <lb/>sures us that no system, founded on the oppression of
	    <lb/>one part of mankind, <emph>can</emph> be beneficial to another.</quote></p>
        <p>But the tolerator of slavery will say, <said>No doubt the
	    <lb/>system is evil; but we are not to blame for it; we re­
	    <lb/>ceived it from our English ancestors. It is a lamentable
	    <lb/><emph>necessity</emph>; we cannot do it away if we would; — insur­
	    <lb/>rections would be the inevitable result of any attempt to
	    <lb/>remove it</said> — and having quieted their consciences by
	  <lb/>the use of the word <mentioned rend="slant(italic)">lamentable</mentioned>, they think no more upon
	  <lb/>the subject</p>
        <p>These assertions have been so often, and so dogmati­
	  <lb/>cally repeated, that many truly kind-hearted people have
	  <lb/>believed there was some truth in them. I myself, (may
	  <lb/>God forgive me for it!) have often, in thoughtless igno­
	  <lb/>rance, made the same remarks.</p>
        <p>An impartial and careful examination has led me to
	  <lb/>the conviction that slavery causes insurrections, while
	  <lb/>emancipation prevents them.</p>
        <p>The grand argument of the slave holder is that sudden
	  <lb/>freedom occasioned the horible massacres of <placeName>St Domin­
	  <lb/>go</placeName>. — If a word is said in favor of abolition, he shakes
	  <lb/>his head, and points a warning finger to <placeName>St Domingo</placeName>!
	  <lb/>But it is a remarkable fact that this same vilified island
	  <lb/>furnishes a strong argument <emph>against</emph> the lamentable ne­
	  <lb/>cessity of slavery. In the first place, there was a bloody
	  <lb/>civil war there before the act of emancipation was passed;
	  <lb/>in the second place enfranchisement produced the most
	  <lb/>blessed effects; in the third place, no difficulties whatev­
	  <lb/>er arose, until <persName>Bonaparte</persName> made his atrocious attempt <emph>to

        <p><persName>Colonel Malenfant</persName>, a slave proprietor, resident in <placeName>St

        <p><quote>After this public act of emancipation, the negroes re­

	    <lb/>where no white men w<choice><sic>h</sic><corr/></choice>ere left to direct them, they be­
	    <lb/>took themselves to the planting of provisions; but upon
	    <lb/>all the plantations where the whites resided, the blacks
	    <lb/>continued to labor as quietly as before.</quote> <persName>Colonel Ma­

        <p>He adds, <quote>If you will take care not to talk to them

	    <lb/>dom, you may with this word chain them down to their

	    <lb/>they will all reply that not a single negro upon that plan­

	    <lb/>laborers, refused to work: and yet this plantation was
	    <lb/>thought to be under the worst discipline and the slaves
	    <lb/>the most idle of any in the plain. I inspired the same

	  <lb/>The prices of slaves were settled by the magistrates,

	  <lb/>stipulated wages, until the debt was paid. If the slave
	  <lb/>wished to change masters he could do so, if another per­

	  <lb/>exhange for his labor; and provided the master was se­
	  <lb/>cured against loss, he was obliged to consent to the trans­
	  <lb/>action. Similar transfers might take place to accommo­
	  <lb/>date the master, but never without the consent of the
	  <lb/>servant. The law regulated the allowance of provis­
	  <lb/>ions, clothing, &amp;c., and if the negro wished for more,
	  <lb/>he might have it charged, and deducted from his wages;
	  <lb/>but lest masters should take advantage of the improvi­
	  <lb/>dence of their servants, it was enacted, that all charges
	  <lb/>exceeding half the earnings of any slave, or family of
	  <lb/>slaves, should be void in law. The duties of servants
	  <lb/>were defined as clearly as possible by the laws, and
	  <lb/>magistrates appointed to enforce them; but the master
	  <lb/>was entrusted with no power to punish, in any manner
	  <lb/>whatever. It was expressly required that the masters

	  <lb/>— and above all, the evident union of purpose existing
	  <lb/>between the French and English cabinets, — I can most
	  <lb/>plainly see the hand of God working for the deliverance
	  <lb/>of the negroes. We may resist the blessed influence, if
	  <lb/>we will; but we cannot conquer. Every year the plot
	  <lb/>is thickening around us, and the nations of the earth,
	  <lb/>either consciously or unconsciously, are hastening the
	  <lb/>crisis. The defenders of the slave system are situated
	  <lb/>like the man in the Iron Shroud, the walls of whose
	  <lb/>prison daily moved nearer and nearer, by means of pow­
	  <lb/>werful machinery, until they crushed all that remained
	  <lb/>within them.</p>
        <p>But to return to the subject of emancipation. Nearly
	  <lb/>every one of the States north of <name>Mason and Dixon's line</name>
	  <lb/>once held slaves. These slaves were manumitted with­
	  <lb/>out bloodshed, and there was no trouble in making free
	  <lb/>colored laborers obey the laws.</p>
        <p>I am aware that this desirable change must be attend­
	  <lb/>ed with much more difficulty in the Southern States,
	  <lb/>simply because the evil has been suffered until it is
	  <lb/>fearfully overgrown; but it must not be forgotten that
	  <lb/>while they are using their ingenuity and strength to sus­
	  <lb/>tain it for the present, the mischief is increasing more
	  <lb/>and more rapidly. If this be not a good time to apply
	  <lb/>a remedy, when will be a better? They must annihi­
	  <lb/>late slavery, or slavery will annihilate them.</p>
        <p>It seems to be forgotten that emancipation from
	  <lb/>tyranny is not an emancipation from law; the negro,
	  <lb/>after he is made free, is restrained from the commission
	  <lb/>of crimes by the same laws which restrain other citi­
	  <lb/>zens: if he steals, he will be imprisoned: if he commits
	  <lb/>murder, he will be hung.</p>
        <p>It will, perhaps, be said that the free people of color in
	  <lb/>the slave portions of <emph>this</emph> country are peculiarly ignorant,
	  <lb/>idle, and vicious? It may be so; for our laws and our
	  <lb/>influence are peculiarly calculated to make them bad
	  <lb/>members of society. But we trust the civil power to
	  <lb/>keep in order the great mass of ignorant and vicious for­
	  <lb/>eigners continually pouring into the country; and if the
	  <lb/>laws are strong enough for this, may they not be trusted
	  <lb/>to restrain the free blacks?</p>

        <p>In those countries where the slave codes are mild,
	  <lb/>where emancipation is rendered easy, and inducements
	  <lb/>are offered to industry, insurrections are not feared, and
	  <lb/>free people of color form a valuable portion of the com­
	  <lb/>munity. If we persist in acting in opposition to the es­
	  <lb/>tablished laws of nature and reason, how can we expect 
	  <lb/>favorable results? But it is pronounced <soCalled rend="slant(italic)">unsafe</soCalled> to
	  <lb/>change our policy. Every progressive improvement in
	  <lb/>the world has been resisted by despotism, on the ground
	  <lb/>that changes were dangerous. The Emperor of <placeName>Austria</placeName>
	  <lb/>thinks there is need of keeping his subjects ignorant,
	  <lb/>that good order may be preserved. But what he calls
	  <lb/>good order, is sacrificing the happiness of many to the
	  <lb/>advancement of a few; and no doubt knowledge <emph>is</emph> un­
	  <lb/>favorable to the continuation of such a state of things.
	  <lb/>It is precisely so with the slave holder; he insists that
	  <lb/>the welfare of millions must be subordinate to his private
	  <lb/>interest, or else all good order is destroyed.</p>
        <p>It is much to be regretted that <persName>Washington</persName> enfran­
	  <lb/>chised his slaves in the manner he did; because their
	  <lb/>poverty and indolence have furnished an ever ready ar­
	  <lb/>gument for those who are opposed to emancipation.<anchor xml:id="a27" corresp="#n27" rend="pre(*)"/>
	  <lb/>To turn slaves adrift in their old age, unaccustomed to
	  <lb/>take care of themselves, without employment, and in a
	  <lb/>community where all the prejudices were strongly ar­

	  <lb/>experiment.</p>
        <p>But if slaves were allowed to redeem themselves pro­

	  <lb/>industry would be gradually formed, and enterprise

	  <lb/>purpose of proving by experiment the safety and good
	  <lb/>policy of conferring freedom.<anchor xml:id="a28" corresp="#n28" rend="pre(*)"/> Being afraid to trust the
	  <lb/>agents generally employed in the colony, he engaged a

	    <lb/>ette's</persName> plans and wishes, sailed for <placeName>Cayenne</placeName>. The first
	  <lb/>thing he did when he arrived, was to collect all the cart-
	  <lb/>whips, and other instruments of punishment, and have
	  <lb/>them burnt amid a general assemblage of the slaves; he
	  <lb/>then made known to them the laws and rules by which
	  <lb/>the estates would be governed. The object of all the
	  <lb/>regulations was to encourage industry by making it the
	  <lb/>means of freedom. This new kind of stimulus had a
	  <lb/>most favorable effect on the slaves, and gave promise of
	  <lb/>complete success. But the judicious agent died in con­
	  <lb/>sequence of the climate, and the <name>French Revolution</name>
	  <lb/>threw everything into a state of convulsion at home and
	  <lb/>abroad. The new republic of <placeName>France</placeName> bestowed uncon­
	  <lb/>ditional emancipation upon the slaves in her colonies;
	  <lb/>and had she persevered in her promises with good faith
	  <lb/>and discretion, the horrors of <placeName>St Domingo</placeName> might have
	  <lb/>been spared. The emancipated negroes in <placeName>Cayenne</placeName>
	  <lb/>came in a body to the agents, and declared that if the
	  <lb/>plantations still belonged to <persName>General La Fayette</persName> they were
	  <lb/>ready and willing to resume their labors for the benefit of

	  <lb/>one who had treated them like men, and cheered their
	  <lb/>toil by making it a certain means of freedom.</p>
        <p>I cannot forbear paying a tribute of respect to the
	  <lb/>venerable <persName>Moses Brown</persName>, of <placeName>Providence</placeName>, <placeName>Rhode Island</placeName>,
	  <lb/>now living in virtuous and vigorous old age. He was a
	  <lb/>slave owner in early life, and, unless I have been misin­
	  <lb/>formed, a slave dealer, likewise. When his attention
	  <lb/>became roused to religious subjects, these facts troubled
	  <lb/>his conscience. He easily and promptly decided that a
	  <lb/><name>Christian</name> could not consistently keep slaves; but he did
	  <lb/>not dare to trust his own nature to determine the best
	  <lb/>manner of doing justice to those he had wronged. He
	  <lb/>therefore appointed a committee, before whom he laid a
	  <lb/>statement of the expenses he had incurred for the food
	  <lb/>and clothing of his slaves, and the number of years,
	  <lb/>during which he had had the exclusive benefit of their
	  <lb/>labors. He conceived that he had no right to charge 
	  <lb/>them for their freedom, because God had given them an
	  <lb/>unalienable right to that possession, from the very hour
	  <lb/>of their birth; but he wished the committee to decide
	  <lb/>what wages he ought to pay them for the work they had
	  <lb/>done. He cordially accepted the decision of the com­
	  <lb/>mittee, paid the negroes their dues, and left them to
	  <lb/>choose such employments as they thought best. Many
	  <lb/>of the grateful slaves preferred to remain with him as
	  <lb/>hired laborers. It is hardly necessary to add that <persName>Moses
	    <lb/>Brown</persName> is a <name>Quaker</name>.</p>
        <p>It is commonly urged against emancipation that white
	  <lb/>men cannot possibly labor under the sultry climate of our
	  <lb/>most southerly States. This is a good reason for not
	  <lb/>sending the slaves out of the country, but it is no argu­
	  <lb/>ment against making them free. No doubt we do need
	  <lb/>their labor; but we ought to pay for it. Why should
	  <lb/>their presence be any more disagreeable as hired labor­
	  <lb/>ers, than as slaves? In <placeName>Boston</placeName>, we continually meet
	  <lb/>colored people in the streets, and employ them in vari­
	  <lb/>ous ways, without being endangered, or even incom­
	  <lb/>moded. There is no moral impossibility in a perfectly
	  <lb/>kind and just relation between the two races.</p>
        <p>If white men think otherwise, let <emph>them</emph> remove from
	  <lb/>climates which nature has made too hot for their consti­

	  <lb/>tutions. Wealth or pleasure often induces men to
	  <lb/>change their abode; and emigration for the sake of hu­
	  <lb/>manity would be an agreeable novelty. <persName>Algernon Sid­
	    <lb/>ney</persName>, said <quote>When I cannot live in my own country, but
	    <lb/>by such means as are worse than dying in it, I think
	    <lb/>God shows me that I ought to keep myself out of it.</quote></p>
        <p>But the slave holders try to stop all the efforts of be­
	  <lb/>nevolence, by vociferous complaints about infringing
	  <lb/>upon their <soCalled rend="slant(italic)">property</soCalled>; and justice is so subordinate to self-
	  <lb/>interest, that the unrighteous claim is silently allowed,
	  <lb/>and even openly supported, by those who ought to blush
	  <lb/>for themselves, as <name>Christians</name>, and as republicans. Let
	  <lb/>men <emph>simplify</emph> their arguments — let them confine them­
	  <lb/>selves to one single question, <quote>What right can a man
	    <lb/>have to compel his neighbor to toil without reward, and
	    <lb/>leave the same hopeless inheritance to his children, in
	    <lb/>order that <emph>he</emph> may live in luxury and indolence?</quote> Let
	  <lb/>the doctrines of <emph>expediency</emph> return to the Father of Lies,
	  <lb/>who invented them, and gave them power to turn every
	  <lb/>way for evil. The <name>Christian</name> knows no appeal from the
	  <lb/>decisions of God, plainly uttered in his conscience.</p>
        <p>The laws of <placeName>Venice</placeName> allowed <emph>property</emph> in human be­
	  <lb/>ings; and upon this ground <persName>Shylock</persName> demanded his
	  <lb/>pound of flesh, cut nearest to the heart. Those who
	  <lb/>advertise mothers to be sold separately from their child­
	  <lb/>ren, likewise claim a right to human flesh; and they
	  <lb/>too cut it nearest to the <emph>heart</emph>.</p>
        <p>The personal liberty of one man can never be the
	  <lb/>property of another. All ideas of property are founded
	  <lb/>upon the mutual agreement of the human race, and are
	  <lb/>regulated by such laws as are deemed most conducive to
	  <lb/>the general good. In slavery there is no <emph>mutual</emph> agree­
	  <lb/>ment; for in that case it would not be slavery. The
	  <lb/>negro has no voice in the matter — no alternative is pre­
	  <lb/>sented to him — no bargain is made. The beginning of
	  <lb/>his bondage is the triumph of power over weakness; its
	  <lb/>continuation is the tyranny of knowledge over ignor­
	  <lb/>ance. One man may as well claim an exclusive right to
	  <lb/>the air another man breathes, as to the possession of his
	  <lb/>limbs and faculties. Personal freedom is the birthright
	  <lb/>of every human being. God himself made it the first

	  <lb/>great law of creation; and no human enactment can
	  <lb/>render it null and void. <quote>If,</quote> says <persName>Price</persName>, <quote>you have a
	    <lb/>right to make another man a slave, he has a right to
	    <lb/>make you a slave;</quote> and <persName>Ramsay</persName> says, <quote>If we have in
	    <lb/>the beginning no right to sell a man, no person has a
	    <lb/>right to buy him.</quote></p>
        <p>Am I reminded that the <emph>laws</emph> acknowledge these
	  <lb/>vested rights in human flesh? I answer, the laws them­
	  <lb/>selves were made by individuals, who wished to justify
	  <lb/>this wrong and profit by it. We ought never to have
	  <lb/>recognised a claim, which cannot exist according to the
	  <lb/>laws of God; it is our duty to atone for the error; and
	  <lb/>the sooner we make a beginning, the better will it be for
	  <lb/>us all. Must our arguments be based upon justice
	  <lb/>and mercy to the slave holders <emph>only</emph>? Have the negroes
	  <lb/>the right to ask compensation for their years and years of
	  <lb/>unrewarded toil? It is true that they have food and cloth­
	  <lb/>ing, of such kind, and in such quantities, as their mas­
	  <lb/>ters think proper. But it is evident that this is not the
	  <lb/>worth of their labor; for the proprietors can give from
	  <lb/>one hundred to five and six hundred dollars for a slave,
	  <lb/>beside the expense of supporting those who are too old or
	  <lb/>too young to labor. They could not <emph>afford</emph> to do this, if
	  <lb/>the slave did not earn more than he receives in food and
	  <lb/>clothing. If the laws allowed the slave to redeem him­
	  <lb/>self progressively, the owner would receive his money
	  <lb/>back again; and the negro's years of uncompensated
	  <lb/>toil would be more than lawful interest.</p>
        <p>The southerners are much in the habit of saying they
	  <lb/>really <emph>wish</emph> for emancipation, if it could be effected in
	  <lb/>safety; but I search in vain for any proof that these as­
	  <lb/>sertions are sincere. (When I say this, I speak collec­
	  <lb/>tively; there are, no doubt, individual exceptions.)</p>
        <p>Instead of profiting by the experience of other nations,
	  <lb/>the slave oweners, as a body, have resolutely shut their
	  <lb/>eyes against the light, because they preferred darkness.
	  <lb/>Every change in the laws has rivetted the chain closer
	  <lb/>and closer upon their victims; every attempt to make the
	  <lb/>voice of reason and benevolence heard has been overpow­
	  <lb/>ered with threatening and abuse. A cautious vigilance
	  <lb/>against improvement, a keen-eyed jealousy of all freedom
<pb n="105"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="9(5)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">105</mw>
	  <lb/>of opinion, has characterized their movements. There
	  <lb/><emph>can</emph> be no doubt that the <emph>majority</emph> wish to perpetuate
	  <lb/>slavery. They support it with loud bravado, or insidi­
	  <lb/>ous sophistry, or pretended regret; but they never
	  <lb/>abandon the point. Their great desire is to keep the
	  <lb/>public mind turned in another direction. They are well
	  <lb/>aware that the ugly edifice is built of rotten timbers, and
	  <lb/>stands on slippery sands — if the loud voice of public
	  <lb/>opinion could be made to reverberate through its dreary
	  <lb/>chambers, the unsightly frame would fall, never to rise
	  <lb/>again.</p>
        <p>Since so many of their own citizens admit that the
	  <lb/>policy of this system is unsound, and its effects injurious,
	  <lb/>it is wonderful that they do not begin to destroy the
	  <lb/><quote>costly iniquity</quote> in good earnest. But long continued
	  <lb/>habit is very powerful; and in the habit of slavery are
	  <lb/>concentrated the strongest evils of human nature —
	  <lb/>vanity, pride, love of power, licentiousness, and indolence.</p>
        <p>There is a minority, particularly in <placeName>Virginia</placeName> and <placeName>Ken­
	    <lb/>tucky</placeName>, who sincerely wish a change for the better; but
	  <lb/>they are overpowered, and have not even ventured to
	  <lb/>speak, except in the great <placeName>Virginia</placeName> debate of <date when="1832">1832</date>. In
	  <lb/>the course of that debate the spirit of slavery showed itself
	  <lb/>without disguise. The members <emph>talked</emph> of emancipation;
	  <lb/>but with one or two exceptions, they merely wanted to
	  <lb/>emancipate or rather to send away, the <emph>surplus</emph> popula­
	  <lb/>tion, which they could neither keep nor sell, and which
	  <lb/>might prove dangerous. They wished to get rid of the
	  <lb/>consequences of the evil, but were determined to keep
	  <lb/>the evil itself. Some members from Western <placeName>Virginia</placeName>,
	  <lb/>who spoke in a better spirit, and founded their argu­
	  <lb/>ments on the broad principles of justice, not on the mere
	  <lb/>convenience of a certain class, were repelled with angry
	  <lb/>excitement. The eastern districts threatened to sepa­
	  <lb/>rate from the western, if the latter persisted in express­
	  <lb/>ing opinions opposed to the continuance of slavery.
	  <lb/>From what I have uniformly heard of the comparative
	  <lb/>prosperity of Eastern and Western <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, I should
	  <lb/>think this was very much like the town's poor threaten­
	  <lb/>ing to separate from the town.</p>
        <p>The mere circumstance of daring to debate on the
<pb n="106"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="9(5)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">106</mw>
	  <lb/>subject was loudly reprimanded; and there was a good
	  <lb/>deal of indignation expressed that <quote>reckless editors, and
	    <lb/>imprudent correspondents, had presumed so far as to al­
	    <lb/>lude to it in the columns of a newspaper.</quote> Discussion in
	  <lb/>the Legislature was strongly deprecated until a plan had
	  <lb/>been formed; yet they must have known that no plan
	  <lb/>could be formed, in a republican government, without
	  <lb/>previous discussion. The proposal contained within
	  <lb/>itself that self-perpetuating power, for which the schemes
	  <lb/>of slave oweners are so remarkable.</p>
        <p><persName>Mr Gholson</persName> sarcastically rebuked the restless spirit of
	  <lb/>improvement, by saying <quote>he really had been under the
	    <lb/><emph>impression</emph> that he <emph>owned</emph> his slaves. He had lately pur­
	    <lb/>chased four women and ten children, in whom he
	    <lb/>thought he had obtained a great bargain; for he sup­
	    <lb/>posed they were his own property, <emph>as were his brood
	      <lb/>mares</emph>.</quote> To which <persName>Mr Roane</persName> replied, <quote>I own a con­
	    <lb/>siderable number of slaves, and am perfectly sure they
	    <lb/>are mine; and I am sorry to add that I have occasion­
	    <lb/>ally, though not often, been compelled to make <emph>them</emph> feel
	    <lb/>the <emph>impression</emph> of that ownership. I would not touch a
	    <lb/>hair on the head of the genteman's slave, any sooner
	    <lb/>than I would a hair in the <emph>mane of his horse</emph>.</quote></p>
        <p><persName>Mr R.</persName> likewise remarked, <quote>I think slavery as much a
	    <lb/>correlative of liberty as cold is of heat. History, expe­
	    <lb/>rience, observation and reason, have taught me that the
	    <lb/>torch of liberty has ever burned brighter when sur­
	    <lb/>rounded by the dark and filthy, yet <emph>nutritious</emph> atmosphere
	    <lb/>of slavery! I do not believe in the fanfaronade that all
	    <lb/>men are by nature equal. But these abstract specula­
	    <lb/>tions have nothing to do with the question, which I am
	    <lb/>willing to view as one of cold, sheer state policy, in
	    <lb/>which the safety, prosperity, and happiness of the <emph>whites
	      <lb/>alone</emph> are concerned.</quote></p>
        <p>Would <persName>Mr Roane</persName> carry out his logic into all its de­
	  <lb/>tails? Would he cherish intemperance, that sobriety
	  <lb/>might shine the brighter? Would he encourage theft,
	  <lb/>in order to throw additional lustre upon honesty? Yet
	  <lb/>there seems to be precisely the same relation between
	  <lb/>these things that there is between slavery and freedom.
	  <lb/>Such sentiments sound oddly enough in the mouth of a
	  <lb/>republican of the nineteenth century!</p>

        <p>When <persName>Mr Wirt</persName>, before the <orgName>Supreme Federal Court</orgName>,
	  <lb/>said that slavery was contrary to the laws of nature and
	  <lb/>of nations, and that the law of <placeName>South Carolina</placeName> concern­
	  <lb/>ing seizing colored seamen, was unconstitutional, the
	  <lb/>Governor directed several reproofs at him. In <date when="1825">1825</date>, <persName>Mr
	    <lb/>King</persName> laid on the table of the <orgName>United States Senate</orgName> a re­
	  <lb/>solution to appropriate the proceeds of the public lands
	  <lb/>to the emancipation of slaves, and the removal of free
	  <lb/>negroes, provided the same could be done under and
	  <lb/>agreeable to, the laws of the respective States. He said
	  <lb/>he did not wish it to be debated, but considered at some
	  <lb/>future time. Yet kindly and cautiously as this move­
	  <lb/>ment was made, the whole South resented it, and <persName>Gov­

	  <lb/>that slaves born in the <placeName>District of Colombia</placeName> after a given
	  <lb/>time, specified by law, might become free on arriv­
	  <lb/>ing at a certain age. A famous member from <placeName>South
	  <lb/>Carolina</placeName> called this an <quote>impertinent interference, and
	    <lb/>a violation of the principles of <emph>liberty</emph>!</quote> and the petition
	  <lb/>was not even <emph>committed</emph>. Another Southern gentleman in

        <p><persName>Mr Hayne</persName>, in his reply to <persName>Mr Webster</persName>, says: <quote>There

        <p><persName>Governor Miller</persName>, of <placeName>South Carolina</placeName>, speaking of the
	  <lb/>tariff and <quote>the remedy,</quote> asserted that slave labor was
	  <lb/>preferable to free, and challenged the free states to compe­
	  <lb/>tition on fair terms. <persName>Governor Hamilton</persName> of the same
	  <lb/>State, in delivering an address on the same subject, ut­
	  <lb/>tered a eulogy upon slavery; concluding as usual that
	  <lb/>nothing but the tariff — nothing but the rapacity of
	  <lb/>Northerners, could have nullified such great blessings
	  <lb/>of Providence, as the cheap labor and fertile soil of
	  <lb/><placeName>Carolina</placeName>. <persName>Mr Calhoun</persName>, in his late speech in the Senate,
	  <lb/>alludes in a tone of strong disapprobation, and almost
	  <lb/>of reprimand, to the remarkable debate in the <orgName>Virginia

	  <lb/>to the opinions and policy of the north.</p>
        <p>If these things evince any real desire to do away the

	  <lb/>miserable birthright if they could; for their sakes, I wish
	  <lb/>the majority were guided by a better spirit and a wiser
	  <lb/>policy. But this state of things cannot last. The ope­
	  <lb/>rations of Divine Providence are hastening the crisis,
	  <lb/>and move which way we will, it must come in some form
	  <lb/>or other; if we take warning in time, it may come as
	  <lb/>a blessing. The spirit of philanthropy, which <persName>Mr Hayne</persName>
	  <lb/>calls <quote rend="pre(‘)post(’)">false,</quote> <emph>is</emph> walking to and fro in the earth; and it
	  <lb/>will not pause, or turn back, till it has fastened the

        <p>The advocates of slavery remind me of a comparison I

	  <lb/>tations</ref><anchor xml:id="a040" corresp="#n040"/> and of perfect equality in the Senate, were always
	  <lb/>connected together; and a large committee of compro­
	  <lb/>mise, consisting of one member from each State, ex­
	  <lb/>pressly recommended that both provisions should be
	  <lb/>adopted, but neither of them without the other.</p>
        <p>Such were the equivalents, directly or indirectly of­
	  <lb/>fered, by which the free States were induced to consent
	  <lb/>to slave representation. It was not without very consid­
	  <lb/>erable struggles that they overcame their repugnance to
	  <lb/>admitting such a principle in the construction of a repub­
	  <lb/>lican government. <persName>Mr Gerry</persName>, of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, <emph>at first</emph>
	  <lb/>exclaimed against it with evident horror, but <emph>at last</emph>, he
	  <lb/>was chairman of the committee of compromise. Even
	  <lb/>the slave States themselves, seem to have been a little
	  <lb/>embarrassed with the discordant element. A curious
	  <lb/>proof of this is given in the language of the <title>Constitution</title>.
	  <lb/>The ugly feature is covered as cautiously as the deformed
	  <lb/>visage of the Veiled Prophet. The words are as follows:
	  <lb/><quote>Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned
	    <lb/>among the States according to their respective numbers;
	    <lb/>which shall be ascertained by adding to the whole num­
	    <lb/>ber of free persons, <emph>including those bound to servitude
	      <lb/>for a term of years, and excluding <name>Indians</name> not taxed,
	      <lb/>three fifths of all other persons</emph>.</quote> In this most elaborate
	  <lb/>sentence, a foreigner would discern no slavery. None
	  <lb/>but those who already knew the venomous serpent, would
	  <lb/>be able to discover its sting.</p>
        <p><persName>Governor Wright</persName>, of <placeName>Maryland</placeName>, a contemporary of all
	  <lb/>these transactions, and a slave holder, after delivering a
	  <lb/>eulogy upon the kindness of masters<anchor xml:id="a29" corresp="#n29" rend="pre(*)"/> expressed himself
	  <lb/>as follows: <quote>The <title>Constitution</title> guaranties to us the ser­

	    <lb/>feelings of the framers of that glorious instrument would
	    <lb/>not suffer them to use <emph>that</emph> word, on account of its anti­
	    <lb/>congeniality — its incongeniality to the idea of a consti­
	    <lb/>tution for freemen. It says, <quote rend="slant(italic)pre(‘)post(’)">persons held to service, or la­

        <p>This high praise bestowed on the <emph>form</emph> of our consti­
	  <lb/>tution, reminds me of an anecdote. A clergyman in a
	  <lb/>neighboring State, being obliged to be absent from his
	  <lb/>parish, procured a young man to supply his place, who
	  <lb/>was very worldly in his inclinations, and very gay in his
	  <lb/>manners. When the minister returned, his people said
	  <lb/>somewhat reproachfully, <quote>How could you provide such
	    <lb/>a man to preach for us; <emph>you might at least have left us a
	      <lb/>hypocrite</emph>.</quote></p>
        <p>While all parties agreed to act in opposition to the
	  <lb/><emph>principles</emph> of justice, they all concurred to pay homage
	  <lb/>to them by hypocrisy of <emph>language</emph>! Men are willing to
	  <lb/>try all means to <emph>appear</emph> honest, except the simple experi­
	  <lb/>ment of <emph>being</emph> so. It is true, there were individuals
	  <lb/>who distrusted this compromise at the time, if they did
	  <lb/>not wholly disapprove of it. It is said that <persName>Washington</persName>,
	  <lb/>as he was walking thoughtfully near the <placeName>Schuylkill</placeName>, was
	  <lb/>met by a menber of the Convention, to whom, in the
	  <lb/>course of conversation, he acknowledged that he was
	  <lb/>meditating whether it would not be better to separate,
	  <lb/>without proposing a constitution to the people; for he
	  <lb/>was in great doubt whether the frame of government,
	  <lb/>which was now nearly completed, would be better for
	  <lb/>them, than to trust to the course of events, and await
	  <lb/>future emergencies.</p>
        <p>This anecdote was derived from an authentic source,
	  <lb/>and I have no doubt of its truth; neither is there any
	  <lb/>doubt that <persName>Washington</persName> had in his mind this great com­
	  <lb/>promise, the pivot on which the system of government
	  <lb/>was to turn.</p>
        <p>If avarice was induced to shake hands with injustice,
	  <lb/>from the expectation of increased direct taxation upon
	  <lb/>the South, she gained little by the bargain. With the
	  <lb/>exception of two brief periods, during the French war,
	  <lb/>and the last war with <placeName>England</placeName>, the revenue of the

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">112</mw>
	  <lb/><placeName>United States</placeName> has been raised by <emph>duties on imports</emph>.—
	  <lb/>The heavy debts and expenditures of the several States,
	  <lb/>which they had been accustomed to provide for by
	  <lb/>direct taxes, and which they probably expected to
	  <lb/>see provided for by the same means in time to come,
	  <lb/>have been all paid by duties on imports. The greatest
	  <lb/>proportion of these duties are, of course, paid by the free
	  <lb/>States; for here, the poorest laborer daily consumes
	  <lb/>several articles of foreign production, of which from one
	  <lb/>eighth to one half the price is a tax paid to government.
	  <lb/>The clothing of the slave population increases the reve­
	  <lb/>nue very little, and their food almost none at all.</p>
        <p>Wherever free labor and slave labor exist under the
	  <lb/>same government, there must be a perpetual clashing of
	  <lb/>interests. The legislation required for one, is, in its
	  <lb/>spirit and maxims, diametrically opposed to that required
	  <lb/>for the other. Hence <persName>Mr Madison</persName> predicted, in the
	  <lb/>convention, which formed our <title>Federal Constitution</title>, that
	  <lb/>the contests would be between the great geographical
	  <lb/>sections; that such had been the division, even during 
	  <lb/>the war and the confederacy.</p>
        <p>In the same convention, <persName>Charles Pinckney</persName>, a man of
	  <lb/>great sagacity, spoke of the equal representation of large
	  <lb/>and small States as a matter of slight consequence; no
	  <lb/>difficulties would ever arise on that point, he said; the
	  <lb/>question would always be between the slave-holding and
	  <lb/>non-slave-holding interests.</p>
        <p>If the pressure of common danger, and the sense of
	  <lb/>individual weakness, during our contest for indepen­
	  <lb/>dence, could not bring the States to mutual confidence,
	  <lb/>nothing ever can do it, except a change of character.—
	  <lb/>From the adoption of the <title>constitution</title> to the present time,
	  <lb/>the breach has been gradually widening. The South
	  <lb/>has pursued a uniform and sagacious system of policy,
	  <lb/>which, in all its bearings, direct and indirect, has been
	  <lb/>framed for the preservation and extension of slave power.
	  <lb/>This system, has in the very nature of the two things,
	  <lb/>constantly interfered with the interests of the free States;
	  <lb/>and hitherto the South have always gained the victory.
	  <lb/>This has principally been accomplished by yoking all
	  <lb/>important questions together <emph>in pairs</emph>, and strenuously
	  <lb/>resisting the passage of one, unless accompanied by the
<pb n="113"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="10(3)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">113</mw>
	  <lb/>other. The South was desirous of removing the seat of
	  <lb/>government from <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> to <placeName>Washington</placeName>, because
	  <lb/>the latter is in a slave territory, where republican repre­
	  <lb/>sentatives and magistrates can bring their slaves without
	  <lb/>danger of losing them, or having them contaminated by
	  <lb/>the principles of universal liberty: The assumption of
	  <lb/>the State debts, likely to bring considerable money back
	  <lb/>to the North, was <emph>linked</emph> with this question, and both
	  <lb/>were carried. The admission of <placeName>Maine</placeName> into the <name>Union</name>
	  <lb/>as a free State, and of <placeName>Missouri</placeName> as a slave State, were
	  <lb/>two more of these Siamese twins, not allowed to be sepa­
	  <lb/>rated from each other. A numerous smaller progeny
	  <lb/>may be found in the laying of imposts, and the succes­
	  <lb/>sive adjustment of protection to navigation, the fisheries,
	  <lb/>agriculture, and manufactures.</p>
        <p>There would perhaps be no harm in this system of
	  <lb/>compromises, or any objection to its continuing in in­
	  <lb/>finite series, if no injustice were done to a third party,
	  <lb/>which is never heard or noticed, except for purposes of
	  <lb/>oppression.</p>
        <p>I reverence the wisdom of our early legislators; but
	  <lb/>they certainly did very wrong to admit slavery as an ele­
	  <lb/>ment into a free constitution; and to sacrifice the known
	  <lb/>and <emph>declared</emph> rights of a third and weaker party, in order
	  <lb/>to cement a union between two stronger ones. Such an
	  <lb/>arrangement ought not, and could not, come to good. It
	  <lb/>has given the slave States a controlling power which they
	  <lb/>will always keep, so long as we remain together.</p>
        <p><persName>President John Adams</persName> was of opinion, that this
	  <lb/>ascendency might be attributed to an early mistake,
	  <lb/>originating in what he called the <soCalled><placeName>Frankford</placeName> advice.</soCalled>
          <lb/>When the first Congress was summoned in <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>,

	    <lb/>ford</placeName>, a few miles from <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>, and conjured them,
	  <lb/>as they valued the success of the common cause, to let no
	  <lb/>measure of importance <emph>appear</emph> to originate with the
	  <lb/>North, to yield precedence in all things to <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, and
	  <lb/>lead her if possible to commit herself to the Revolution.
	  <lb/>Above all, they begged that not a word might be said
	  <lb/>about <quote>independence;</quote> for that a strong prejudice

	  <lb/>already existed against the delegates from <placeName>New England</placeName>,
	  <lb/>on account of a supposed design to throw off their alle­
	  <lb/>giance to the mother country. The <soCalled><placeName>Frankford</placeName> advice</soCalled>
	  <lb/>was followed. The delegates from <placeName>Virginia</placeName> took the
	  <lb/>lead on all occasions.</p>
        <p>His son, <persName>John Q. Adams</persName>, finds a more substantial
	  <lb/>reason. In his speech on the Tariff, <date when="1833-02-04"><name>February</name> 4, 1833</date>,
	  <lb/>he said; <quote>Not three days since, <persName>Mr Clayton</persName> of <placeName>Geor­
	      <lb/>gia</placeName>, called that species of population (viz. slaves) the
	    <lb/>machinery of the South. Now that machinery had
	    <lb/>twenty odd representatives<anchor xml:id="a30" corresp="#n30" rend="pre(*)"/> in that hall, — not elected
	    <lb/>by the machinery, but by those who owned it. And if
	    <lb/>he should go back to the history of this government from
	    <lb/>its foundation, it would be easy to prove that its decisions
	    <lb/>had been effected, in general, by less majorities than
	    <lb/>that. Nay, he might go farther, and insist that that very
	    <lb/>representation had ever been, in fact, <emph>the ruling power of
	      <lb/>this government</emph>.</quote></p>
        <p>
          <quote>The history of the <name>Union</name> has afforded a continual
	    <lb/>proof that this representation of property, which they
	    <lb/>enjoy, as well in the election of President and Vice Pre­
	    <lb/>sident of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, as upon the floor of the
	    <lb/><orgName>House of Representatives</orgName>, has secured to the slave-hold­
	    <lb/>ing States the entire control of the national policy, and,
	    <lb/>almost without exception, the possession of the highest
	    <lb/>executive office of the <name>Union</name>. Always united in the pur­
	    <lb/>pose of regulating the affairs of the whole <name>Union</name> by the
	    <lb/>standard of the slave-holding interest, their disproportion­
	    <lb/>ate numbers in the electoral colleges have enabled them,
	    <lb/>in ten out of twelve quadrennial elections, to confer the
	    <lb/>Chief Magistracy upon one of their own citizens. —
	    <lb/>Their suffrages at every election, without exception, have
	    <lb/>been almost exclusively confined to a candidate of their
	    <lb/>own caste. Availing themselves of the divisions which,
	    <lb/>from the nature of man, always prevail in communities
	    <lb/>entirely free, they have sought and found auxiliaries in
	    <lb/>the other quarters of the <name>Union</name>, by associating the pas­
	    <lb/>sions of parties, and the ambition of individuals, with
	    <lb/>their own purposes, to establish and maintain throughout
	    <lb/>the confederated nations the slave-holding policy. The

	    <lb/>office of Vice President, a station of high dignity, but of
	    <lb/>little other than contingent power, had been usually, by
	    <lb/>their indulgence, conceded to a citizen of the other sec­
	    <lb/>tion; but even this political courtesy was superseded at
	    <lb/>the election before the last, and both the offices of Pre­
	    <lb/>sident and Vice President of the <placeName>United States</placeName> were, by
	    <lb/>the preponderancy of slave-holding votes, bestowed upon
	    <lb/>citizens of two adjoining and both slave-holding States.
	    <lb/>At this moment the President of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, the
	    <lb/>President of the <orgName>Senate</orgName>, the Speaker of the <orgName>House of
	      <lb/>Representatives</orgName>, and the Chief Justice of the <placeName>United
	    <lb/>States</placeName>, are all citizens of that favored portion of the united
	    <lb/>republic. The last of these offices, being, under the
	    <lb/><title>constitution</title>, held by the tenure of good behaviour, has
	    <lb/>been honored and dignified by the occupation of the pre­
	    <lb/>sent incumbent upwards of thirty years. An overruling
	    <lb/>sense of the high responsibilities under which it is held,
	    <lb/>has effectually guarded him from permitting the sectional
	    <lb/>slave-holding spirit to ascend the tribunal of justice; and
	    <lb/>it is not difficult to discern, in this inflexible impartiality,
	    <lb/>the source of the obloquy which that same spirit has not
	    <lb/>been inactive in attempting to excite against the <orgName>Su­
	      <lb/>preme Court of the United States</orgName> itself; and of the insu­
	    <lb/>perable aversion of the votaries of nullification to encoun­
	    <lb/>ter or abide by the decision of that tribunal, the true and
	    <lb/>legitimate umpire of constitutional, controverted law.</quote>

        <p>It is worthy of observation that this slave representation
	  <lb/>is always used to protect and extend slave power; and
	  <lb/>in this way, the slaves themselves are made to vote for
	  <lb/>slavery: they are compelled to furnish halters to hang
	  <lb/>their posterity.</p>
        <p><persName>Machiavel</persName> says that <quote>the whole politics of rival states
	    <lb/>consist in checking the growth of one another.</quote> It is
	  <lb/>sufficiently obvious, that the slave and free States are, and
	  <lb/>must be, rivals, owing to the inevitable contradiction of
	  <lb/>their interests. It needed no <persName>Machiavel</persName> to predict the
	  <lb/>result. A continual strife has been going on, more or
	  <lb/>less earnest, according to the nature of the interests it
	  <lb/>involved, and the South has always had strength and
<pb n="116"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="10(4)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">116</mw>
	  <lb/>skill to carry her point. Of all our Presidents, <persName>Washing­
	  <lb/>ton</persName> alone, had power to keep the jealousies of his coun­
	  <lb/>tymen in check; and he used his influence nobly. —
	  <lb/>Some of his successors have cherished those jealousies,
	  <lb/>and made effective use of them.</p>
        <p>The people of the North have to manage a rocky and
	  <lb/>reluctant soil; hence commerce and the fisheries early
	  <lb/>attracted their attention. The products of these employ­
	  <lb/>ments were, as they should be, proportioned to the dex­
	  <lb/>terity and hard labor required in their pursuit. The
	  <lb/>North grew opulent; and her politicians, who came in
	  <lb/>contact with those of the South with anything like rival
	  <lb/>pretensions, represented the commercial class, which
	  <lb/>was the nucleus of the old Federal party.</p>
        <p>The Southerners have a genial climate and a fertile
	  <lb/>soil; but in consequence of the cumbrous machinery of
	  <lb/>slave labor, which is slow for everything, (except exhaust­
	  <lb/>ing the soil,) they have always been less prosperous than
	  <lb/>the free States. It is said, I know not with how much
	  <lb/>truth, but it is certainly very credible, that a great pro­
	  <lb/>portion of their plantations are deeply mortgaged in <placeName>New
	    <lb/>York</placeName> and <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName>. It is likewise said that the ex­
	  <lb/>penses of the planters are generally one or two years in
	  <lb/>advance of their income. Whether these statements be
	  <lb/>true or not, the most casual observer will decide, that the
	  <lb/>free States are uniformly the most prosperous, notwith­
	  <lb/>standing the South possesses a political power, by which
	  <lb/>she manages to check-mate us at every important move.
	  <lb/>When we add this to the original jealousy spoken of by
	  <lb/><persName>Mr Madison</persName>, it is not wonderful that Southern politicians
	  <lb/>take so little pains to conceal their strong dislike of the
	  <lb/>North.</p>
        <p>A striking difference of manners, also caused by
	  <lb/>slavery, serves to aggravate other differences. Slave
	  <lb/>holders have the habit of command; and from the supe­
	  <lb/>rior ease with which it sits upon them, they seem to
	  <lb/>imagine that they were <quote>born to command,</quote> and we to
	  <lb/>obey. In time of war, they tauntingly told us that we
	  <lb/>might furnish the <emph>men</emph>, and they would furnish the <emph>offi­
	    <lb/>cers</emph>; but in time of peace they find our list of pensioners
	  <lb/>so large, they complain that we did furnish so many men.</p>

        <p>At the North, every body is busy in some employ­
	  <lb/>ment, and politics, with very few exceptions, form but a
	  <lb/>brief episode in the lives of the citizens. But the
	  <lb/>Southern politicians are men of leisure. They have
	  <lb/>nothing to do but to ride round their plantations, hunt,
	  <lb/>attend the races, study politics for the next legislative
	  <lb/>or congressional campaign, and decide how to use the
	  <lb/>prodigious mechanical power, of slave representation,
	  <lb/>which a political <persName>Archimedes</persName> may effectually wield for
	  <lb/>the destruction of commerce, or anything else, involving
	  <lb/>the prosperity of the free States.</p>
        <p>It has been already said, that most of the wealth in
	  <lb/><placeName>New England</placeName> was made by commerce; consequently
	  <lb/>the South became unfriendly to commerce. There
	  <lb/>was a class in <placeName>New England</placeName>, jealous, and not with­
	  <lb/>out reason, of their own commercial aristocracy. It
	  <lb/>was the policy of the South to foment these passions, and
	  <lb/>increase these prejudices. Thus was the old Democratic
	  <lb/>party formed; and while that party honestly supposed
	  <lb/>they were merely resisting the encroachments of a nobil­
	  <lb/>ity at home, they were actually playing a game for one
	  <lb/>of the most aristocratic classes in the world — viz. the
	  <lb/>Southern planters. A famous slave owner and politi­
	  <lb/>cian, openly boasted, that the South could always put
	  <lb/>down the aristocracy of the North, by means of her own
	  <lb/>democracy. In this point of view, democracy becomes
	  <lb/>a machine used by one aristocratic class against another,
	  <lb/>that has less power, and is therefore less dangerous.</p>
        <p>There are features in the organization of society, re­
	  <lb/>sulting from slavery, which are conducive to anything
	  <lb/>but the union of those States. A large class are with­
	  <lb/>out employment, are accustomed to command, and have a
	  <lb/>strong contempt for habits of industry. This class, like
	  <lb/>the nobility of feudal times, are restless, impetuous, eager
	  <lb/>for excitement, and prompt to settle all questions with the
	  <lb/>sword. Like the fierce old barons, at the head of their
	  <lb/>vassals, they are ever ready to resist and nullify the <emph>cen­
	    <lb/>tral</emph> power of the State, whenever it interferes with their
	  <lb/>individual interests, or even approaches the strong holds
	  <lb/>of their prejudices. All history shows, that men possess­
	  <lb/>ing hereditary, despotic power, cannot easily be brought
<pb n="118"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">118</mw>
	  <lb/>to acknowledge a superior, either in the administrators
	  <lb/>of the laws, or in the law itself. It was precisely such a
	  <lb/>class of men that covered <placeName>Europe</placeName> with camps, for up­
	  <lb/>wards of ten centuries.</p>
        <p>A Southern governor has dignified duelling with the
	  <lb/>name of an <soCalled rend="slant(upright)pre(“)post(”)">institution</soCalled>; and the planters generally,
	  <lb/>seem to regard it as among those which they have denom­
	  <lb/>inated their <quote>peculiar institutions.</quote> <persName>General Wilkinson</persName>,
	  <lb/>who was the son of a slave owner, expresses in his me­
	  <lb/>moirs, great abhorrence of duelling, and laments the

	  <lb/>a boy, had upon his after life: <said><persName>James</persName>,</said> said the old

        <p>A young lawyer, who went from <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> to re­
	  <lb/>side at the South, has frequently declared that he could
	  <lb/>not take any stand there as a lawyer, or a gentleman,
	  <lb/>until he had fought: he was subject to continual insult
	  <lb/>and degredation, until he had evinced his readiness to
	  <lb/>kill, or be killed. It is obvious that such a state of morals
	  <lb/>elevates mere physical courage into a most undue impor­
	  <lb/>tance. There are indeed emergencies, when all the
	  <lb/>virtues, and all the best affections of man, are intertwined
	  <lb/>with personal bravery; but this is not the kind of cour­
	  <lb/>age, which makes duelling in fashion. The patriot nobly
	  <lb/>sacrifices himself for the good of others; the duellist
	  <lb/>wantonly sacrifices others to himself.</p>

	  <lb/>legislation. By these means, they seek to overawe the
	  <lb/>Representatives from the free States, whenever any ques­
	  <lb/>tion even remotely connected with slavery is about to be
	  <lb/>discussed; and this, united with our strong reverence for
	  <lb/>the <name>Union</name>, has made our legislators shamefully cautious
	  <lb/>with regard to a subject, which peculiarly demands moral
	  <lb/>courage, and an abandonment of selfish considerations.
	  <lb/>If a member of Congress does stand his ground firmly, if
	  <lb/>he wants no preferment or profit, which the all powerful
	  <lb/>Southern influence can give, an effort is then made to
	  <lb/>intimidate him. The instances are numerous in which
	  <lb/>Northern men have been insulted and challenged by
	  <lb/>their Southern brethren, in consequence of the adverse

	  <lb/>influence they exerted over the measures of the <emph>Federal</emph>
	  <lb/>government. This turbulent evil exists only in our slave
	  <lb/>States; and the peace of the country is committed to
	  <lb/>their hands whenever <emph>twentyfive</emph> votes in Congress can
	  <lb/>turn the scale in favor of war.</p>
        <p>The statesmen of the South have generally been
	  <lb/>planters. Their agricultural products must pay the
	  <lb/>merchants— foreign and domestic, — the ship owner, the
	  <lb/>manufacturer, — and all others concerned in the ex­
	  <lb/>change or manipulation of them. It is universally
	  <lb/>agreed that the production of the raw materials is the
	  <lb/>least profitable employment of capital. The planters
	  <lb/>have always entertained a jealous dislike of those engaged
	  <lb/>in the more profitable business of the manufacture and
	  <lb/>exchange of products; particularly as the existence of
	  <lb/>slavery among them destroys ingenuity and enterprise,
	  <lb/>and compels them to employ the merchants, manufactur­
	  <lb/>ers, and sailors of the free States.<anchor xml:id="a32" corresp="#n32" rend="pre(*)"/> Hence there has ever
	  <lb/>been a tendency to check <placeName>New England</placeName>, whenever she
	  <lb/>appears to shoot up with vigorous rapidity. Whether
	  <lb/>she tries to live by <emph>hook</emph> or by <emph>crook</emph>, there is always an
	  <lb/>effort to restrain her within certain limited bounds. The
	  <lb/>embargo, passed without limitation of time, (a thing
	  <lb/>unprecedented,) was fastened upon the bosom of her
	  <lb/>commerce, until life was extinguished. The ostensible
	  <lb/>object of this measure, was to force <placeName>Great Britain</placeName> to
	  <lb/>terms, by distressing the <placeName>West Indies</placeName> for food. But
	  <lb/>while <placeName>England</placeName> commanded the seas, her colonies were
	  <lb/>not likely to starve; and <unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">for</unclear> the sake of this doubtful
	  <lb/>experiment, a certain and incalculable injury was in­
	  <lb/>flicted upon the Northern States. Seamen, and the
	  <lb/>numerous classes of mechanics connected with naviga­
	  <lb/>tion, were thrown out of employment, as suddenly as if
	  <lb/>they had been cast on a desert island by some convulsion
	  <lb/>of nature. Thousands of families were ruined by that
	  <lb/>ill-judged measure. Has any government a right to in­
	  <lb/>flict so much direct suffering on a very large portion of 
	  <lb/>their own people, for the sake of an indirect and remote
	  <lb/>evil which may possibly be inflicted on an enemy?</p>
        <pb n="120"/>

        <p>It is true, agriculture suffered as well as commerce;
	  <lb/>but agricultural products could be converted into food
	  <lb/>and clothing; they would not decay like ships, nor would
	  <lb/>the producers be deprived of employment and sustenance,
	  <lb/>like those connected with navigation.</p>
        <p>Whether this step was intended to paralyze the
	  <lb/>North or not, it most suddenly and decidedly produced
	  <lb/>that effect. We were told that it was done to save our
	  <lb/>commerce from falling into the hands of the <name>English</name> and
	  <lb/><name>French</name>. But our merchants earnestly entreated not to
	  <lb/>be thus saved. At the very moment of the embargo,
	  <lb/>underwriters were ready to <emph>insure</emph> at the <emph>usual</emph> rates.</p>
        <p>The non-intercourse was of the same general charac­
	  <lb/>ter as the embargo, but less offensive and injurious.
	  <lb/>The war crowned this course of policy; and like the
	  <lb/>other measures, was carried by slave votes. It was em­
	  <lb/>phatically a Southern, not a national war. Individuals
	  <lb/>gained glory by it, and many of them nobly deserved it;
	  <lb/>but the amount of benefit which the country derived
	  <lb/>from that war might be told in much fewer words than
	  <lb/>would enumerate the mischiefs it produced.</p>
        <p>The commercial States, particularly <placeName>New England</placeName>,
	  <lb/>have been frequently reproached for not being willing to
	  <lb/>go to war for the protection of their own interests; and
	  <lb/>have been charged with pusillanimity and ingratitude for
	  <lb/>not warmly seconding those who were so zealous to de­
	  <lb/>fend their cause. <persName>Mr Hayne</persName>, during the great debate
	  <lb/>with <persName>Mr Webster</persName>, in the <orgName>Senate</orgName>, made use of this cus­
	  <lb/>tomary sarcasm. It is revived whenever the sectional
	  <lb/>spirit of the South, or party spirit in the North, prompts
	  <lb/>individuals to depreciate the talents and character of any
	  <lb/>eminent Northern man. The Southern States have even
	  <lb/>gone so far on this subject, as to assume the designa­
	  <lb/>tion of <quote rend="slant(italic)">patriot States,</quote> in contra-distinction to their
	  <lb/>northern neighbors — and this too, while <placeName>Bunker Hill</placeName> and 
	  <lb/><name>Faneuil Hall</name> are still standing! It certainly was a pleas­
	  <lb/>ant idea to exchange the appellation of <emph>slave</emph> States for
	  <lb/>that of <emph>patriot</emph> States — it removed a word which in a
	  <lb/>republic is unseemly and inconsistent.</p>
        <p>Whatever may be thought of the justice and expedi­
	  <lb/>ency of the last war, it was certainly undertaken against
<pb n="121"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="11(1)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">121</mw>
	  <lb/>the earnest wishes of the commercial States — two thirds
	  <lb/>of the Representatives from those States voted in oppo­
	  <lb/>sition to the measure. According to the spirit of the
	  <lb/><title>constitution</title> it ought not to have passed unless there
	  <lb/>were two thirds in favor of it. Why then should the
	  <lb/>South have insisted upon conferring a boon, which was
	  <lb/>not wanted; and how happened it, that <emph>Yankees</emph>, with
	  <lb/>all their acknowledged shrewdness in money matters,
	  <lb/>could never to this day perceive how they were protected
	  <lb/>by it? Yet <placeName>New England</placeName> is reproached with cowardice
	  <lb/>and ingratitude to her Southern benefactors! If one
	  <lb/>man were to knock another down with a broad axe, in
	  <lb/>the attempt to brush a fly from his face, and then blame
	  <lb/>him for not being sufficiently thankful, it would exactly
	  <lb/>illustrate the relation between the North and the South
	  <lb/>on this subject.</p>
        <p>If the protection of commerce had been the real ob­
	  <lb/>ject of the war, would not some preparations have been
	  <lb/>made for a navy? It was ever the policy of the slave
	  <lb/>States to destroy the navy. Vast conquests by <emph>land</emph> were
	  <lb/>contemplated, for the protection of Northern commerce.
	  <lb/>Whatever was intended, the work of destruction was
	  <lb/>done. The policy of the South stood for a while like a
	  <lb/>giant among ruins. <placeName>New England</placeName> received a blow,
	  <lb/>which crushed her energies, but could not annihilate
	  <lb/>them. Where the system of free labor prevails, and
	  <lb/>there is work of any kind to be done, there is a safety
	  <lb/>valve provided for <emph>any</emph> pressure. In such a community
	  <lb/>there is a vital and active principle, which cannot be
	  <lb/>long repressed. You may dam up the busy waters, but
	  <lb/>they will sweep away any obstructions, or force a new channel.</p>
        <p>Immediately after the peace, when commerce again
	  <lb/>began to try her broken wings, the South took care to
	  <lb/>keep her down, by multiplying permanent embarrass­
	  <lb/>ments, in the shape of duties. The <emph>direct</emph> tax (which
	  <lb/>would have borne equally upon them, and which in the
	  <lb/>original compact was the equivalent for slave representa­
	  <lb/>tion), was forthwith repealed, and commerce was bur­
	  <lb/>dened with the payment of the national debt. The
	  <lb/>encouragement of <emph>manufactures</emph>, the consumption of
	  <lb/>domestic products, or <emph>living within ourselves</emph>, was then

	  <lb/>urged upon us. This was an ancient doctrine of the
	  <lb/>democratic party. <persName>Mr Jefferson</persName> was its strongest advo­
	  <lb/>cate. Did he think it likely to bear unfavorably upon
	  <lb/><quote xml:id="a33" corresp="#n33" rend="post(”*)">the nation of shop keepers and peddlers?</quote> The
	  <lb/>Northerners adopted it with sincere views to economy,
	  <lb/>and more perfect independence. The duties were so
	  <lb/>adjusted as to embarrass commerce, and to guard the in­
	  <lb/>terests of a few in the North, who, from patriotism, party
	  <lb/>spirit, or private interest, had established manufac­
	  <lb/>tures on a considerable scale. This system of protec­
	  <lb/>tion opposed by the North, was begun in <date when="1816">1816</date> by
	  <lb/>Southern politicians, and enlarged and confirmed by them
	  <lb/>in <date when="1824">1824</date>. It was carried nearly as much by Southern influ­
	  <lb/>ence, as was the war itself; and if the votes were placed
	  <lb/>side by side, there could not be a doubt of the identity of the
	  <lb/>interests and passions, which lay concealed under both.
	  <lb/>But enterprise, that moral perpetual-motion, overcomes all
	  <lb/>obstacles. Neat and flourishing villages rose in every
	  <lb/>valley of <placeName>New England</placeName>. The busy hum of machinery
	  <lb/>made music with her neglected waterfalls. All her
	  <lb/>streams, like the famous <placeName>Pactolus</placeName>, flowed with gold. From
	  <lb/>her discouraged and embarrassed commerce arose a
	  <lb/>greater blessing, apparently indestructible. Walls of
	  <lb/>brick and granite could not easily be overturned by the
	  <lb/>Southern <emph>lever</emph>, and left to decay, as the ship timber had
	  <lb/>done. Thus <persName>Mordecai</persName> was again seated in the king's
	  <lb/>gate, by means of the very system intended for his
	  <lb/>ruin. As soon as this state of things became percep­
	  <lb/>tible, the South commenced active hostility with man­
	  <lb/>ufactures. Doleful pictures of Southern desolation and
	  <lb/>decay were given, and all attributed to manufactures.
	  <lb/>The North was said to be plundering the South, while
	  <lb/>she, poor dame, was enriching her neighbors, and
	  <lb/>growing poor upon her extensive labors. (If this state­
	  <lb/>ment be true, how much gratitude do we owe the <emph>ne­
	    <lb/>groes</emph>: for they do all the work that is done at the
	  <lb/>South. Their masters only serve to keep them in a
	  <lb/>condition, where they do not accomplish half as much
	  <lb/>as they otherwise would.).</p>

        <p>What would the South have? They took the manage­

	  <lb/>they have kept it ever since. They claimed slave repre­

	  <lb/>be kept down. But change their policy as they will, free
	  <lb/>States <emph>cannot</emph> be kept down. There is but one way to
	  <lb/>ruin them; and that is to make them slave States. If
	  <lb/>the South with all her power and skill cannot manage
	  <lb/>herself into prosperity, it is because the difficulty lies at
	  <lb/>her own doors, and she will not remove it. At one time
	  <lb/>her deserted villages were attributed to the undue patron­
	  <lb/>age bestowed upon settlers on the public lands; at
	  <lb/>another, the tariff is the cause of her desolation. Slavery,
	  <lb/>the real root of the evil, is carefully kept out of sight, as
	  <lb/>a <quote>delicate subject,</quote> which must not be alluded to. It is
	  <lb/>a singular fact in the present age of the world, that delicate
	  <lb/>and indelicate subjects mean precisely the same thing.</p>
        <p>If any proof were wanted, that <emph>slavery</emph> is the cause
	  <lb/>of all this discord, it is furnished by Eastern and West­
	  <lb/>ern <placeName>Virginia</placeName>. They belong to the same State, and are
	  <lb/>protected by the same laws; but in the former, the slave-
	  <lb/>holding interest is very strong — while in the latter, it
	  <lb/>is scarcely anything. The result is, warfare, and con­
	  <lb/>tinual complaints, and threats of separation. There are
<pb n="125"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="11(3)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">125</mw>
	  <lb/>no such contentions between the different sections of 
	  <lb/><emph>free</emph> States; simply because slavery, the exciting cause of
	  <lb/>strife, does not exist among them.</p>
        <p>The constant threat of the slave-holding States is the
	  <lb/>dissolution of the <name>Union</name>; and they have repeated it with
	  <lb/>all the earnestness of sincerity, though there are power­
	  <lb/>ful reasons why it would not be well of them to venture
	  <lb/>upon that untried state of being. In one respect only,
	  <lb/>are these threats of any consequence — thay have famil­
	  <lb/>iarized the public mind with the subject of separation,
	  <lb/>and diminished the reverence, with which the free States
	  <lb/>have hitherto regarded the <name>Union</name>. The farewell advice
	  <lb/>of <persName>Washington</persName> operated like a spell upon the hearts and
	  <lb/>consciences of his countrymen. For many, many years
	  <lb/>after his death, it would almost have been deemed blas­
	  <lb/>phemy to speak of separation as a possible event. I
	  <lb/>would that it still continued so! But it is now an every­
	  <lb/>day occurence, to hear politicians, of all parties, con­
	  <lb/>jecturing what system would be pursued by different sec­
	  <lb/>tions of the country, in case of a dissolution of the <name>Union</name>.
	  <lb/>This evil is likewise chargeable upon slavery. The threats
	  <lb/>of separation have <emph>uniformly</emph> come from the slave-hold­
	  <lb/>ing States; and on many important measures the free
	  <lb/>States have been awed into acquiescence by their respect
	  <lb/>for the <name>Union</name>.</p>
        <p><persName>Mr Adams</persName>, in the able and manly report before alluded
	  <lb/>to, says: <quote>It cannot be denied that in a community
	    <lb/>spreading over a large extent of territory, and politically
	    <lb/>founded upon the principles proclaimed in the declara­
	    <lb/>tion of independence, but differing so widely in the ele­
	    <lb/>ments of their social condition, that the inhabitants of
	    <lb/>one half the territory are wholly free, and those of the
	    <lb/>other half divided into masters and slaves, deep if not
	    <lb/>irreconcilable collisions of interest must abound. The
	    <lb/>question whether such a community can exist under
	    <lb/>one common government, is a subject of profound, phi­
	    <lb/>losophical speculation in theory. Whether it can con­
	    <lb/>tinue long to exist, is a question to be solved only by the
	    <lb/>experiment now making by the people of this <name>Union</name>, un­
	    <lb/>der that national compact, the <title>constitution of the <placeName>Unit­

        <p>The admission of <placeName>Missouri</placeName> into the <name>Union</name> is another
	  <lb/>clear illustration of the slave-holding power. That
	  <lb/>contest was marked by the same violence and the same
	  <lb/>threats as have characterized nullification. On both
	  <lb/>occasions the planters were pitted against the commer­
	  <lb/>cial and manufacturing sections of the country. On both
	  <lb/>occasions the democracy of the North was, by one
	  <lb/>means or another, induced to throw its strength upon
	  <lb/>the Southern <mcr rend="slant(italic)">lever</mcr>, to increase its already prodigious
	  <lb/>power. On both, and on all occasions, some little support
	  <lb/>has been given to Northern principles in <placeName>Maryland</placeName>, <placeName>Vir­
	    <lb/>ginia</placeName>, and <placeName>North Carolina</placeName>; because in portions of those
	  <lb/>States there is a considerable commercial interest, and
	  <lb/>some encouragement of free labor. So true it is, in the
	  <lb/>minutest details, that slavery and freedom are always
	  <lb/>arrayed in opposition to each other.</p>
        <p>At the time of the <placeName>Missouri</placeName> question, the pestiferous
	  <lb/>effects of slavery had become too obvious to escape the
	  <lb/>observation of the most superficial statesman. The
	  <lb/>new free States admitted into the <name>Union</name> enjoyed tenfold
	  <lb/>prosperity compared with the new slave States. Give a
	  <lb/>free laborer a barren rock, and he will soon cover it
	  <lb/>with vegetation; while the slave and his task-master,
	  <lb/>would change the garden of <placeName>Eden</placeName> to a desert.</p>
        <p>But <placeName>Missouri</placeName> must be admitted as a slave State, for
	  <lb/>two strong reasons. First, that the planters might per­
	  <lb/>petuate their predominant influence by adding to the
	  <lb/>slave representation, — the power of which is always
	  <lb/>concentrated against the interests of the free States. —
	  <lb/>Second, that a new market might be opened for their
	  <lb/>surplus slaves. It is lamentable to think that two votes
	  <lb/>in favor of <placeName>Missouri</placeName> slavery, were given by <placeName>Massachu­
	  <lb/>setts</placeName> men; and that those two votes would have turned
	  <lb/>the scale. The planters loudly threatened to dissolve
	  <lb/>the <name>Union</name>, if slavery were not extended beyond the <placeName>Mis­
	    <lb/>sissippi</placeName>. If the <name>Union</name> cannot be preserved without
	  <lb/>crime, it is an eternal truth that nothing good can be
	  <lb/>preserved <emph>by</emph> crime. The immense territories of <placeName>Louis­
	    <lb/>iana</placeName>, <placeName>Arkansas</placeName>, and <placeName>Florida</placeName> are very likely to be formed
	  <lb/>into slave States; and every new vote on this side, places

	  <lb/>and gives a renewed and apparently interminable lease
	  <lb/>to the duration of slavery.</p>
        <p>The purchase or the conquest of the <placeName>Texas</placeName>, is a favor­

	  <lb/>that the jealousy of the Mexican government places a
	  <lb/>barrier in that direction.</p>
        <p>The existence of slavery among us prevents the recog­
	  <lb/>nition of Haytian independence. That republic is fast
	  <lb/>increasing in wealth, intelligence and refinement. — Her
	  <lb/>commerce is valuable to us and might become much
	  <lb/>more so. But our Northern representatives have never
	  <lb/>even made an effort to have her independence acknow­
	  <lb/>ledged, because a colored ambassador would be so disa­
	  <lb/>greeable to our prejudices.</p>
        <p>Few are aware of the extent of <emph>sectional</emph> dislike in this
	  <lb/>country; and I would not speak of it, if I thought it pos­
	  <lb/>sible to add to it. The late <persName>John Taylor</persName>, a man of great
	  <lb/>natural talent, wrote a book on the agriculture of <placeName>Vir­
	  <lb/>ginia</placeName>, in which he acknowledges impoverishment, but
	  <lb/>attributes it all to the mismanagement of <emph>overseers</emph>. In
	  <lb/>this work, <persName>Mr Taylor</persName> has embodied more of the genuine
	  <lb/>spirit, the ethics and politics, of planters, than any other
	  <lb/>man; excepting perhaps, <persName>John Randolph</persName> in his speeches.
	  <lb/>He treats merchants, capitalists, bankers, and all other
	  <lb/>people not planters, as so many robbers, who live by
	  <lb/>plundering the slave owner, apparently forgetting by what
	  <lb/>plunder they themselves live.</p>
        <p><persName>Mr Jefferson</persName> and other eminent men from the South,
	  <lb/>have occasionally betrayed the same strong prejudices;
	  <lb/>but they were more guarded, lest the democracy of the
	  <lb/>North should be undeceived, and their votes lost. <persName>Mr
	  <lb/>Taylor's</persName> book is in high repute in the Southern States, and
	  <lb/>its sentiments widely echoed; but it is little known here.</p>
        <p>A year or two since, I received a letter from a pub­
	  <lb/>lisher who largely supplies the Southern market, in which
	  <lb/>he assured me that no book from the North would sell at
<pb n="128"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="11(4)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">128</mw>
	  <lb/>the South, unless the source from which it came, were
	  <lb/>carefully concealed! Yet <placeName>New England</placeName> has always
	  <lb/>yielded to Southern policy in preference to uniting with
	  <lb/>the Middle States, with which she has in most respects,
	  <lb/>a congeniality of interests and habits. It has been the
	  <lb/>constant policy of the slave States to prevent the free
	  <lb/>States from acting together.</p>
        <p>Who does not see that the American people are walk­
	  <lb/>ing over a subterranean fire, the flames of which are fed
	  <lb/>by slavery?</p>
        <p>The South no doubt gave her influence to <persName>General
	  <lb/>Jackson</persName>, from the conviction that a slave owner would
	  <lb/>support the slave-holding interest. The Proclamation
	  <lb/>against the nullifiers, which has given the President such
	  <lb/>sudden popularity at the North, has of course offended
	  <lb/>them. No person has a right to say that Proclamation
	  <lb/>is insincere. It will be extraordinary if a slave owner
	  <lb/>does in <emph>reality</emph> depart from the uniform system of
	  <lb/>his brethren. In the President's last Message, it is
	  <lb/>maintained that the wealthy land holders, that is, the
	  <lb/>planters, are the <emph>best</emph> part of the population; — it admits
	  <lb/>that the laws for raising of revenue by imposts have been
	  <lb/>in their operation oppressive to the South; — it recom­
	  <lb/>mends a gradual withdrawing of protection from manu­
	  <lb/>factures; — it advises that the public lands shall cease to
	  <lb/>be a source of revenue, as soon as practicable — that 
	  <lb/>they be sold to settlers — and in a <emph>convenient time</emph> the
	  <lb/>disposal of the soil be surrendered to <emph>the States respec­
	    <lb/>tively in which it lies</emph>; — lastly, the Message tends to
	  <lb/>discourage future appropriations of public money for
	  <lb/>purposes of internal improvement.</p>
        <p>Every one of these items is a concession to the slave-
	  <lb/>holding policy. If the public lands are taken from the
	  <lb/>nation, and given to the States in which the soil lies,
	  <lb/>who will get the largest share? That <emph>best</emph> part of the
	  <lb/>population called planters.</p>
        <p>The Proclamation and the Message are very unlike
	  <lb/>each other. Perhaps <placeName>South Carolina</placeName> is to obtain her
	  <lb/>own will by a route more certain, though more circuitous,
	  <lb/>than open rebellion. Time will show.</p>

        <p>So much excitement prevails with regard to these two
	  <lb/>societies at present, that it will be difficult to present a
	  <lb/>view of them which will be perfectly satisfactory to all.
	  <lb/>I shall say what appears to me, to be candid and true,
	  <lb/>without any anxiety as to whom it may please, and whom
	  <lb/>it may displease. I need not say that I have a decided
	  <lb/>predilection, because it has been sufficiently betrayed in
	  <lb/>the preceding pages; and I allude to it for the sake of
	  <lb/>perfect sincerity, rather than from any idea that my
	  <lb/>opinion is important.</p>
        <p>The <orgName>American Colonization Society</orgName> was organized a
	  <lb/>little more than sixteen years ago at the city of <placeName>Washing­
	    <lb/>ton</placeName>, chosen as the most central place in the <placeName>Union</placeName>. —
	  <lb/>Auxiliary institutions have since been formed in almost
	  <lb/>every part of the country; and nearly all the distinguish­
	  <lb/>ed men belong to it. The doing away of slavery in the
	  <lb/><placeName>United States</placeName>, by gradually removing all the blacks to
	  <lb/><placeName>Africa</placeName>, has been generally supposed to be its object. —
	  <lb/>The project at first excited some jealousy in the South­
	  <lb/>ern States; and the Society in order to allay this, were
	  <lb/>anxious to make all possible concessions to slave owners,
	  <lb/>in their Addresses, Reports, &amp;c. In <persName>Mr Clay's</persName> speech,
	  <lb/>printed in the first <title>Annual Report of the Society</title>, he said,
<pb n="130"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="11(5)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">130</mw>
	  <lb/><quote>It is far from the intention of this Society to affect, in
	    <lb/><emph>any manner</emph>, the tenure by which a certain species of
	    <lb/>property is held. I am myself a slave-holder, and I con­
	    <lb/>sider that kind of property as inviolable as any other in
	    <lb/>the country. I would resist encroachment upon it as
	    <lb/>soon, and with as much firmness as I would upon any
	    <lb/>other property that I hold. Nor am I prepared to go as
	    <lb/>far as the gentleman, who has just spoken (<persName>Mr Mercer</persName>)
	    <lb/>in saying that I would emancipate my slaves, if the
	    <lb/>means were provided of sending them from the country.</quote></p>
        <p>At the same meeting <persName>Mr Randolph</persName> said, <quote>He thought
	    <lb/>it necessary, being himself a slave-holder, to show that
	    <lb/>so far from being in the <emph>smallest degree</emph> connected with
	    <lb/>the abolition of slavery, the proposed Society <emph>would prove
	    <lb/>one of the greatest securities to enable the master to keep
	    <lb/>in possession his own property</emph>.</quote></p>
        <p>In <persName>Mr Clay's</persName> speech, in the second Annual Report, he
	  <lb/>declares: <quote>It is not proposed to deliberate upon, or con­
	    <lb/>sider at all, any question of emancipation, or any that is
	    <lb/><emph>connected</emph> with the abolition of slavery. On this condi­
	    <lb/>tion alone gentlemen from the South and West can be
	    <lb/>expected to coöperate. On this condition only, I have
	    <lb/>myself attended.</quote></p>
        <p>In the seventh Annual Report it is said, <quote>An effort
	    <lb/>for the benefit of the blacks, in which all parts of the
	    <lb/>country can unite, of course must not have the abolition
	    <lb/>of slavery for its immediate object; <emph>nor may it aim di­
	      <lb/>rectly at the instruction of the blacks</emph>.</quote></p>
        <p><persName>Mr Archer</persName> of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, fifteenth Annual Report, says,
	  <lb/><quote>The object of the Society, if I understand it aright, in­
	    <lb/>volves no intrusion on property, <emph>nor even upon prejudice</emph>.</quote></p>
        <p>In the speech of <persName>James S. Green</persName>, Esq. he says: <quote>This
	    <lb/>Society have ever disavowed, and they do yet disavow
	    <lb/>that their object is the emancipation of slaves. They
	    <lb/>have no <emph>wish</emph> if they <emph>could</emph> to interfere in the smallest
	    <lb/>degree with what they deem the most interesting and
	    <lb/>fearful subject, which can be pressed upon the American
	    <lb/>public. There is no people that treat their slaves with
	    <lb/>so much kindness and so little cruelty.</quote></p>
        <p>In almost every address delivered before the Society
	  <lb/>similar expressions occur. — On the propriety of discuss­
	  <lb/>ing the evils of slavery, without bitterness and without

	  <lb/>fear, good men may differ in opinion; though I think
	  <lb/>the time is fast coming, when they will all agree. —
	  <lb/>But by assuming the ground implied in the above re­
	  <lb/>marks, the <orgName>Colonization Society</orgName> have fallen into the
	  <lb/>habit of glossing over the enormities of the slave system;
	  <lb/>at least, it so appears to me. In their constitution they
	  <lb/>have pledged themselves not to speak, write, or do any­
	  <lb/>thing to offend the Southerners; and as there is no pos­
	  <lb/>sible way of making the truth pleasant to those who do
	  <lb/>not love it, the Society must perforce keep the truth out
	  <lb/>of sight. In many of their publications, I have thought
	  <lb/>I discovered a lurking tendency to palliate slavery; or,
	  <lb/>at least to make the best of it. They often bring to my
	  <lb/>mind the words of <persName>Hamlet</persName>:</p>

        </quote>
        <p>Thus in an Address delivered <date when="1833-03"><name>March</name>, 1833</date>, we are
	  <lb/>told, <quote>It ought never to be forgotten that the slave-trade
	    <lb/>between <placeName>Africa</placeName> and <placeName>America</placeName>, had its origin in a com­
	    <lb/>passionate endeavor to relieve, by the substitution of
	    <lb/>negro labor, the toils endured by native <name>Indians</name>. It was
	    <lb/>the <emph>simul<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">a</unclear>ted form of mercy</emph> that piloted the first slave-
	    <lb/>ship across the <placeName>Atlantic</placeName>.</quote></p>
        <p>I am aware that <persName>Las Cases</persName> used this argument; but
	  <lb/>it was less unbecoming in him than it is in a philanthro­
	  <lb/>pist of the present day. The speaker does indeed say
	  <lb/>that <quote>the <quote rend="pre(‘)post(’)">infinite of agonies</quote> and the infinite of crime,
	    <lb/>since suffered and committed, proves that mercy cannot ex­
	    <lb/>ist in opposition to justice.</quote> I can hardly realize what sort
	  <lb/>of a conscience it must be, that needed the demonstration.</p>
        <p>The plain truth was, the <name>Spaniards</name> were in a hurry
	  <lb/>for gold; they overworked the native <name>Indians</name>, who
	  <lb/>were inconsiderate enough to die in a very inconvenient
	  <lb/>numbers<gap extent="zero to one punctuation character" reason="flawed-reproduction" desc="printed"/> but the gold must be
 had,
	  and that quickly<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">;</unclear>
	  <lb/>and so the <name>Africans</name> were forced to come and die in com­
	  <lb/>pany with the <name>Indians</name>. And in the nineteenth century,
	  <lb/>we are told it is our duty not to forget that this was a
	  <lb/><quote>simulated form of mercy</quote>! A <mentioned><emph>dis</emph>simulated form</mentioned> would
	  <lb/>have been the better expression.</p>
        <p>If we may believe the slave owners, the whole system, from 
<pb n="132"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="11(6)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">132</mw>
	  <lb/>beginning to end, is a matter of mercy. They have
	  <lb/>described the <name>Middle Passage</name>, with its gags, fetters,
	  <lb/>and thumbscrews, as <quote>the happiest period of a negro's
	    <lb/>life</quote>; they say they do the slaves a great charity in
	  <lb/>bringing them from barbarous <name>Africa</name> to a civilized and
	  <lb/>Christian country; and on the plantation, under the
	  <lb/>whip of the driver, the negroes are so happy, that a <placeName>West
	  <lb/>India</placeName> planter publicly declared he could not look upon
	  <lb/>them, without wishing to be himself a slave.</p>
        <p>In the speech above referred to, we are told, that as to
	  <lb/>any political interference, <quote>the slave States are <emph>foreign</emph>
	    <lb/>States. We can alienate their feelings until they be­
	    <lb/>come foreign enemies; or, on the other hand, we can
	    <lb/>conciliate them until they become allies and auxiliaries
	    <lb/>in the sacred cause of emancipation.</quote></p>
        <p>But so long as the South insist that slavery is <soCalled rend="slant(italic)">unavoid­
	    <lb/>able</soCalled>, and say they will not tolerate any schemes <emph>tending</emph>
	  <lb/>to its abolition — and so long as the North take the <emph>ne­
	    <lb/>cessity</emph> of slavery for an unalterable truth, and put down
	  <lb/>any discussions, however mild and candid, which tend to
	  <lb/>show that it <emph>may</emph> be done away with safety — so long as
	  <lb/>we thus strengthen each other's hands in evil, what re­
	  <lb/>mote hope is there of emancipation? If by political
	  <lb/>interference is meant <emph>hostile</emph> interference, or even a desire
	  <lb/>to promote insurrection, I should at once pronounce it to
	  <lb/>be most wicked; and if by politial interference is meant
	  <lb/>the liberty to investigate this subject, as other subjects
	  <lb/>are investigated — to inquire into what has been done,
	  <lb/>and what may be done — I saw it is our sacred duty to
	  <lb/>do it. To enlighten public opinion is the best way that
	  <lb/>has yet been discovered for the removal of national evils;
	  <lb/>and slavery is certainly a <emph>national</emph> evil.</p>
        <p>The Southern States, according to their own evidence,
	  <lb/>are impoverished by it; a great amount of wretchedness
	  <lb/>and crime inevitably follows in its train; the prosperity
	  <lb/>of the North is continually checked by it; it promotes
	  <lb/>feelings of rivalry between the States; it separates our
	  <lb/>interests; makes our councils discordant; threatens the
	  <lb/>destruction of our government; and disgraces us in the
	  <lb/>eyes of the world. I have often heard <name>Americans</name> who
	  <lb/>had been abroad, declare that nothing embarrassed
<pb n="133"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="12(1)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">133</mw>
	  <lb/>them so much as being questioned about our slaves; and
	  <lb/>that nothing was so mortifying as to have the pictures of
	  <lb/>runaway negroes pointed at in the newspapers of this re­
	  <lb/>public. <persName>La Fayette</persName>, with all his admiration for our insti­
	  <lb/>tutions, can never speak of the subject without regret
	  <lb/>and shame.</p>
        <p>Now a common evil certainly implies a common right
	  <lb/>to remedy; and where is the remedy to be found, if the
	  <lb/>South in all their speeches and writings repeat that
	  <lb/>slavery <emph>must</emph> exist — if the <orgName>Colonization Society</orgName> re-echo,
	  <lb/>in all their Addresses and Reports, that there is no help
	  <lb/>for the evil, and it is very wicked to hint that there is —
	  <lb/>and if public opinion here brands every body a fanatic
	  <lb/>and madman, who wishes to <emph>inquire</emph> what can be done?
	  <lb/>The supineness of <placeName>New England</placeName> on this subject, reminds
	  <lb/>me of the man who being asked to work at the pump, be­
	  <lb/>cause the vessel was going down, answered, <said>I am only
	    <lb/>a passenger.</said></p>
        <p>An error often and urgently repeated is apt to receive
	  <lb/>the sanction of truth; and so it is in this case. The
	  <lb/>public take it for granted that slavery is a <quote>lamentable
	    <lb/><soCalled rend="slant(italic)">necessity</soCalled>.</quote> Nevertheless there
<emph>is</emph> a way to effect its cure,
	  <lb/>if we all join sincerely, earnestly, and kindly in the work;
	  <lb/>but if we expend our energies in palliating the evil, or
	  <lb/>mourning over its hopelessness, or quarreling about who
	  <lb/>is the most to blame for it, the vessel, — crew, passengers,
	  <lb/>and all, — will go down together.</p>
        <p>I object to the <orgName>Colonization Society</orgName>, because it tends
	  <lb/>to put public opinion asleep, on a subject where it needs
	  <lb/>to be wide awake.</p>
        <p>The address above alluded to, does indeed inform us
	  <lb/>of one thing which we are at liberty to do: <quote>We must
	    <lb/><emph>go</emph> to the master and <emph>adjure</emph> him, by all the sacred rights
	    <lb/>of humanity, by all the laws of natural justice, by his
	    <lb/>dread responsibilites, — which in the economy of Provi­
	    <lb/>dence, are always coëxtensive and commensurate with
	    <lb/>power, — to <emph>raise the slave</emph> out of his abyss of degrada­
	    <lb/>tion, to give him a participation in the benefits of mortal
	    <lb/>existence, and to make him a member of the <emph>intellectual</emph>
	    <lb/>and moral world, from which he, and his fathers, for so
	    <lb/>many generations, have been exiled.</quote> The practical

	  <lb/><emph>utility</emph> of such a plan needs no comment. Slave owners
	  <lb/>will smile when they read it.</p>
        <p>I will for a moment glance at what many suppose is
	  <lb/>still the intention of the <orgName>Colonization Society</orgName>, viz. grad­
	  <lb/>ually to remove all the blacks in the <placeName>United States</placeName>. The
	  <lb/>Society has been in operation more than fifteen years,
	  <lb/>during which it has transported between two and three
	  <lb/>thousand <emph>free</emph> people of color. There are in the <placeName>United
	  <lb/>States</placeName> two million of slaves, and three hundred thousand
	  <lb/>free blacks; and their numbers are increasing at the
	  <lb/>rate of seventy thousand annually. While the Society
	  <lb/>have removed less than three thousand, — five hundred
	  <lb/>thousand have been born. While one hundred and fifty
	  <lb/><emph>free</emph> blacks have been sent to <placeName>Africa</placeName> in a <emph>year</emph>, two hun­
	  <lb/>dred <emph>slaves</emph> have been born in a <emph>day</emph>. To keep the evil
	  <lb/>just where it is, seventy thousand a year, must be trans­
	  <lb/>ported. How many ships, and how many millions of
	  <lb/>money, would it require to do this? It would cost
	  <lb/>3,500,000 dollars a year, to provide for the safety of
	  <lb/>our Southern brethren in this way! To use the lan­
	  <lb/>guage of <persName>Mr Hayne</persName>, it would <quote>bankrupt the treasury
	    <lb/>of the world</quote> to execute the scheme. And if such a
	  <lb/>great number could be removed annually, how would
	  <lb/>the poor fellows subsist? Famines have already been
	  <lb/>produced, even by the few that have been sent. What
	  <lb/>would be the result of landing <emph>several</emph> thousand destitute
	  <lb/>beings, even on the most fertile of our own cultivated
	  <lb/>shores?</p>
        <p>And why <emph>should</emph> they be removed? Labor is greatly
	  <lb/>needed, and we are glad to give good wages for it. We
	  <lb/>encourage emigration from all parts of the world; why
	  <lb/>is it not good policy, as well as good feeling, to improve
	  <lb/>the colored people, and pay them for the use of their
	  <lb/>faculties? For centuries to come, the means of suste­
	  <lb/>nance in this vast country must be much greater than the
	  <lb/>population; then why should we drive away people, whose
	  <lb/>services may be most useful? If the moral cultivation of
	  <lb/>negroes received the attention it ought, thousands and
	  <lb/>thousands would at the present moment be gladly taken
	  <lb/>up in families, factories, &amp;c. And, like other men, they
	  <lb/>ought to be allowed to fit themselves for more important
	  <lb/>usefulness, as far and as fast as they can.</p>

        <p>There will, in all human probability, never be any de­
	  <lb/>crease in the black population of the <placeName>United States</placeName>.
	  <lb/>Here they are, and here they must remain, in very large
	  <lb/>numbers, do what we will. We may at once agree to
	  <lb/>live together in mutual good will, and perform a mutual
	  <lb/>use to each other — or we may go on, increasing tyranny
	  <lb/>on one side, and jealousy and revenge on the other, until
	  <lb/>the fearful elements complete their work of destruction,
	  <lb/>and something better than this sinful republic rises on the
	  <lb/>ruins. Oh, how earnestly do I wish that we may choose
	  <lb/>the holier and safer path!</p>
        <p>To transport the blacks in such annual numbers as
	  <lb/>has hitherto been done, cannot have any beneficial effect
	  <lb/>upon the present state of things. It is <persName>Dame Partington</persName>
	  <lb/>with her pail mopping up the rushing waters of the <placeName>At­
	  <lb/>lantic</placeName>! So far as this gradual removal has <emph>any</emph> effect, it
	  <lb/>tends to keep up the price of slaves in the market, and
	  <lb/>thus perpetuate the system. A writer in the <orgName>Kentucky
	    <lb/>Luminary</orgName>, speaking of colonization, uses the following
	  <lb/>argument: <quote>None are obliged to follow our example;
	    <lb/>and those who do not, <emph>will find the value of their ne­
	      <lb/>goes increased by the departure of ours</emph>.</quote></p>
        <p>If the value of slaves is kept up, it iwll be a strong
	  <lb/>temptation to smuggle in the commodity; and thus
	  <lb/>while one vessel carries them out from <placeName>America</placeName>, another
	  <lb/>will be bringing them in from <placeName>Africa</placeName>. This would be
	  <lb/>like dipping up the waters of <placeName>Chesapeake Bay</placeName> into bar­
	  <lb/>rels, conveying it across the <placeName>Atlantic</placeName>, and emptying it
	  <lb/>into the <placeName>Mediterranean</placeName>: the <placeName>Chesapeake</placeName> would remain
	  <lb/>as full as ever, and by the time the vessel returned, wind
	  <lb/>and waves would have brought the <emph>same</emph> water back
	  <lb/>again.</p>
        <p>Slave owners have never yet, in any part of the world,
	  <lb/>been known to favor, as a body, any scheme, which could
	  <lb/>ultimately <emph>tend</emph> to abolish slavery; yet in this country,
	  <lb/>they belong to the <orgName>Colonization Society</orgName> in large num­
	  <lb/>bers, and agree to pour from their State treasuries into
	  <lb/>its funds. Individuals object to it, it is true; but the
	  <lb/>scheme is very generally favored in the slave States.</p>
        <p>The following extract from <persName>Mr Wood's</persName> speech in the
	  <lb/>Legislature of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, will show upon what ground the

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">136</mw>
	  <lb/>owners of slaves are willing to sanction any schemes of
	  <lb/>benevolence. The <quote><orgName>Colonization Society</orgName> may be a part
	    <lb/>of the grand system of the Ruler of the Universe, to
	    <lb/>provide for the transfer of negroes to their <emph>mother</emph> coun­
	    <lb/>try. Their introduction into this land may have been
	    <lb/>one of the inscrutable ways of Providence to confer bless­
	    <lb/>ings upon that race — it may have been decreed that
	    <lb/>they shall be the means of conveying to the minds of
	    <lb/>their benighted countrymen, the blessing of religious
	    <lb/>and civil liberty. But I fear there is little ground to be­
	    <lb/>lieve the means have yet been created to effect so glori­
	    <lb/>ous a result, or that the present race of slaves are to be
	    <lb/>benefited by such a removal. <emph>I shall trust that many
	      <lb/>of them may be carried to the southwestern States as
	      <lb/>slaves</emph>. Should this door be closed, how can <placeName>Virginia</placeName> get
	    <lb/>rid of so large a number as are now annually deported
	    <lb/>to the different States and Territories where slaves are
	    <lb/>wanted? Can the gentlemen show us how from <emph>twelve
	      <lb/>thousand to twenty thousand</emph> can be <emph>annually</emph> carried to
	    <lb/><placeName>Liberia</placeName>?</quote></p>
        <p>Yet notwithstanding such numbers of mothers and
	  <lb/>children are yearly sent from a single State, <quote>separately
	    <lb/>or in lots,</quote> to supply the demands of the internal <mcr rend="slant(italic)">slave
	    <lb/>trade</mcr>, <persName>Mr Hayne</persName>, speaking of <emph>freeing</emph> these people and
	  <lb/>sending them away, says: <quote>It is wholly irreconcilable
	    <lb/>with <emph>our</emph> notions of humanity to <emph>tear asunder the tender
	      <lb/>ties</emph>, which they had formed among us, to gratify the
	    <lb/>feelings of a false philanthropy</quote>!</p>
        <p>As for the <emph>removal</emph> of blacks from this country, the
	  <lb/>real fact is this; the slave States are very desirous to get
	  <lb/>rid of their troublesome <emph>surplus</emph> of colored population,
	  <lb/>and they are willing that we should help to pay for the
	  <lb/>transportation. A double purpose is served by this; for
	  <lb/>the active benevolence which is eager to work in the
	  <lb/>cause, is thus turned into a harmless and convenient
	  <lb/>channel. Neither the planters nor the <orgName>Colonization So­
	    <lb/>ciety</orgName>, seem to ask what <emph>right</emph> we have to remove people
	  <lb/>from the places where they have been born and brought
	  <lb/>up, — where they have a home, which, however miser­
	  <lb/>able, is still their home, — and where their relatives and
	  <lb/>acquaintances all reside. <placeName>Africa</placeName> is no more their native

	  <lb/>country than <placeName>England</placeName> is ours,
	  <anchor xml:id="a34" corresp="#n34" rend="pre(*)"/> — nay, it is less so, be­
	  <lb/>cause there is no community of language or habits; —
	  <lb/>besides, we cannot say to them, as <persName>Gilpin</persName> said to his
	  <lb/>horse, <quote>'Twas for <emph>your</emph> pleasure you came here, you
	    <lb/>shall go back for mine.</quote></p>
        <p>In the <placeName>Virginia</placeName> Debate of <date when="1832">1832</date> it was agreed that
	  <lb/>very few of the free colored people would be <emph>willing</emph> to
	  <lb/>go to <placeName>Africa</placeName>; and this is proved by several petitions
	  <lb/>from them, praying for leave to remain. One of the
	  <lb/>Virginian legislators said, <quote>either <emph>moral</emph> or <emph>physical</emph> force
	    <lb/>must be used to compel them to go;</quote> some of them ad­
	  <lb/>vised immediate coercion; others recommended persua­
	  <lb/>sion first, until their numbers were thinned, and coercion
	  <lb/>afterward. I believe the resolution finally passed the
	  <lb/>House without any proviso of this sort; and I mention
	  <lb/>it merely to show that it was generally supposed the col­
	  <lb/>ored people would be unwilling to go.</p>
        <p>The planters are resolved to drive the free blacks
	  <lb/>away; and it is another evil of the <orgName>Colonization Society</orgName>
	  <lb/>that their funds and their influence cooperate with them in
	  <lb/>this project. They do not indeed thrust the free negroes
	  <lb/>off, at the point of the bayonet; but they make their <emph>laws</emph>
	  <lb/>and <emph>customs</emph> so very unequal and oppressive, that the poor
	  <lb/>fellows are surrounded by raging fires on every side, and
	  <lb/>must leap into the <placeName>Atlantic</placeName> for safety. In slave ethics I
	  <lb/>suppose this is called <quote rend="slant(italic)">moral force.</quote> If the slave popu­
	  <lb/>lation is left to its own natural increase, the crisis will
	  <lb/>soon come; for labor will be so very cheap that slavery
	  <lb/>will not be for the interest of the whites. Why should
	  <lb/>we retard this crisis?</p>
        <p>In the next place, many of the <name>Colonizationists</name>, (I do
	  <lb/>not suppose it applies to all) are averse to giving the 
	  <lb/>blacks a good education; and they are not friendly to
	  <lb/>the establishment of schools and colleges for that pur­
	  <lb/>pose. Now I would ask any candid person why colored
<mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(2)">12*</mw>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">138</mw>
	  <lb/>children should <emph>not</emph> be educated? Some say, it will
	  <lb/>raise them above their situation; I answer, it will raise
	  <lb/>them <emph>in</emph> their situation — not <emph>above</emph> it. When a High
	  <lb/>School for white girls was first talked of in this city,
	  <lb/>several of the wealthy class objected to it; because, said
	  <lb/>they, <quote>if everybody is educated, we shall have no ser­
	    <lb/>vants.</quote> This argument is based on selfishness, and
	  <lb/>therefore cannot stand. If carried into operation, the
	  <lb/>welfare of many would be sacrificed to the convenience
	  <lb/>of a few. We might as well protest against the sun­
	  <lb/>light, for the benefit of lamp-oil merchants. Of all mo­
	  <lb/>nopolies, a monopoly of <emph>knowledge</emph> is the worst. Let it
	  <lb/>be as active as the ocean — as free as the wind — as
	  <lb/>universal as the sun-beams! <persName>Lord <placeName>Brougham</placeName></persName> said very
	  <lb/>wisely, <quote>If the higher classes are afraid of being left in
	    <lb/>the rear, they likewise must hasten onward.</quote></p>
        <p>With our firm belief in the natural inferiority of ne­
	  <lb/>groes, it is strange we should be so much afraid that 
	  <lb/>knowledge will elevate them quite too high for our con­
	  <lb/>venience. In the march of improvement, we are sev­
	  <lb/>eral centuries in advance; and if, with this obstacle
	  <lb/>at the very beginning, they can outstrip us, why then,
	  <lb/>in the name of justice, let them go ahead? Nay,
	  <lb/>give them three cheers as they pass. If any nation,
	  <lb/>or any class of men, can obtain intellectual preë­
	  <lb/>inence, it is a sure sign they deserve it; and by this
	  <lb/>republican rule the condition of the world will be regu­
	  <lb/>lated as surely as the waters find their level.</p>
        <p>Besides, like all selfish policy, this is not <emph>true</emph> policy.
	  <lb/>The more useful knowledge a person has, the better he ful­
	  <lb/>fils his duties in <emph>any</emph> station; and there is no kind of know­
	  <lb/>ledge, high or low, which may not be brought into <emph>use</emph>.</p>
        <p>But it has been said, that information will make the
	  <lb/>blacks discontented; because, if ever so learned, they
	  <lb/>will not be allowed to sit at the white man's table, or
	  <lb/>marry the white man's daughter.</p>
        <p>In relation to this question, I would ask, <quote>Is there
	    <lb/>anybody so high, that they do not see others above
	    <lb/>them?</quote> The working classes of this country have no
	  <lb/>social communication with the aristocracy. Every day
	  <lb/>of my life I see people who can dress better, and live in
<pb n="139"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="12(4)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">139</mw>
	  <lb/>better houses, than I can afford. There are many indi­
	  <lb/>viduals who would not choose to make my acquaintance,
	  <lb/>because I am not of their <emph>caste</emph> — but I should speak a
	  <lb/>great untruth, if I said this made me discontented.
	  <lb/>They have their path and I have mine; I am happy in
	  <lb/>my own way, and am willing they should be happy in
	  <lb/>theirs. If asked whether what little knowledge I have
	  <lb/>produces discontent, I should answer, that it made me
	  <lb/>happier, infinitely happier, than I could be without it.</p>
        <p>Under every form of government, there will be distinct
	  <lb/>classes of society, which have only occasional and tran­
	  <lb/>sient communication with each other; and the colored
	  <lb/>people, whether educated or not, will form one of these
	  <lb/>classes. By giving them names of information, we in­
	  <lb/>crease their happiness, and make them better members
	  <lb/>of society. I have often heard it said that there was a
	  <lb/>disproportionate number of crimes committed by the
	  <lb/>colored people in this State. The same thing is true of
	  <lb/>the first generation of Irish emigrants; but we univer­
	  <lb/>sally attribute it to their ignorance, and agree that the
	  <lb/>only remedy is to give their children as good an educa­
	  <lb/>tion as possible. If the policy is wise in one instance,
	  <lb/>why would it not be so in the other?</p>
        <p>As for the possibility of social intercourse between
	  <lb/>the different colored races, <emph>I</emph> have not the slightest ob­
	  <lb/>jection to it, provided they were equally virtuous, and
	  <lb/>equally intelligent; but I do not wish to war with the
	  <lb/>prejudices of others; I am willing that all, who consult
	  <lb/>their consciences, should keep them as long as ever they
	  <lb/>can. One thing is certain, the blacks will never come
	  <lb/>into your houses, unless you <emph>ask</emph> them; and you need
	  <lb/>not ask them unless you choose. They are very far
	  <lb/>from being intrusive in this respect.</p>
        <p>With regard to marrying your daughters, I believe
	  <lb/>the feeling in opposition to such unions is quite as strong
	  <lb/>among the colored class, as it is among white people. —
	  <lb/>While the prejudice exists, such instances must be ex­
	  <lb/>ceedingly rare, because the consequence is degradation
	  <lb/>in society. Believe me, you may safely trust to anything
	  <lb/>that depends on the pride and selfishness of unregene­
	  <lb/>rated human nature.</p>

        <p>Perhaps, a hundred years hence, some negro <name>Roths­
	    <lb/>child</name> may come from <placeName>Hayti</placeName>, with his <measure>seventy <emph>millions</emph> of
	  <lb/>pounds</measure>, and persuade some white woman to <emph>sacrifice</emph> her­
	  <lb/>self to him — Stranger things than this do happen every
	  <lb/>year. — But before that century has passed away, I ap­
	  <lb/>prehend there will be a sufficient number of well-informed
	  <lb/>and elegant colored women in the world, to meet the de­
	  <lb/>mands of colored patricians. Let the sons and daughters
	  <lb/>of <placeName>Africa</placeName> <emph>both</emph> be educated, and then they will be fit for
	  <lb/>each other. They will not be forced to make war upon
	  <lb/>their white neighbors for wives; nor will they, if they
	  <lb/>have intelligent women of their own, see anything so
	  <lb/>vary desirable in the project. Shall we keep this class
	  <lb/>of people in everlasting degradation, for fear one of their
	  <lb/>descendants <emph>may</emph> marry our great-great-great-great-grand­
	  <lb/>child?</p>
        <p>While the prejudice exists, such unions cannot take
	  <lb/>place; and when the prejudice is melted away, they
	  <lb/>will cease to be a degradation, and of course cease to be
	  <lb/>an evil.</p>
        <p>My third and greatest objection to the <orgName>Colonization
	    <lb/>Society</orgName> is, that its members write and speak, both in
	  <lb/>public and private, as if the prejudice against skins
	  <lb/>darker colored than our own, was a fixed and unaltera­
	  <lb/>ble law of our nature, which cannot possibly be changed.
	  <lb/>The very <emph>existence</emph> of the Society is owing to this pre­
	  <lb/>judice: for if we could make all the colored people
	  <lb/>white, or if they could be viewed as impartially as if
	  <lb/>they were white, what would be left for the <orgName>Colonization
	    <lb/>Society</orgName> to do? Under such circumstances, they would
	  <lb/>have a fair chance to rise in their moral and intellectual
	  <lb/>character, and we should be glad to have them remain
	  <lb/>among us, to give their energies for our money, as the
	  <lb/><name>Irish</name>, the <name>Dutch</name>, and people from all parts of the world
	  <lb/>are now doing.</p>
        <p>I am aware that some of the <name>Colonizationists</name> make
	  <lb/>large professions on this subject; but nevertheless we are
	  <lb/>constantly told by this Society, that people of color must
	  <lb/>be removed, not only because they are in our way, but
	  <lb/>because they <emph>must</emph> always be in a state of degradation
	  <lb/>here — that they never <emph>can</emph> have all the rights and privi­

        <p>This is shaking hands with iniquity, and covering sin
	  <lb/>with a silver veil. Our prejudice against the blacks is
	  <lb/>founded in sheer pride; and i<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">t</unclear> originates in the circum­
	  <lb/>stance that people of their color only, are universally
	  <lb/>allowed to be slaves. We made slavery, and slavery
	  <lb/>makes the prejudice. No <name>Christian</name>, who questions his
	  <lb/>own conscience, can justify himself in indulging the feel­
	  <lb/>ing. The removal of this prejudice is not a matter of
	  <lb/>opinion — it is a matter of <emph>duty</emph>. We have no right to
	  <lb/>palliate a feeling, sinful in itself, and highly injurious to
	  <lb/>a large number of our fellow beings. Let us no longer
	  <lb/>set upon the narrow-minded idea, that we must always
	  <lb/>continue to do wrong, because we have so long been in
	  <lb/>the habit of doing it. That there is no <emph>necessity</emph> for the
	  <lb/>prejudice is shown by facts. In <placeName>England</placeName>, it exists to a
	  <lb/>much less degree than it does here. If a respectable col­

	  <lb/>ored person enters a church there, the pews are readily
	  <lb/>opened to him if he appears at an inn, room is made for
	  <lb/>him at the table, and no laughter, or winking, reminds
	  <lb/>him that he belongs to an outcast race. A highly re­
	  <lb/>spectable English gentleman residing in this country has
	  <lb/>often remarked that nothing filled him with such utter
	  <lb/>astonishment as our prejudice with regard to color. —
	  <lb/>There is now in old <placeName>England</placeName> a negro, with whose name,
	  <lb/>parentage, and history, I am well acquainted, who was
	  <lb/>sold into West Indian slavery by his <placeName>New England</placeName> mas­
	  <lb/>ter; (I know <emph>his</emph> name.) The unfortunate negro became
	  <lb/>free by the kindness of an individual, and has now a
	  <lb/>handsome little property, and the command of a vessel.
	  <lb/>He must take care not to come into the ports of our
	  <lb/>Southern republics! — The anecdote of <persName>Prince Saunders</persName>
	  <lb/>is well known; but it will bear repeating. He called
	  <lb/>upon an American family, then residing in <placeName>London</placeName>. —
	  <lb/>The fashionable breakfast hour was very late, and the
	  <lb/>family were still seated at the table. The lady fidgetted
	  <lb/>between the contending claims of politeness and preju­
	  <lb/>dice. At last, when all but herself had risen from the
	  <lb/>table, she said, as if struck by a sudden thought, <said><persName>Mr
	    <lb/>Saunders</persName>, I forgot to ask if you had breakfasted.</said> <said>I
	    <lb/>thank you, madam,</said> replied the colored gentleman;

	    <lb/>gent this morning.</said></p>
        <p><persName>Mr Wilberforce</persName> and <persName>Mr <placeName>Brougham</placeName></persName> have often been
	  <lb/>seen in the streets of <placeName>London</placeName>, walking arm in arm with
	  <lb/>people of color. The same thing is true of <persName>Brissot</persName>, <persName>La
	    <lb/>Fayette</persName>, and several other distinguished <name>Frenchmen</name>. —
	  <lb/>In this city, I never but once saw such an instance:
	  <lb/>When the <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> company were here last summer,
	  <lb/>I met one of the officers walking arm in arm with a fine
	  <lb/>looking black musician. The circumstance gave me a
	  <lb/>good deal of respect for the white man; for I thought
	  <lb/>he must have kind feelings and c<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">orre</unclear>ct principles, thus
	  <lb/>fearlessly to throw off a worse than idle prejudice.</p>
        <p>In <placeName>Brazil</placeName>, people of color are lawyers, clergymen,

	  <lb/>the wealthiest merchants are black. If we were accus­
	  <lb/>tomed to see intelligent and polished negroes, the preju­
	  <lb/>dice would soon disappear. There is certainly no law of
	  <lb/>our nature which makes a <emph>dark color</emph> repugnant to our
	  <lb/>feelings. We admire the swarthy beauties of <placeName>Spain</placeName>;
	  <lb/>and the finest forms of statuary are often preferred in
	  <lb/>bronze. If the whole world were allowed to vote on the
	  <lb/>question, there would probably be a plurality in favor of
	  <lb/>complexions decidedly dark. Everybody knows how
	  <lb/>much the <name>Africans</name> were amused at the sight of 
	  <persName>Mungo
	    <lb/>Park</persName>, and what an ugly misfortune they considered his
	  <lb/>pale color, prominent nose, and thin lips.</p>
        <p>Ought we to be called <name>Christians</name>, if we allow a preju­
	  <lb/>dice so absurd to prevent the improvement of a large
	  <lb/>portion of the human race, and interfere with what all
	  <lb/>civilized nations consider the most common rights of
	  <lb/>mankind? It cannot be that my enlightened and gen­
	  <lb/>erous countrymen will sanction anything so narrow-
	  <lb/>minded and so selfish.</p>
        <p>Having found much fault with the <orgName>Colonization Soci­
	    <lb/>ety</orgName>, it is pleasant to believe that one portion of their
	  <lb/>enterprise affords a distant prospect of doing more good
	  <lb/>than evil. They now principally seek to direct the pub­
	  <lb/>lic attention to the founding of a Colony in <placeName>Africa</placeName>; and
	  <lb/>this may prove beneficial in process of time. If the col­
	  <lb/>ored emigrants were <emph>educated</emph> before they went there, 
	  <lb/>such a Colony would tend slowly, but certainly, to
	  <lb/>enlighten <placeName>Africa</placeName>, to raise the character of the negroes,
	  <lb/>to strengthen the increasing liberality of public opinion,
	  <lb/>and to check the diabolical slave trade. If the <name>Coloni­
	    <lb/>zationists</name> will work zealously and judiciously in this de­
	  <lb/>partment, pretend to do nothing more, and let others
	  <lb/>work in another and more efficient way, they will deserve
	  <lb/>the thanks of the country; but while it is believed that
	  <lb/>they do all the good which <emph>can</emph> be done in this important
	  <lb/>cause, they will <ref type="error" xml:id="er2" target="#ec2">do

	  <lb/>could possibly be expected, when we consider that the
	  <lb/>emigrants are almost universally ignorant and vicious,
	  <lb/>without property, and without habits of industry or en­
	  <lb/>terprise. The colored people in our slave States must,
	  <lb/>almost without exception, be destitute of information;
	  <lb/>and in choosing negroes to send away, the masters
	  <lb/>would be very apt to select the most helpless and the
	  <lb/>most refractory. Hence the superintendents of <placeName>Liberia</placeName>
	  <lb/>have made reiterated complaints of being flooded with
	  <lb/>ship-loads of <quote>vagrants.</quote> These causes are powerful
	  <lb/>drawbacks. But the negroes in <placeName>Liberia</placeName> have schools

	  <lb/>principally that they cannot find proper subjects for in­
	  <lb/>struction. Why cannot such subjects be found? Sim­

	  <lb/>ply because our ferocious prejudices compel the colored
	  <lb/>children to grow up in ignorance and vicious compan­
	  <lb/>ionship, and when we seek to educate them, we find their
	  <lb/>minds closed against the genial influence of knowledge.</p>
        <p>When I heard of the <orgName>Education Society</orgName>, I did hope
	  <lb/>to fine one instance of <emph>sincere, thorough, disinterested</emph>
	  <lb/>good will for the blacks. But in the consitution of that
	  <lb/>Society, I again find the selfish principle predominant.
	  <lb/>They pledge themselves to educate no colored persons,
	  <lb/>unless they are solemnly bound to <emph>quit the country</emph>.
	  <lb/>The abolitionists are told that they must wait till the
	  <lb/>slaves are more fit for freedom. But if this system is
	  <lb/>pursued, when are they to be more fit for freedom?
	  <lb/>Never — never — to the end of time.</p>
        <p>Whatever other good the <orgName>Colonization Society</orgName> may do,
	  <lb/>it seems to me evident that they do not produce <emph>any</emph>
	  <lb/>beneficial effect on the condition of colored people in
	  <lb/><placeName>America</placeName>; and indirectly they produce much evil.</p>
        <p>In a body so numerous as the <orgName>Colonization Society</orgName>,
	  <lb/>there is, of course, a great variety of character and opin­
	  <lb/>ions. I presume that many among them believe the ulti­
	  <lb/>mate tendency of the Society to be very different from
	  <lb/>what it really is. Some slave owners encourage it,
	  <lb/>because they think it cannot decrease slavery, and will
	  <lb/>keep back the inconvenient crisis when free labor will be
	  <lb/>cheaper than slave labor; others of the same class join
	  <lb/>it because they really want to do some act of kindness
	  <lb/>to the unfortunate African race, and all the country in­
	  <lb/>sists upon it that this is the only way; some politicians
	  <lb/>in the free States countenance it from similar motives,
	  <lb/>and because less cautious measures might occasion a
	  <lb/>loss of Southern votes and influence; the time-serving
	  <lb/>class — so numerous in every community, — who are
	  <lb/>always ready to flatter existing prejudices, and sail
	  <lb/>smoothly along the current of popular favor, join it, of
	  <lb/>course; but I am willing to believe that the largest pro­
	  <lb/>portion belong to it, because they have compassionate
	  <lb/>hearts, are fearful of injuring their Southern breth­
	  <lb/>ren, and really think there is no other way of doing so
	  <lb/>much good to the negroes. With this last mentioned
	  <lb/>class, I sympathize in feeling, but differ in opinion.</p>

        <p>The <orgName>Anti-Slavery Society</orgName> was formed in <date when="1832-01"><name>January</name>,
	    <lb/>1832</date>. Its objects are distinctly stated in the second
	  <lb/>Article of their constitution, which is as follows:</p>
        <p>
          <quote><label rend="case(smallcaps)">Art. 2.</label> The objects of the Society shall be, to endeavor,
	    <lb/>by all means sanctioned by law, humanity and religion, to ef­
	    <lb/>fect the abolition of slavery in the <placeName>United States</placeName>; to improve
	    <lb/>the character and condition of the free people of color, to in­
	    <lb/>form and correct public opinion in relation to their situation
	    <lb/>and rights, and obtain for them equal civil and political rights
	    <lb/>and privileges with the whites.</quote>
        </p>
        <p>From this it will be seen that they think it a duty to
	  <lb/>give colored people all possible means of education, and
	  <lb/>instead of removing them away from the prejudice, to
	  <lb/>remove the prejudice away from them.</p>
        <p>They lay it down as a maxim that immediate emanci­
	  <lb/>pation is the only just course, and the only safe policy.
	  <lb/>They say that slavery is a common evil, and therefore
	  <lb/>there is a common right to investigate it, and search for
	  <lb/>modes of relief. They say that <placeName>New England</placeName> shares,
	  <lb/>and ever has shared, in this national sin, and is therefore
	  <lb/>bound to atone for the mischief, as far as it can be done.</p>
        <p>The strongest reason why the <orgName>Anti-Slavery Society</orgName>
	  <lb/>wish for the emancipation of slaves, is because they
	  <lb/>think no other course can be pursued which does not,
	  <lb/>in its very nature, involve a constant violation of the
	  <lb/>laws of God. In the next place, they believe there is
	  <lb/>no other sure way of providing for the safety of the
	  <lb/>white population in the slave States. I know that many
	  <lb/>of the planters affect to laugh at the idea of fearing
	  <lb/>their slaves; but why are their laws framed with such
	  <lb/>cautious vigilance? Why must not negroes of different
	  <lb/>plantations communicate together? Why are they not
	  <lb/>allowed to be out in the vening, or to carry even a stick
	  <lb/>to defend themselves, in case of necessity?</p>
        <p>In the <placeName>Virginia</placeName> Legislature a gentleman said, <quote>It was
	    <lb/>high time for something to be done when men did not
	    <lb/>dare to open their own doors without pistols at their
	    <lb/>belts;</quote> and <persName>Mr Randolph</persName> has publicly declared that a
	  <lb/>planter was merely <quote>a sentry at his own door.</quote></p>
        <p><persName>Mr Roane</persName> of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, asks, — <quote>Is there an intelli­
	    <lb/>gent man who does not know that this <emph>excess</emph> of slavery
<pb n="147"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="13(2)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">147</mw>
	    <lb/>is increasing, and will continue to increase in a ratio
	    <lb/>which is alarming in the extreme, and must overwhelm
	    <lb/>our descendants in ruin? Why then should we shut our
	    <lb/>eyes and turn our backs upon the evil? Will delay ren­
	    <lb/>der it less gigantic, or give us more <rs type="properAdjective">Herculean</rs> strength
	    <lb/>to meet and subdue it at a future time? Oh, no — delay
	    <lb/>breeds danger — procrastination is the thief of time, and
	    <lb/>the refuge of sluggards.</quote></p>
        <p>It is very true that insurrection is perfect madness on
	  <lb/>the part of the slaves; for they are sure to be overpow­
	  <lb/>ered. But such madness has happened; and innocent
	  <lb/>women and children have fallen victims to it.</p>
        <p>A few months ago, I was conversing with a very mild
	  <lb/>and judicious member of the <orgName>Anti-Slavery Society</orgName>, when
	  <lb/>a gentleman originally from the South came in. As he
	  <lb/>was an old acquaintance, and had been a long time resi­
	  <lb/>dent in <placeName>New England</placeName>, it was not deemed necessary, as a
	  <lb/>matter of courtesy, to drop the conversation. He soon
	  <lb/>became excited. <said>Whatever you may think, <persName>Mrs
	    <lb/>Child</persName>,</said> said he, <said>the slaves are a great deal happier
	      <lb/>than either of us; the less people know, the more merry
	      <lb/>they are.</said> I replied, <said>I heard you a short time since
	    <lb/>talking over your plans for educating your son; if know­
	    <lb/>ledge brings wretchedness, why do you not keep him in
	    <lb/>happy ignorance?</said> <said>The fashion of the times requires
	    <lb/>some information,</said> said he; <said>but why do you concern
	    <lb/>yourself about the negroes? Why don't you excite the
	    <lb/>horses to an insurrection, because they are obliged to
	    <lb/>work, and are whipped if they do not?</said> <said>One <emph>horse</emph>
	    <lb/>does not whip another,</said> said I; <said>and besides, I do not
	    <lb/>wish to promote insurrections. I would, on the contrary,
	    <lb/>do all I could to prevent them.</said> <said>Perhaps you do not
	    <lb/>like the comparison between slaves and horses,</said> rejoined
	  <lb/>he; <said>it is true, the horses have the advantage.</said> I 
	  <lb/>made no reply; for where such ground is assumed, what
	  <lb/><emph>can</emph> be said; besides, I did not then, and I do not
	  <lb/>now, believe that he expressed his real feelings. He was
	  <lb/>piqued, and spoke unadvisedly. This gentleman denied
	  <lb/>that the lot of the negroes was hard. He said they
	  <lb/>loved their masters, and their masters loved them; and
	  <lb/>in any cases of trouble or illness, a man's slaves were
<pb n="148"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="13(2)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">148</mw>
	  <lb/>his best friends. I mentioned some undoubted instances
	  <lb/>of cruelty to slaves; he acknowledged that such instan­
	  <lb/>ces might very rarely happen, but said that in general
	  <lb/>the masters were much more to be pitied than the ne­
	  <lb/>groes. A lady, who had been in <placeName>South Carolina</placeName> when
	  <lb/>an insurrection was apprehended, related several anec­
	  <lb/>dotes concerning the alarm that prevailed there at the
	  <lb/>time: and added, <said>I often wish that none of my friends
	    <lb/>lived in a slave State.</said> <said>Why should you be anxious?</said>
	  <lb/>rejoined the Southern gentleman; <said>You know that they
	    <lb/>have built a strong citadel in the heart of the city, to 
	    <lb/>which all the inhabitants can repair, in case of insur­
	    <lb/>rection.</said> <said>So,</said> said I, <said>they have built a <emph>citadel</emph> to
	    <lb/>protect them from their happy, contented servants — a
	    <lb/>citadel against their <soCalled rend="slant(italic)">best friends</soCalled>!</said> I could not but be
	  <lb/>amused at the contradictions that occured during this
	  <lb/>conversation.</p>
        <p>That emancipation has in several instances been ef­
	  <lb/>fected with safety has been already shown. But allowing
	  <lb/>that there is some danger in discontinuing slavery, is
	  <lb/>there not likewise danger in continuing it? In one
	  <lb/>case, the danger, if there were any, would soon be sub­
	  <lb/>dued; in the other, it is continually increasing.</p>
        <p>The planter tells us that the slave is very happy, and
	  <lb/>bids us leave him as he is. If laughter is a sign of hap­
	  <lb/>piness, the <name>Irishman</name>, tombling in the same mire as his
	  <lb/>pigs, is happy. The merely sensual man is no doubt
	  <lb/>merry and heedless; but who would call him happy?
	  <lb/>Is it not a fearful thing to keep immortal beings in a
	  <lb/>state like beasts? The more the senses are subjected
	  <lb/>to the moral and intellectual powers, the happier man is,
	  <lb/>— the more we learn to sacrifice the present to the future,
	  <lb/>the higher do we rise in the scale of existence. The
	  <lb/>negro may often enjoy himself, like the dog when he is
	  <lb/>not beaten, or the hog when he is not starved; but let
	  <lb/>not this be called <soCalled rend="slant(italic)">happiness</soCalled>.</p>
        <p>How far the slave laws are conducive to the enjoyment
	  <lb/>of those they govern, each individual can judge for him­
	  <lb/>self. In the Southern papers, we continually see pic­
	  <lb/>tures of runaway negroes, and sometimes the advertise­
	  <lb/>ments identify them by scars, or by letters branded upon
<pb n="149"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="13(3)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">149</mw>
	  <lb/>them. Is it natural for men to run away from comfort
	  <lb/>and happiness, especially when any one who meets them
	  <lb/>may shoot them, like a dog? and when whipping nearly
	  <lb/>unto death is authorized as the punishment? I forbear
	  <lb/>to describe how much more shocking slave whipping is
	  <lb/>than anything we are accustomed to see bestowed upon
	  <lb/>cattle.</p>
        <p>But the advocates of slavery tell us, that on the ne­
	  <lb/>gro's own account, it is best to keep him in slavery; that
	  <lb/>without a master to guide him and take care of him, he
	  <lb/>is a wretched being; that freedom is the greatest curse
	  <lb/>that can be bestowed upon him. Then why do their
	  <lb/>Legislatures grant it as a reward for <quote rend="slant(italic)">meritorious servi­
	    <lb/>ces to the State</quote>? Why do benevolent masters be­
<lb/>queath the legacy of freedom, <quote>in consideration on long
<lb/>and faithful service</quote>? Why did <persName>Jefferson</persName> so earnestly,
	  <lb/>and so very humbly request the Legislature of <placeName>Virginia</placeName> 
	  <lb/>to ratify the manumission of his five <emph>favorite</emph> slaves?</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the disadvantageous position of free
	  <lb/>negroes in a community consisting of whites and slaves,
	  <lb/>it is evident that, even upon these terms, freedom is con­
	  <lb/>sidered a blessing.</p>
        <p>The <orgName>Anti-Slavery Society</orgName> agrees with <persName>Harriet Marti­
	    <lb/>neau</persName> in saying, <quote>Patience with the <emph>men</emph>, but no patience
	    <lb/>with the <emph>principles</emph>. As much patience as you please in
	    <lb/>enlightening those who are unaware of the abuses, but
	    <lb/>no patience with social crimes</quote>!</p>
        <p>The <orgName>Colonization Society</orgName> are always reminding us
	  <lb/>that the <emph>master</emph> has rights as well as the slave: The
	  <lb/><orgName>Anti-Slavery Society</orgName> urge us to remember that the <emph>slave</emph>
	  <lb/>has rights as well as the master. I leave it for sober
	  <lb/>sense to determine which of these claims is in the great­
	  <lb/>est danger of being forgotten.</p>
        <p>The abolitionists think it a duty to maintain at all
	  <lb/>times, and in all places, that slavery <emph>ought</emph> to be abol­
	  <lb/>ished, and that it <emph>can</emph> be abolished. When error is so
	  <lb/>often repeated it becomes very important to repeat the
	  <lb/>truth; especially as good men are apt to be quiet, and
	  <lb/>selfish men are prone to be active. They propose no
	  <lb/><emph>plan</emph> — they leave that to the wisdom of Legislatures. —
	  <lb/>But they never swerve from the <emph>principle</emph> that slavery is
<mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(4)">13*</mw>
<pb n="150"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="13(3)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">150</mw>
	  <lb/>both wicked and unnecessary. Their object is to turn the
	  <lb/>public voice against this evil, by a plain exposition of facts.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it may seem of little use for individuals to
	  <lb/>maintain any particular <emph>principle</emph>, while they do not at­
	  <lb/>tempt to prescribe the ways and means by which it can
	  <lb/>be carried into operation: But the voice of the public
	  <lb/>is mighty, either for good or evil; and that far sounding
	  <lb/>echo is composed of single voices.</p>
        <p><persName>Schiller</persName> makes his <persName>Fiesco</persName> exclaim, <quote>Spread out the
	    <lb/>thunder into its <emph>single</emph> tones, and it becomes a lullaby for
	    <lb/>children; pour it forth in <emph>one</emph> quick peal, and the royal
	    <lb/>sound shall move the heavens!</quote></p>
        <p>If the work of abolition must necessarily be slow in its
	  <lb/>progress, so much the more need of beginning soon, and
	  <lb/>working vigorously. My life upon it, a safe remedy
	  <lb/>can be found for this evil, whenever we are sincerely de­
	  <lb/>sirous of doing justice for its own sake.</p>
        <p>The <orgName>Anti-Slavery Society</orgName> is loudly accused of being
	  <lb/>seditious, fanatical, and likely to promote insurrections.
	  <lb/>It seems to be supposed, that they wish to send fire and
	  <lb/>sword into the South, and encourage the slaves to hunt
	  <lb/>down their masters. Slave owners wish to have it
	  <lb/>viewed in this light, because they know that the subject
	  <lb/>they have chosen, will not bear discussion; and men
	  <lb/>here, who give the tone to public opinion, have loudly re­
	  <lb/>peated the charge — some from good motives and some
	  <lb/>from bad. I once had a very strong prejudice against
	  <lb/>anti-slavery; — (I am ashamed to think <emph>how</emph> strong —
	  <lb/>for mere prejudice should never be stubborn,) but a can­
	  <lb/>did examination has convinced me, that I was in an
	  <lb/>error. I made the common mistake of taking things for
	  <lb/>granted, without stopping to investigate.</p>
        <p>This Society do not not wish to see any coercive or dan­
	  <lb/>gerous measures pursued. They wish for universal
	  <lb/>emancipation, because they believe it is the only way to
	  <lb/><emph>prevent</emph> insurrections. Almost every individual among
	  <lb/>them, is a strong friend to Peace Societies. They wish
	  <lb/>to move the public mind on this subject, in the same
	  <lb/>manner that it has been moved on other subjects: viz.
	  <lb/>by open, candid, fearless discussion. This is <emph>all</emph> they
	  <lb/>want to do; and this they are determined to do, because
	  <lb/>they believe it to be an important duty. For a long time

	  <lb/>past, public sympathy has been earnestly directed in the
	  <lb/>wrong way; if it could be made to turn round, a most
	  <lb/>happy change would be produced. There are many
	  <lb/>people at the South who would be glad to have a safe
	  <lb/>method of emancipation discovered; but instead of en­
	  <lb/>couraging <emph>them</emph>, all our presses, and pulpits, and books,
	  <lb/>and conversation, have been used to strengthen the
	  <lb/>hands of those who wish to perpetuate the <quote>costly ini­
	    <lb/>quity.</quote> Divine Providence <emph>always</emph> opens the way for
	  <lb/>the removal of evils, individual or national, whenever
	  <lb/>man is sincerely willing to have them removed; it may
	  <lb/>be difficult to do right, but it is never impossible. Yet
	  <lb/>a majority of my countrymen do, in effect, hold the fol­
	  <lb/>lowing language: <quote>We know that this evil <emph>cannot</emph> be
	    <lb/>cured; and we will speak and publish our opinion on
	    <lb/>every occasion; but you must not, for your lives, dare to
	    <lb/>assert that there is a possibility of our being mistaken.</quote></p>
        <p>If there were any apparent wish to get rid of this
	  <lb/>sin and disgrace, I believe the members of the <orgName>Anti-
	    <lb/>Slavery Society</orgName> would most heartily and courageously
	  <lb/>defend slave owners from any risk they might incur in
	  <lb/>a sincere effort to do right. They would teach the ne­
	  <lb/>gro that it is the <name>Christian's</name> duty meekly and patiently
	  <lb/>to <emph>suffer</emph> wrong; but they dare not excuse the white man
	  <lb/>for continuing to <emph>inflict</emph> the wrong.</p>
        <p>They think it unfair that all arguments on this sub­
	  <lb/>ject should be founded on the convenience and safety
	  <lb/>of the master <emph>alone</emph>. They wish to see the white man's
	  <lb/>claims have their due weight; but they insist that the
	  <lb/>negro's rights ought not to be thrown out of the balance.</p>
        <p>At the time a large reward was offered for the cap­
	  <lb/>ture of <persName>Mr Garrison</persName>, on the ground that his paper excited
	  <lb/>insurrections, it is a fact, that he had never sent or
	  <lb/>caused to be sent, a single paper south of <placeName>Mason and
	    <lb/>Dixon's line</placeName>. He <emph>afterwards</emph> sent papers to some of the
	  <lb/>leading politicians there; but they of course were not
	  <lb/>the ones to promote negro insurrections. <quote>But,</quote> it has
	  <lb/>been answered, <quote>the papers did find their way there.</quote>
	  <lb/>Are we then forbidden to publish our opinions upon an
	  <lb/>important subject, for fear <emph>somebody</emph> will send them
	  <lb/><emph>somewhere</emph>? Is slavery to remain a sealed book in this most
	  <lb/>communicative of all ages, and this most inquisitive of

	  <lb/>all countries? If so, we live under an actual censorship
	  <lb/>of the press. This is like what the <name>Irishman</name> said of our
	  <lb/>paved cities — tying down the stones, and letting the
	  <lb/>mad dogs run loose.</p>
        <p>If insurrections do occur, they will no doubt be attri­
	  <lb/>buted to the <orgName>Anti-Slavery Society</orgName>. But we must not for­
	  <lb/>get that there were insurrections in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName> long 
	  <lb/>before the English abolitionists began their efforts; and
	  <lb/>that masters were murdered in this country, before the
	  <lb/><orgName>Anti-Slavery Society</orgName> was thought of. Neither must
	  <lb/>we forget that the increased severity of the laws is very
	  <lb/>likely to goad an oppressed people to madness. The
	  <lb/>very cruelty of the laws against resistance under any cir­
	  <lb/>cumstances, would be thought to justify a white man in
	  <lb/>rebellion, because it gives resistance the character of self-
	  <lb/>defence. <quote>The law,</quote> says <persName>Blackstone</persName>, <quote>respects the
	    <lb/>passions of the human mind; and when external violence
	    <lb/>is offered to a man himself, or those to whom he bears a
	    <lb/>near connexion, makes it lawful in him to do himself
	    <lb/>that immediate justice, to which he is prompted by nature,
	    <lb/>and which no prudential motives are strong enough to
	    <lb/>restrain.</quote></p>
        <p>As it respects promoting insurrections by discussing
	  <lb/>this subject, it should be remembered that it is very
	  <lb/>rare for any colored person at the South to know how
	  <lb/>to read or write.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, if there be danger in the discussion, <emph>our</emph>
	  <lb/>silence cannot arrest it; for the whole world is talking
	  <lb/>and writing about it; — even children's handkerchiefs
	  <lb/>seem to be regarded as sparks falling into a powder
	  <lb/>magazine. How much better it would be not to live
	  <lb/>in the midst of a powder magazine.</p>
        <p>The English abolitionists have labored long and ardu­
	  <lb/>ously. Every inch of the ground has been contested. —
	  <lb/>After obtaining the decision that negroes brought into
	  <lb/><placeName>England</placeName> were freemen, it took them <emph>thirtyfive years</emph> to
	  <lb/>obtain the abolition of the slave <emph>trade</emph>. But their pro­
	  <lb/>gress, though slow and difficult, has been certain. They
	  <lb/>are now on the very eve of entire, unqualified emanci­
	  <lb/>pation in all their colonies. I take very little interest in
	  <lb/>politics, unless they bear upon the subject of slavery; —
	  <lb/>and then I throw my whole soul into them. Hence the

	  <lb/>permanence of <persName>Lord Grey's</persName> ministry has become an ob­
	  <lb/>ject of intense interest. But all <placeName>England</placeName> is acting as
	  <lb/>one man on this subject, and she <emph>must</emph> prevail.</p>
        <p>The good work has indeed been called by every odious
	  <lb/>epithet. It was even urged that the abolition of the
	  <lb/>slave <emph>trade</emph> would encourage the massacre of white men.
	  <lb/><persName>Clarkson</persName>, who seems to have been the meekest and most
	  <lb/>patient of men, was stigmatized as an insurrectionist. —
	  <lb/>It was said he wanted to bring all the horrors of the
	  <lb/><name>French Revolution</name> into <placeName>England</placeName>, merely because he
	  <lb/>wanted to abolish the slave <emph>trade</emph>. — It was said <placeName>Liver­
	    <lb/>pool</placeName> and <placeName>Bristol</placeName> would sink, never to rise again, if that
	  <lb/>traffic were destroyed.</p>
        <p>The insurrection at <placeName>Barbadoes</placeName>, in <date when="1816">1816</date>, was ascribed
	  <lb/>to the influence of missionaries infected with the wicked
	  <lb/>philanthropy of the age; but it was discovered that
	  <lb/>there was no missionary on the island at the time of that
	  <lb/>event, nor for a long time previous to it. The insurrec­
	  <lb/>tion at <placeName>Demerara</placeName>, several years after, was publicly and
	  <lb/>angrily ascribed to the Methodist missionaries; they
	  <lb/>were taken up and imprisoned; and it was lucky for
	  <lb/>these innocent men, that, out of their twelve hundred
	  <lb/>black converts, only <emph>two</emph> had joined the rebellion.</p>
        <p>Ridicule and reproach has been abundantly heaped
	  <lb/>upon the laborers in this righteous cause. Power,
	  <lb/>wealth, talent, pride, and sophistry, are all in arms
	  <lb/>against them; but God and truth is on their side. The
	  <lb/>cause of anti-slavery is rapidly gaining ground. Wise
	  <lb/>heads as well as warm hearts, are joining in its support.
	  <lb/>In a few years I believe the opinion of <placeName>New England</placeName> will
	  <lb/>be unanimous in its favor. <placeName>Maine</placeName>, which enjoys the
	  <lb/>enviable distinction of never having had a slave upon
	  <lb/>her soil, has formed an <orgName>Anti-Slavery Society</orgName> composed
	  <lb/>of her best and most distinguished men. Those who are
	  <lb/>determined to be on the popular side, should be cautious
	  <lb/>how they move just now: It is a trying time for such
	  <lb/>characters, when public opinion is on the verge of a great
	  <lb/>change.</p>
        <p>Men who <emph>think</emph> upon the subject, are fast coming to
	  <lb/>the conclusion that slavery can never be much amelior­
	  <lb/>ated, while it is allowed to exist. What <persName>Mr Fox</persName> said of
	  <lb/>the <emph>trade</emph> is true of the <emph>system</emph> — <quote>you may as well try

	    <lb/>to <emph>regulate</emph> murder.</quote> It is a disease as deadly as the
	  <lb/>cancer; and while one particle of it remains in the con­
	  <lb/>stitution, no cure can be effected. The relation is unnat­
	  <lb/>ural in itself, and therefore it reverses all the rules
	  <lb/>which are applied to other human relations. Thus a
	  <lb/>free government, which in every other point of view is a
	  <lb/>blessing, is a curse to the slave. The liberty around him
	  <lb/>is contagious, and therefore the laws must be endowed
	  <lb/>with a tenfold crushing power, or the captive will break
	  <lb/>his chains. A despotic monarch can follow the impulses
	  <lb/>of humanity without scruple. When <persName>Vidius Pollio</persName> or­
	  <lb/>dered one of his slaves to be cut in pieces and thrown
	  <lb/>into his fish pond, the <persName>Emperor Augustus</persName> commanded
	  <lb/>him to emancipate immediately, not only that slave, but
	  <lb/>all his slaves. In a free State there is no such power;
	  <lb/>and there would be none needed, if the laws were equal,
	  <lb/>— but the slave owners are legislators, and <emph>make</emph> the
	  <lb/>laws, in which the negro has no voice — the master in­
	  <lb/>fluences public opinion, but the slave cannot.</p>
        <p><persName>Miss Martineau</persName> very wisely says; <quote>To attempt to
	    <lb/>combine freedom and slavery is to put new wine into old
	    <lb/>skins. Soon may the old skins burst! for we shall never
	    <lb/>want for better wine than they have ever held.</quote></p>
        <p>A work has been lately published, written by <persName>Jonathan
	  <lb/>Dymond</persName>, who was a member of the <orgName>Society of Friends</orgName>,
	  <lb/>in <placeName>England</placeName>; it is entitled <title rend="pre(“)post(”)">Essays on the Principles of
	    <lb/>Morality</title> — and most excellent Essays they are. Ev­

	  <lb/>selfish considerations to our inward perceptions of duty;
	  <lb/>and therefore every page shines with the mild but pow­
	  <lb/>erful light of true christian philosophy. I rejoice to
	  <lb/>hear that the book is likely to be republished in this
	  <lb/>country. In his remarks on slavery the author says:
	  <lb/><quote>The supporters of the <emph>system</emph> will hereafter be regarded
	    <lb/>with the same public feelings, as he who was an advo­
	    <lb/>cate of the slave <emph>trade</emph> now is. How is it that legislators

	  <lb/><name>Africans</name> and their descendants, we must first clearly
	  <lb/>make up our minds whether they are, or are not, human
	  <lb/>being — whether they have, or have not, the same capa­
	  <lb/>cities for improvement as other men.</p>
        <p>The intellectual inferiority of the negroes is a common,
	  <lb/>though most absurd apology, for personal prejudice, and
	  <lb/>the oppressive inequality of the laws; for this reason, I
	  <lb/>shall take some pains to prove that the present degraded
	  <lb/>condition of that unfortunate race is produced by artifi­
	  <lb/>cial causes, not by the laws of nature.</p>
        <p>In the first place, naturalists are universally agreed
	  <lb/>concerning <quote>the identity of the <emph>human</emph> type;</quote> by which
	  <lb/>they mean that all living creatures, that can, by any pro­
	  <lb/>cess, be enabled to perceive moral and intellectual truths,
	  <lb/>are characterized <emph>by similar peculiarities of organization</emph>.
	  <lb/>They may differ from each other widely, but they still
	  <lb/>belong to the same class. An eagle and a wren are very
	  <lb/>unlike each other; but no one would hesitate to pro­
	  <lb/>nounce that they were both birds: so it is with the
	  <lb/>almost endless varieties of the monkey tribe. We all
	  <lb/>know that beasts, however sagacious, are incapable of
	  <lb/>abstract thought, or moral perception. The most won­
	  <lb/>derful elephant in the world could not command an army,
	  <lb/>or govern a state. An ourang-outang may eat, and
	  <lb/>drink, and dress, and move like a man; but he could
	  <lb/>never write an ode, or learn to relinquish his own good
	  <lb/>for the good of his species. The <emph>human</emph> conformation,

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">156</mw>
	  <lb/>however it may be altered by the operation of physical
	  <lb/>or moral causes, differs from that of all other beings,
	  <lb/>and on this ground, the negro's claim to be ranked as
	  <lb/>a <emph>man</emph>, is universally allowed by the learned.</p>
        <p>The condition of this people in ancient times is very
	  <lb/>far from indicating intellectual or moral inferiority. —
	  <lb/><placeName>Ethiopia</placeName> held a conspicuous place among the nations. —
	  <lb/>Her princes were wealthy and powerful, and her people
	  <lb/>distinguished for integrity and wisdom. Even the proud
	  <lb/><name>Grecians</name> evinced respect for <placeName>Ethiopia</placeName>, almost amounting
	  <lb/>to reverence, and derived thence the sublimest portions
	  <lb/>of their mythology. The popular belief that all the
	  <lb/>gods made an annual visit to the <name>Ethiopians</name>, shows the
	  <lb/>high estimation in which they were held; for we are not
	  <lb/>told that such an honor was bestowed on any other
	  <lb/>nation. In the first book of the <title>Iliad</title>, <persName>Achilles</persName> is repre­
	  <lb/>sented as anxious to appeal at once to the highest author­
	  <lb/>ities; but his mother tells him: <said><persName>Jupiter</persName> set off yester­
	    <lb/>day, attended by all the gods, on a journey toward the
	    <lb/>ocean, to feast with the excellent <name>Ethiopians</name>, and is not
	    <lb/>expected back at <placeName>Olympus</placeName> till the twelfth day.</said></p>
        <p>In <placeName>Ethiopia</placeName>, was likewise placed the table of the Sun,
	  <lb/>reported to kindle of its own accord, when exposed to
	  <lb/>the rays of that great luminary.</p>
        <p>In <placeName>Africa</placeName> was the early reign of <persName>Saturn</persName>, under the
	  <lb/>appellation of <persName>Ouranus</persName>, or <gloss>Heaven</gloss>; there the impious
	  <lb/><name>Titans</name> warred with the sky; there <persName>Jupiter</persName> was born and
	  <lb/>nursed; there was the celebrated shrine of <persName>Ammon</persName>, ded­
	  <lb/>icated to Theban <persName>Jove</persName>, which the <name>Greeks</name> reverenced
	  <lb/>more highly than the <name>Delphic Oracle</name>; there was the
	  <lb/>birth-place and oracle of <persName>Minerva</persName>; and there, <persName>Atlas</persName> sup­
	  <lb/>ported both the heavens and the earth upon his shoul­
	  <lb/>ders.</p>
        <p>It will be said that fables prove nothing. — But there
	  <lb/>is probably much deeper meaning in these fables than
	  <lb/>we now understand; there was surely some reason for
	  <lb/>giving them such a <quote>local habitation.</quote> Why did the
	  <lb/>ancients represent <persName>Minerva</persName> as born in <placeName>Africa</placeName>, — and
	  <lb/>why are we told that <persName>Atlas</persName> there sustained the heavens
	  <lb/>and the earth, unless they meant to imply that <placeName>Africa</placeName>
	  <lb/>was the centre, from which religious and scientific light
	  <lb/>had been diffused?</p>

        <p>Some ancient writers suppose that <placeName>Egypt</placeName> derived all
	  <lb/>the arts and sciences from <placeName>Ethiopia</placeName>; while others believe
	  <lb/>precisely the reverse. <persName>Diodorus</persName> supported the first opin­
	  <lb/>ion, — and asserts that the Ethiopian vulgar spoke the
	  <lb/>same language as the learned of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>.</p>
        <p>It is well known that <placeName>Egypt</placeName> was the great school of
	  <lb/>knowledge in the ancient world. It was the birth-place 
	  <lb/>of Astronomy; and we still mark the constellations as
	  <lb/>they were arranged by Egyptian shepherds. The wisest
	  <lb/>of the Grecian philosophers, among whom were <persName>Solon</persName>,
	  <lb/><persName>Pythagoras</persName> and <persName>Plato</persName>, went there for instruction, as our
	  <lb/>young men now go to <placeName>England</placeName> and <placeName>Germany</placeName>. The
	  <lb/>Eleusinian mysteries were introduced from <placeName>Egypt</placeName>; and
	  <lb/>the important secret which they taught, is supposed to
	  <lb/>have been the existence of one, invisible God. A large
	  <lb/>portion of Grecian mythology was thence derived; but in
	  <lb/>passing from one country to the other, the form of these
	  <lb/>poetical fables was often preserved, while the original
	  <lb/>meaning was lost.</p>
        <p><persName>Herodotus</persName>, the earliest of the Greek historians, informs
	  <lb/>us that the <name>Egyptians</name> were negroes. This fact has been
	  <lb/>much doubted, and often contradicted. But <persName>Herodotus</persName>
	  <lb/>certainly had the best means of knowing the truth on
	  <lb/>this subject; for he travelled in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and obtained his
	  <lb/>knowledge of the country by personal observation. He
	  <lb/>declares that the <name>Colchians</name> must be a colony of <name>Egyp­
	  <lb/>tians</name>, because, <quote>like them, they have a black skin and
	    <lb/>frizzled hair.</quote></p>
        <p>The statues of the Sphinx have the usual characteristics
	  <lb/>of the negro race. This opinion is confirmed by <persName>Blu­
	    <lb/>menbach</persName>, the celebrated German naturalist, and by <persName>Vol­
	    <lb/>ney</persName>, who carefully examined the architecture of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>.</p>
        <p>Concerning the sublimity of the architecture in this
	  <lb/>ancient negro kingdom, some idea may be conceived 
	  <lb/>from the description of <placeName>Thebes</placeName> given by <persName>Denon</persName>, who
	  <lb/>accompanied the French army into <placeName>Egypt</placeName>: <quote>This city,
	    <lb/>renowned for numerous kings, who through their wisdom
	    <lb/>have been elevated to the rank of gods; for laws, which
	    <lb/>have been revered without being known; for sciences,
	    <lb/>which have been confided to proud and mysterious in­
	    <lb/>scriptions; for wise and earliest monuments of the arts,

	    <lb/>which time has respected; — this sanctuary, abandoned,
	    <lb/>isolated through barbarism, and surrendered to the desert
	    <lb/>from which it was won; this city, shrouded in the veil
	    <lb/>of mystery by which even colossi are magnified; this
	    <lb/>remote city, which imagination has only caught a glimpse
	    <lb/>of through the darkness of time — was still so gigantic
	    <lb/>an apparition, that, at the sight of its scattered ruins, the
	    <lb/>army halted of its own accord, and the soldiers with one
	    <lb/>spontaneous movement, clapped their hands.</quote></p>
        <p>The Honorable <persName>Alexander Everett</persName> in his work on
	  <lb/><placeName>America</placeName>, says: <quote>While <placeName>Greece</placeName> and <placeName>Rome</placeName> were yet
	    <lb/>barbarous, we find the light of learning and improvement
	    <lb/>emanating from the continent of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, (supposed to

	    <lb/>explained, and to hear the sound of the language, which
	    <lb/>he declared to be beautiful. He then began to press his
	    <lb/>visiter with theological questions, and showed himself not
	    <lb/>wholly unacquainted with the controversies which have
	    <lb/>agitated the christian world; indeed, he soon went beyond

	  <lb/>the <name>Portuguese</name>. A palace was prepared for her recep­
	  <lb/>tion; and she was received with the honors due to her
	  <lb/>rank. On entering the audience-chamber, she perceived
	  <lb/>that a magnificent chair of state was prepared for the
	  <lb/>Portuguese Viceroy, while in front of it, a rich carpet, and
	  <lb/>velvet cushions, embroidered with gold, were arranged
	  <lb/>on the floor for her use. The haughty princess observed
	  <lb/>this in silent displeasure. She gave a signal with her
	  <lb/>eyes, and immediately one of her women knelt on the
	  <lb/>carpet, supporting her weight on her hands. <persName>Zhinga</persName>
	  <lb/>gravely seated herself upon her back, and awaited the
	  <lb/>entrance of the Viceroy. The spirit and dignity with
	  <lb/>which she fulfilled her mission excited the admiration of
	  <lb/>the whole court. When an alliance was offered, upon
	  <lb/>the condition of annual tribute to the king of <placeName>Portugal</placeName>,
	  <lb/>she proudly answered: <said>Such proposals are for a people
	    <lb/>subdued by force of arms; they are unworthy of a pow­
	    <lb/>erful monarch, who voluntarily seeks the friendship of
	    <lb/>the <name>Portuguese</name>, and who scorns to be their vassal.</said></p>
        <p>She finally concluded a treaty, upon the single condi­
	  <lb/>tion of restoring all the Portuguese prisoners. When the
	  <lb/>audience was ended, the Viceroy, as he conducted her
	  <lb/>from the room, remarked that the attendant, upon whose
	  <lb/>back she had been seated, still remained in the same
	  <lb/>posture. <persName>Zhinga</persName> replied: <said>It is not fit that the ambas­
	    <lb/>sadress of a great king should be twice served with the
	    <lb/>same seat. I have no further use for the woman.</said></p>
        <p>Charmed with the politeness of the <name>Europeans</name>, and
	  <lb/>the evolutions of their troops, the African princess long
	  <lb/>delayed her departure. Having received instruction in
	  <lb/>the christian religion, she professed a deep conviction of
	  <lb/>its truth. Whether this was sincere, or merely assumed
	  <lb/>from political motives, is uncertain. During her visit,
	  <lb/>she received baptism, being then forty years old. She
	  <lb/>returned to <placeName>Angola</placeName> loaded with presents and honors. —
	  <lb/>Her brother, notwithstanding a solemn promise to pre­
	  <lb/>serve the treaty she had formed, soon made war upon the
	  <lb/><name>Portuguese</name>. He was defeated, and soon after died of
	  <lb/>poison; some said his death was contrived by <persName>Zhinga</persName>.
	  <lb/>She ascended the throne, and having artfully obtained
	  <lb/>possession of her nephew's person, she strangled him
<pb n="163"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="14(4)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">163</mw>
	  <lb/>with her own hands. Revenge, as well as ambition, im­
	  <lb/>pelled her to this crime; for her brother had, many years
	  <lb/>before, murdered <emph>her</emph> son, lest he should claim the crown.</p>
        <p>The <name>Portuguese</name> increased so fast in numbers, wealth,
	  <lb/>and power, that the people of <placeName>Angola</placeName> became jealous of
	  <lb/>them, and earnestly desired war. <persName>Zhinga</persName>, having formed
	  <lb/>an alliance with the <name>Dutch</name>, and with several neighboring
	  <lb/>chiefs, began the contest with great vigor. She obtained
	  <lb/>several victories, at first, but was finally driven from her
	  <lb/>kingdom with great loss. Her conquerors offered to
	  <lb/>re-establish her on the throne, if she would consent to
	  <lb/>pay tribute. She haughtily replied, <said>If my cowardly
	    <lb/><emph>subjects</emph> are willing to bear shameful fetters, <emph>I</emph> cannot
	    <lb/>endure even the thought of dependence upon any foreign
	    <lb/>power.</said></p>
        <p>In order to subdue her stubborn spirit, the <name>Portuguese</name>
	  <lb/>placed a king of their own choosing upon the throne of
	  <lb/><placeName>Angola</placeName>. This exasperated <persName>Zhinga</persName> to such a degree,
	  <lb/>that she vowed everlasting hatred against her enemies,
	  <lb/>and publicly abjured their religion. At the head of an
	  <lb/>intrepid and ferocious band, she, during eighteen years,
	  <lb/>perpetually harassed the <name>Portuguese</name>. She could neither
	  <lb/>be subdued by force of arms, nor appeased by presents.
	  <lb/>She demanded complete restitution of her territories,
	  <lb/>and treated every other proposal with the utmost scorn.
	  <lb/>Once, when closely besieged in an island, she asked a
	  <lb/>short time to reflect on the terms of surrender. The
	  <lb/>request being granted, she silently guided her troops
	  <lb/>through the river at midnight, and carried fire and sword
	  <lb/>into another portion of the enemy's country.</p>
        <p>The total defeat of the <name>Hollanders</name>, and the death of
	  <lb/>her sister, who had been taken captive during the wars,
	  <lb/>softened her spirit. She became filled with remorse for
	  <lb/>having renounced the <name>christian</name> religion. She treated
	  <lb/>her prisoners more mercifully, and gave orders that the
	  <lb/>captive priests should be attended with the utmost reve­
	  <lb/>rence. They perceived the change, and lost no opportu­
	  <lb/>nity of regaining their convert. The queen was ready to
	  <lb/>comply with their wishes, but feared a revolt among her
	  <lb/>subjects and allies, who were strongly attached to the
	  <lb/>customs of their fathers. The priest, by mumerous arti­

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">164</mw>
	  <lb/><unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">fices</unclear>, worked so powerfully upon the superstitious fears
	  <lb/>of the people, that they were prepared to hail <persName>Zhinga's</persName>
	  <lb/>return to the <name>Catholic</name> faith with joy.</p>
        <p>The queen, thus reconciled to the church, signed a
	  <lb/>treaty of peace; took the <name>Capuchins</name> for her counsellors;
	  <lb/>dedicated her capital city to the Virgin, under the name
	  <lb/>of <persName>Saint Mary</persName> of <placeName>Matamba</placeName>; and erected a large church.
	  <lb/>Idolatry was forbidden, under the most rigorous pen­
	  <lb/>alties; and not a few fell martyrs to <persName>Zhinga's</persName> fiery zeal.</p>
        <p>A law prohibiting polygamy excited discontent. —
	  <lb/><persName>Zhinga</persName>, though seventyfive years old, publicly patronized
	  <lb/>marriage, by espousing one of her courtiers; and her
	  <lb/>sister was induced to give the same example. The <name>Por­
	  <lb/>tuguese</name> again tried to make her a vassal to the crown;
	  <lb/>but the priests, notwithstanding their almost unlimited in­
	  <lb/>fluence, could never obtain her consent to this degradation.</p>
        <p>In <date when="1657">1657</date>, one of her tributaries having violated the
	  <lb/>treaty of peace, she marched at the head of her troops,
	  <lb/>defeated the rebel, and sent his head to the <name>Portuguese</name>.</p>
        <p>In <date when="1658">1<choice><sic>7</sic><corr>6</corr></choice>58</date>, she made war upon a neighboring king, who
	  <lb/>had attacked her territories; and returned in triumph,
	  <lb/>after having compelled him to submit to such conditions
	  <lb/>as she saw fit to impose. The same year, she abolished
	  <lb/>the cruel custom of immolating human victims on the
	  <lb/>tombs of princes; and founded a new city, ornamented
	  <lb/>with a beautiful church and palace.</p>
        <p>She soon after sent an embassage to the Pope, request­
	  <lb/>ing more missionaries among her people. The Pontiff's
	  <lb/>answer was publicly read in the church, where <persName>Zhinga</persName>
	  <lb/>appeared with a numerous and brilliant train. At a fes­
	  <lb/>tival in honor of this occasion, she and the ladies of her
	  <lb/>court performed a mimic battle, in the dress and armor of
	  <lb/><name>Amazons</name>. Though more than eighty years old, this
	  <lb/>remarkable woman displayed as much strength, agility,
	  <lb/>and skill, as she could have done at twentyfive. She
	  <lb/>died in <date when="1663">1663</date>, aged eightytwo. Arrayed in royal robes,
	  <lb/>ornamented with precious stones, with a bow and arrow
	  <lb/>in her hand, the body was shown to her sorrowing sub­

        <p>The commandant of a Portuguese fort, who expected

	  <lb/>mented saloon, he was not invited to sit down. Like
	  <lb/><persName>Zhinga</persName>, he made a signal to an attendant, who knelt
	  <lb/>upon the floor, and thus furnished him a seat. The

	  <lb/>and published his Memoirs. The book is said to be

	  <lb/>description of his terror at an earthquake, his surprise
	  <lb/>when he first saw snow, a picture, a watch, and a quad­
	  <lb/>rant.</p>
        <p>He always had an earnest desire to understand navi­

	  <lb/>slavery. Having persuaded a sea-captain to give him
	  <lb/>lessons, he applied himself with great diligence, though
	  <lb/>obliged to contend with many obstacles, and subject to
	  <lb/>frequent interruptions. <persName>Doctor Irving</persName>, with whom he
	  <lb/>once lived as a servent, taught him to render salt water
	  <lb/>fresh by distillation. Some time after, when engaged in
	  <lb/>a northern expedition, he made good use of this know­
	  <lb/>ledge, and furnished the crew with water they could
	  <lb/>drink.</p>
        <p>His sympathies were, very naturally, given to the
	  <lb/>weak and the despised, wherever he found them. He
	  <lb/>deplores the fate of modern <name>Greeks</name>, nearly as much de­

	  <lb/>who at her death left him an annuity of thirty pounds;

        <p>Something of dissipation mixed with his love of

	  <lb/>He spent his last shilling at <placeName>Drury Lane</placeName>, to see <persName>Garrick</persName>,
	  <lb/>who was extremely friendly to him. At one time he
	  <lb/>thought of performing African characters on the stage,
	  <lb/>but was prevented by a bad articulation.</p>
        <p>He afterward became very regular in his habits, and
	  <lb/>married a worthy West Indian girl. After his death, two
	  <lb/>volumes of his letters were printed, of which a second
	  <lb/>edition was soon published, with a portrait of the author,
	  <lb/>designed by <persName>Gainsborough</persName>, and engraved by <persName>Bartolozzi</persName>.</p>
        <p><persName>Sterne</persName> formed an acquaintance with <persName>Ignatius Sancho</persName>;
	  <lb/>and in the third volume of his letters, there is an epistle
	  <lb/>addressed to this <name>African</name>, in which he tells him that va­

	  <lb/>and expresses his indignation that certain men wish to
	  <lb/>class their equals among the brutes, in order to treat
	  <lb/>them as such with impunity. <persName>Jefferson</persName> criticises <persName>Sancho</persName>
	  <lb/>with some severity, for yielding too much to an eccentric
	  <lb/>imagination; but he acknowledges that he has an easy
	  <lb/>style, and a happy choice of expressions.</p>
        <p>The letters of <persName>Sancho</persName> are thought to bear some resem­
	  <lb/>blance to those of <persName>Sterne</persName>, both in their beauties and

        <p>They formed a constitution, established tribunals of

	  <lb/>and accumulated wrong. Discouraged in his efforts to
	  <lb/>make head against the intrigues of the slave-holders, he
	  <lb/>could not contain his indignation: <said>I begin,</said> said he

	    <lb/>degraded light. Despatches shall go directly to <placeName>St Do­
	    <lb/>mingo</placeName>; and we will soon follow them. We can pro­
	    <lb/>duce as good soldiers on our own estates, as those in
	    <lb/><placeName>France</placeName>. Our own arms shall make us independent and

        <p><persName rend="slant(italic)">Toussaint L'Ouverture</persName>, the celebrated black chieftain,
	  <lb/>was born a slave, in the year <date when="1745">1745</date>, upon the plantation
	  <lb/>of <persName>Count de <placeName>Noé</placeName></persName>. His amiable deportment as a slave,
	  <lb/>the patience, mildness, and benevolence of his disposi­
	  <lb/>tion, and the purity of his conduct amid the general
	  <lb/>laxity of morals which prevailed in the island, gained for
	  <lb/>him many of those advantages which afterwards gave
	  <lb/>him such absolute ascendency over his insurgent breth­
	  <lb/>ren. His good qualities attracted the attention of <persName>M.
	    <lb/>Bayou de Libertas</persName>, the agent on the estate, who taught
	  <lb/>him reading, writing, and arithmetic, — elements of
	  <lb/>knowledge, which hardly one in ten thousand of his fel­
	  <lb/>low slaves possessed. <persName>M. Bayou</persName> made him his postillion,
	  <lb/>which gave him advantages much above those of the field
	  <lb/>slaves. When the general rising of the blacks took
	  <lb/>place, in <date when="1791">1791</date>, much solicitation was used to induce
	  <lb/><persName>Toussaint</persName> to join them; but he declined, until he had
	  <lb/>procured an opportunity for the escape of <persName>M. Bayou</persName> and
	  <lb/>his family to <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, shipping a considerable quantity
	  <lb/>of sugar for the supply of their immediate wants. In his
	  <lb/>subsequent prosperity, he availed himself of every occa­
	  <lb/>sion to give them new marks of his gratitude. Having
	  <lb/>thus provided security for his benefactor, he joined a
	  <lb/>corps of blacks, under the orders of <persName>General Biassou</persName>;
	  <lb/>but was soon raised to the principal command, <persName>Biassou</persName>

	  <lb/>being degraded on account of his cruelty and ferocity.
	  <lb/>Indeed, <persName>Toussaint</persName> was every way so much superior to
	  <lb/>the other negroes, by reason of his general intelligence
	  <lb/>and education, his prudence, activity and address, not
	  <lb/>less than his bravery, that he immediately attained a
	  <lb/>complete ascendency over all the black chieftains. In
	  <lb/><date when="1797">1797</date>, <persName>Toussaint</persName> received from the French government a
	  <lb/>commission of General-in-Chief of the armies of <placeName>St Do­
	    <lb/>mingo</placeName>, and as such signed the convention with <persName>General
	    <lb/>Maitland</persName> for the evacuation of the island by the <name>British</name>.
	  <lb/>From <date when="1798">1798</date> until <date when="1801">1801</date>, the island continued tranquil
	  <lb/>under the government of <persName>Toussaint</persName>, who adopted and
	  <lb/>enforced the most judicious measures for healing the
	  <lb/>wounds of his country, and restoring its commercial and
	  <lb/>agricultural prosperity. His efforts would have been
	  <lb/>attended with much success, but for the ill-judged expe­
	  <lb/>dition, which <persName>Bonaparte</persName> sent against the island, under
	  <lb/>the command of <persName>Le Clerc</persName>. This expedition, fruitless as
	  <lb/>it was in respect of its general object, proved fatal to
	  <lb/>the negro chieftain.</p>
        <p><persName>Toussaint</persName> was noted for private virtues; among the rest,
	  <lb/>warm affection for his family. <persName>Le Clerc</persName> brought out from
	  <lb/><placeName>France</placeName> <persName>Toussaint's</persName> two sons, with their preceptor, whose
	  <lb/>orders were to carry his pupils to their father, and make
	  <lb/>use of them to work on his tenderness, and induce
	  <lb/>him to abandon his countrymen. If he yielded, he was
	  <lb/>to be made second in command to <persName>Le Clerc</persName>; if he re­
	  <lb/>fused, his children were to be reserved as hostages of his
	  <lb/>fideltiy to the <name>French</name>. Notwithstanding the greatness
	  <lb/>of the sacrifice demanded of him, <persName>Toussaint</persName> remained
	  <lb/>faithful to his brethren. We pass over the details of the
	  <lb/>war, which at length, ended in a treaty of peace con­
	  <lb/>cluded by <persName>Toussaint</persName>, <persName>Dessalines</persName> and <persName>Christophe</persName>, againt
	  <lb/>their better judgment, but in consequence of the effect
	  <lb/>of <persName>Le Clerc's</persName> professions upon their simple followers,
	  <lb/>who were induced to lay down their arms. <persName>Toussaint</persName>
	  <lb/>retired to his plantation, relying upon the solemn assu­
	  <lb/>rances of <persName>Le Clerc</persName>, that his person and property should
	  <lb/>be held sacred. Notwithstanding these assurances, he
	  <lb/>was treacherously seized in the night, hurried on board
	  <lb/>a ship of war, and conveyed to <placeName>Brest</placeName>. He was con­

	  <lb/>ducted first to close prison in <placeName>Chateaux de Joux</placeName>, and
	  <lb/>from thence to <persName>Besançon</persName>, where he was plunged into a
	  <lb/>cold, wet, subterranean prison, which soon proved fatal
	  <lb/>to a constitution used only to the warm skies and free
	  <lb/>air of the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>. He languished through the win­
	  <lb/>ter of <date from="1802" to="1803">1802-1803</date>; and his death, which happened in
	  <lb/><date when="1803-04"><name>April</name>, 1803</date>, raised a cry of indignation against the gov­
	  <lb/>ernment, which had chosen this dastardly method of
	  <lb/>destroying one of the best and bravest of the negro race.</p>
        <p><persName>Toussaint L'Ouverture</persName> is thus spoken of by <persName>Vincent</persName>,
	  <lb/>in his Reflections on the state of <placeName>St Domingo</placeName>: <quote><persName>Tous­
	    <lb/>saint L'Ouverture</persName> is the most active and indefatigable
	    <lb/>man, of whom it is possible to form an idea. He is
	    <lb/>always present wherever difficulty or danger makes his
	    <lb/>presence necessary. His great sobriety, — the power of
	    <lb/>living without repose, — the facility with which he re­
	    <lb/>sumes the affairs of the cabinet, after the most tiresome
	    <lb/>excursions, — of answering daily a hundred letters, —
	    <lb/>and of habitually tiring five secretaries — render him so
	    <lb/>superior to all around him, that their respect and submis­
	    <lb/>sion almost amount to fanaticism. It is certain no man
	    <lb/>in modern times has obtained such an influence over a
	    <lb/>mass of ignorant people, as <persName>General Toussaint</persName> possesses
	    <lb/>over his brethren of <placeName>St Domingo</placeName>. He is endowed with
	    <lb/>a prodigious memory. He is a good father and a good
	    <lb/>husband.</quote></p>
        <p><persName>Toussaint</persName> re-established religious worship in <placeName>St Do­

        <p>With the genius and energy of <persName>Bonaparte</persName>, <persName>General
	  <lb/>Toussaint</persName> is said to have possessed the same political
	  <lb/>duplicity, and far-sighted cunning. These are qualities
	  <lb/>which almost inevitably grew out of the peculiar circum­

        <p>If we are willing to see and believe, we have full op­

	  <lb/>tion are highly susceptible of cultivation. <placeName>St Domingo</placeName>
	  <lb/>produces black legislators, scholars, and gentlemen. —
	  <lb/>The very negroes who had been slaves, formed a consti­
	  <lb/>tution that would do credit to paler-faced statesman —
	  <lb/><name>Americans</name> may well blush at its <emph>consistent</emph> republicanism.</p>
        <p>The enemies of true freedom were very ready to predict
	  <lb/>that the govenment of <placeName>Hayti</placeName> could not continue for any
	  <lb/>length of time; but it has now lasted nearly thirty years,
	  <lb/>constantly increasing in respectability and wealth. The
	  <lb/>affairs of <placeName>Greece</placeName> have been managed with much less
	  <lb/>ability and discretion, though all the cabinets of <placeName>Europe</placeName>
	  <lb/>have given assistance and advice. <placeName>St Domingo</placeName> achieved
	  <lb/>her independence alone and unaided — nay, in the very
	  <lb/>teeth of prejudice and scorn. The <name>Greeks</name> had loans
	  <lb/>from <placeName>England</placeName>, and contributions from <placeName>America</placeName>, and
	  <lb/>sympathy from half the world; the decisive battle of
	  <lb/><placeName>Navarino</placeName> was gained by the combined fleets of <placeName>England</placeName>,
	  <lb/><placeName>France</placeName> and <placeName>Russia</placeName>. Is it asked why
<placeName>Hayti</placeName> has not pro­
	  <lb/>duced any examples of splendid genius? In reply let me
	  <lb/>inquire, how long did the <name>Europeans</name> ridicule <emph>us</emph> for our
	  <lb/>poverty in literature? When <persName>Raynal</persName> reproached the
	  <lb/><placeName>United States</placeName> with not having produced one celebrated
	  <lb/>man, <persName>Jefferson</persName> requested him to wait until we had existed
	  <lb/><quote>as long as the <name>Greeks</name> before they had a <persName>Homer</persName>, the
	    <lb/><name>Romans</name> a <persName>Virgil</persName>, and the <name>French</name> a
<persName>Racine</persName>.</quote> Half a
	  <lb/>century elapsed before our republic produced <persName>Irving</persName>,

	  <lb/>forget that the cruel prejudice, under which colored
	  <lb/>people labor, makes it extremely difficult for them to
	  <lb/>gain admission to the best colleges and schools; they are
	  <lb/>obliged to contend with obstacles, which white men never
	  <lb/>encounter.</p>
        <p>It might seem wonderful that the descendants of wise
	  <lb/><placeName>Ethiopia</placeName>, and learned <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, are now in such a state of
	  <lb/>degradation, if history did not furnish a remarkable
	  <lb/>parallel in the condition of the modern <name>Greeks</name>. The
	  <lb/>land of <persName>Homer</persName>, <persName>Pericles</persName>, and <persName>Plato</persName>, is now inhabited by
	  <lb/>ignorant, brutal pirates. Freedom made the <persName>Grecians</persName>
	  <lb/>great and glorious — tyranny has made them stupid and
	  <lb/>miserable. Yet their yoke has been light, compared
	  <lb/>with African bondage. In both cases the wrongs of the
	  <lb/>oppressed have been converted into an argument against
	  <lb/>them. We first debase the nature of man by making
	  <lb/>him a slave, and then very coolly tell him that he must
	  <lb/>always remain a slave because he does not know how to
	  <lb/>use freedom. We first crush people to the earth, and
	  <lb/>then claim the right of trampling on them forever, because
	  <lb/>they are prostrate. Truly, human selfishness never
	  <lb/>invented a rule, which worked so charmingly both ways!</p>
        <p>No one thinks of doubting the intellect of <name>Indians</name>;
	  <lb/>yet civilization has certainly advanced much farther in
	  <lb/>the interior of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, than it did among the North
	  <lb/>American tribes. The <name>Indians</name> have strong untutored
	  <lb/>eloquence, — so have the <name>Africans</name>. And where will you
	  <lb/>find an <name>Indian</name> chieftain, whose pride, intellect, and
	  <lb/>valor, are more than a match for <persName>Zhinga's</persName>? Both of these
	  <lb/>classes have been most shamefully wronged; but public
	  <lb/>prejudice, which bows the negro to the earth, has borne
	  <lb/>with a far less crushing power upon the energies of the
	  <lb/>red man; yet they have not produced a <persName>Shakspeare</persName> or
	  <lb/>a <persName>Newton</persName>. But I shall be asked how it is that the na­
	  <lb/>tions of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, having proceeded so far in the arts of
	  <lb/>civilization, have made a full stop, and remained century
	  <lb/>after century without any obvious improvement? I will
	  <lb/>answer this by another question: How long did the an­
	  <lb/>cient <name>Helvetians</name>, <name>Gauls</name>, and <name>Saxons</name> remain in such a state
	  <lb/>of barbarism, that what they considered splendor and re­

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">180</mw>
	  <lb/>finement, would be called poverty and rudeness, by
	  <lb/>their German, French, and English descendants? —
	  <lb/>What was it that changed the intellectual and moral
	  <lb/>character of these people, after ages of ignorance and
	  <lb/>ferocity? It was the <emph>art of printing</emph>. But, alas, with
	  <lb/>the introduction of printing, modern slavery was intro­
	  <lb/>duced! While commerce has carried books and maps
	  <lb/>to other portions of the glope, she has sent kidnappers,
	  <lb/>with guns and cutlasses into <placeName>Africa</placeName>. We have not
	  <lb/>preached the Gospel of peace to her princes; we have
	  <lb/>incited them to make war upon each other, to fill our
	  <lb/>markets with slaves. While knowledge, like a mighty
	  <lb/>pillar of fire, has guided the European nations still onward,
	  <lb/>and onward, a dark cloud has settled more and more
	  <lb/>gloomily over benighted <placeName>Africa</placeName>. The lessons of time, the
	  <lb/>experience of ages, from which we have learned so much,
	  <lb/>are entirely lost to this vast continent.</p>
        <p>I have heard it asserted that the <name>Indians</name> were evi­
	  <lb/>dently superior to the negroes, because it was impossible
	  <lb/>to enslave <emph>them</emph>. Our slave laws prove that there are
	  <lb/>some exceptions to this remark; and it must be remem­
	  <lb/>bered that the <name>Indians</name> have been fairly met in battle,
	  <lb/>contending with but one nation at a time; while the 
	  <lb/>whole world have combined against the <name>Africans</name> — send­
	  <lb/>ing emissaries to lurk for them in secret places, or steal
	  <lb/>them at midnight from their homes. The <name>Indian</name> will
	  <lb/>seek freedom in the arms of death — and so will the
	  <lb/>negro. By thousands and thousands, these poor people
	  <lb/>have died for freedom. They have stabbed themselves
	  <lb/>for freedom — jumped into the waves for freedom
	  <lb/>— starved for freedom — fought like very tigers for
	  <lb/>freedom! But they have been hung, and burned,
	  <lb/>and shot — and their tyrants have been their historians!
	  <lb/>When the <name>Africans</name> have writers of their own, we shall
	  <lb/>hear their efforts for liberty called by the true title of
	  <lb/>heroism in a glorious cause. We are told in the fable
	  <lb/>that a lion, looking at the picture of one of his own spe­
	  <lb/>cies, conquered and trampled on by man, calmly said,
	  <lb/><said>We lions have no painters.</said></p>
        <p>I shall be told that in the preceding examples I have
	  <lb/>shown only the bright side of the picture. I readily
<pb n="181"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="16(1)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">181</mw>
	  <lb/>grant it; but I have deemed it important to show that
	  <lb/>the picture <emph>has</emph> a bright side. I am well aware that most
	  <lb/>of the negro authors are remarkable, principally because
	  <lb/>they are negroes. With considerable talent, they gener­
	  <lb/>ally evince bad taste. I do not pretend that they are
	  <lb/><persName>Scotts</persName> or <persName>Miltons</persName>; but I wish to prove that they are <emph>men</emph>,
	  <lb/>capable of producing their proportion of <persName>Scotts</persName> and <persName>Mil­
	  <lb/>tons</persName>, if they could be allowed to live in a state of physical
	  <lb/>and intellectual freedom. But where, at the present
	  <lb/>time, <emph>can</emph> they live in perfect freedom, cheered by the
	  <lb/>hopes and excited by the rewards, which stimulate white
	  <lb/>men to exertion? Every avenue to distinction is closed
	  <lb/>to them. Even where the body is suffered to be free, a
	  <lb/>hateful prejudice keeps the soul in fetters. I think every
	  <lb/>candid mind must admit that it is more wonderful they
	  <lb/>have done so much, than that they have done no more.</p>
        <p>As a class, I am aware that the negroes, with many
	  <lb/>honorable exceptions, are ignorant, and show little dis­
	  <lb/>position to be otherwise; but this ceases to be the case
	  <lb/>just in proportion as they are free. The fault is in their
	  <lb/>unnatural situation, not in themselves. Tyranny always
	  <lb/>dwarfs the intellect. <persName>Homer</persName> tells us, that when <persName>Jupiter</persName>
	  <lb/>condemns a man to slavery, he takes from him half his
	  <lb/>mind. A family of children treated with habitual vio­
	  <lb/>lence or contempt, become stupid and sluggish, and are
	  <lb/>called fools by the very parents or guardians who have
	  <lb/>crushed their mental energies. It was remarked by <persName>M.
	    <lb/>Dupuis</persName>, the British Consul at <placeName>Mogadore</placeName>, that the gener­
	  <lb/>ality of <name>Europeans</name>, after a long captivity and severe treat­
	  <lb/>ment among the <name>Arabs</name>, seemed at first exceedingly dull
	  <lb/>and insensible. <quote>If they had been any considerable
	    <lb/>time in slavery,</quote> says he, <quote>they appeared lost to reason
	    <lb/>and feeling; their spirits broken; and their faculties
	    <lb/>sunk in a species of stupor, which I am unable adequate­
	    <lb/>ly to describe. They appeared degraded even below the
	    <lb/>negro slave. The succession of hardships, without any
	    <lb/>protecting law to which they can appeal for alleviation,
	    <lb/>or redress, seems to destory every spring of exertion, or
	    <lb/>hope in their minds. They appear indifferent to every­
	    <lb/>thing around them; abject, servile, and brutish.</quote></p>

	    <lb/>based, and lowered beneath the standard of humanity.</quote></p>
        <p>The great <name>Virginian</name>, <persName>Patrick Henry</persName>, who certainly

	  <lb/><placeName>Rio Janeiro</placeName>:</p>
        <quote rend="pre()bequeath((pre(“))(p))">
          <p>The whole labor of bearing and moving burdens is
	  <lb/>performed by these people, and the state in which they
	  <lb/>appear is revolting to humanity. Here was a number of
	  <lb/>beings entirely naked, with the exception of a covering
	  <lb/>of dirty rags tied about their waists. Their skins, from
	  <lb/>constant exposure to the weather, had become hard,
	  <lb/>crusty, and seamed, resembling the coarse black cover­
	  <lb/>ing of some beast, or like that of an elephant, a wrinkled
	  <lb/>hide scattered with scanty hairs. On contemplating
	  <lb/>their persons you saw them with a physical organization
	  <lb/>resembling beings of a grade below the rank of man;
	  <lb/>long projecting heels, the gastronymic muscle wanting,
	  <lb/>and no calves to their legs; their mouths and chins pro­
	  <lb/>truded, their noses flat, their foreheads retiring, having
	  <lb/>exactly the head and legs of the baboon tribe. Some of
	  <lb/>these beings were yoked to drays, on which they dragged
	  <lb/>heavy burdens. Some were chained by the necks and
	  <lb/>legs, and moved with loads thus encumbered. Some
	  <lb/>followed each other in ranks, with heavy weights on their
	  <lb/>heads, chattering the most inarticulate and dismal ca­
	  <lb/>dence as they moved along. Some were munching young
	  <lb/>sugar-canes, like beasts of burden eating green proven­
	  <lb/>der; and some were seen near the water, lying on the
	  <lb/>bare ground among filth and offal, coiled up like dogs,
	  <lb/>and seeming to expect or require no more comfort or ac­
	  <lb/>commodation, exhibiting a state and conformation so
	  <lb/>unhuman; that they not only seemed, but actually were,
<pb n="183"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="16(2)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">183</mw>
	  <lb/>far below the inferior animals around them. Horses and
	  <lb/>mules were not employed in this way; they were used
	  <lb/>only for pleasure, and not labor. They were seen in the
	  <lb/>same streets, pampered, spirited, and richly caparisoned,
	  <lb/>enjoying a state far superior to the negroes, and ap­
	  <lb/>pearing to look down on the fettered and burdened
	  <lb/>wretches they were passing, as on beings of an inferior
	  <lb/>rank in the creation. Some of the negroes actually
	  <lb/>seemed to envy the caparisons of their fellow brutes, and
	  <lb/>eyed with jealousy their glittering harness. In imita­
	  <lb/>tion of this finery, they were fond of thrums of many col­
	  <lb/>ored threads; and I saw one creature, who supported the
	  <lb/>squalid rag that wrapped his waist by a suspender of
	  <lb/>gaudy worsted, which he turned every moment to look at,
	  <lb/>on his naked shoulder. The greater number, however,
	  <lb/>were as unconscious of any covering for use or ornament,
	  <lb/>as a pig or an ass.</p>
          <p>The first impression of all this on my mind, was to
	  <lb/>shake the conviction I had always felt, of the wrong and
	  <lb/>hardship inflicted on our black fellow-creatures, and that
	  <lb/>they were only in that state which God and nature had
	  <lb/>assigned them; that they were the lowest grade of hu­
	  <lb/>man existence, and the link that connected it with the
	  <lb/>brute; and that the gradation was so insensible, and
	  <lb/>their natures so intermingled, that it was impossible to
	  <lb/>tell where one had terminated and the other commenced;
	  <lb/>and that it was not surprising that people who contem­
	  <lb/>plated them every day, so formed, so employed, and so
	  <lb/>degraded, should forget their claims to that rank in the
	  <lb/>scale of being in which modern philanthropists are so
	  <lb/>anxious to place them. I did not at the moment myself
	  <lb/>recollect, that the white man, made a slave on the coast
	  <lb/>of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, suffers not only a similar mental but physical
	  <lb/>deterioration from hardships and emaciation, and be­
	  <lb/>comes in time the dull and deformed beast I now saw
	  <lb/>yoked to a burden.</p>
          <p>A few hours only were necessary to correct my first
	  <lb/>impressions of the negro population, by seeing them un­
	  <lb/>der a different aspect. We were attracted by the sound
	  <lb/>of military music, and found it proceeded from a regi­
	  <lb/>ment drawn up in one of the streets. Their colonel had
<pb n="184"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="16(2)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">184</mw>
	  <lb/>just died, and they attended to form a procession to cele­
	  <lb/>brate his obsequies. They were all of different shades
	  <lb/>of black, but the majority were negroes. Their equip­
	  <lb/>ment was excellent; they wore dark jackets, white pan­
	  <lb/>taloons, and black leather caps and belts, all which, with
	  <lb/>their arms, were in high order. Their band produced
	  <lb/>sweet and agreeable music, of the leader's own composi­
	  <lb/>tion, and the men went through some evolutions with
	  <lb/>regularity and dexterity. They were only a militia regi­
	  <lb/>ment, yet were as well appointed and disciplined as
	  <lb/>one of our regiments of the line. Here then was the first
	  <lb/>step in that gradation by which the black population of this
	  <lb/>country ascend in the scale of humanity; he advances
	  <lb/>from the state below that of a beast of burden into a mili­
	  <lb/>tary rank, and he shows himself as capable of discipline
	  <lb/>and improvement as a human being of any other color.</p>
          <p>Our attention was next attracted by negro men and
	  <lb/>women bearing about a variety of articles for sale; some
	  <lb/>in baskets, some on boards and cases carried on their
	  <lb/>heads. They belonged to a class of small shopkeepers,
	  <lb/>many of whom vend their wares at home, but the greater
	  <lb/>number send them about in this way, as in itinerant
	  <lb/>shops. A few of these people were still in a state of
	  <lb/>bondage, and brought a certain sum every evening to
	  <lb/>their owners, as the produce of their daily labor. But a
	  <lb/>large proportion, I was informed, were free, and exer­
	  <lb/>cised this little calling on their own account. They
	  <lb/>were all very neat and clean in their persons, and
	  <lb/>had a decorum and sense of respectability about them,
	  <lb/>superior to whites of the same class and calling. All
	  <lb/>their articles were good in their kind and neatly kept,
	  <lb/>and they sold them with simplicity and confidence,
	  <lb/>neither wishing to take advantage of others, nor suspect­
	  <lb/>ing that it would be taken of themselves. I bought some
	  <lb/>confectionary from one of the females, and I was struck
	  <lb/>with the modesty and propriety of her manner; she was
	  <lb/>a young mother, and had with her a neatly dressed child,
	  <lb/>of which she seemed very fond. I gave it a little comfit,
	  <lb/>and it turned up its dusky countenance to her and then
	  <lb/>to me, taking my sweetmeat and at the same time kissing
	  <lb/>my hand. As yet unacquainted with the coin of the
<pb n="185"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="16(3)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">185</mw>
	  <lb/>country, I had none that was current about me, and was
	  <lb/>leaving the articles; but the poor young woman pressed
	  <lb/>them on me with a ready confidence, repeating in broken
	  <lb/><name>Portuguese</name>, <foreign rend="slant(italic)" xml:lang="pt">outo tempo</foreign>. I am sorry to say, the 
	    <gloss rend="pre(‘)post(’)">other
	    <lb/>time</gloss> never came, for I could not recognise her person
	  <lb/>afterwards to discharge her little debt, though I went to
	  <lb/>the same place for the purpose.</p>
          <p>It soon began to grow dark, and I was attracted by a
	  <lb/>number of persons bearing large lighted wax tapers, like
	  <lb/>torches, gathering before a house. As I passed by, one
	  <lb/>was put into my hand by a man who seemed in some
	  <lb/>authority, and I was requested to fall into a procession
	  <lb/>that was forming. It was the preparation for a funeral,
	  <lb/>and on such occasions, I learned that they always request
	  <lb/>the attendance of a passing stranger, and feel hurt if they
	  <lb/>are refused. I joined the party, and proceeded with
	  <lb/>them, to a neighboring church. When we entered we
	  <lb/>ranged ourselves on each side of a platform which stood
	  <lb/>near the choir, on which was laid an open coffin, covered
	  <lb/>with pink silk and gold borders. The funeral service
	  <lb/>was chanted by a choir of priests, one of whom was a
	  <lb/>negro, a large comely man, whose jet black visage formed
	  <lb/>a strong and striking contrast to his white vestments. —
	  <lb/>He seemed to perform his part with a decorum and sense
	  <lb/>of solemnity, which I did not observe in his brethren. —
	  <lb/>After scattering flowers on the coffin, and fumigating it
	  <lb/>with incense, they retired, the procession dispersed, and
	  <lb/>we returned on board.</p>
          <p>I had been but a few hours on shore for the first time,
	  <lb/>and I saw an African negro under four aspects of soci­
	  <lb/>ety; and it appeared to me, that in every one his charac­
	  <lb/>ter depended on the state in which he was placed, and
	  <lb/>the estimation in which he was held. As a despised
	  <lb/>slave, he was far lower than other animals of burthen
	  <lb/>that surrounded him; more miserable in his look, more
	  <lb/>revolting in his nakedness, more distorted in his person,
	  <lb/>and apparently more deficient in intellect, than the horses
	  <lb/>and mules that passed him by. Advanced to the grade
	  <lb/>of a soldier, he was clean and neat in his person, amena­
	  <lb/>ble to discipline, expert at his exercises, and showed the
	  <lb/>port and being of a white man similarly placed. As a
<mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(2)">16*</mw>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">186</mw>
	  <lb/>citizen, he was remarkable for the respectability of his
	  <lb/>appearance, and the decorum of his manners in the rank
	  <lb/>assigned him; and as a priest, standing in the house of
	  <lb/>God, appointed to instruct society on their most impor­
	  <lb/>tant interests, and in a grade in which moral and intel­
	  <lb/>lectual fitness is required, and a certain degree of supe­
	  <lb/>riority is expected, he seemed even more devout in his
	  <lb/>impressions, and more correct in his manners, than his
	  <lb/>white associates. I came, therefore, to the irresistible
	  <lb/>conclusion in my mind, that color was an accident affect­
	  <lb/>ing the surface of a man, and having no more to do with
	  <lb/>his qualities than his clothes — that God had equally
	  <lb/>created an <name>African</name> in the image of his person, and
	  <lb/>equally given him an immortal soul; and that a <name>Euro­
	  <lb/>pean</name> had no pretext but his own cupidity, for impiously
	  <lb/>thrusting his fellow-man from that rank in the creation
	  <lb/>which the Almighty had assigned him, and degrading
	  <lb/>him below the lot of the brute beasts that perish.</p>

        <p>The <persName>Hon. A. H. Everett</persName>, in his able work on the po­
	  <lb/>litical situation of <placeName>America</placeName>, says, <quote>Nations, and races,
	    <lb/>like individuals, have their day, and seldom have a second.
	    <lb/>The blacks had a long and glorious one; and after what
	    <lb/>they have been and done, it argues not so much a mis­
	    <lb/>taken theory, as sheer ignorance of the most notorious
	    <lb/>historical facts, to pretend that they are naturally inferior
	    <lb/>to the whites. It would seem indeed, that if any race
	    <lb/>have a right claim to a sort of preëinence over others,
	    <lb/>on the fair honorable ground of talents displayed,
	    <lb/>and benefits conferred, it is precisely this very one,
	    <lb/>which we take upon us, in the pride of a temporary supe­
	    <lb/>riority, to stamp with the brand of essential degradation.
	    <lb/>It is hardly necessary to add, that while the blacks were
	    <lb/>the leading race in civilization and political power, there
	    <lb/>was no prejudice among the whites against their color.
	    <lb/>On the contrary, we find that the early <name>Greeks</name> regarded
	    <lb/>them as a superior variety of the human species, not only
	    <lb/>in intellectual and moral qualities, but in outward appear­
	    <lb/>ance. <quote rend="pre(‘)post(’)">The <name>Ethiopians</name>,</quote> says

        <p>Then let the slave-holder no longer apologize for himself
	  <lb/>by urging the stupidity and sensuality of negroes. It is
	  <lb/>upon the <emph>system</emph>, which thus transforms men into beasts,
	  <lb/>that the reproach rests in all its strength and bitterness.
	  <lb/>And even if the negroes were, beyond all doubt, our
	  <lb/>inferiors in intellect, this would form no excuse for op­
	  <lb/>pression or contempt. The use of law and public opin­
	  <lb/>ion is to protect the weak against the strong; and the
	  <lb/>government, which perverts these blessings into means
	  <lb/>of tyranny, resembles the priest, who, administered poi­

        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> opinion that negroes are naturally inferior in in­
	  <lb/>tellect is almost universal among white men; but the
	  <lb/>belief that they are worse than other people, is, I believe,
	  <lb/>much less extensive: indeed, I have heard some, who
	  <lb/>were by no means admirers of the colored race, main­
	  <lb/>tain that they were very remarkable for kind feelings,
	  <lb/>and strong affections. <persName>Homer</persName> calls the ancient <name>Ethio­

	  <lb/>have given innumerable instances of domestic tender­
	  <lb/>ness, and generous hospitality in the interior of <name>Africa</name>.
	  <lb/><persName>Mungo Park</persName> informs us that he found many schools in
	  <lb/>his progress through the country, and observed with
	  <lb/>pleasure the great docility and submissive deportment of
	  <lb/>the children, and heartily wished they had better instruct­

	    <lb/>smith and his relations was very tender; for these rude
	    <lb/>children of nature, free from restraint, display their emo­
	    <lb/>tions in the strongest and most expressive manner. —
	    <lb/>Amidst these transports, the aged mother was led forth,
	    <lb/>leaning upon a staff. Every one made way for her, and

	    <lb/>she stretched out her hand to bid her son welcome. Be­
	    <lb/>ing totally blind, she stroked his hands, arms, and face,
	    <lb/>with great care, and seemed highly delighted that her
	    <lb/>latter days were blessed by his return, and that her ears
	    <lb/>once more heard the music of his voice. From this in­
	    <lb/>terview, I was fully convinced, that whatever difference
	    <lb/>there is between the negro and the <name>European</name>, in the
	    <lb/>conformation of the nose, and the color of the skin,
	    <lb/>there is none in the gen<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">u</unclear>ine sympathies and character­
	    <lb/>istic feelings of our common nature.</quote></p>
        <p>At a small town in the interior, called <placeName>Wawra</placeName>, he
	  <lb/>says, <quote>In the course of the day, several women, hearing
	    <lb/>that I was going to <placeName>Sego</placeName>, came and begged me to inquire
	    <lb/>of <persName>Mansong</persName>, the king, what was become of their child­
	    <lb/>ren. One woman, in particular, told me that her son's
	    <lb/>name was <persName>Mamadee</persName>; that he was no heathen; but
	    <lb/>prayed to God morning and evening; that he had been
	    <lb/>taken from her about three years ago by <persName>Mansong's</persName> army,
	    <lb/>since which she had never heard from him. She said
	    <lb/>she often dreamed about him, and begged me, if I should
	    <lb/>see him in <placeName>Bambarra</placeName>, or in my own country, to tell him
	    <lb/>that his mother and sister were still alive.</quote></p>
        <p>At <placeName>Sego</placeName>, in <placeName>Bambarra</placeName>, the king, being jealous of <persName>Mr
	    <lb/>Park's</persName> intentions, forbade him to cross the river. Under
	  <lb/>these discouraging circumstances, he was advised to lodge
	  <lb/>at a distant village; but there the same distrust of the
	  <lb/>white man's purposes prevailed, and no person would
	  <lb/>allow him to enter his house. He says, <quote xml:id="q031" rend="post()" next="#q032">I was regard­

	    <lb/>day without food, under the shade of a tree. The wind

        <p>At another time, <persName>Mr Park</persName> thus continues his narrative:
	  <lb/><quote>A little before sunset, I descended on the northwest
	    <lb/>side of a ridge of hills, and as I was looking about for a
	    <lb/>convenient tree, under which to pass the night, (for I
	    <lb/>had no hopes of reaching any town) I descended into a
	    <lb/>delightful valley, and soon afterward arrived at a roman­
	    <lb/>tic village called <placeName>Kooma</placeName>. I was immediately surrounded
	    <lb/>by a circle of the harmless villagers. They asked me a
	    <lb/>thousand questions about my country, and in return for
	    <lb/>my information brought corn and milk for myself, and
	    <lb/>grass for my horse; kindled a fire in the hut where I was
	    <lb/>to sleep, and appeared very anxious to serve me.</quote></p>
        <p>Afterward, being robbed and stripped by banditti in
	  <lb/>the wilderness, he informs us that the robbers stood con­
	  <lb/>sidering whether they should leave him quite destitute;
	  <lb/>even in <emph>their</emph> minds, humanity partially prevailed over
	  <lb/>avarice; they returned the worst of two shirts, and a pair
	  <lb/>of trowsers; and as they went away, one of them threw
	  <lb/>back his hat. At the next village, <persName>Mr Park</persName> entered a
	  <lb/>complaint to the Dooty, or chief man, who continued
	  <lb/>very calmly smoking while he listened to the narration;
	  <lb/>but when he had heard all the particulars, he took the
	  <lb/>pipe from his mouth, and tossing up the sleeve of his cloak
	  <lb/>with an indignant air, he said, <said>You shall have every­
	    <lb/>thing restored to you — I have sworn it.</said> Then, turn­

	  <lb/>ing to an attendant, he added, <said>Give the white man a
	    <lb/>draught of water; and with the first light of morning go
	    <lb/>over the hills, and inform the Dooty of <placeName>Bammakoo</placeName>, that
	    <lb/>a poor white man, the king of <placeName>Bambarra's</placeName> stranger, has
	    <lb/>been robbed by the king of <placeName>Foolodoo's</placeName> people.</said> He
	  <lb/>then invited the traveller to remain with him, and share
	  <lb/>his provisions, until the messenger returned. <persName>Mr Park</persName>
	  <lb/>accepted the kind offer most gratefully: and in a few
	  <lb/>days his horse and clothes were restored to him.</p>
        <p>At the village of <placeName>Nemacoo</placeName>, where corn was so scarce
	  <lb/>that the people were actually in a state of starvation, a
	  <lb/>negro pitied his distress and brought him food.</p>
        <p>At <placeName>Kamalia</placeName>, <persName>Mr Park</persName> was earnestly dissuaded by an
	  <lb/><name>African</name> named <persName>Karfa</persName>, from attempting to cross the <placeName>Ja­
	  <lb/>lonka</placeName> wilderness during the rainy <choice><sic>r</sic><corr>s</corr></choice>eason; to which he
	  <lb/>replied that there was no alternative — for he was so
	  <lb/>poor, that he must either beg his subsistence from place
	  <lb/>to place, or perish with hunger. <persName>Karfa</persName> eagerly inquired
	  <lb/>if he could eat the food of the country, adding that, if he
	  <lb/>would stay with him, he should have plenty of victuals,
	  <lb/>and a hut to sleep in; and that after he had been safely
	  <lb/>conducted to the <placeName>Gambia</placeName>, he might make what return
	  <lb/>he thought proper. He was accordingly provided with a
	  <lb/>mat to sleep on, an earthen jar for holding water, a
	  <lb/>small calabash for a drinking cup, and two meals a day,
	  <lb/>with a supply of wood and water, from <persName>Karfa's</persName> own
	  <lb/>dwelling. Here he recovered from a fever, which had
	  <lb/>tormented him several weeks. His benevolent landlord
	  <lb/>came daily to inquire after his health, and see that he
	  <lb/>had everything for his comfort. <persName>Mr Park</persName> assures us
	  <lb/>that the simple and affectionate manner of those around
	  <lb/>him contributed not a little to his recovery. He adds,
	  <lb/><quote>Thus was I delivered, by the friendly care of this be­
	    <lb/>nevolent negro, from a situation truly deplorable. Dis­
	    <lb/>tress and famine pressed hard upon me; I had before

	    <lb/>Park</persName> having travelled in company with a coffle of thirty­
	  <lb/>five slaves, has describes his feelings as they came near
	  <lb/>the coast: <quote>Although I was now approaching the end
	    <lb/>of my tedious and toilsome journey, and expected in an­
	    <lb/>other day to meet with countrymen and friends, I could
	    <lb/>not part with my unfortunate fellow travellers, — doomed
	    <lb/>as I knew most of them to be, to a life of slavery in a
	    <lb/>foreign land, — without great emotion. During a pere­
	    <lb/>grination of more than five hundred miles, exposed to
	    <lb/>the burning rays of a tropical sun, these poor slaves,
	    <lb/>amidst their own infinitely greater sufferings, would
	    <lb/>commiserate mine, and frequently, of their own accord,
	    <lb/>bring water to quench my thirst, and at night collect
	    <lb/>branches and leaves to prepare me a bed in the wilder­
	    <lb/>ness. We parted with mutual regret and blessings. —
	    <lb/>My good wishes and prayers were all I could bestow
	    <lb/>upon them, and it afforded me some consolation to be
	    <lb/>told that they were sensible I had no more to give.</quote></p>
        <p>The same enlightened traveller remarks, <quote xml:id="q033" rend="post()" next="#q034">All the
	    <lb/>negro nations that fell under my observation, though di­
	    <lb/>vided into a number of petty, independent states, subsist
	    <lb/>chiefly by the same means, live nearly in the same tem­
	    <lb/>perature, and possess a wonderful similarity of disposition.
	    <lb/>The <name>Mandingoes</name>, in particular, are a very gentle race,
	    <lb/>cheerful, inquisitive, credulous, simple, and fond of
	    <lb/>flattery. Perhaps the most prominent defect in their
	    <lb/>character, was that insurmountable propensity, which
	    <lb/>the reader must have observed to prevail in all classes, to
	    <lb/>steal from me the few effects I was possessed of. No
	    <lb/>complete justification can be offered for this conduct,
	    <lb/>be<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">cau</unclear>se theft is a crime in their own estimation; and it
	    <lb/>must be observed that they are not habitually and gen­
	    <lb/>erally guilty of it towards each other. But before we pro­
	    <lb/>nounce them a more depraved people than any other, it
	    <lb/>were well to consider, whether the lower class of people
	    <lb/>in any part of <placeName>Europe</placeName>, would have acted, under similar
	    <lb/>circumstances, with greater honesty towards a stranger.
	    <lb/>It must be remembered that the laws of the country af­
	    <lb/>forded me no protection; that every one was permitted
	    <lb/>to rob me with impunity; and that some part of my ef­
	    <lb/>fects were of as great value in the estimation of the

	    <lb/>negroes, as pearls and diamonds would have been in the
	    <lb/>eyes of a <name>European</name>. Let us suppose a black merchant
	    <lb/>of <placeName>Hindostan</placeName> had found his way into <placeName>England</placeName>, with a
	    <lb/>box of jewels at his back, and the laws of the kingdom
	    <lb/>afforded him no security — in such a case, the wonder
	    <lb/>would be, not that the stranger was robbed of any part of
	    <lb/>his riches, but that any part was left for a second depre­
	    <lb/>dator.<anchor xml:id="a38" corresp="#n38" rend="pre(*)"/> Such, on sober reflection, is the judgment I have

	    <lb/>erally so sound, that he is not affected by those little mor­
	    <lb/>bid sensations, which are the frequent cause of crossness
	    <lb/>and ill-temper in our children. I do not remember, that I
	    <lb/>ever saw a young black fretful, or out of humor; cer­
	    <lb/>tainly never displaying those ferocious fits of petty pas­
	    <lb/>sion, in which the superior nature of infant whites in­
	    <lb/>dulges. I sometimes brought cakes and fruit in my
	    <lb/>pocket, and handed them in to the group. It was quite de­
	    <lb/>lightful to observe the generous and disinterested manner
	    <lb/>in which they distributed them. There was no scramb­
	    <lb/>ling with one another; no selfish reservation to them­
	    <lb/>selves. The child to whom I happened to give them,
	    <lb/>took them so gently, looked so thankfully, and distributed
	    <lb/>them so generously, that I could not help thinking that
	    <lb/>God had compensated their dusky hue, by a more than
	    <lb/>usual human portion of amiable qualities.</quote>

        <p>Several negroes in <placeName>Jamaica</placeName> were to be hung. One of
	  <lb/>them was offered his life, if he would hang the others;
	  <lb/>he preferred death. A negro slave who was ordered to
	  <lb/>do it, asked time to prepare; he went into his cabin,
	  <lb/>chopped off his right hand with an axe, and then came
	  <lb/>back, saying he was ready.</p>
        <p><persName>Sutcliff</persName> in his <title>Travels</title>, speaks of meeting a coffle of
	  <lb/>slaves in <placeName>Maryland</placeName>, one of whom had voluntarily gone
	  <lb/>into slavery, in hopes of meeting her husband, who was
	  <lb/>a free black and had been stolen by kidnappers. The
	  <lb/>poor creature was in treacherous hands, and it is a great
	  <lb/>chance whether she ever saw her husband again.</p>
        <p>An affecting instance of negro friendship may be found
	  <lb/>in <bibl>1 <title>Bay's Report</title>, 260-3</bibl>. A female slave in <placeName>South
	  <lb/>Carolina</placeName> was allowed to work out in the town, on con­
	  <lb/>dition that she paid her master a certain sum of money,
	  <lb/>per month. Being strong and industrious, her wages
	  <lb/>amounted to more than had been demanded in their
	  <lb/>agreement. After a time she earned enough to buy her
	  <lb/>freedom; but she preferred to devote the sum to the
	  <lb/>emancipation of a negro girl, named <persName>Sally</persName>, for whom she
	  <lb/>had conceived a strong affection. For a long time the

	  <lb/>master pretended to have no property in his slave's man­
	  <lb/>umitted friend, never paid taxes for her, and often spoke
	  <lb/>of her as a free negro. But, from some motive or other,
	  <lb/>he afterward claimed Sally as his slave, on the ground
	  <lb/>that no slave could make any purchase on his own ac­
	  <lb/>count, or possess anything which did not legally belong
	  <lb/>to his master. It is an honor to <persName>Chief Justice Rutledge</persName>
	  <lb/>that his charge was given in a spirit better than the laws.
	  <lb/>He concluded by saying, <quote>If the wench chose to appro­
	    <lb/>priate the savings of her extra labor to the purchase of this
	    <lb/>girl, in order to set her free, will a jury of the country
	    <lb/>say, <said rend="pre()post()">No</said>? I trust not. I hope they are too upright and
	  <lb/>humane, to do such manifest violence to such an extra­
	  <lb/>ordinary act of benevolence.</quote> By the prompt decision
	  <lb/>of the jury, <persName>Sally</persName> was declared free.<anchor xml:id="a39" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n39"/></p>
        <p>In speaking of the character of negroes, it ought not
	  <lb/>to be omitted that many of them were brave and faithful
	  <lb/>soldiers during our Revolution. Some are now receiving
	  <lb/>pensions for their services. At <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>, likewise,
	  <lb/>the conduct of the colored troops was deserving of the
	  <lb/>highest praise.</p>
        <p>It is common to speak of the negroes as a very unfeel­
	  <lb/>ing race; and no doubt the charge has considerable
	  <lb/>truth when applied to those in a state of bondage; for
	  <lb/>slavery blunts the feelings, as well as stupifies the intel­
	  <lb/>lect. The poor negro is considered as having no right
	  <lb/>in his wife and children. They may be suddently torn
	  <lb/>from him to be sold in a distant market; but he cannot
	  <lb/>prevent the wrong. He may see them exposed to every
	  <lb/>species of insult and indignity; but the law, which
	  <lb/>stretches forth her broad shield to guard the white man's
	  <lb/>rights, excludes the negro from her protection. They
	  <lb/>may be tied to the whipping post and <emph>die</emph> under <soCalled rend="slant(italic)">moderate</soCalled>
	  <lb/>punishment; but he dares not complain. If he murmur,
	  <lb/>there is the tormenting lash; if he resist, it is death. —
	  <lb/>And the injustice extends even beyond the grave; for
	  <lb/>the story of the slave is told by his oppressor, and the
	  <lb/>manly spirit which the poor creature shows, when stung

	  <lb/>to the very heart's core, is represented as diabolical re­
	  <lb/>venge. A short time ago, I read in a <placeName>Georgia</placeName> paper,
	  <lb/>what was called a horrid transaction, on the part of the
	  <lb/>negro. A slave stood by and saw his wife whipped as
	  <lb/>long as he could possibly endure the sight; he then called
	  <lb/>out to the overseer, who was applying the lash, that he
	  <lb/>would kill him if he did not use more mercy. This
	  <lb/>probably made matters worse; at all events the lashing
	  <lb/>continued. The husband, goaded to frenzy, rushed upon
	  <lb/>the overseer, and stabbed him three times. White men!
	  <lb/>what would <emph>you</emph> do, if the laws admitted that your wives
	  <lb/>might <quote rend="slant(italic)">die</quote> of 
	  <soCalled rend="pre(“)post(”)slant(italic)">moderate punishment</soCalled>, administered by
	  <lb/>your employers? The overseer died, and his murderer
	  <lb/>was either burned or shot, — I forget which. The
	  <lb/><placeName>Georgia</placeName> editor viewed the subject only on one side —
	  <lb/>viz. — the monstrous outrage against the white man —
	  <lb/>the negro's wrongs passed for nothing! It was very
	  <lb/>gravely added to the account (probably to increase the
	  <lb/>odiousness of the slave's offence,) that the overseer be­
	  <lb/>longed to the Presbyterian church! I smiled, – because it
	  <lb/>made me think of a man, whom I once heard described
	  <lb/>as <quote>a most excellent <name>Christian</name>, that would steal timber to
	    <lb/>build a church.</quote></p>
        <p>This instance shows that even slaves are not quite des­
	  <lb/>titute of feeling — yet we could not wonder at it, if they
	  <lb/>were. Who could expect the kindly affections to expand
	  <lb/>in such an atmosphere! Where there is no hope, the
	  <lb/>heart becomes paralyzed: it is a merciful arrangement
	  <lb/>of Divine Providence, by which the acuteness of sensi­
	  <lb/>bility is lessened when it becomes merely a source of suf­
	  <lb/>fering.</p>
        <p>But there are exceptions to this general rule; instan­
	  <lb/>ces of very strong and deep affection are sometimes
	  <lb/>found in a state of hopeless bondage. <persName>Godwin</persName>, in his
	  <lb/>eloquent <title>Lectures on Colonial Slavery</title>, quotes the fol­
	  <lb/>lowing anecdote, as related by <persName>Mr T. Pennock</persName>, at a pub­

        <p>
          <quote>A few years ago it was enacted, that it should not

	    <lb/>moval of a great part of his <soCalled rend="slant(italic)">live stock</soCalled> was the conse­
	    <lb/>quence. He had a female slave, a <name>Methodist</name>, and highly
	    <lb/>valuable to him (not the less so for being the mother of
	    <lb/>eight or nine children), whose husband, also of our con­
	    <lb/>nexion, was the property of another resident on the
	    <lb/>island, where I happened to be at the time. Their mas­
	    <lb/>ters not agreeing on a sale, separation ensued, and I
	    <lb/>went to the beach to be an eye witness of their behaviour
	    <lb/>in the greatest pang of all. One by one, the man kissed
	    <lb/>his children, with the firmness of a hero, and blessing
	    <lb/>them, gave as his last words — (oh! will it be believed,
	    <lb/>and have no influence upon our veneration for the ne­
	    <lb/>gro?) <said rend="pre(‘)post(’)">Farewell! <emph>Be honest, and obedient to your mas­
		<lb/>ter</emph>!</said> At length he had to take leave of his wife: there
	    <lb/>he stood (I have him in my mind's eye at this moment),
	    <lb/>five or six yards from the mother of his children, unable
	    <lb/>to move, speak, or do anything but gaze, and still to gaze,
	    <lb/>on the object of his long affection, soon to cross the blue
	    <lb/>waves forever from his aching sight. The fire of his
	    <lb/>eyes alone gave indication of the passion within, until
	    <lb/>after some minutes standing thus, he fell senseless on the
	    <lb/>sand, as if suddenly struck down by the hand of the Al­
	    <lb/>mighty. Nature could do no more; the blood gushed
	    <lb/>from his nostrils and mouth, as if rushing from the ter­
	    <lb/>rors of the conflict within; and amid the confusion occa­
	    <lb/>sioned by the circumstance, the vessel bore off his family
	    <lb/>forever from the island! After some days he recovered,
	    <lb/>and came to ask advice of me. What <emph>could</emph> an <name>English­
	      <lb/>man</name> do in such a case? I felt the blood boiling within

        <p>The following account is given by <persName>Mr Gilgrass</persName>, one
	  <lb/>of the Methodist missionaries at <placeName>Jamaica</placeName>: <quote>A master
	    <lb/>of slaves, who lived near us in <placeName>Kingston</placeName>, exercised his
	    <lb/>barbarities on a <name>Sabbath</name> morning while we were worship­
	    <lb/>ing God in the Chapel; and the cries of the female
	    <lb/>sufferers have frequently interrupted us in our devotions.
	    <lb/>But there was no redress for them, or for us. This man
	    <lb/>wanted money; and one of the female slaves having two
	    <lb/>fine children, he sold one of them, and the child was
	    <lb/>torn from her maternal affection. In the agony of her
<pb n="203"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">203</mw>
	    <lb/>feelings, she made a hideous howling; and for that
	    <lb/>crime she was flogged. Soon after he sold her other
	    <lb/>child. This <quote rend="pre(‘)post(’)">turned her heart within her,</quote> and impelled
	    <lb/>her into a kind of madness. She howled night and day
	    <lb/>in the yard; tore her hair; ran up and down the streets
	    <lb/>and the parade, rending the heavens with her cries, and
	    <lb/>literally watering the earth with her tears. Her con­
	    <lb/>stant cry was, <said rend="slant(italic)pre(‘)post(’)">Da wicked massa, he sell me children. —
	      <lb/>Will no buckra master pita nega? What me do! Me
	      <lb/>have no child!</said> As she stood before my window, she
	    <lb/>said, lifting her hands towards heaven, <said rend="slant(italic)pre(‘)post()">Do, me master
	      <lb/>minister, pity me! Me heart do so,</said> (shaking herself
	    <lb/>violently,) <said rend="slant(italic)pre()post(’)">me heart do so, because me have no child. Me
	      <lb/>go a massa house, in massa yard, and in me hut, and me
	      <lb/>no see em;</said> and then her cry went up to God. I durst
	    <lb/>not be seen looking at her.</quote></p>
        <p>A similar instance of strong affection happened in the
	  <lb/>city of <placeName>Washington</placeName>, <date when="1815-12"><name>December</name>, 1815</date>. A negro woman,
	  <lb/>with her two children, was sold, near <placeName>Bladensburgh</placeName>, to
	  <lb/><placeName>Georgia</placeName> traders; but the master refused to sell her hus­
	  <lb/>band. When the coffle reached <placeName>Washington</placeName>, on their way
	  <lb/>to <placeName>Georgia</placeName>, the poor creature attempted to escape, by jump­
	  <lb/>ing from the garret window of a three-story brick tavern.
	  <lb/>Her arms and back were dreadfully broken. When ask­
	  <lb/>ed why she had done such a desperate act, she replied,
	  <lb/><said rend="slant(italic)">They brought me away, and wound n't let me see my hus­
	    <lb/>band; and I did n't want to go. I was so distracted that
	    <lb/>I did not know what I was about: but I did n't want to
	    <lb/>go — and I jumped out of the window.</said> The unfortu­
	  <lb/>nate woman was given to the landlord as a compensation
	  <lb/>for having her taken care of at his house; her children
	  <lb/>were sold in <placeName>Carolina</placeName>; and thus was this poor forlorn
	  <lb/>being left alone in her misery. In all this wide land of
	  <lb/>benevolence and freedom, there was no one who could
	  <lb/>protect her: for in such chases, the <emph>laws</emph> come in, with
	  <lb/>iron grasp, to check the stirrings of human sympathy.</p>
        <p>Another complaint is that slaves have most inveterate
	  <lb/>habits of laziness. No doubt this is true — it would be
	  <lb/>strange indeed if it were otherwise. Where is the hu­
	  <lb/>man being, who will work from a disinterested love of
	  <lb/>toil, when his labor brings no improvement to himself, no
	  <lb/>increase of comfort to his wife and children?</p>

        <p><persName>Pelletan</persName>, in his <title>Memoirs of the French Colony of <placeName>Se­
	    <lb/>negal</placeName></title>, says, <quote>The negroes work with ardor, because
	    <lb/>they are now unmolested in their possessions and enjoy­
	    <lb/>ments. Since the suppression of slavery, the <name>Moors</name> 
	    <lb/>make no more inroads upon them, and their villages are
	    <lb/>rebuilt and re-peopled.</quote> <persName>Bosman</persName>, who was by no means
	  <lb/>very friendly to colored people, says: <quote>The negroes of
	    <lb/><placeName>Cabomonte</placeName> and <placeName>Juido</placeName>, are indefatigable cultivators,
	    <lb/>economical of their soil, they scarcely leave a foot-path to
	    <lb/>form a communication between the different possessions;
	    <lb/>they reap one day, and the next they sow the same earth,
	    <lb/>without allowing it time for repose.</quote></p>
        <p>It is needless to multiply quotations; for the concur­
	  <lb/>rent testimony of all travellers proves that industry is a
	  <lb/>common virtue in the interior of <placeName>Africa</placeName>.</p>
        <p>Again, it is said that the negroes are treacherous, cun­
	  <lb/>ning, dishonest, and profligate. Let me ask you, candid
	  <lb/>reader, what you would be, if you labored under the
	  <lb/>same unnatural circumstances? The daily earnings of
	  <lb/>the slave, nay, his very wife and children, are constantly
	  <lb/>wrested from him, under the sanction of the laws; is
	  <lb/>this the way to teach a scrupulous regard to the property
	  <lb/>of others? How can purity be expected from him, who
	  <lb/>sees almost universal licentiousness prevail among those
	  <lb/>whom he is taught to regard as his superiors? Besides, we
	  <lb/>must remember how entirely unprotected the negro is in
	  <lb/>his domestic relations, and how very frequently husband
	  <lb/>and wife are separated by the caprice, or avarice, of the
	  <lb/>white man. I have no doubt that slaves are artful; for
	  <lb/>they <emph>must</emph> be so. Cunning is always the resort of the
	  <lb/>weak against the strong; children, who have violent and
	  <lb/>unreasonable parents, become deceitful in self-defence.
	  <lb/>The only way to make young people sincere and frank,
	  <lb/>is to treat them with mildness and perfect justice.</p>
        <p>The negro often pretends to be ill in order to avoid
	  <lb/>labor; and if you were situated as he is, you would do
	  <lb/>the same. But it is said that the blacks are malignant
	  <lb/>and revengeful. Granting it to be true, — is it their fault,
	  <lb/>or is it owing to the cruel circumstances in which they
	  <lb/>are placed? Surely there are proofs enough that they
	  <lb/>are naturally a kind and gentle people. True, they do
<pb n="205"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="18(1)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">205</mw>
	  <lb/>sometimes murder their masters and overseers; but where
	  <lb/>there is utter hopelessness, can we wonder at occasional
	  <lb/>desperation? I do not believe that any class of people
	  <lb/>subject to the same influences, would commit fewer
	  <lb/>crimes. <persName>Dickson</persName>, in his letters on slavery, informs us
	  <lb/>that among one hundred and twenty thousand negroes
	  <lb/>and creoles of <placeName>Barbadoes</placeName>, only three murders have been
	  <lb/>known to be committed by them in the course of thirty
	  <lb/>years; although often provoked by the cruelty of the
	  <lb/>planters.<choice><sic>”</sic><corr/></choice></p>
        <p>In estimating the vices of slaves, there are several
	  <lb/>items to be taken into the account. In the first place,
	  <lb/>we hear a great deal of the negroes' crimes, while we
	  <lb/>hear very little of their provocations. If they murder
	  <lb/>their masters, newspapers and almanacs blazon it all over
	  <lb/>the country; but if their masters murder <emph>them</emph>, a trifling
	  <lb/>fine is paid, and nobody thinks of mentioning the matter.
	  <lb/>I believe there are twenty negroes killed by white men,
	  <lb/>where there is one white man killed by a black. If you
	  <lb/>believe this to be mere conjecture, I pray you examine
	  <lb/>the Judicial Reports of the Southern States. The voice
	  <lb/>of <emph>humanity</emph>, concerning this subject, is weak and stifled;
	  <lb/>and when a master kills his own slave we are not likely
	  <lb/>to hear the tidings — but the voice of <emph>avarice</emph> is loud and
	  <lb/>strong; and it sometimes happens that negroes <quote>die</quote>
	  <lb/><quote>under a moderate punishment</quote> administered by other
	  <lb/>hands: then prosecutions ensue, in order to recover the
	  <lb/>price of the slave; and in <emph>this</emph> way we are enabled to
	  <lb/>form a tolerable conjecture concerning the frequency of 
	  <lb/>such crimes.</p>
        <p>I have said that we seldom hear of the grievous wrongs
	  <lb/>which provoke the vengeance of the slave; I will tell an
	  <lb/>anecdote, which I know to be true, as a proof in point
	  <lb/>Within the last two years, a gentleman residing in <placeName>Bos­
	    <lb/>ton</placeName>, was summoned to the <placeName>West Indies</placeName> in consequence
	  <lb/>of troubles on his plantation. His overseer had been
	  <lb/>killed by the slaves. This fact was soon made public;
	  <lb/>and more than one exclaimed, <said>what diabolical passions
	    <lb/>these negroes have!</said> To which I replied that I only
	  <lb/>wondered they were half as good as they were. It was
	  <lb/>not long, however, before I discovered the particulars of
<mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(2)">18</mw>
<pb n="206"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="18(1)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">206</mw>
	  <lb/>the case; and I took some pains that the public should
	  <lb/>likewise be informed of them. The overseer was a bad,
	  <lb/>licentious man. How long and how much the slaves en­
	  <lb/>dured under his power I know not, but at last, he took a
	  <lb/>fancy to two of the negroes' wives, ordered them to be
	  <lb/>brought to his house, and in spite of their entreaties and
	  <lb/>resistance, compelled them to remain as long as he
	  <lb/>thought proper. The husbands found their little huts
	  <lb/>deserted, and knew very well where the blame rested.
	  <lb/>In such a case, <emph>you</emph> would have gone to law; but the law
	  <lb/>does not recognise a negro's rights — he is the <emph>property</emph>
	  <lb/>of his master, and subject to the will of his agent. If
	  <lb/>a slave should talk of being protected in his domestic re­
	  <lb/>lations, it would cause great merriment in a slave-holding
	  <lb/>State; the proposition would be deemed equally inconve­
	  <lb/>nient and absurd. Under such circumstances, the negro
	  <lb/>husbands took justice into their own hands. They mur­
	  <lb/>dered the overseer. Four innocent slaves were taken
	  <lb/>up, and upon every slight circumstantial evidence were
	  <lb/>condemned to be shot; but the real actors of this scene
	  <lb/>passed unsuspected. When the unhappy men found
	  <lb/>their companions were condemned to die, they avowed
	  <lb/>the fact, and exculpated all others from any share in the
	  <lb/>deed. Was not this true magnanimity? Can you help
	  <lb/>respecting those negroes? If you can, I pity you.</p>
        <p>Since the condition of slaves is such as I have describ­
	  <lb/>ed, are you surprised at occasional insurrections? You
	  <lb/>may <emph>regret</emph> it most deeply; but <emph>can</emph> you wonder at it.
	  <lb/>The famous <persName>Captain Smith</persName>, when he was a slave in <placeName>Tar­
	  <lb/>tary</placeName>, killed his overseer and made his escape. I never
	  <lb/>heard him blamed for it — it seems to be universally con­
	  <lb/>sidered a simple act of self-defence. The same thing
	  <lb/>has often occurred with regard to white men taken by
	  <lb/>the <placeName>Algerines</placeName>.</p>
        <p>The <name>Poles</name> have shed Russian <quote>blood enough to float
	    <lb/>our navy;</quote> and we admire and praise them, because
	  <lb/>they did it in resistance of oppression. Yet they have
	  <lb/>suffered less than black slaves, all the world over, are
	  <lb/>suffering. We honor our forefathers because they re­
	  <lb/>belled against certain principles dangerous to political
	  <lb/>freedom; yet from actual, personal tyranny, they suffered

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">207</mw>
	  <lb/>nothing: the negro, on the contrary, is suffering all that
	  <lb/>oppression <emph>can</emph> make human nature suffer. Why do we
	  <lb/>exercrate in one set of men, what we laud so highly in
	  <lb/>another? I shall be reminded that insurrections and mur­
	  <lb/>ders are totally at variance with the precepts of our reli­
	  <lb/>gion; and this is most true. But according to this rule,
	  <lb/>the <name>Americans</name>, <name>Poles</name>, <name>Parisians</name>, <name>Belgians</name>, and all who
	  <lb/>have shed blood for the sake of liberty, are more to blame
	  <lb/>than the negroes; for the former are more enlightened,
	  <lb/>and can always have access to the fountain of religion;
	  <lb/>while the latter are kept in a state of brutal ignorance —
	  <lb/>not allowed to read their Bibles — knowing nothing of
	  <lb/><name>Christianity</name>, except the examples of their masters, who
	  <lb/>profess to be governed by its maxims.</p>
        <p>I hope I shall not be misunderstood on this point. I
	  <lb/>am not vindicating insurrections and murders; the very
	  <lb/>thought makes my blood run cold. I believe revenge is
	  <lb/><emph>always</emph> wicked; but I say, what the laws of every country
	  <lb/>acknowledge, that great provocations are a palliation of
	  <lb/>great crimes. When a man steals food because he is
	  <lb/>starving, we are more disposed to pity, than to blame him.
	  <lb/>And what <emph>can</emph> human nature do, subject to continual and
	  <lb/>oppressive wrong — hopeless of change — not only unpro­
	  <lb/>tected by law, but the law itself changed into an enemy —
	  <lb/>and to complete the whole, shut out from the instructions
	  <lb/>and consolations of the Gospel! No wonder the West
	  <lb/>Indian missionaries found it very difficult to decide what
	  <lb/>they ought to say to the poor, suffering negroes! They
	  <lb/>could indeed tell them it was very impolitic to be rash
	  <lb/>and violent, because it could not, under existing circum­
	  <lb/>stances, make their situation better, and would be very
	  <lb/>likely to make it worse; but if they urged the maxims of
	  <lb/>religion, the slaves might ask the embarrassing question,
	  <lb/>is not our treatment in direct opposition to the precepts
	  <lb/>of the gospel? Our masters can read the Bible — they
	  <lb/>have a chance to know better. Why do not <name>Christians</name>
	  <lb/>deal justly by us, before they require us to deal merci­
	  <lb/>fully with them?</p>
        <p>Think of all these things, kind-hearted reader. Try
	  <lb/>to judge the negro by the same rules you judge other
	  <lb/>men; and while you condemn his faults, do not forget
	  <lb/>his manifold provocations.</p>

        <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">While</hi> we bestow our earnest disapprobation on the
	  <lb/>system of slavery, let us not flatter ourselves that we are
	  <lb/>in reality any better than our brethren of the South.
	  <lb/>Thanks to our soil and climate, and the early exertions
	  <lb/>of the <name>Quakers</name>, the <emph>form</emph> of slavery does not exist among
	  <lb/>us; but the very <emph>spirit</emph> of the hateful and mischievous
	  <lb/>thing is here is all its strength. The manner in which
	  <lb/>we use what power we have, gives us ample reason to be
	  <lb/>grateful that the nature of our institutions does not intrust
	  <lb/>us with more. Our prejudices against colored people is
	  <lb/>even more inveterate than it is at the South. The plan­
	  <lb/>ter is often attached to his negroes, and lavishes caresses
	  <lb/>and kind words upon them, as he would on a favorite
	  <lb/>hound: but our cold-hearted, ignoble prejudice admits
	  <lb/>of no exception — no intermission.</p>
        <p>The Southerners have long continued habit, apparent
	  <lb/>interest and dreaded danger, to palliate the wrong they
	  <lb/>do<unclear reason="flawed-reproduction">:</unclear> but we stand without excuse. They tell us that North­
	  <lb/>ern ships and Northern capital have been engaged in this

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">209</mw>
	  <lb/>wicked business; and the reproach is true. Several for­
	  <lb/>tunes in this city have been made by the sale of negro blood.
	  <lb/>If these criminal transactions are still carried on, they
	  <lb/>are done in silence and secrecy, because public opinion
	  <lb/>has made them disgraceful. But if the free States wished
	  <lb/>to cherish the system of slavery forever, they could not
	  <lb/>take<choice><sic/><corr> </corr></choice>a more direct course than they now do. Those who
	  <lb/>are kind and liberal on all other subjects, unite with the
	  <lb/>selfish and the proud in their unrelenting efforts to keep
	  <lb/>the colored population in the lowest state of degradation;
	  <lb/>and the influence they unconsciously exert over children
	  <lb/>early infuses into their innocent minds the same strong
	  <lb/>feelings of contempt.</p>
        <p>The intelligent and well informed have the least share of
	  <lb/>this prejudice; and when their minds can be brought to
	  <lb/>reflect upon it, I have generally observed that they soon 
	  <lb/>cease to have any at all. But such a general apathy pre­
	  <lb/>vails and the subject is so seldom brought into view, that
	  <lb/>few are really aware how oppressively the influence of
	  <lb/>society is made to bear upon this injured class of the
	  <lb/>community. When I have related facts, that came
	  <lb/>under my own observation, I have often been listened to
	  <lb/>with surprise, which gradually increased to indignation.
	  <lb/>In order that my readers may not be ignorant of the ex­
	  <lb/>tent of this tyrannical prejudice, I will as briefly as pos­
	  <lb/>sible state the evidence, and leave them to judge of it, as
	  <lb/>their hearts and consciences may dictate.</p>
        <p>In the first place, an unjust law exists in this Common­
	  <lb/>wealth, by which marriages between persons of different
	  <lb/>color is pronounced illegal. I am perfectly aware of the
	  <lb/>gross ridicule to which I may subject myself by alluding
	  <lb/>to this particular; but I have lived too long, and observed
	  <lb/>too much, to be disturbed by the world's mockery. In
	  <lb/>the first place, the government ought not to be invested
	  <lb/>with power to control the affections, any more than the
	  <lb/>consciences of citizens. A man has at least as good a
	  <lb/>right to choose his wife, as he has to choose his religion.
	  <lb/>His taste may not suit his neighbors; but so long as his
	  <lb/>deportment is correct, they have no right to interfere
	  <lb/>with his concerns. In the second place, this law is a
	  <lb/><emph>useless</emph> disgrace to <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>. Under existing cir­

	  <lb/>cumstances, none but those whose condition in life is too
	  <lb/>low to be much affected by public opinion, will form such
	  <lb/>alliances; and they, when they choose to do so, <emph>will</emph>
	  <lb/>make such marriages, in spite of the law. I know two
	  <lb/>or three instances where women of the laboring class
	  <lb/>have been united to reputable, industrious colored men.
	  <lb/>These husbands regularly bring home their wages, and
	  <lb/>are kind to their families. If by some of the odd
	  <lb/>chances, which not unfrequently occur in the world, their
	  <lb/>wives should become heirs to any property, the children
	  <lb/>may be wronged out of it, because the law pronounces
	  <lb/>them illegitimate. And while this injustice exists with
	  <lb/>regard to <emph>honest</emph>, industrious individuals, who are merely
	  <lb/>guilty of differing from us in a matter of taste, neither
	  <lb/>the legislation nor customs of slave-holding States exert
	  <lb/>their influence against <emph>immoral</emph> connexions.</p>
        <p>In one portion of our country this fact is shown in a
	  <lb/>very peculiar and striking manner. There is a numer­
	  <lb/>ous class at <placeName>New Orleans</placeName>, called Quateroons, or Quad­
	  <lb/>roons, because their colored blood has for several succes­
	  <lb/>sive generations been intermingled with the white. The
	  <lb/>women are much distinguished for personal beauty and
	  <lb/>gracefulness of motion; and their parents frequently send
	  <lb/>them to <placeName>France</placeName> for the advantages of an elegant education.
	  <lb/>White gentlemen of the first rank are desirous of being
	  <lb/>invited to their parties, and often become seriously in love
	  <lb/>with these fascinating but unfortunate beings. Prejudice
	  <lb/>forbids matrimony, but universal custom sanctions tem­
	  <lb/>porary connexions, to which a certain degreee of respec­
	  <lb/>tability is allowed, on account of the peculiar situation of
	  <lb/>the parties. These attachments often continue for
	  <lb/>years — sometimes for life — and instances are not unfre­
	  <lb/>quent fo exemplary constancy and great propriety of
	  <lb/>deportment.</p>
        <p>What eloquent vituperations we should pour forth, if
	  <lb/>the contending claims of nature and pride produced such
	  <lb/>a tissue of contradictions in some other country, and
	  <lb/>not in our own!</p>
        <p>There is another <placeName>Massachussetts</placeName> law, which an enlight­
	  <lb/>ened community would not probably suffer to be carried
	  <lb/>into execution under any circumstances; but it still re­

        <p>An honorable <name>Haytian</name> or <name>Brazilian</name>, who visited this
	  <lb/>country for business or information, might come under
	  <lb/>this law, unless public opinion rendered it a mere dead
	  <lb/>letter.</p>
        <p>There is among the colored people an increasing de­
	  <lb/>sire for information, and a laudable ambition to be
	  <lb/>respectable in manners and appearance. Are we not
	  <lb/>foolish as well as sinful, in trying to repress a tendency
	  <lb/>so salutary to themselves, and so beneficial to the commu­
	  <lb/>nity? Several individuals of this class are very desirous
	  <lb/>to have persons of their own color qualified to teach
	  <lb/>something more than mere reading and writing. But
	  <lb/>in the public schools, colored children are subject to
	  <lb/>many discouragements and difficulties; and into the pri­
	  <lb/>vate schools they cannot gain admission. A very sensi­
	  <lb/>ble and well-informed colored woman in a neighboring
	  <lb/>town, whose family have been brought up in a manner
	  <lb/>that excited universal remark and approbation, has been
	  <lb/>extremely desirous to obtain for her eldest daughter the
	  <lb/>advantages of a private school; but she has been reso­
	  <lb/>lutely repulsed, on account of her complexion. The girl
	  <lb/>is a very light mulatto, with great modesty and propriety
	  <lb/>of manners; perhaps no young person in the Common­
	  <lb/>wealth was less likely to have a bad influence on her
	  <lb/>associates. The clergyman respected the family, and
<pb n="212"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="18(4)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">212</mw>
	  <lb/>he remonstrated with the instructer; but while the lat­
	  <lb/>ter admitted the injustice of the thing, he excused him­
	  <lb/>self by saying such a step would occasion the loss of all
	  <lb/>his white scholars.</p>
        <p>In a town adjoining <placeName>Boston</placeName>, a well-behaved colored
	  <lb/>boy was kept out of the public school more than a year,
	  <lb/>by vote of the trustees. His mother, having some in­
	  <lb/>formation herself, knew the importance of knowledge,
	  <lb/>and was anxious to obtain it for her family. She wrote
	  <lb/>repeatedly and urgently; and the school-master himself
	  <lb/>told me that the correctness of her spelling, and the neat­
	  <lb/>ness of her hand-writing formed a curious contrast with
	  <lb/>the notes he received from many white parents. At last,
	  <lb/>this spirited woman appeared before the committee, and
	  <lb/>reminded them that her husband, having for many years
	  <lb/>paid taxes as a citizen, had a right to the privileges of a
	  <lb/>citizen; and if her claim were refused, or longer post­
	  <lb/>poned, she declared her determination to seek justice
	  <lb/>from a higher source. The trustees were, of course,
	  <lb/>obliged to yield to the equality of the laws, with the best
	  <lb/>grace they could. The boy was admitted, and made
	  <lb/>good progress in his studies. Had his mother been too
	  <lb/>ignorant to know her rights, or too abject to demand
	  <lb/>them, the lad would have had a fair chance to get a living
	  <lb/>out of the State as the occupant of a workhouse, or pen­
	  <lb/>itentiary.</p>
        <p>The attempt to establish a school for African girls at
	  <lb/><placeName>Canterbury</placeName>, <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, has made too much noise to
	  <lb/>need a detailed account in this volume. I do not know
	  <lb/>the lady who first formed the project, but I am told that
	  <lb/>she is a benevolent and religious woman. It certainly is
	  <lb/>difficult to imagine any other motives than good ones,
	  <lb/>for an undertaking so arduous and unpopular. Yet had
	  <lb/>the Pope himself attempted to establish his supremacy
	  <lb/>over that commonwealth, he could hardly have been re­
	  <lb/>pelled with more determined and angry resistance. —
	  <lb/>Town meetings were held, the records of which are not
	  <lb/>highly creditable to the parties concerned. Petitions
	  <lb/>were sent to the Legislature, beseeching that no African
	  <lb/>school might be allowed to admit individuals not re­
	  <lb/>siding in the town where said school was established;
<pb n="213"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="18(5)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">213</mw>
	  <lb/>and strange to relate, this law, which makes it impossible
	  <lb/>to collect a sufficient number of pupils, was sanctioned
	  <lb/>by the State. A colored girl, who availed herself of this
	  <lb/>opportunity to gain instruction, was warned out of town,
	  <lb/>and fined for not complying; and the instructress was
	  <lb/>imprisoned for persevering in her benevolent plan.</p>
        <p>It is said, in excuse, that <placeName>Canterbury</placeName> will be inundated
	  <lb/>with vicious characters, who will corrupt the morals of
	  <lb/>the young men; that such a school will break down the
	  <lb/>distinctions between black and white; and that mar­
	  <lb/>riages between people of different colors will be the prob­
	  <lb/>able result. Yet they seem to assume the ground that
	  <lb/>colored people <emph>must</emph> always be an inferior and degraded
	  <lb/>class — that the prejudice against them <emph>must</emph> be eternal;
	  <lb/>being deeply founded in the laws of God and nature. —
	  <lb/>Finally, they endeavored to represent the school as one of
	  <lb/>the <soCalled rend="slant(italic)">incendiary</soCalled> proceedings of the <orgName>Anti-Slavery Society</orgName>;
	  <lb/>and they appeal to the <orgName>Colonization Society</orgName>, as an ag­
	  <lb/>grieved child is wont to appeal to its parent.</p>
        <p>The objection with regard to the introduction of vicious
	  <lb/>characters into a village, certainly has some force; but
	  <lb/>are such persons likely to leave cities for a quiet country
	  <lb/>town, in search of moral and intellectual improvement?
	  <lb/>Is it not obvious that the <emph>best</emph> portion of the colored class
	  <lb/>are the very ones to prize such an opportunity for in­
	  <lb/>struction? Grant that a large proportion of these unfor­
	  <lb/>tunate people <emph>are</emph> vicious — is it not our duty, and of
	  <lb/>course our wisest policy, to try to make them other­
	  <lb/>wise? And what will so effectually elevate their char­
	  <lb/>acter and condition, as knowledge? I beseech you,
	  <lb/>my countrymen, think of these things wisely, and in
	  <lb/>season.</p>
        <p>As for intermarriages, if there be such a repugnance
	  <lb/>between the two races, founded in the laws of <emph>nature</emph>,
	  <lb/>methinks there is small reason to dread their frequency.</p>
        <p>The breaking down of distinctions in society, by means
	  <lb/>of extended information, is an objection which appropri­
	  <lb/>ately belongs to the Emperor of <placeName>Austria</placeName>, or the Sultan of
	  <lb/><placeName>Egypt</placeName>.</p>
        <p>I do not know how the affair at <placeName>Canterbury</placeName> is <emph>generally</emph>
	  <lb/>considered; but I have heard individuals of all parties
<pb n="214"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="18(5)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">214</mw>
	  <lb/>and all opinions speak of it — and never without merri­
	  <lb/>ment or indignation. Fifty years hence, the <emph>black</emph> laws
	  <lb/>of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> will be a greater source of amusement to
	  <lb/>the antiquarian, than her famous <emph>blue</emph> laws.</p>
        <p>A similar, though less violent opposition arose in con­
	  <lb/>sequence of the attempt to establish a college for colored
	  <lb/>people at <placeName>New Haven</placeName>. A young colored man, who tried
	  <lb/>to obtain education at the <orgName>Wesleyan</orgName> college in <placeName>Middleton</placeName>,
	  <lb/>was obliged to relinquish the attempt on account of the
	  <lb/>persecution of his fellow students. Some collegians from
	  <lb/>the South objected to a colored associate in their reci­
	  <lb/>tations; and those from <placeName>New England</placeName> promptly and zeal­
	  <lb/>ously joined in the hue and cry. A small but firm party
	  <lb/>were in favor of giving the colored man a chance to pur­
	  <lb/>sue his studies without insult or interruption; and I am
	  <lb/>told that this manly and disinterested band were all
	  <lb/>Southerners. As for those individuals, who exerted
	  <lb/>their influence to exclude an unoffending fellow-citizen
	  <lb/>from privileges which ought to be equally open to all, it
	  <lb/>is to be hoped that age will make them wiser — and that
	  <lb/>they will learn, before they die, to be ashamed of a step
	  <lb/>attended with more important results than usually belong
	  <lb/>to youthful follies.</p>
        <p>It happens that these experiments have all been made
	  <lb/>in <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>; but it is no more than justice to that
	  <lb/>State to remark that a similar spirit would probably have
	  <lb/>been manifested in <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, under like circum­
	  <lb/>stances. At our debating clubs and other places of pub­
	  <lb/>lic discussion, the demon of prejudice girds himself for
	  <lb/>the battle, the moment negro colleges and high schools
	  <lb/>are alluded to. Alas, while we carry on our lips that
	  <lb/>religion which teaches us to <quote>love our neighbor as our­
	    <lb/>selves,</quote> how little do we cherish its blessed influence
	  <lb/>within our hearts! How much republicanism we have
	  <lb/>to <emph>speak</emph> of, and how little do we practise!</p>
        <p>Let us seriously consider what injury a negro college
	  <lb/>could possibly do us. It is certainly a fair presumption
	  <lb/>that the scholars would be from the better portion of the
	  <lb/>colored population; and it is an equally fair presumption
	  <lb/>that knowledge would improve their characters. There
	  <lb/>are already many hundreds of colored people in the city
<pb n="215"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="18(6)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">215</mw>
	  <lb/>of <placeName>Boston</placeName>. — In the street they generally appear neat and
	  <lb/>respectable; and in our houses they do not <quote>come be­
	    <lb/>tween the wind and our nobility.</quote> Would the addition 
	  <lb/>of one or two hundred more even be perceived? As for
	  <lb/>giving offence to the Southerners by allowing such estab­
	  <lb/>lishments — they have no right to interfere with our
	  <lb/>internal concerns, any more than we have with theirs. —
	  <lb/>Why should they not give up slavery to please us, by the
	  <lb/>same rule that we must refrain from educating the ne­
	  <lb/>groes to please them? If they are at liberty to do wrong,
	  <lb/>we certainly ought to be at liberty to do right. They
	  <lb/>may talk and publish as much about us as they please;
	  <lb/>and we ask for no other influence over them.</p>
        <p>It is a fact not generally known that the brave <persName>Kosci­
	  <lb/>usko</persName> left a fund for the establishment of a negro college
	  <lb/>in the <placeName>United States</placeName>. Little did he think he had been
	  <lb/>fighting for a people, who would not grant one rood of
	  <lb/>their vast territory for the benevolent purpose!</p>
        <p>According to present appearances, a college for col­
	  <lb/>ored persons will be established in <placeName>Canada</placeName>; and thus, by
	  <lb/>means of our foolish and wicked pride, the credit of this
	  <lb/>philanthropic enterprise will be transferred to our mother
	  <lb/>country.</p>
        <p>The preceding chapters show that it has been no un­
	  <lb/>common thing for colored men to be educated at English,
	  <lb/>German, Portuguese and Spanish Universities.</p>
        <p>In <placeName>Boston</placeName> there is an Infant School, three Primary
	  <lb/>Schools, and a Grammar School. The two last, are I
	  <lb/>believe supported by the public; and this fact is highly
	  <lb/>creditable. A building for the colored Grammar School
	  <lb/>is not supplied by the city, though such provision is
	  <lb/>always made for similar institutions for white boys. —
	  <lb/>The apartment is close and uncomfortable, and many
	  <lb/>pupils stay away, who would gladly attend under more
	  <lb/>convenient circumstances. There ought likewise to be
	  <lb/>a colored teacher instead of a white one. Under the do­
	  <lb/>minion of existing prejudices, it is difficult to find a white
	  <lb/>man, well qualified to teach such a school, who feels the
	  <lb/>interest he ought to feel, in these Pariahs<anchor xml:id="a40" rend="pre(*)" corresp="#n40"/> of our republic.

	  <lb/>The parents would repose more confidence in a colored
	  <lb/>instructer; and he, both from sympathy and pride, would
	  <lb/>be better fitted for his task.</p>
        <p>It is peculiarly incumbent on the city authorities to
	  <lb/>supply a commodious building for the colored grammar
	  <lb/>school, because public prejudice excludes these oppress­
	  <lb/>ed people from all lucrative employments, and they can­
	  <lb/>not therefore be supposed to have ample funds of their
	  <lb/>own.</p>
        <p>I was much pleased with the late resolution awarding
	  <lb/><name>Franklin</name> medals to the colored pupils of the grammar
	  <lb/>school; and I was still more pleased with the laudable
	  <lb/>project, originated by <persName>Josiah Holbrook</persName>, Esq. for the es­
	  <lb/>tablishment of a colored Lyceum. Surely a better spirit
	  <lb/>is beginning to work in this cause; and when once
	  <lb/>begun, the good sense and good feeling of the commu­
	  <lb/>nity will bid it go on and prosper. How much this spirit
	  <lb/>will have to contend with is illustrated by the following
	  <lb/>fact. When <persName>President Jackson</persName> entered this city, the
	  <lb/>white children of all the schools were sent out in uniform
	  <lb/>to do him honor. A member of the Committee proposed
	  <lb/>that the pupils of the African schools should be invited
	  <lb/>likewise; but he was the only one who voted for it. He
	  <lb/>then proposed that the yeas and nays should be recorded;
	  <lb/>upon which, most of the gentlemen walked off, to pre­
	  <lb/>vent the question from being taken. Perhaps they felt
	  <lb/>an awkward consciousness of the incongeniality of such
	  <lb/>proceedings with our republican institutions. By order
	  <lb/>of the Committee the vacation of the African schools did
	  <lb/>not commence until the day after the procession of the
	  <lb/>white pupils; and a note to the instructor intimated that
	  <lb/>the pupils were not expected to appear on the Common.
	  <lb/>The reason given was because <quote>their numbers were so
	    <lb/>few;</quote> but in private conversation, fears were expressed
	  <lb/>lest their sable faces should give offence to our slave-
	  <lb/>holding President. In all probability the sight of the
	  <lb/>colored children would have been agreeable to <persName>General
	  <lb/>Jackson</persName>, and seemed more like home, than anything he
	  <lb/>witnessed.</p>
        <p>In the theatre, it is not possible for respectable colored
	  <lb/>people to obtain a decent seat. They must either be ex­
	  <lb/>cluded, or herd with the vicious.</p>

        <p>A fierce excitement prevailed, not long since, because
	  <lb/>a colored man had bought a pew in one of our churches.
	  <lb/>I heard a very kind-hearted and zealous democrat de­
	  <lb/>clare his opinion that <quote>the fellow ought to be turned
	    <lb/>out by constables, if he dared to occupy the pew he had
	    <lb/>purchased.</quote> Even at the communion-table, the mock­
	  <lb/>ery of human pride is mingled with the worship of <persName>Jeho­
	  <lb/>vah</persName>. Again and again have I seen a solitary negro come
	  <lb/>up to the altar, meekly and timidly, after all the white
	  <lb/>communicants had retired. One Episcopal clergyman
	  <lb/>of this city, forms an honorable exception to this remark.
	  <lb/>When there is room at the altar, Mr ―― often makes a
	  <lb/>signal to the colored members of his church to kneel be­
	  <lb/>side their white brethren; and once, when two white
	  <lb/>infants and one colored one were to be baptized, and the
	  <lb/>parents of the latter bashfully lingered far behind the
	  <lb/>others, he silently rebuked the unchristian spirit of pride,
	  <lb/>by first administering the holy ordinance to the little
	  <lb/>dark-skinned child of God.</p>
        <p>An instance of prejudice lately occurred, which I
	  <lb/>should find hard to believe, did I not positively know it
	  <lb/>to be a fact. A gallery pew was purchased in one of our
	  <lb/>churches for two hundred dollars. A few <name>Sabbaths</name> after,
	  <lb/>an address was delivered at that church, in favor of the
	  <lb/><name>Africans</name>. Some colored people, who very naturally wish­
	  <lb/>ed to hear the discourse, went into the gallery; probably
	  <lb/>because they thought they should be deemed less intru­
	  <lb/>sive there than elsewhere. The man who had recently
	  <lb/>bought a pew, found it occupied by colored people, and
	  <lb/>indignantly retired with his family. The next day, he
	  <lb/>purchased a pew in another meeting-house, protesting
	  <lb/>that nothing would tempt him again to make use of seats,
	  <lb/>that had been occupied by negroes.</p>
        <p>A well known country representative, who makes a very
	  <lb/>loud noise about his democracy, once attended the Cath­
	  <lb/>olic church. A pious negro requested him to take off his
	  <lb/>hat, while he stood in the presence of the Virgin <persName>Mary</persName>.
	  <lb/>The white man rudely shoved him aside, saying, <said>You
	    <lb/>son of an <name>Ethiopian</name>, do you dare to speak to me!</said> I
	  <lb/>more than once heard the hero repeat this story; and he
	  <lb/>seemed to take peculiar satisfaction in telling it. Had he

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">218</mw>
	  <lb/>been less ignorant, he would not have chosen <quote>son of an
	    <lb/><name rend="slant(italic)">Ethiopian</name></quote> as an <emph>ignoble</emph> epithet; to have called the <name>Af­
	  <lb/>rican</name> his own equal would have been abundantly more
	  <lb/>sarcastic. The same republican dismissed a strong, in­
	  <lb/>dustrious colored man, who had been employed on the
	  <lb/>farm during his absence. <said>I am too great a democrat,</said>
	  <lb/>quoth he, <said>to have any body in my house, who don't sit
	    <lb/>at my table; and I'll be hanged, if I ever eat with the 
	    <lb/>son of an <name>Ethiopian</name>.</said></p>
        <p>Men whose education leaves them less excuse for such
	  <lb/>illiberality, are yet vulgar enough to join in this ridiculous
	  <lb/>prejudice. The colored woman, whose daughter has
	  <lb/>been mentioned as excluded from a private school, was
	  <lb/>once smuggled into a stage, upon the supposition that she
	  <lb/>was a white woman, with a sallow complexion. Her
	  <lb/>manners were modest and prepossessing, and the gentle­
	  <lb/>men were very polite to her. But when she stopped at
	  <lb/>her own door, and was handed out by her curly-headed
	  <lb/>husband, they were at once surprised and angry to find
	  <lb/>they had been riding with a mulatto — and had, in
	  <lb/>their ignorance, been really civil to her!</p>
        <p>A worthy colored woman, belonging to an adjoining
	  <lb/>town, wished to come into <placeName>Boston</placeName> to attend upon a son,
	  <lb/>who was ill. She had a trunk with her, and was too
	  <lb/>feeble to walk. She begged permission to ride in the
	  <lb/>stage. But the passengers with <soCalled rend="slant(italic)">noble</soCalled> indignation, de­
	  <lb/>clared they would get out, if she were allowed to get in.
	  <lb/>After much entreaty, the driver suffered her to sit by
	  <lb/>him upon the box. When he entered the city, his com­
	  <lb/>rades began to point and sneer. Not having sufficient
	  <lb/>moral courage to endure this, he left the poor woman
	  <lb/>with her trunk, in the middle of the street, far from the
	  <lb/>place of her destination; telling her, with an oath, that
	  <lb/>he would not carry her a step further.</p>
        <p>A friend of mine, lately wished to have a colored girl
	  <lb/>admitted into the stage with her, to take care of her
	  <lb/>babe. The girl very lightly tinged with the sable
	  <lb/>hue, had handsome Indian features, and very pleasing
	  <lb/>manners. It was, however, evident that she was not
	  <lb/>white; and therefore the passengers objected to her
	  <lb/>company. This of course, produced a good deal of in­
<pb n="219"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="19(2)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">219</mw>
	  <lb/>convenience on one side, and mortification on the other.
	  <lb/>My friend repeated the circumstance to a lady, who, as
	  <lb/>the daughter and wife of a clergyman, might be supposed
	  <lb/>to have imbibed some liberality. The lady seemed to
	  <lb/>think the experiment was very preposterous; but when
	  <lb/>my friend alluded to the mixed parentage of the girl, she
	  <lb/>exclaimed, with generous enthusiasm, <said>Oh, that alters
	    <lb/>the case, <name rend="slant(italic)">Indians</name> certainly <emph>have</emph> their rights.</said></p>
        <p>Every year a colored gentleman and scholar is becom­
	  <lb/>ing less and less of a rarity — thanks to the existence of
	  <lb/>the <placeName>Haytian Republic</placeName>, and the increasing liberality of
	  <lb/>the world! Yet if a person of refinement from <placeName>Hayti</placeName>,
	  <lb/><placeName>Brazil</placeName>, or other countries, which we deem less enlight­
	  <lb/>ened than our own, should visit us, the very boys of this
	  <lb/>republic would dog his footsteps with the vulgar outcry of
	  <lb/><said>Nigger! Nigger!</said> I have known this to be done, from
	  <lb/>no other provocation than the sight of a colored man
	  <lb/>with the dress and deportment of a gentleman. Were
	  <lb/>it not that republicanism, like <name>Christianity</name>, is often per­
	  <lb/>verted from its true spirit by the bad passions of mankind,
	  <lb/>such things as these would make every honest mind dis­
	  <lb/>gusted with the very name of republics.</p>
        <p>I am acquainted with a gentleman from <placeName>Brazil</placeName> who is
	  <lb/>shrewd, enterprising, noble-spirited, and highly respect­
	  <lb/>able in character and manners; yet he has experienced
	  <lb/>almost every species of indignity on account of his color.
	  <lb/>Not long since, it became necessary for him to visit the
	  <lb/>southern shores of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, to settle certain ac­
	  <lb/>counts connected with his business. His wife was in a
	  <lb/>feeble state of health, and the physicians had recom­
	  <lb/>mended a voyage. For this reason, he took passage for 
	  <lb/>her with himself in the steam-boat; and the captain, as
	  <lb/>it appears, made no objection to a colored gentleman's
	  <lb/>money. After remaining on deck some time, Mrs ――
	  <lb/>attempted to pass into the cabin; but the captain pre­
	  <lb/>vented her; saying, <said>You must go down forward.</said> —
	  <lb/>The <name>Brazilian</name> urged that he had paid the customary
	  <lb/>price, and therefore his wife and infant had a right to a
	  <lb/>place in the ladies' cabin. The captain answered,
	  <lb/><said>Your wife a'n't a lady; she is a nigger.</said> The forward
	  <lb/>cabin was occupied by sailors; was entirely without
<pb n="220"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="19(2)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">220</mw>
	  <lb/>accomodations for women, and admitted the sea-
	  <lb/>water, so that a person could not sit in it comfortably with­
	  <lb/>out keeping the feet raised in a chair. The husband
	  <lb/>stated that his wife's health would not admit of such ex­
	  <lb/>posure; to which the captain still replied, <said>I don't allow
	    <lb/>any niggers in my cabin.</said> With natural and honest in­
	  <lb/>dignation, the <name>Brazilian</name> exclaimed, <said>You <name>Americans</name>
	    <lb/>talk about the <name>Poles</name>! You are a great deal more Russian
	    <lb/>than the <name>Russians</name>.</said> The affair was concluded by
	  <lb/>placing the colored gentleman and his invalid wife on the
	  <lb/>shore, and leaving them to provide for themselves as they
	  <lb/>could. Had the cabin been full, there would have been
	  <lb/>some excuse; but it was occupied only by two sailors'
	  <lb/>wives. The same individual sent for a relative in a distant
	  <lb/>town on account of illness in his family. After staying
	  <lb/>several weeks, it became necessary for her to return;
	  <lb/>and he procured a seat for her in the stage. The same
	  <lb/>ridiculous scene occurred; the passengers were afraid of
	  <lb/>losing their dignity by riding with a neat, respectable
	  <lb/>person, whose face was darker than their own. No pub­
	  <lb/>lic vehicle could be obtained, by which a colored citizen
	  <lb/>could be conveyed to her home; it therefore became
	  <lb/>absolutely necessary for the gentleman to leave his busi­
	  <lb/>ness and hire a chaise at great expense. Such proceed­
	  <lb/>ings are really inexcusable. No authority can be found
	  <lb/>for them in religion, reason, or the laws.</p>
        <p>The Bible informs us that <quote>a man of <placeName>Ethiopia</placeName>, an
	    <lb/>eunuch of great authority under <persName>Candace</persName>, Queen of the
	    <lb/><name>Ethiopians</name>, who had charge of all her treasure, came to
	    <lb/><placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> to worship.</quote> Returning in his chariot, he
	  <lb/>read <persName>Esaias</persName>, the Prophet; and at his request <persName>Phillip</persName> went
	  <lb/>up into the chariot and sat with him, explaining the
	  <lb/>Scriptures. Where should we now find an apostle, who
	  <lb/>would ride in the same chariot with an <name>Ethiopian</name>!</p>
        <p>Will any candid person tell me why respectable colored
	  <lb/>people should not be allowed to make use of public con­
	  <lb/>veyances, open to all who are able and willing to pay
	  <lb/>for the privilege? Those who enter a vessel, or a stage-
	  <lb/>coach, cannot expect to select their companions. If
	  <lb/>they can afford to take a carriage or boat for themselves,
	  <lb/>then, and then only, they have a right to be exclusive. I

	  <lb/>was lately talking with a young gentleman on this sub­
	  <lb/>ject, who professed to have no prejudice against colored
	  <lb/>people, except so far as they were ignorant and vulgar;
	  <lb/>but still he could not tolerate the idea of allowing them
	  <lb/>to enter stages and steam-boats. <said>Yet, you allow the
	    <lb/>same privilege to vulgar and ignorant white men, with­
	    <lb/>out a murmur,</said> I replied; <said>Pray give a good republican
	    <lb/>reason why a respectable colored citizen should be less
	    <lb/>favored.</said> For want of a better argument, he said —
	  <lb/>(pardon me, fastidious reader) — he implied that the pres­
	  <lb/>ence of colored persons was less agreeable than Otto of
	  <lb/>Rose, or Eau de Cologne; and this distinction, he urged
	  <lb/>was made by God himself. I answered, <said>Whoever
	    <lb/>takes his chance in a public vehicle, is liable to meet
	    <lb/>with uncleanly white passengers, whose breath may be
	    <lb/>redolent with the fumes of American cigars, or American
	    <lb/>gin. Neither of these articles have a fragrance peculiarly
	    <lb/>agreeable to nerves of delicate organization. Allowing
	    <lb/>your argument double the weight it deserves, it is utter
	    <lb/>nonsense to pretend that the inconvenience in the case I
	    <lb/>have supposed is not infinitely greater. But what is more
	    <lb/>to the point, do you dine in a fashionable hotel, do you sail
	    <lb/>in a fashionable steam-boat, do you sup at a fashionable
	    <lb/>house, without having negro servants behind your chair.
	    <lb/>Would they be any more disagreeable, as <emph>passengers</emph>
	    <lb/>seated in the corner of a stage, or a steam-boat, than
	    <lb/>as <emph>waiters</emph> in such immediate attendance upon your
	    <lb/>person?</said></p>
        <p>Stage-drivers are very much perplexed when they at­
	  <lb/>tempt to vindicate the present tyrannical customs; and
	  <lb/>they usually give up the point, by saying they themselves
	  <lb/>have no prejudice against colored people — they are
	  <lb/>merely afraid of the public. But stage-drivers should re­
	  <lb/>menber that in a popular government, they, in common
	  <lb/>with every other citizen, form a part and portion of the 
	  <lb/>dreaded public.</p>
        <p>The gold was never coined for which I would barter
	  <lb/>my individual freedom of acting and thinking upon any
	  <lb/>subject, or knowingly interfere with the rights of the
	  <lb/>meanest human being. The only true courage is that
	  <lb/>which impels us to do right without regard to consequen­
<mw type="sig" rend="align(left)indent(2)">19*</mw>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">222</mw>
	  <lb/>ces. To fear a populace is as servile as to fear an empe­
	  <lb/>ror. The only salutary restraint is the fear of doing
	  <lb/>wrong.</p>
        <p>Our representatives to Congress have repeatedly rode
	  <lb/>in a stage with colored servants at the request of their
	  <lb/>masters. Whether this is because <name>New Englanders</name> are
	  <lb/>willing to do out of courtesy to a Southern gentleman,
	  <lb/>what they object to doing from justice to a colored citi­
	  <lb/>zen, — or whether those representatives, being educated
	  <lb/>men, were more than usually divested of this absurd pre­
	  <lb/>judice, — I will not pretend to say.</p>
        <p>The state of public feeling not only makes it difficult
	  <lb/>for the <name>Africans</name> to obtain information, but it prevents
	  <lb/>them from making profitable use of what knowledge
	  <lb/>they have. A colored man, however intelligent, is not
	  <lb/>allowed to pursue any business more lucrative than that
	  <lb/>of a barber, a shoe-black, or a waiter. These, and all
	  <lb/>other employments, are truly respectable, whenever the
	  <lb/>duties connected with them are faithfully performed;
	  <lb/>but it is unjust that a man should, on account of his com­
	  <lb/>plexion, be prevented from performing more elevated
	  <lb/>uses in society. Every citizen ought to have a fair
	  <lb/>chance to try his fortune in any line of business, which
	  <lb/>he thinks he has ability to transact. Why should not
	  <lb/>colored men be employed in the manufactories of various
	  <lb/>kinds? If their ignorance is an objection, let them be
	  <lb/>enlightened, as speedily as possible. If their moral char­
	  <lb/>acter is not sufficiently pure, remove the pressure of pub­
	  <lb/>lic scorn, and thus supply them with motives for being
	  <lb/>respectable. All this can be done. It merely requires
	  <lb/>an earnest wish to overcome a prejudice, which has
	  <lb/><quote>grown with our growth and strengthened with our
	    <lb/>strength,</quote> but which is in fact opposed to the spirit of
	  <lb/>our religion, and contrary to the instinctive good feel­
	  <lb/>ings of our nature. When examined by the clear light
	  <lb/>of reason, it disappears. Prejudices of all kinds have
	  <lb/>their strongest holds in the minds of the vulgar and the
	  <lb/>ignorant. In a community so enlightened as our own,
	  <lb/>they must gradually melt away under the influence of
	  <lb/>public discussion. There is no want of kind feelings
	  <lb/>and liberal sentiments in the American people; the sim­
<pb n="223"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="19(4)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">223</mw>
	  <lb/>ple fact is, they have not <emph>thought</emph> upon this subject. —
	  <lb/>An active and enterprising community are not apt to
	  <lb/>concern themselves about laws and customs, which do
	  <lb/>not obviously interfere with their interests or convenience;
	  <lb/>and various political and prudential motives have com­
	  <lb/>bined to fetter free inquiry in this direction. Thus we
	  <lb/>have gone on, year after year, thoughtlessly sanctioning,
	  <lb/>by our silence and indifference, evils which our hearts
	  <lb/>and consciences are far enough from approving.</p>
        <p>It has been shown that no other people on earth in­
	  <lb/>dulge so strong a prejudice with regard to color, as we
	  <lb/>do. It is urged that negroes are civilly treated in <placeName>Eng­
	  <lb/>land</placeName>, because their numbers are so few. I could never
	  <lb/>discover any great force in this argument. Colored peo­
	  <lb/>ple are certainly not sufficiently rare in that country to
	  <lb/>be regarded as a great show, like a giraffe, or a <placeName>Sand­
	  <lb/>wich Island</placeName> king; and on the other hand, it would seem
	  <lb/>natural that those who were more accustomed to the sight
	  <lb/>of dark faces would find their aversion diminished, rather
	  <lb/>than increased.</p>
        <p>The absence of prejudice in the Portuguese and Span­
	  <lb/>ish settlements is accounted for, by saying that the
	  <lb/>white people are very little superior to the negroes in
	  <lb/>knowledge and refinement. But <persName>Doctor Walsh's</persName> book
	  <lb/>certainly gives us no reason to think meanly of the <name>Bra­
	  <lb/>zilians</name>; and it has been my good fortune to be acquaint­
	  <lb/>ed with many highly intelligent <name>South Americans</name>, who
	  <lb/>were divested of this prejudice, and much surprised at
	  <lb/>its existence here.</p>
        <p>If the <name>South Americans</name> are really in such a low state
	  <lb/>as the argument implies, it is a still greater disgrace to
	  <lb/>us to be outdone in liberality and consistent republican­
	  <lb/>ism by men so much less enlightened than ourselves.</p>
        <p>Pride will doubtless hold out with strength and adroit­
	  <lb/>ness against the besiegers of its fortress; but it is an ob­
	  <lb/>vious truth that the condition of the world is rapidly im­
	  <lb/>proving, and that our laws and customs must change
	  <lb/>with it.</p>
        <p>Neither ancient nor modern history furnishes a page
	  <lb/>more glorious than the last twenty years in <placeName>England</placeName>; for
	  <lb/>at every step, free principles, after a long and arduous

	  <lb/>struggle, have conquered selfishness and tyranny. Al­
	  <lb/>most all great evils are resisted by individuals who di­
	  <lb/>rectly suffer injustice or inconvenience from them; but
	  <lb/>it is a peculiar beauty of the abolition cause that its de­
	  <lb/>fenders enter the lists against wealth, and power, and
	  <lb/>talent, not to defend their own rights, but to protect weak
	  <lb/>and injured neighbors, who are not allowed to speak for
	  <lb/>themselves.</p>
        <p>Those, who became interested in a cause laboring so
	  <lb/>heavily under the pressure of present unpopularity, must
	  <lb/>expect to be assailed by every form of bitterness and so­
	  <lb/>phistry. At times, discouraged and heart-sick, they
	  <lb/>will perhaps begin to doubt whether there are in reality
	  <lb/>any unalterable principles of right and wrong. But let
	  <lb/>them cast aside the fear of man, and keep their minds
	  <lb/>fixed on a few of the simple, unchangeable laws of God,
	  <lb/>and they will certainly receive strength to contend with
	  <lb/>the adversary.</p>
        <p>Paragraphs in the Southern papers already begin to
	  <lb/>imply that the <placeName>United States</placeName> will not look tamely on,
	  <lb/>while <placeName>England</placeName> emancipates her slaves; and they inform
	  <lb/>us that the inspection of the naval stations has become
	  <lb/>a subject of great importance since the recent measures
	  <lb/>of the <orgName>British Parliament</orgName>. A republic declaring war
	  <lb/>with a monarchy, because she gave freedom to her slaves,
	  <lb/>would indeed form a beautiful moral picture for the ad­
	  <lb/>miration of the world!</p>
        <p><persName>Mr Garrison</persName> was the first person who dared to edit a
	  <lb/>newspaper, in which slavery was spoken of as altogether
	  <lb/>wicked and inexcusable. For this crime the Legislature
	  <lb/>of <placeName>Georgia</placeName> have offered five thousand dollars to any one
	  <lb/>who will <quote>arrest and prosecute him to conviction <emph>under
	      <lb/>the laws of that State</emph>.</quote> An association of gentlemen
	  <lb/>in <placeName>South Carolina</placeName> have likewise offered a large reward
	  <lb/>for the same object. It is, to say the least, a very
	  <lb/>remarkable step for one State in this Union to promul­
	  <lb/>gate such a law concerning a citizen of another State,
	  <lb/>merely for publishing his opinions boldly. The disciples
	  <lb/>of <persName>Fanny Wright</persName> promulgate the most zealous and viru­

	  <lb/>truly rational ground that individual freedom of opinion
	  <lb/>ought to be respected — that what is false cannot stand,
	  <lb/>and what is true cannot be overthrown. We leave <name>Chris­
	  <lb/>tianity</name> to take care of itself; but slavery is a <quote>delicate
	    <lb/>subject,</quote> — and whoever attacks that must be punished.
	  <lb/><persName>Mr Garrison</persName> is a disinterested, intelligent, and remark­
	  <lb/>ably pure-minded man, whose only fault is that he
	  <lb/>cannot be moderate on a subject which it is exceedingly
	  <lb/>difficult for an honest mind to examine with calmness.
	  <lb/>Many, who highly respect his character, and motives,
	  <lb/>regret his tendency to use wholesale and unqualified
	  <lb/>expressions; but it is something to have the truth told,
	  <lb/>even if it be not in the most judicious way. Where an
	  <lb/>evil is powerfully supported by the self-interest and
	  <lb/>prejudice of the community, none but an ardent indi­
	  <lb/>vidual will venture to meddle  with it. <persName>Luther</persName> was
	  <lb/>deemed indiscreet even by those who liked him best;
	  <lb/>yet a more prudent man would never have given an
	  <lb/>impetus sufficiently powerful to heave the great mass
	  <lb/>of corruption under which the church was buried. <persName>Mr
	  <lb/>Garrison</persName> has certainly the merit of having first called
	  <lb/>public attention to a neglected and very important sub­
	  <lb/>ject. I believe whoever fairly and dispassionately exam­
	  <lb/>ines the question, will be more than disposed to forgive
	  <lb/>the occasional faults of an ardent temperament, in con­
	  <lb/>sideration of the difficulty of the undertaking, and the
	  <lb/>violence with which it has been opposed.</p>
        <p>The palliator of slavery assures the abolitionists that
	  <lb/>their benevolence is perfectly quixotic — that the negroes
	  <lb/>are happy and contented, and have no desire to change
	  <lb/>their lot. An answer to this may, as I have already said,
	  <lb/>be found in the Judicial Reports of slave-holding States,
	  <lb/>in the vigilance of their laws, in advertisements for run­
	  <lb/>away slaves, and in the details of their own newspapers.
	  <lb/>The <placeName>West India</placeName> planters make the same protestations
	  <lb/>concerning the happiness of their slaves; yet the cruel­
	  <lb/>ties proved by undoubted and unanswerable testimony
	  <lb/>are enough to break a compassionate heart. It is said
	  <lb/>that slavery is a great deal worse in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName> than
	  <lb/>in the <placeName>United States</placeName>; but I believe precisely the re­
	  <lb/>verse of this proposition has been true within late years;
	  <lb/>for the English government have been earnestly trying to
<pb n="226"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="19(5)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">226</mw>
	  <lb/>atone for their guilt, by the introduction of laws express­
	  <lb/>ly framed to guard the weak and defenceless. A gentle­
	  <lb/>man who has been a great deal among the planters of
	  <lb/>both countries, and who is by no means favorable to
	  <lb/>anti-slavery, gives it as his decided opinion that the 
	  <lb/>slaves are better off in the <placeName>West Indies</placeName>, than they are in
	  <lb/>the <placeName>United States</placeName>. It is true we <emph>hear</emph> a great deal more
	  <lb/>about West Indian cruelty than we do about our own.—
	  <lb/>English books and periodicals are continually full of the
	  <lb/>subject; and even in the colonies, newspapers openly de­
	  <lb/>nounce the hateful system, and take every opportunity to
	  <lb/>prove the amount of wretchedness it produces. In this
	  <lb/>country, we have not, until very recently, dared to pub­
	  <lb/>lish anything upon the subject. Our books, our re­
	  <lb/>views, our newspapers, our almanacs, have all been si­
	  <lb/>lent, or exerted their influence on the wrong side. The
	  <lb/>negro's crimes are repeated, but his sufferings are never
	  <lb/>told. Even in our geographies it is taught that the col­
	  <lb/>ored race <emph>must</emph> always be degraded. Now and then an­
	  <lb/>ecdotes of cruelties committed in the slave-holding States
	  <lb/>are told by individuals who witnessed them; but they are
	  <lb/>almost always afraid to give their names to the public,
	  <lb/>because the Southerners will call them <quote>a disgrace to
	    <lb/>the soil,</quote> and the Northerners will echo the sentiment. —
	  <lb/>The promptitude and earnestness with which <placeName>New Eng­
	    <lb/>land</placeName> has aided the slave-holders in repressing all discus­
	  <lb/>sions which they were desirous to avoid, has called forth
	  <lb/>many expressions of gratitude in their public speeches,
	  <lb/>and private conversation; and truly we have well earned
	  <lb/><persName>Randolph's</persName> favorite appellation, <quote>the white slaves of
	    <lb/>the North,</quote> by our tameness and servility with regard to
	  <lb/>a subject, where good feeling and good principle alike
	  <lb/>demanded a firm and independent spirit.</p>
        <p>We are told that the Southerners will of themselves do
	  <lb/>away slavery, and they alone understand how to do it. —
	  <lb/>But it is an obvious fact that all their measures have tend­
	  <lb/>ed to perpetuate the system; and even if we have the
	  <lb/>fullest faith that they mean to do their duty, the belief
	  <lb/>by no means absolves us from doing ours. The evil is
	  <lb/>gigantic; and its removal requires every heart and head
	  <lb/>in the community.</p>
        <pb n="227"/>

        <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">227</mw>
        <p>It is said that our sympathies ought to be given to the
	  <lb/>masters, who are abundantly more to be pitied than the
	  <lb/>slaves. If this be the case, the planters are singularly
	  <lb/>disinterested not to change places with their bondmen,
	  <lb/>Our sympathies <emph>have</emph> been given to the masters — and to
	  <lb/>those masters who seemed most desirous to remain for­
	  <lb/>ever in their pitiable condition. There are hearts at the
	  <lb/>South sincerely desirous of doing right in this cause;
	  <lb/>but their generous impulses are checked by the laws of
	  <lb/>their respective States, and the strong disapprobation of 
	  <lb/>their neighbors. I know a lady in <placeName>Georgia</placeName>, who would,
	  <lb/>I believe, make any personal sacrifice to instruct her
	  <lb/>slaves, and give them freedom; but if she were found
	  <lb/>guilty of teaching the alphabet, or manumitting her slaves,
	  <lb/>fines and imprisonment would be the consequence; if 
	  <lb/>she sold them, they would be likely to fall into hands less
	  <lb/>merciful than her own. Of such slave-owners we can­
	  <lb/>not speak with too much respect and tenderness. They
	  <lb/>are comparatively few in number, and stand in a most per­
	  <lb/>plexing situation; it is a duty to give all our sympathy to
	  <lb/><emph>them</emph>. It is mere mockery to say, what is so often said,
	  <lb/>that the Southerners, as a body, really wish to abolish
	  <lb/>slavery. If they wished it, they certainly would make
	  <lb/>the attempt. When the majority heartily desire a change,
	  <lb/>it is effected, be the difficulties what they may. The
	  <lb/><name>Americans</name> are peculiarly responsible for the example
	  <lb/>they give; for in no other country does the unchecked
	  <lb/>voice of the people constitute the whole of government.</p>
        <p>We must not be induced to excuse slavery by the plau­
	  <lb/>sible argument that <placeName>England</placeName> introduced it among us. —
	  <lb/>The wickedness of beginning such a work unquestiona­
	  <lb/>bly belongs to her; the sin of continuing it is certainly
	  <lb/>our own. It is true that <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, while a province, did
	  <lb/>petition the British government to check the introduc­
	  <lb/>tion of slaves into the colonies; and their refusal to do
	  <lb/>so was afterward enumerated among the public reasons
	  <lb/>for separating from the mother country: but it is equally
	  <lb/>true that when we became independent, the Southern
	  <lb/>States stipulated that the slave trade should not be abol­
	  <lb/>ished by law until <date when="1808">1808</date>.</p>
        <p>The strongest and best reason that can be given for
<pb n="228"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="19(6)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">228</mw>
	  <lb/>our supineness on the subject of slavery, is the fear of
	  <lb/>dissolving the Union. The <title>Constitution of the <placeName>United
	  <lb/>States</placeName></title> demands our highest reverence. Those who ap­
	  <lb/>prove, and those who disapprove of particular portions,
	  <lb/>are equally bound to yield implicit obedience to its au­
	  <lb/>thority. But we must not forget that the Constitution
	  <lb/>provides for any change that may be required for the
	  <lb/>general good. The great machine is constructed with a 
	  <lb/>safety valve, by which any rapidly increasing evil may
	  <lb/>be expelled whenever the people desire it.</p>
        <p>If the Southern politicians are determined to make a
	  <lb/>Siamese question of this also — if they insist that the Union
	  <lb/>shall not exist without slavery — it can only be said that
	  <lb/>they join two things, which have no affinity with each
	  <lb/>other, and which cannot permanently exist together. —
	  <lb/>They chain the living and vigorous to the diseased and
	  <lb/>dying; and the former will assuredly perish in the infect­
	  <lb/>ed neighborhood.</p>
        <p>The universal introduction of free labor is the surest
	  <lb/>way to consolidate the Union, and enable us to live to­
	  <lb/>gether in harmony and peace. If a history is ever writ­
	  <lb/>ten entitled <title rend="pre(“)post(”)">The Decay and Dissolution of the North
	    <lb/>American Republic,</title> its author will distinctly trace our
	  <lb/>downfall to the existence of slavery among us.</p>
        <p>There is hardly anything bad, in politics or religion,
	  <lb/>that has not been sanctioned or tolerated by a suffer­
	  <lb/>ing community, because certain powerful individuals
	  <lb/>were able to identify the evil with some other principle
	  <lb/>long consecrated to the hearts and consciences of men.</p>
        <p>Under all circumstances, there is but one honest
	  <lb/>course; and that is to do right, and trust the consequen­
	  <lb/>ces to Divine Providence. <quote>Duties are ours; events
	    <lb/>are God's.</quote> Policy, with all her cunning, can devise no
	  <lb/>rule so safe, salutary, and effective, as this simple maxim.</p>
        <p>We cannot too cautiously examine arguments and
	  <lb/>excuses brought forward by those whose interest or
	  <lb/>convenience is connected with keeping their fellow crea­
	  <lb/>tures in a state of ignorance and brutality; and such we
	  <lb/>shall find in abundance, at the North as well as the
	  <lb/>South. I have heard the abolition of slavery condemned
	  <lb/>on the ground that <placeName>New England</placeName> vessels would not be
<pb n="229"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="20(1)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">229</mw>
	  <lb/>employed to export the produce of the South, if they had
	  <lb/>free laborers of their own. This objection is so utterly
	  <lb/>bad in its spirit, that it hardly deserves an answer. As­
	  <lb/>suredly it is a righteous plan to retard the progress of
	  <lb/>liberal principles, and <quote>keep human nature forever in the
	    <lb/>stocks</quote> that some individuals may make a few hundred
	  <lb/>dollars more per annum! Besides, the experience of the
	  <lb/>world abundantly proves that all such forced expedients
	  <lb/>are unwise. The increased prosperity of one country,
	  <lb/>or of one section of a country, always contributes, in
	  <lb/>some form or other, to the prosperity of other states. —
	  <lb/>To <quote>love our neighbor as ourselves</quote> is, after all, the
	  <lb/>shrewdest way of doing business.</p>
        <p>In <placeName>England</placeName>, the abolition of the <emph>traffic</emph> was long and
	  <lb/>stoutly resisted, in the same spirit, and by the same ar­
	  <lb/>guments, that characterize the defence of the <emph>system</emph>
	  <lb/>here; but it would now be difficult to find a man so reck­
	  <lb/>less, that he would not be ashamed of being called a slave
	  <lb/>dealer. Public opinion has nearly conquered one evil,
	  <lb/>and if rightly directed, it will ultimately subdue the
	  <lb/>other.</p>
        <p>Is it asked what can be done? I answer, much, very
	  <lb/>much, can be effected, if each individual will try to de­
	  <lb/>serve the commendation bestowed by our Saviour on the
	  <lb/>woman of old — <quote>She hath done what she could.</quote></p>
        <p>The <name>Quakers</name>, — always remarkable for fearless obe­
	  <lb/>dience to the inward light of conscience, — early gave
	  <lb/>an example worthy of being followed. At their annual
	  <lb/>meeting in <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName>, in <date when="1688">1688</date>, many individuals
	  <lb/>urged the incompatibility of slavery, and <name>Christianity</name>;
	  <lb/>and their zeal continued until, in <date when="1776">1776</date>, all <name>Quakers</name> who
	  <lb/>bought or sold a slave, or refused to emancipate those
	  <lb/>they already owned, were excluded from communion
	  <lb/>with the society. Had it not been for the early exer­
	  <lb/>tions of these excellent people, the fair and flourishing
	  <lb/>State of <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> might now, perchance, be with­
	  <lb/>ering under the effects of slavery. To this day, the
	  <lb/><orgName>Society of Friends</orgName>, both in <placeName>England</placeName> and <placeName>America</placeName>, omit
	  <lb/>no opportunity, public or private, of discountenancing
	  <lb/>this bad system; and the <name>Methodists</name> (at least in <placeName>Eng­
	  <lb/>land</placeName>) have earnestly labored in the same glorious cause.</p>

        <p>The famous <persName>Anthony Benezet</persName>, a <name>Quaker</name> in <placeName>Philadel­
	  <lb/>phia</placeName>, has left us a noble example of what may be done
	  <lb/>for conscience' sake. Being a teacher, he took effectual
	  <lb/>care that his scholars should have ample knowledge and
	  <lb/>christian impressions concerning the nature of slavery;
	  <lb/>he caused articles to be inserted in the almanacs likely
	  <lb/>to arrest public attention upon the subject; he talked
	  <lb/>about it, and wrote letters about it; he published and
	  <lb/>distributed tracts at his own expense; if any person was
	  <lb/>going a journey, his first thought was how he could make
	  <lb/>him instrumental in favor of his benevolent purposes;
	  <lb/>he addressed a petition to the Queen for the suppression
	  <lb/>of the slave-trade; and another to the good Countess of
	  <lb/><placeName>Huntingdon</placeName> beseeching that the rice and indigo planta­
	  <lb/>tions belonging to the orphan-house, which she had en­
	  <lb/>dowed near <placeName>Savannah</placeName>, in <placeName>Georgia</placeName>, might not be cultivated
	  <lb/>by those who encouraged the slave trade; he took care to
	  <lb/>increase the comforts and elevate the character of the
	  <lb/>colored people within his influence; he zealously pro­
	  <lb/>moted the establishment of an African school, and
	  <lb/>devoted much of the two last years of his life to personal
	  <lb/>attendance upon his pupils. By fifty years of constant
	  <lb/>industry he had amassed a small fortune; and this was
	  <lb/>left, after the decease of his widow, to the support of the
	  <lb/>African school.</p>
        <p>Similar exertions, though on a less extensive scale,
	  <lb/>were made by the late excellent <persName>John Kenrick</persName>, of <placeName>Newton</placeName>,
	  <lb/><placeName>Mass</placeName>. For more than thirty years the constant object
	  <lb/>of his thoughts, and the chief purpose of his life, was
	  <lb/>the abolition of slavery. His earnest conversation arous­
	  <lb/>ed many other minds to think and act upon the subject.
	  <lb/>He wrote letters, inserted articles in the newspapers,
	  <lb/>gave liberal donations, and circulated pamphlets at his
	  <lb/>own expense.</p>
        <p><persName>Cowper</persName> contributed much to the cause when he wrote
	  <lb/>the <title rend="pre(“)post(”)">Negro's Complaint,</title> and thus excited the compas­
	  <lb/>sion of his numerous readers. <persName>Wedgewood</persName> aided the
	  <lb/>work, when he caused cameos to be struck, representing
	  <lb/>a kneeling <name>African</name> in chains, and thus made even capri­
	  <lb/>cious fashion an avenue to the heart. <persName>Clarkson</persName> assisted
	  <lb/>by patient investigation of evidence; and <persName>Fox</persName> and <persName>Wil­

	    <lb/>berforce</persName> by eloquent speeches. <persName>Mungo Park</persName> gave his
	  <lb/>powerful influence by the kind and liberal manner in
	  <lb/>which he always represented the <name>Africans</name>. The Duch­
	  <lb/>ess of <placeName>Devonshire</placeName> wrote verses and caused them to be
	  <lb/>set to music; and wherever those lines were sung, some
	  <lb/>hearts were touched in favor of the oppressed. This
	  <lb/>fascinating woman made even her far-famed beauty
	  <lb/>serve in the cause of benevolence. <persName>Fox</persName> was returned for
	  <lb/>Parliament through her influence, and she is said to
	  <lb/>have procured more than one vote, by allowing the yeo­
	  <lb/>manry of <placeName>England</placeName> to kiss her beautiful cheek.</p>
        <p>All are not able to do so much as <persName>Anthony Benezet</persName> and
	  <lb/><persName>John Kenrick</persName> have done; but we can all do something.
	  <lb/>We can speak kindly and respectfully of colored people
	  <lb/>upon all occasions; we can repeat to our children such
	  <lb/>traits as are honorable in their character and history;
	  <lb/>we can avoid making odious caricatures of negroes; we
	  <lb/>can teach boys that it is unmanly and contemptible to
	  <lb/>insult an unfortunate class of people by the vulgar outcry
	  <lb/>of <said>Nigger! — Nigger!</said> — Even <persName>Mahmoud</persName> of <placeName>Turkey</placeName>
	  <lb/>rivals us in liberality — for he long ago ordered a fine to
	  <lb/>be levied upon those who called a <name>Christian</name> a dog; and
	  <lb/>in his dominions the <emph>prejudice</emph> is so great that a <name>Christian</name>
	  <lb/>must be a degraded being. A residence in <placeName>Turkey</placeName>
	  <lb/>might be profitable to those <name>Christians</name> who patronize the
	  <lb/>eternity of prejudice; it would afford an opportunity of
	  <lb/>testing the goodness of the rule, by showing how it works
	  <lb/>both ways.</p>
        <p>If we are not able to contribute to African schools, or
	  <lb/>do not choose to do so, we can at least refrain from op­
	  <lb/>posing them. If it be disagreeable to allow colored
	  <lb/>people the same rights and privileges as other citizens,
	  <lb/>we can do with our prejudice, what most of us often do
	  <lb/>with better feelings — we can conceal it.</p>
        <p>Our almanacs and newspapers can fairly show both
	  <lb/>sides of the question; and if they lean to either party,
	  <lb/>let it not be to the strongest. Our preachers can speak
	  <lb/>of slavery, as they do of other evils. Our poets can find
	  <lb/>in this subject abundant room for sentiment and pathos.
	  <lb/>Our orators (provided they do not want office) may ven­
	  <lb/>ture an allusion to our <emph>in-</emph><quote>glorious institutions.</quote></p>

        <p>The union of individual influence produces a vast
	  <lb/>amount of moral force, which is not the less powerful
	  <lb/>because it is often unperceived. A mere change in the
	  <lb/><emph>direction</emph> of our efforts, without any increased exertion,
	  <lb/>would in the course of a few years, produce an entire
	  <lb/>revolution of public feeling. This slow but sure way of
	  <lb/>doing good is almost the only means by which benevo­
	  <lb/>lence can effect its purpose.</p>
        <p><emph>Sixty thousand</emph> petitions have been addressed to the
	  <lb/>English parliament on the subject of slavery, and a large
	  <lb/>number of them were signed by women. The same
	  <lb/>steps here would be, with one exception, useless and
	  <lb/>injudicious; because the general govenment has no con­
	  <lb/>trol over the legislatures of individual States. But the
	  <lb/><placeName>District of Columbia</placeName> forms an exception to this rule. —
	  <lb/><emph>There</emph> the <placeName>United States</placeName> have power to abolish slavery;
	  <lb/>and it is the duty of the citizens to petition year after
	  <lb/>year, until a reformation is effected. But who will pre­
	  <lb/>sent remonstrances against slavery? The Hon. <persName>John Q.
	  <lb/>Adams</persName> was intrusted with fifteen petitions for the aboli­
	  <lb/>tion of slavery in the <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName>; yet, clearly
	  <lb/>as that gentleman sees and defines the pernicious effects
	  <lb/>of the system, he offered the petitions only to protest
	  <lb/>against them! Another petition to the same effect,
	  <lb/>intrusted to another <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> representative, was
	  <lb/>never noticed at all. <quote><persName>Brutus</persName> is an honorable man: —
	    <lb/>So are they all — all honorable men.</quote> Nevertheless,
	  <lb/>there is, in this popular government, a subject on which it
	  <lb/>is <emph>impossible</emph> for the people to make themselves heard.</p>
        <p>By publishing this book I have put my mite into the
	  <lb/>treasury. The expectation of displeasing all classes has
	  <lb/>not been unaccompanied with pain. But it has been
	  <lb/>strongly impressed upon my mind that it was a duty to
	  <lb/>fulfil this task; and earthly considerations should never
	  <lb/>stifle the voice of conscience.</p>
