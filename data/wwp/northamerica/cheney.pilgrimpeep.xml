		<date when="1636">1636</date> a British vessel
		<lb/>approached the coast of <placeName>New-England</placeName>; it was
		<lb/>filled with adventurers, who, on the first cry of
		<lb/>land, eagerly crowded the deck to catch a glimpse
		<lb/>of its rugged shores. Political dissentions and
		<lb/>religious persecution, which, at that period, un­
		<lb/>happily agitated <placeName>England</placeName>, induced many of her
		<lb/>subjects to quit the home of their fathers, and seek
		<lb/>the hospitality, or endure the rigour of foreign
		<lb/>climes; while others, stimulated by a romantic
		<lb/>spirit of adventure; by ambition, or a thirst of
		<lb/>gain; and allured by the sanguine representations
		<lb/>of the enthusiastic, or the exaggerated reports of
		<lb/>the interested, annually embarked their lives and
		<lb/>fortunes, and swelled the population, and extended

		<lb/>the boundaries of the infant colonies. Such was
		<lb/>the motley group, who now gazed, for the first
		<lb/>time, upon the blue mountains and thickly wooded
		<lb/>shores of <placeName>New-England</placeName>; while, rapidly pressed
		<lb/>forward by a favourable wind, the rough outlines of
		<lb/>the landscape gradually assumed distinctness, and
		<lb/>stood forth in all the glowing beauty and mejestic
		<lb/>grandeur of nature's colouring.</p>
	      <p>Apart from his companions, stood a young man
		<lb/>whose countenance and figure were singularly
		<lb/>prepossessing. In an attitude of deep attention,
		<lb/>he regarded the new world, which stretched around
		<lb/>him;—his dark eyes now sparkling with admira­
		<lb/>tion, then softening into sadness; and, again, some
		<lb/>object of sublimity or beauty kindling the glow of
		<lb/>enthusiasm on his cheek. To him, they seemed
		<lb/>approaching a wilderness; for already the forests
		<lb/>were enveloped in darkness, and the gigantic hills
		<lb/>invested with the shadows of twilight. Presently
		<lb/>a dim speck appeared on the horizon:—it was the
		<lb/>little village of <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, the most ancient of the
		<lb/>settlements, fast rising into importance, and far-
		<lb/>famed for the success and enterprize of its inhabi­
		<lb/>tants.</p>
	      <p>The stranger experienced a momentary disap­
		<lb/>pointment, as he rapidly surveyed the limited di­
		<lb/>mensions, and rude architecture of that new <quote>city
		  <lb/>of refuge.</quote> His fancy had sketched scenes of <rs type="properAdjective">Ar­
		  <lb/>cadian</rs> loveliness, and coloured the picture, which
		<lb/>it drew, with the fairy tints of romance; but he
		<lb/>only saw, rising from the rocky and sea-girt shore,
		<pb n="007"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="1(4)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">7</mw>
		<lb/>the humble roofs of the <name>Pilgrims</name>, clustered to­
		<lb/>gether in two compact lines, and thinly shaded by
		<lb/>native trees; each tenement encircled by a patch
		<lb/>of vegetation, then wearing the seared and fading
		<lb/>hues of autumn. The <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> colours waved
		<lb/>gaily from the battlements of a square fort, which
		<lb/>crowned the summit of a commanding eminence,
		<lb/>and its flat roof was paced by several persons, who
		<lb/>watched with curiousity the approaching vessel.</p>
	      <p><said>And this is my adopted country!</said> was his first
		<lb/>reflection, accompanied by a deep sigh, as his
		<lb/>thoughts reverted to the refinements of polished
		<lb/>life to which he had been accustomed. But this
		<lb/>involuntary chagrin gave place to other feelings,
		<lb/>as the ship rode gallantly into the shallow but ex­
		<lb/>tensive harbour, and anchored beneath the very
		<lb/>rock which, seventeen years before, received the
		<lb/>intrepid band of adventurers, who had forsaken
		<lb/>the enjoyments and comforts of civilized life, brav­
		<lb/>ed the howlings of the wintry blast, the horrors of
		<lb/>famine, and the terrors of an unknown wilderness,
		<lb/>for <quote>conscience' sake,</quote>—reposing an unwavering
		<lb/>confidence in Him, who had hitherto sustained and
		<lb/>kept them, as in the <quote>hollow of his hand.</quote></p>
	      <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName>, in the enthusiasm which the
		<lb/>scene inspired, remained lost in a train of reflec­
		<lb/>tions, till accosted by the captain of the vessel,
		<lb/>who enquired if he had any friend to welcome him
		<lb/>on shore.</p>
	      <p><said>No; I am friendless and a stranger,</said> he re­
		<lb/>plied, and never had the loneliness of his situation

		<lb/>struck so forcibly on his heart; for, looking around,
		<lb/>he perceived the vessel was almost deserted, and
		<lb/>there were few of his fellow-passengers, who had
		<lb/>not recognized some old acquaintance, and receiv­
		<lb/>ed a cordial greeting. The inhabitants of the town
		<lb/>hastened towards the ship, eager to learn tidings
		<lb/>from the friends and relatives they had left in
		<lb/>their native, and still fondly remembered, coun­
		<lb/>try;—and it was pleasant to witness the inter­
		<lb/>change of kind inquirers, the mutual expressions of
		<lb/>good-will, and the heart-felt earnestness, with
		<lb/>which they listened to, even, the minutest incidents
		<lb/>relating to those, with whom, though perhaps for­
		<lb/>ever separated, they still felt united by the ties of
		<lb/>kindred affection, the sweet sympathies of one
		<lb/>common country, and the delightful associations of
		<lb/>childhood and youth.</p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName> indulged but a moment in gloomy re­
		<lb/>flections:—naturally cheerful, and always san­
		<lb/>guine, he turned to the Captain, who still regard­
		<lb/>ed him with an air of kindness, and said,</p>
	      <p>
		<said>Pardon me, that I have so long trespassed on
		  <lb/>your patience; but I feel like one in a dream, to
		  <lb/>whom every object is strange and incongruous;
		  <lb/>we seem to have passed the threshold of earth,
		  <lb/>and to verge on a new creation.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>To me it is not new,</said> replied his companion,
		<lb/><said>I have thrice before visited this rocky coast, and
		  <lb/>am well known to most of the inhabitants; and if
		  <lb/>my services can be of use to you, I pray you to
		  <lb/>command them.</said></p>

	      <p><said>I thank you,</said> returned the young man, fervent­
		<lb/>ly; <said>but I have one kinsman in this land of stran­
		  <lb/>gers, to whom my first respects are due; <persName>Captain
		    <lb/>Standish</persName>, sir, with whom you are probably ac­
		  <lb/>quainted. I am personally unknown to him, but
		  <lb/>we are nearly allied by blood, and I would crave
		  <lb/>your courtesy to shew me the place of his resi­
		  <lb/>dence.</said></p>
	      <p><said>The military commander of <placeName>New-Plymouth</placeName>,</said><lb/>said the Captain. <said>You will find a warm heart, as

		  <lb/>with you to his house, as soon as I can find a
		  <lb/>moment of leisure.</said></p>
	      <p>So saying, they both sprang on shore, and <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName> continued walking alone, to and fro, on the
		<lb/>beach, until the crowd had dispersed, and he was
		<lb/>rejoined by the Captain, from whom he learned,
		<lb/>with chagrin, that <persName>Captain Standish</persName> had gone to
		<lb/>the <placeName>Massachusetts Bay</placeName>, to transact some public
		<lb/>business, and that the period of his return was
		<lb/>uncertain.</p>
	      <p><said>It was an unlucky planet which presided at
		  <lb/>my birth,</said> he said, <said>but patience must be my coun­
		  <lb/>ter-charm; and so, if it please you, Captain, I will
		  <lb/>return to your floating castle to-night, and the
		  <lb/>morrow may bring me better fortune.</said></p>
	      <p>They, however, continued to walk on, for a con­
		<lb/>siderable time, and almost in silence; it was a mild
		<lb/>evening, in the early part of <name>September</name>; and, just
		<lb/>escaped from the monotony of a long and tedious
		<pb n="010"/>

		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">10</mw>
		<lb/>voyage, the bright and beautiful moonlight scene­
		<lb/>ry floated before their eyes, like a vision of en­
		<lb/>chantment. Every object, half hid, and half re­
		<lb/>vealed, in the pale and uncertain light, was mel­
		<lb/>lowed into grace; and not a sound was heard, ex­
		<lb/>cept the sighing of the wind among the trees of the
		<lb/>forest which hung, like a cloud, around the skirts
		<lb/>of the settlement, and the low murmuring of the
		<lb/>ocean, slowly rolling its waves upon the strand.
		<lb/>The village of <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, with its lowly houses
		<lb/>and cultivated fields, alone interrupted the wild
		<lb/>magnificence of nature; and, unimportant as it
		<lb/>seemed amidst her vast dominions, was a striking
		<lb/>monument of the enterprise of man, and the free­
		<lb/>dom and independence of his spirit.</p>
	      <p>The scene produced, in the mind of <persName>Atherton</persName>,
		<lb/>sensations of mingled awe and delight; he felt, as
		<lb/>if translated to a holier and happier sphere; and,
		<lb/>for awhile, the passions, and hopes, and disappoint­
		<lb/>ments of earth, were lost in the novelty and in­
		<lb/>tenseness of his emotions. He stopped, and gazed
		<lb/>around; and his companion, who, if he did not
		<lb/>comprehend the nature of his feelings, at least,
		<lb/>forbore to interrupt them, retired within the sha­
		<lb/>dow of a dwelling-house, apart from <persName>Atherton</persName>, who
		<lb/>stood leaning against the twisted and gnarled trunk
		<lb/>of a venerable oak, quite unconscious of his vicini­
		<lb/>ty to the residence of man.</p>
	      <p>The evening was far advanced, the busy hum of
		<lb/>voices had ceased, and a few feeble lights stream­
		<lb/>ing through the narrow casements, and then sud­
		<pb n="011"/>

		<lb/>denly extinguished, shewed, that the inhabitants
		<lb/>were fast seeking their repose.</p>
	      <p>Suddenly, a low, sweet strain of vocal music
		<lb/>stole upon the ear;—it gradually rose, and swelled
		<lb/>into full cadence, and a female voice, soft, rich,
		<lb/>and powerful, predominated in a slow and solemn
		<lb/>tune of sacred melody. <persName>Atherton</persName> started, and look­
		<lb/>ed round; but his half uttered exclamation of sur­
		<lb/>prise was interrupted by the Captain, who softly
		<lb/>approached, motioning him to silence.</p>
	      <p><said>Hush,</said> said he in a whisper, <said>or we shall dis­
		  <lb/>turb the family, who are now at their evening wor­
		  <lb/>ship; it is the custom, here, to begin and close each
		  <lb/>day with devotional exercises, in which the sing­
		  <lb/>ing of a psalm is included.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And whose voice is that, so full of sweetness
		  <lb/>and harmony,</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>It is <persName>Miriam Grey's</persName>, the fairest maiden of <placeName>New-
		    <lb/>England</placeName>,</said> replied his friend; <said>but had we not bet­
		  <lb/>ter withdraw? I would not, for the world, be dis­
		  <lb/>covered loitering beneath the windows.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Oh no, not yet, hark!</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, almost
		<lb/>breathless with attention; and again he listened,
		<lb/>till the last notes died away; and even then linger­
		<lb/>ed, hoping again to hear the voice, or at least to
		<lb/>catch a glimpse of the fair musician: but he waited
		<lb/>in vain; all continued silent, and, though a faint
		<lb/>light shewed the apartment in which the family
		<lb/>was assembled, they were screened from observa­
		<lb/>tion by a curtain, which hung against the case­
		<lb/>ment. At that moment, too, a favourite dog, who

		<lb/>had long shared the fortunes of <persName>Atherton</persName>, began to
		<lb/>bark at some offensive object, threatening a speedy
		<lb/>discovery; and he reluctantly turned from the spot.</p>
	      <p>During the remainder of their walk, <persName>Major
		  <lb/>Atherton</persName> sunk into a deep reverie: and his imagina­
		<lb/>tion was so excited by the events of the evening,
		<lb/>and the novelty of his situation, that it was long
		<lb/>after he had retired to rest, before sleep visited his
		<lb/>eyelids;—and, then, the sweet voice of <persName>Miriam
		  <lb/>Grey</persName> haunted his dreams. He awoke and heard
		<lb/>only the waves lashing the sides of the vessel, and
		<lb/>the wind whistling among the shrouds; and again
		<lb/>closing his eyes, to exclude the day-light, which
		<lb/>was beginning to steal into the cabin, he fell into a
		<lb/>long and profound slumber.</p>

	      <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> father of <persName>Major Atherton</persName> was left an orphan
		<lb/>in early childhood; and, with an only sister, con­
		<lb/>signed to the guardianship of his maternal uncle,
		<lb/><persName>Sir Robert Fenly</persName>, who, in receiving his young
		<lb/>charge from the hands of their dying mother, pro­
		<lb/>mised to watch over them with care, and faithfully
		<lb/>discharge the duties of his interesting and respon­
		<lb/>sible office;—a promise which he fulfilled, at least,
		<lb/>to his own satisfaction, by entrusting their educa­
		<lb/>tion and morals entirely to strangers; while, en­
		<lb/>gaged in an eager pursuit of pleasure, which left
		<lb/>no leisure from its selfish and absorbing engag­
		<lb/>ments to observe the intellectual progress of his
		<lb/>wards, he contented himself with remarking, from
		<lb/>time to time, their proficiency in the outward ac­
		<lb/>complishments, suited to their rank and age, and
		<lb/>which, in his opinion, were alone of essential im­
		<lb/>portance. But the gentleman he selected, as tutor
		<lb/>to his nephew, was fortunately possessed of excel­
		<lb/>lent principles, a vigorous understanding, and those
		<lb/>attaching qualities of the mind and heart, which
		<lb/>secured the entire confidence and affection of his

		<lb/>pupil, and effectually counteracted his own pernici­
		<lb/>ous example.</p>
	      <p>Young <persName>Atherton</persName> was naturally grave and reflec­
		<lb/>tive, but cheerful and unreserved in the society of
		<lb/>those he loved, and susceptible of a depth and ardour
		<lb/>of attachment, which could only be appreciated by
		<lb/>those who knew him most intimately. Deeply feel­
		<lb/>ing the indifference of his uncle, whose blind par­
		<lb/>tiality to an only son seemed to exclude every other
		<lb/>object of regard from his heart; and with few natu­
		<lb/>ral ties to interest his affections, they became
		<lb/>almost entirely centered in his sister. <persName>Miss Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName> regarded her brother with enthusiastic tender­
		<lb/>ness; she was gay, innocent, and lovely; and, till
		<lb/>her seventeenth year, scarcely experienced a plea­
		<lb/>sure, of which he was not the source, or participa­
		<lb/>tor. But, at that time, <persName>Atherton</persName> began to watch
		<lb/>the progress of a still stronger and more engross­
		<lb/>ing passion; nor was it without many painful ef­
		<lb/>forts, he could reconcile himself to the idea, that,
		<lb/>in future, her heart would be devoted to another,
		<lb/>and their pursuits and interests no longer united.
		<lb/>But he was destined to receive a deeper and more
		<lb/>lasting wound. The week previous to that ap­
		<lb/>pointed for her marriage, <persName>Miss Atherton</persName> was seiz­
		<lb/>ed with a violent disorder, which brought her to
		<lb/>an untimely grave, in the spring-tide of life and
		<lb/>beauty, when all around her breathed of love and
		<lb/>happiness, and the future seemed strewed with
		<lb/>thornless and unfading flowers.</p>
	      <p>The health and spirits of <persName>Atherton</persName> sunk under
		<pb n="15"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="2(2)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">15</mw>
		<lb/>the withering blow; nor was it, till months of
		<lb/>wretchedness had passed away, that a new misfor­
		<lb/>tune aroused the dormant energy of his mind. <persName>Sir
		  <lb/>Robert Fenly</persName> died suddenly, leaving his affairs in
		<lb/>a state of extreme derangement, and his improvi­
		<lb/>dence and dissipation had not only ruined himself,
		<lb/>but induced him to borrow freely from the inheri­
		<lb/>tance of his ward, to support his extravagance, and
		<lb/>pay the arrears of the gaming table: and though
		<lb/>he probably intended to refund it before his ne­
		<lb/>phew became of age, death surprised him, in the
		<lb/>midst of his days, with his plan and schemes un­
		<lb/>accomplished, and all that remained of a once noble
		<lb/>fortune, was an entailed estate, which descended to
		<lb/>his son and heir.</p>
	      <p>These tidings awoke <persName>Atherton</persName> from his lethargy
		<lb/>of grief; stript at once of independence, and, by
		<lb/>the hand which ought to have cherished his inte­
		<lb/>rests, he felt the necessity of immediate exertion;
		<lb/>and the effort happily diverted his mind from the
		<lb/>calamity which had long entirely occupied it. In­
		<lb/>clination decided him to embrace the profession of
		<lb/>arms, and he obtained an Ensign's commission in
		<lb/>a regiment of foot, then quartered in the village of
		<lb/>――, in <placeName>Lancashire</placeName>.</p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName> there became acquainted with <persName>Eleanor
		  <lb/>Standish</persName>, the heiress of an ancient family, whose he­
		<lb/>reditary estates were watered by the <placeName>Douglas</placeName>; and,
		<lb/>deeply touched by the charms of her mind and per­
		<lb/>son, he, for the first time, felt the full extent of his
		<lb/>uncle's injustice. It was no longer in his power
		<pb n="16"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="2(2)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">16</mw>
		<lb/>to offer her an establishment suitable to her rank
		<lb/>and expectations; and, too generous to seek her
		<lb/>affections, under circumstances which must in­
		<lb/>volve her in difficulties, he withdrew, in doubt and
		<lb/>sadness, from her dangerous society.</p>
	      <p>The pacific reign of <persName>James the first</persName>, admitted
		<lb/>few opportunities for military distinction; and,
		<lb/>eager to engage in active duty, and acquire an ho­
		<lb/>nourable rank in his profession, <persName>Atherton</persName> obtained
		<lb/>a furlough, and repaired to <placeName>Holland</placeName>, then the scene
		<lb/>of contention between the disciples of <persName>Calvin</persName> and
		<lb/><persName>Arminius</persName>, each of whose followers had resorted to
		<lb/>the sword to decide their controversy.</p>
	      <p>The intrepid bravery of the young Ensign, unit­
		<lb/>ed with a prudence and judgment beyond his years,
		<lb/>procured him the favour of the <persName>Prince of <placeName>Orange</placeName></persName>,
		<lb/>who distinguished him by his personal regard, and
		<lb/>rewarded his services by promoting him to the
		<lb/>command of a <choice><sic>reigment</sic><corr>regiment</corr></choice>. But amidst the bustle of
		<lb/>a camp, <persName>Eleanor Standish</persName> retained her influence
		<lb/>over his imagination, and occupied his thoughts in
		<lb/>every moment of repose; for nearly two years he
		<lb/>had been self-banished from her presence, and anx­
		<lb/>iety respecting her often weighed heavily on his
		<lb/>spirits: he was, therefore rejoiced, when a suspen­
		<lb/>sion of hostilities at length permitted him to re­
		<lb/>tire from the field, and return to his native country.</p>
	      <p><persName>Colonel Atherton</persName>, on arriving in <placeName>England</placeName>, pro­
		<lb/>ceded directly to <placeName>Lancashire</placeName>, impatient of a mo­
		<lb/>ment's delay, until he reached the residence of <persName>Miss
		  <lb/>Standish</persName>. As he rode through the stately avenue,
		<pb n="17"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="2(3)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">17</mw>
		<lb/>and looked wistfully at the mansion, which used to
		<lb/>be hospitably thrown open to admit the stranger,
		<lb/>he was struck by the gloom and silence that sur­
		<lb/>rounded it, and something like a melancholy fore­
		<lb/>boding damped the ardour of expectation. He
		<lb/>knocked long and loudly at the door, before he
		<lb/>could make himself heard, and it was, at last,
		<lb/>opened by an old domestic, whose countenance was
		<lb/>familiar to him, though changed and sorrowful
		<lb/>since the days when he had last seen it. His en­
		<lb/>quiries respecting the family were minute, but
		<lb/>though he had fancied himself prepared for the
		<lb/>worst, he was inexpressibly shocked by the intelli­
		<lb/>gence he received.</p>
	      <p><persName>Eleanor Standish</persName> had embraced the tenets of the
		<lb/><name>Puritans</name>, and, with some others of her distinguish­
		<lb/>ed house, formally renounced the faith and worship
		<lb/>of her ancestors. Her father, incensed at her con­
		<lb/>duct, and unable to effect a change in her newly
		<lb/>adopted opinions, which were fixed by the dictates
		<lb/>of conscience, banished her from his presence, and
		<lb/>bequeathed his whole estate to a distant branch of
		<lb/>the family. But a few months of loneliness, suc­
		<lb/>ceeded by a mortal illness, softened his heart to­
		<lb/>wards his only child, and, in his last hours, she
		<lb/>was again folded in his embrace, and blessed with
		<lb/>his forgiveness. The arguments of the interested
		<lb/>and prejudiced, however, had persuaded him, that
		<lb/>it would be criminal to leave his fortune, at the
		<lb/>disposal of one, who would doubtless appropriate it
		<lb/>to the use of a sect, which had already set at defi­
		<mw type="vol" rend="align(left)case(allcaps)indent(+1)">Vol. I.</mw>

		<lb/>ance the established laws and religion of their
		<lb/>country; and he, therefore, made no alteration in
		<lb/>his will; but added a codicil, which left his daughter
		<lb/>heiress to her mother's estate, sufficient to render
		<lb/>her independent, but not rich. <persName>Eleanor</persName> was too
		<lb/>happy at being restored to her fathers affection, to
		<lb/>regret the loss of superfluous wealth, though it was
		<lb/>not without deep and painful emotion, that she
		<lb/>bade farewell to the home of her youth, and retired
		<lb/>to the house of a widowed relative in a distant part
		<lb/>of the country.</p>
	      <p><persName>Colonel Atherton</persName> listened, with interest, to the
		<lb/>simple tale of the garrulous domestic; he had been
		<lb/>taught, from childhood, to believe the <orgName>church of
		  <lb/><placeName>England</placeName></orgName> infallible, and that, on the existence of its
		<lb/>forms and privileges, depended the security of the
		<lb/>crown, and all that was valuable to a loyalist. He
		<lb/>had viewed with abhorrence, not unmixed with
		<lb/>contempt, the surprising increase and firm resist­
		<lb/>ance of the non-conformists, and conceived it the
		<lb/>bounden duty of every faithful subject, to check
		<lb/>their audacious pretensions. With these senti­
		<lb/>ments, he naturally heard, with the keenest disap­
		<lb/>pointment, that <persName>Eleanor Standish</persName> had united her­
		<lb/>self to that despised and persecuted sect; and,
		<lb/>fondly as he l<unclear reason="obscured">o</unclear>ved her, pride and principle revolted
		<lb/>from the idea of receiving a <name>Puritan</name>, for the bosom
		<lb/>companion of his future life.</p>
	      <p>Still, however, he would not, at once, relinquish
		<lb/>his long cherished hopes, nor would he believe it
		<lb/>possible that one, so young and gentle, could long
		<pb n="19"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="2(4)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">19</mw>
		<lb/>remain blinded by the spirit of fanaticism. He re­
		<lb/>solved, at all events, to see her once more, were it
		<lb/>only from respect to the memory of her father, and
		<lb/>sympathy in her own misfortunes; and during his
		<lb/>rapid journey thither, he almost persuaded himself,
		<lb/>that these were the leading objects of his visit.</p>
	      <p><persName>Colonel Atherton</persName> felt his heart beat quicker, as
		<lb/>he drew near her sequestered dwelling; and, what­
		<lb/>ever had been his feelings and resolutions, preju­
		<lb/>dice vanished, and creeds and sects were forgotten,
		<lb/>when he found himself again and alone in the pre­
		<lb/>sence of his beloved <persName>Eleanor</persName>. She looked paler
		<lb/>than formerly, and her countenance was pensive,
		<lb/>almost to sadness; but her smile was as sweet as
		<lb/>ever, and her blushing confusion, more eloquent
		<lb/>than language, revealed the untold secret of her
		<lb/>heart.</p>
	      <p><persName>Colonel Atherton</persName>, too happy to think of reason
		<lb/>or resolve, yielded to the impulse of passionate ten­
		<lb/>derness, and whispered a tale of love, and hope,
		<lb/>and constancy, which drew from her lips a confes­
		<lb/>sion, that her affections had been long devoted to
		<lb/>him, nor did she shrink from a firm but modest
		<lb/>avowal of the principles she had adopted, in the
		<lb/>earnestness of sincere conviction, candidly acknow­
		<lb/>ledging, that no worldly advantage would ever
		<lb/>tempt her to forsake them; and her lover, convinc­
		<lb/>ed, that arguments would be vain, freely conceded
		<lb/>to her the rights of conscience, and promised her
		<lb/>the full exercise of her religious principles and wor­
		<lb/>ship.</p>

	      <milestone unit="sig" n="2(4)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">20</mw>
	      <p>Their union, which, shortly, took place, proved
		<lb/>happy beyond the common lot of mortals, and
		<lb/>though <persName>Colonel Atherton</persName> had probably indulged
		<lb/>the hope, that the tacit influence, or mild persua­
		<lb/>sions of the husband, would eventually restore his
		<lb/>wife to the bosom of the church, a more intimate
		<lb/>knowledge of her character satisfied him, that the
		<lb/>opinions she had deliberately chosen, would con­
		<lb/>tinue to guide her through life. <persName>Mrs. Atherton</persName>
		<lb/>was firm, but not bigotted; and, though strongly
		<lb/>attached to her own creed, was far from condemn­
		<lb/>ing all others, as erroneous. She reverenced the
		<lb/>virtues of her husband, and happily exercised the
		<lb/>rare prudence to avoid all religious controversy
		<lb/>with him; while he, though unwavering in his faith,
		<lb/>could not but respect the doctrines, which she so
		<lb/>beautifully exemplified, by a life of uniform and un­
		<lb/>obtrusive piety and benevolence.</p>
	      <p>This mutual forbearance and liberality produc­
		<lb/>ed the desired effect on the mind of their only child,
		<lb/>who, though educated in the forms of the establish­
		<lb/>ed church, honoured the more austere principles of
		<lb/>his mother, and listened, with submissive attention,
		<lb/>to the pure and virtuous precepts, which distilled,
		<lb/>like the <quote>dews of <placeName>Hermon</placeName>,</quote> from her lips. His
		<lb/>mind thus unprejudiced, and left to the guidance 
		<lb/>of reason and scripture, in all matters of mere
		<lb/>nominal importance, escaped the infection of party-
		<lb/>spirit, which excited so much rancour during his
		<lb/>youth, and, afterwards, burst forth and subverted
		<lb/>the pillars of church and state.</p>

	      <p><persName>Edward Atherton</persName> grew up, gay, spirited and
		<lb/>handsome; with all the vigour and enthusiasm of
		<lb/>his father's character, happily tempered by the
		<lb/>vivacity and gentleness of his mother's. Educated
		<lb/>in retirement, and accustomed to little society,
		<lb/>beyond his family circle, he entered into manhood,
		<lb/>with an ingenuous and well disciplined mind, a san­
		<lb/>guine and adventurous disposition, and spirits buoy­
		<lb/>ant with hope and happiness. Active in his pur­
		<lb/>suits, he betrayed an early predeliction for a milita­
		<lb/>ry life, and, though not without many scruples, his
		<lb/>parents, at length consented to his wishes; and, at
		<lb/>the age of eighteen, he received a Lieutenant's
		<lb/>commission, in a regiment then commanded by his
		<lb/>father. The regiment soon after received orders
		<lb/>to sail with the army of the <persName>Duke of <placeName>Buckingham</placeName></persName>,
		<lb/>to succour the <name>Huguenots</name> of <placeName>Rochelle</placeName>; and, in that
		<lb/>ill starred expedition, both father and son were
		<lb/>distinguished by their courage and address; but
		<lb/><persName>Colonel Atherton</persName> received a mortal wound in the
		<lb/>engagement, and died, a few hours after, in the
		<lb/>arms of his afflicted son.</p>
	      <p><persName>Edward Atherton</persName>, stricken in heart, with the ir­
		<lb/>reparable loss he had sustained, returned to the
		<lb/>desolate mansion of his mother with the fatal in­
		<lb/>telligence; and, though it was disclosed to her
		<lb/>with the utmost precaution, the shock produced an
		<lb/>effect upon her health and spirits, from which she
		<lb/>never entirely recovered.</p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton's</persName> talents and zeal in his profession, ac­
		<lb/>quired him many friends, and he was advanced to
		<pb n="22"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="2(5)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">22</mw>
		<lb/>the rank of Major far sooner than he had antici­
		<lb/>pated; but, though surrounded by every allurement
		<lb/>to pleasure and dissipation, his principles were un­
		<lb/>tainted, and his heart ever turned, with affectionate
		<lb/>solicitude, to the scenes of his earliest enjoyments;
		<lb/>and, in every interval of duty, he flew to their quiet
		<lb/>shades, and almost regretted, when the call of
		<lb/>honour again forced him from the society of his
		<lb/>beloved parent.</p>
	      <p><persName>Mrs. Atherton</persName> survived her husband several
		<lb/>years; they were passed in profound retirement,
		<lb/>but filled up with active duties, employed in noise­
		<lb/>less efforts to promote a cause, in which she believ­
		<lb/>ed the interests of religion involved; in works of
		<lb/>charity and benevolence, particularly towards the
		<lb/>persecuted <name>Puritans</name>, who were relieved by her
		<lb/>bounty, and often sheltered beneath her roof. In
		<lb/>the meridian of her days, she awaited, with perfect
		<lb/>composure, the expected moment of her departure
		<lb/>from a world, which had ceased to charm, happy
		<lb/>in the virtue and prosperity of her son, and soothed
		<lb/>in the last stages of a lingering decline, by his ef­
		<lb/>fectionate and unwearied attention. Never was a
		<lb/>parent more deeply and justly lamented; and it
		<lb/>was fortunate for <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, that profession­
		<lb/>al engagements drew him from the indulgence of
		<lb/>his solitary grief.</p>
	      <p>Public events, at that time, engaged the attention
		<lb/>of every one, and the affairs of the kingdom seemed
		<lb/>daily assuming a more dark and threatening as­
		<lb/>pect. The number and influence of the <name>Puritans</name>
		<pb n="23"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="2(6)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">23</mw>
		<lb/>was rapidly augmenting. Far from being intimi­
		<lb/>dated by threats, they opposed a determined and
		<lb/>zealous resistance to the arbitrary measures, which
		<lb/>the impolitic obstinacy of <persName>Charles</persName>, instigated by
		<lb/>the implacable <persName>Archbishop Laud</persName>, had adopted. An
		<lb/>alarming insurrection had taken place in the <rs type="properAdjective">Scot­
		  <lb/>tish</rs> Capital, when, in compliance with a royal
		<lb/>mandate, an attempt was made to read the Litur­
		<lb/>gy in its churches; and, already, a military force
		<lb/>was regarded by many as indispensibly necessary
		<lb/>to crush the power and check the progress of the
		<lb/>rebels.</p>
	      <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> was firmly attached to his fath­
		<lb/>er's religion, and would cheerfully have encounter­
		<lb/>ed death, to advance the interests of his sovereign,
		<lb/>and the glory of his country. But his conscience
		<lb/>revolted from the idea of aiding in a war of perse­
		<lb/>cution, against an inoffensive sect of <name>christians</name>,
		<lb/>who claimed nothing but the privilege of enjoying
		<lb/>their opinions unmolested, and of sharing, with
		<lb/>their fellow subjects, the protection of the govern­
		<lb/>ment, to which they acknowledged allegiance. Re­
		<lb/>spect for the memory of his mother, and subduing
		<lb/>recollections of her tenderness, her purity, her un­
		<lb/>affected piety, strengthened these lenient sentiments.
		<lb/>He could not cherish harsh and groundless preju­
		<lb/>dices against a sect, which she had loved, and his
		<lb/>father had favoured; and, though he was daily ac­
		<lb/>customed to hear them derided, and, in spite of ar­
		<lb/>guments and raillery, and against interest itself,
		<pb n="24"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="2(6)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">24</mw>
		<lb/>he remained convinced, that their cause was just,
		<lb/>however mistaken, and that the rights of con­
		<lb/>science were too sacred to be infringed by the
		<lb/>arbitrary will of a monarch.</p>
	      <p>Still, however, and an ardent love of his profession,
		<lb/>and the natural desire to attain the honours which
		<lb/>tempted his ambition, and seemed within his grasp,
		<lb/>struggled long and powerfully against the convic­
		<lb/>tions of reason and conscience. But the generous 
		<lb/>impulse of a candid and well-principled mind final­
		<lb/>ly prevailed over every selfish consideration, and
		<lb/>determined him to resign his commission, and with
		<lb/>it the dreams of glory, which had so long delight­
		<lb/>ed his imagination.</p>
	      <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> returned to <placeName>Lancashire</placeName>, de­
		<lb/>pressed in spirits, and his father's house, no long­
		<lb/>er cheered by the smiles of those he had so fondly
		<lb/>loved, awakened the most melancholy reminiscen­
		<lb/>ces. He had few around him to excite interest or
		<lb/>affection, and in relinquishing the active duties,
		<lb/>which had so long occupied his attention, he felt as
		<lb/>if he had resigned the gay and busy world, and had
		<lb/>no object worthy of pursuit and exertion. With
		<lb/>such sombre feelings, the winter passed away drea­
		<lb/>rily enough; but a dejection so foreign to his na­
		<lb/>tural disposition could not long retain its influence;
		<lb/>and the return of spring, with its train of rural
		<lb/>pleasures, and varied occupations, gradually with­
		<lb/>drew his thoughts from the past. An unexpected
		<lb/>occurence also took place, which gave a new im­
		<lb/>pulse and direction to his mind.</p>

	      <p><persName>Mr. Fullerton</persName>, an intelligent young man, who
		<lb/>had resided several years in the colony of <placeName>New-
		  <lb/>Plymouth</placeName>, just at that time chanced to revisit
		<lb/><placeName>England</placeName>, and frequently met with <persName>Major Atherton</persName>
		<lb/>at the house of a mutual friend. Warm and san­
		<lb/>guine in his feelings, he confidently believed, that
		<lb/><placeName>New-England</placeName> would soon become the most happy
		<lb/>and favoured region of the earth; and painted its
		<lb/>charms and advantages with an enthusiasm, which
		<lb/>completely dazzled the imagination of <persName>Atherton</persName>.
		<lb/><persName>Mr. Fullerton</persName>, without dreaming of such an effect,
		<lb/>was daily imbuing him with a portion of his own
		<lb/>spirit; and, from repeated conversations respecting
		<lb/>the early colonists of  <placeName>America</placeName>, he began to wish
		<lb/>himself transported to their land of simple habits
		<lb/>and uncorrupted morals. It was not long before
		<lb/>these incipient desires became confirmed and ac­
		<lb/>tive; and <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, romantic, fond of no­
		<lb/>velty and adventure, and rapid in his decisions, made
		<lb/>speedy preparations for a voyage to the western
		<lb/>world. <persName>Mr. Fullerton</persName> was pleased with his deter­
		<lb/>mination, and regretted that he would not accom­
		<lb/>pany him; but business detained him in <placeName>England</placeName>,
		<lb/>whence it was his intention to proceed to the
		<lb/>Continent, and the period of his return was uncer­
		<lb/>tain.</p>
	      <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName>, eager to execute his project,
		<lb/>committed his affairs to a trusty agent, and hasten­
		<lb/>ed to <placeName>Falmouth</placeName>, where a vessel was in readiness to
		<lb/>cross the <placeName>Atlantic</placeName>. He arrived there just in time
		<lb/>to secure a passage; in a few moments the moor­

		<lb/>ings were loosed, and the white cliffs of his native
		<lb/>land receded fast from his view. He stood with
		<lb/>his eyes fixed on the shore he had left, perhaps
		<lb/>forever, till the highest stretch of land dwindled to
		<lb/>a point, and hung like a light cloud in the distant
		<lb/>heavens, and at last faded from his sight. He
		<lb/>looked around—the vessel pursued its tranquil
		<lb/>course, cutting the deep green waves, and leaving,
		<lb/>far behind, a foamy track: a strong breeze swelled
		<lb/>the canvass, and, all around the circling horizon,

	      <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> day after his arrival at <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, <persName>Major
		  <lb/>Atherton</persName> delivered several letters of introduction,
		<lb/>with which <persName>Mr. Fullerton</persName> had furnished him, and
		<lb/>among others, one to <persName>Mr. Winslow</persName>, then governor
		<lb/>of the colony. He was received by that gentleman
		<lb/>with the most cordial hospitality, and so earnestly
		<lb/>solicited to remain his guest, at least, till he had
		<lb/>arranged his future plans, that <persName>Atherton</persName> could not
		<lb/>without an appearance of affectation refuse the offer­
		<lb/>ed courtesy. It was, indeed, a courtesy truly grateful
		<lb/>to his feelings. Exhausted by the fatigues of a long
		<lb/>voyage, and cast on a world of strangers, the society
		<lb/>of an intelligent friend, and the comforts of a well-
		<lb/>ordered family, were peculiarly soothing to his spi­
		<lb/>rits. The unobtrusive attentions of all around him,
		<lb/>which delicately <choice><sic>inferrred</sic><corr>inferred</corr></choice> that they received rather
		<lb/>than bestowed obligations, and the ease with which 
		<lb/>he found himself included in their domestic arrange­
		<lb/>ments, removed from his mind every idea of intru­
		<lb/>sion, and he soon felt as perfectly at home, and free
		<lb/>from restraint, as if only renewing an intercourse
		<lb/>with his early and familiar friends.</p>
	      <p><persName>Mr. Winslow</persName>, himself an experienced traveller,
		<pb n="28"/><milestone unit="sig" n="3(2)v"/><mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">28</mw><lb/>had too often enjoyed the kindness of strangers not
		<lb/>to appreciate its value, and the native benevolence
		<lb/>of his heart led him to embrace every opportunity
		<lb/>to confer on others such civilities, as he had grate­
		<lb/>fully received, under various circumstances, during
		<lb/>his eventful life. A zealous adherent to the prin­
		<lb/>ciples of the non-conformists, he attached himself 
		<lb/>to the church at <placeName>Leyden</placeName>, and embarked with the
		<lb/>first adventurers, for the then inhospitable region
		<lb/>of <placeName>North America</placeName>. Possessed of uncommon ac­
		<lb/>tivity and address, a sound judgment and discrim­
		<lb/>inating mind, he acquired great influence with the
		<lb/>colonists, and was early associated with others of
		<lb/>approved worth, in the management of their civil
		<lb/>affairs. Every action of his life was dictated by
		<lb/>the purest motives, and rendered subservient to
		<lb/>their interests, and the advancement of that reli­
		<lb/>gion, for which they had made such astonishing sa­
		<lb/>crifices. His prudence and gentleness rendered
		<lb/>him particularly agreeable to the <name>Indians</name>, with
		<lb/>whom he was often selected to negociate; and the
		<lb/>goodness of his heart and lenity of his disposition
		<lb/>were, perhaps, as useful in maintaining harmony
		<lb/>with them, as the more prompt and severe meas­
		<lb/>ures of the military commander.</p>
	      <p><persName>Mr. Winslow</persName>, at the time of <persName>Major Atherton's</persName><lb/>introduction to him, was still in the prime of life;
		<lb/>he had experienced many vicissitudes of fortune,
		<lb/>and, in travelling through various countries, had
		<lb/>acquired an intimate knowledge of human nature,
		<lb/>and that variety of information, which rendered
		<pb n="29"/><milestone unit="sig" n="3(3)r"/><mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">29</mw><lb/>him a most useful and entertaining companion.
		<lb/>There was in his manners nothing of the gloom, so
		<lb/>generally, and, too often, justly attributed to the
		<lb/><name>Puritans</name>; and <persName>Atherton</persName> ceased to remember the
		<lb/>distinctions of party, in the freedom of social in­
		<lb/>tercourse, and the interchange of liberal and en­
		<lb/>lightened sentiments.</p>
	      <p>At the hour of sunset,—for it was <name>Saturday</name>—
		<lb/>the labours of the week were ended, and the <name>Sabbath</name>
		<lb/>commenced. Every worldly employment was sus­
		<lb/>pended, and the children forsook their play-things,
		<lb/>and gathered in submissive silence around the
		<lb/>knees of their parents. Books of devotion, reli­
		<lb/>gious conversation, and instruction filled up the
		<lb/>evening; and at the customary hour, the assembled
		<lb/>family united in the evening sacrifice of prayer
		<lb/>and thanksgiving.</p>
	      <p>It was so long since <persName>Major Atherton</persName> had enjoyed
		<lb/>the luxury of a neat and quiet bed, that he would,
		<lb/>perhaps, have slept till an unseasonable hour on
		<lb/>the following morning, had he not been awakened
		<lb/>by a concert of young voices in an adjoining apart­
		<lb/>ment. They were audibly repeating their <name>Sabbath</name>
		<lb/>lessons; and every now and then, a young urchin,
		<lb/>more learned than his brethren, assumed the office
		<lb/>of prompter, though generally hushed to silence by
		<lb/>the mild command of <persName>Mrs. Winslow</persName>.</p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName> thought it rather uncomfortable to rise
		<lb/>before the sun in a chilly <name>September</name> morning; but
		<lb/>civility required him to observe the regulations of
		<lb/>the house, and he hastened to join the family in the

		<lb/>sitting-room. The duties of that holy day, as of
		<lb/>every other, were commenced with religious exer­
		<lb/>cises; a practice which the early settlers of <placeName>New-
		  <lb/>England</placeName> never omitted, though, like many others
		<lb/>which were their <quote>glory and defence,</quote> it has since
		<lb/>become unfashionable, and, of course, too generally
		<lb/>disregarded. Breakfast immediately followed, and
		<lb/>all the children, as usual on <name>Sunday</name>, enjoyed the
		<lb/>privilege of sitting at table, and sharing the wheat­
		<lb/>en loaf and a basin of chocolate, instead of their
		<lb/>daily nutritious fare of milk and <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> bread.
		<lb/>Every countenance beamed with cheerfulness and
		<lb/>contentment; and <persName>Atherton</persName> thought he had never
		<lb/>seen a more interesting family group.</p>
	      <p>At the accustomed hour, the governor and his
		<lb/>whole household repaired to the church, or rather to
		<lb/><mentioned rend="slant(italic)">meeting</mentioned>, for that was the term which the dissenters
		<lb/>substituted for one that savoured too much of pre­
		<lb/>lacy. The public funds had not yet permitted the
		<lb/>erection of a house of worship, but the fort already
		<lb/>mentioned, which crowned the summit of a hill in
		<lb/>rear of the village, had been prepared for that pur­
		<lb/>pose. It was built with two stories; the upper,
		<lb/>planted with ordnance and flanked with the battlements
		<lb/>and in the lower, benches were arranged to acco­
		<lb/>modate the audience, with a desk elevated at one 
		<lb/>extremity for the minister, and just below it, seats
		<lb/>for the ruling elders or deacons.</p>
	      <p>Thither the inhabitants of the town were hasten­
		<lb/>ing, all arrayed in their best attire; mothers lead­
		<lb/>ing their tottling little ones, and young people
		<pb n="31"/>

		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">31</mw>
		<lb/>supporting their aged parents, whom no considera­
		<lb/>tions short of absolute necessity could detain from
		<lb/>the public duties of the day. <persName>Atherton</persName> was struck
		<lb/>with the air of reverence and respect with which
		<lb/>every one seemed to approach the house of God;
		<lb/>no news was circulated, no scandal whispered, no
		<lb/>dress or fashion discussed, and even the mirthful
		<lb/>faces of the children had assumed an expression of
		<lb/>gravity and reflection.</p>
	      <p>The people bowed repectfully as <persName>Mr. Winslow</persName>
		<lb/>and his family entered, and passed on to their
		<lb/>usual places; the governor's rank entitling him to
		<lb/>the upper seat with the magistrates, while the
		<lb/>females ranged themselves on the opposite side of
		<lb/>the edifice, separated by a broad passage from the
		<lb/>other sex. <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, according to the usage
		<lb/>of the church, remained a few moments absorbed
		<lb/>in mental devotion, from which he was roused by
		<lb/>a deep groan from an elderly female, accompanied
		<lb/>by a look of horror, which could scarcely have
		<lb/>been more profound had the whole hierarchy, or
		<lb/>the Pope himself, stood before her. Reminded by
		<lb/>the incident that he was not in an <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> chapel,
		<lb/>but amidst a congregation of <name>Puritans</name>, who re­
		<lb/>garded the least approach to episcopacy with as
		<lb/>much abhorrence as an act of sacrilege, he resolved
		<lb/>to abstain from a practice which occasioned so
		<lb/>much offence, and would probably excite many
		<lb/>prejudices against him. As these reflections were
		<lb/>rapidly crossing his mind, <persName>Mr. Reyner</persName>, the clergy­
		<lb/>man, a man of grave and solemn deportment, en­
		<pb n="32"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="3(4)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">32</mw>
		<lb/>tered the assembly. He commenced the duties of
		<lb/>his sacred office with a devout and fervent prayer,
		<lb/>and then selected a psalm from the unharmonious
		<lb/>version of the day, which he briefly expounded, for
		<lb/>the benefit of the ignorant and the prevention of
		<lb/>any false interpretation. One of the elders then
		<lb/>arose and read the first line, when all the audience
		<lb/>who could, and many who could not sing, united
		<lb/>their melody to the words, and having completed
		<lb/>the line, another was read, and so on through the
		<lb/>psalm.</p>
	      <p>Strangely as this intermixture of reading and
		<lb/>music sounded in the ears of <persName>Atherton</persName>, he was im­
		<lb/>pressed with the deep devotion which seemed to
		<lb/>animate every countenance, as they thus mingled
		<lb/>their hearts and voices in the praises of their Ma­
		<lb/>ker. There was a touching eloquence in this sim­
		<lb/>ple worship, that he had seldom felt when listening
		<lb/>to the most skilful performance that ever woke the
		<lb/>tones of the organ, amidst the more imposing cere­
		<lb/>monies of his national religion. An extemporane­
		<lb/>ous discourse succeeded this vocal harmony; and,
		<lb/>though not copiously sprinkled with the flowers of
		<lb/>oratory, it breathed a spirit of ardent piety, and
		<lb/>strongly enforced the observance of moral duty,
		<lb/>with a scrupulous regard to the peculiar tenets
		<lb/>of the sect. This sermon, which, in matter and
		<lb/>dimensions, exceeded half a score of modern ones,
		<lb/>at length drew to a close; and the singing of an­
		<lb/>other psalm concluded the services.</p>
	      <p>In this last exercise, <persName>Major Atherton</persName> was strange­
		<pb n="33"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="3(5)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">33</mw>
		<lb/>ly attracted by a sweet and powerful voice, which
		<lb/>sometimes soared above the others, and then, as if
		<lb/>shrinking from the melody it created, murmured
		<lb/>into silence, and again rose and mingled in the
		<lb/>general strain. It came over his memory like a
		<lb/>half forgotten dream of enchantment; nor was it
		<lb/>till the lapse of several moments that he could
		<lb/>identify it with the one which had so lately held
		<lb/>him lingering beneath the windows of <persName>Miriam
		  <lb/>Grey</persName>. He looked around for the object which
		<lb/>unexpectedly revived the interest then so strongly
		<lb/>excited; and, directed by the same bewitching
		<lb/>tones, his eye rested on a figure of uncommon deli­
		<lb/>cacy and grace, closely enveloped in the folds of a
		<lb/>silken scarf, which, with a hood of the same mate­
		<lb/>rial, completely baffled his curiosity. Yet there
		<lb/>was something superior, <persName>Atherton</persName> thought, some­
		<lb/>thing more tasteful, in short indescribable, about
		<lb/>this female—young she must be, and how beautiful,
		<lb/>he longed to know—which rivetted his attention.
		<lb/>Occupying a seat nearly parallel to her own, he
		<lb/>could watch every movement without altering his
		<lb/>position so much as to occasion remark; and the
		<lb/>unconscious girl little suspected with what diligence
		<lb/>every article of her dress and every motion of her
		<lb/>person was scanned.</p>
	      <p>As soon as the congregation was dismissed, with
		<lb/>a blessing from the pastor, <persName>Atherton</persName>, in his haste
		<lb/>to intercept her retreat, and so obtain a glimpse of
		<lb/>her face, overturned a seat against the unlucky
		<lb/>shins of a curly-pated boy, who, forthwith, set up a
		<pb n="34"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="3(5)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">34</mw>
		<lb/>cry, which resounded through the building, and fix­
		<lb/>ed the eyes of every one upon them. <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>,
		<lb/>turned of course, and <persName>Atheron</persName> saw peeping from
		<lb/>beneath her hood, a pair of laughing blue eyes, with
		<lb/>the features and complexion of a <name>Hebe</name>. Her cheeks
		<lb/>were dimpled with smiles, which seemed excited by
		<lb/>his disaster; but the instant she met his fixed and
		<lb/>admiring gaze, she moved away, with a deep and
		<lb/>almost painful blush. <persName>Atherton</persName> could scarcely re­
		<lb/>gret an accident, which had crowned his wishes
		<lb/>with success; but he felt bound in conscience to of­
		<lb/>fer an apology for his carelessness, and, if possible,
		<lb/>to pacify the still sobbing child, who was kicking
		<lb/>lustily, in utter contempt of the tender caresses of
		<lb/>several venerable damsels, who had gathered about
		<lb/>him, and whose sympathy seemed to have a most
		<lb/>perverse effect upon his temper.</p>
	      <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName>, however, found his interference
		<lb/>quite unavailing; and, as he was looking round for
		<lb/><persName>Governor Winslow</persName>, his step-son, <persName>Peregrine White</persName>,
		<lb/>came towards him, with a countenance, which shew­
		<lb/>ed how highly he was diverted by the passing scene.
		<lb/>They left the house together, and, as they descend­
		<lb/>ed the hill, the quick eye of <persName>Peregrine</persName> readily de­
		<lb/>tected the eagerness, with which his companion
		<lb/>continued to regard the figure of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, who
		<lb/>tripped lightly on before them.</p>
	      <p><said>There goes the handsomest lass in <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>,</said><lb/>said the youth; <said>and there, too, is the sanctimoni­
		  <lb/>ous <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName> walking by her side, whom

		  <lb/>and makes a speech almost every <name>sabbath</name> day at

	      <p><said>A powerful recommendation truly!</said> returned
		<lb/><persName>Atheron</persName>, <said>and is it likely to prove successful with
		  <lb/>the damsel?</said></p>
	      <p><said>It may be so,</said> replied the other; <said>but she is a

	      <p><said>That respectable looking man, to whom she is

	      <p>

		  <lb/>a <quote rend="pre(‘)post(’)">burning and shining light</quote> in the church here,

	      </p>
	      <p><said>I am afraid you are wilfully blind,</said> said <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName> smiling; <said>but has he been a long time in
		  <lb/><placeName>New-England</placeName>?</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>Oh yes, he came over in the <name>May-flower</name>, with
		  <lb/>the first company of settlers, and brought with him
		  <lb/>his wife, and <persName>Miriam</persName>, then scarcely a year old, and

		  <lb/><persName>Mrs. Grey</persName>, I have heard my mother say, was very
		  <lb/>delicately brought up, and did not many years sur­
		  <lb/>vive the change of climate and situation.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><persName>Mr. Grey</persName> and his family, at that moment, reach­
		<lb/>ed the door of their residence; and, shortly after,

	      <p><persName>Peregrine White</persName> was a tall, handsome youth of
		<lb/>seventeen, with a frank, intelligent, and very ani­
		<lb/>mated countenance, which was perfectly character­
		<lb/>istic of his disposition. He was the first <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs>
		<lb/>child born in <placeName>New-England</placeName>, and his birth took
		<lb/>place, while the vessel, which had brought the Pil­
		<lb/>grims to a frozen coast, was lying exposed to the
		<lb/>severity of the season, before they had found a spot
		<lb/>to rest upon, or a shelter for their wives and little
		<lb/>ones. But neither these gloomy circumstances, nor
		<lb/>the hardships to which his childhood was exposed,
		<lb/>had left any traces on his mind; he was gay and
		<lb/>thoughtless, loved a frolic better than any thing
		<lb/>else, and though perfectly good-humoured and af­
		<lb/>fectionate, so inconsiderate as to involve himself in
		<lb/>frequent difficulties, and occasion constant anxiety
		<lb/>to his friends. His father died soon after his ar­
		<lb/>rival at <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>; and, in the following spring,
		<lb/><persName>Mrs. White</persName> was united to <persName>Mr. Edward Winslow</persName>,
		<lb/>whose wife had fallen a victim to the sickness,
		<lb/>which carried away more than half their numbers,
		<lb/>during the preceding winter; and this was the first
		<lb/>marriage that was celebrated in the colony.</p>
	      <p><persName>Peregrine White</persName> drew his hand over his face
		<lb/>with a whimsical expression, as he threw open the
		<lb/>parlour door; and then, with the utmost gravity and
		<lb/>composure, followed <persName>Major Atherton</persName> into the room.
		<lb/>The family were shortly re-assembled, and partook,
		<lb/>rather sparingly, of some light refreshments which
		<lb/>were placed before them. <persName>Mrs. Winslow</persName> apologiz­
		<lb/>ed to her guest for not having provided a dinner,

		<lb/>observing that it was an established custom with
		<lb/>the colonists to refrain from unnecessary labour on
		<lb/>the Lord's day, that their domestics might enjoy
		<lb/>the privilege of public worship, to which they were
		<lb/>equally entitled with themselves.</p>
	      <p>After an hour's intermission they returned to the
		<lb/>meeting-house; and the afternoon services differ­
		<lb/>ed considerably from those in the former part of the
		<lb/>day. The <name>puritans</name>, on leaving their native coun­
		<lb/>try, adopted many opinions and modes of teaching,
		<lb/>suited perhaps, to their peculiar situation, but un­
		<lb/>practised by their brethren in <placeName>England</placeName>. Being at
		<lb/>first destitute of clergymen, the ruling elders, and
		<lb/>others in esteem, were obliged to exercise their <mcr>gifts</mcr>
		<lb/>to edify the people; a practice which became too
		<lb/>common, and often misused, even after the settle­
		<lb/>ment of a minister.</p>
	      <p>Instead of a regular discourse, the Governor
		<lb/>arose, and propounded a question, touching certain
		<lb/>controverted doctrines of their creed, and was an­
		<lb/>swered in a brief and comprehensive manner by the
		<lb/>pastor. <persName>Mr. Brewster</persName>, a ruling elder, then exhort­
		<lb/>ed, or <mentioned rend="slant(italic)">prophesied</mentioned>, as it was called, in a style of per­
		<lb/>suasive eloquence, and with a force and clearness
		<lb/>expression, which always distinguished his pub­
		<lb/>lic teaching, and usually carried conviction to the
		<lb/>heart and understanding of his hearers. He was
		<lb/>followed by several of the congregation, and, among
		<lb/>others, <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName> spoke, at some length, with
		<lb/> a zeal not exactly according to knowledge, and
		<lb/>which <persName>Atherton</persName> thought strongly tinctured with

		<lb/>arrogance and self-conceit. He certainly attended
		<lb/>with more interest to the father of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>,
		<lb/>whose strongly marked, and rather severe counte­
		<lb/>nance, energetic manner, and bold and searching
		<lb/>language, rendered him a meet representative of
		<lb/>the eminent reformer, whose doctrines he so strenu­
		<lb/>ously advocated. The assembly was then remind­
		<lb/>ed of their duty in contributing to the support of
		<lb/>the church, and the necessities of the poor; when
		<lb/>all advanced to the deacon's seat, and put their mites
		<lb/>into the bag destined to receive the offering. The
		<lb/>singing of psalms also formed a part of the exer­
		<lb/>cises, and <persName>Atherton</persName> again listened to a voice, which
		<lb/>had twice charmed him with its unrivalled melody,
		<lb/>though he fancied that <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> cautiously
		<lb/>avoided his observation; and, whether from acci­
		<lb/>dent or design, he was unable to obtain another
		<lb/>view of her features.</p>
	      <p><said>You will find our religious customs and opi­
		  <lb/>nions somewhat singular, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>,</said> ob­
		<lb/>served the Governor, when they had left the house;
		<lb/><said>but I hope there has been nothing unpleasant to
		  <lb/>your feelings, though I am aware that our ideas
		  <lb/>essentially differ.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Perhaps not so very essentially, sir,</said> returned
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>: <said>you will recollect that my mother was
		  <lb/>a dissenter, and I should feel a regard for her re­
		  <lb/>ligion, even if my own experience did not bear wit­
		  <lb/>ness to the purity and rectitude of many of its pro­
		  <lb/>fessors, and the wisdom and piety which have 
		  <lb/>adorned their lives.</said></p>

	      <p><said>Many judicious and good men</said> said <persName>Mr. Wins­
		  <lb/>low</persName>, <said>have objected to the practice of <mcr>prophesying</mcr>,
		  <lb/>as it is generally used amongst us, and which is al­
		  <lb/>lowed in no other churches of <placeName>New-England</placeName>. It
		  <lb/>is a truth, and, to our reproach be it spoken, that
		  <lb/>dissensions have already disturbed our peace, and
		  <lb/>grievous wolves have entered into the fold, and di­
		  <lb/>vided the sheep of the flock.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Do you attribute these divisions,</said> asked <persName>Ath­
		  <lb/>erton</persName>, <said>to the admission of the custom alluded to.</said>
		<lb/><said>In a certain degree;</said> returned the Governor;
		<lb/><said>were the liberty of speaking, subject to particular
		  <lb/>regulations, and confined to men, who, like <persName>Elder
		    <lb/>Brewster</persName>, are gifted with the spirit of grace, and
		  <lb/>prepared by education and habit, it would doubt­
		  <lb/>less tend to edification; and, in the early period of
		  <lb/>the settlement, it was our only method of public
		  <lb/><rs type="properAdjective">christian</rs> instruction. But, in later days, many
		  <lb/>godly ministers, who have <quote>cast in their lot</quote> with
		  <lb/>us, have been discouraged by finding their office
		  <lb/>assumed by brethren, who vainly imagine them­
		  <lb/>selves qualified to exhort, and thus a <quote>door of con­
		    <lb/>tention</quote> has been opened, which our adversaries
		  <lb/>have not failed to use to our disadvantage, and
		  <lb/>sometimes to the hindrance of gospel ordinances.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I thought,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>that here, at least, the
		  <lb/>church was at rest, and that those free and virtuous
		  <lb/>spirits, who braved so much for liberty of con­
		  <lb/>science, and the enjoyment of their religious privi­
		  <lb/>leges, were now reaping the reward of their lauda­
		  <lb/>ble exertions, and sitting quietly under <quote>their own

		  <lb/>portion of earth, we may still be permitted to hope

		  <lb/>disappointments will never discourage those whose
		  <lb/>hearts are truly interested in a great design; and I
		  <lb/>trust that our children, and children's children, even
		  <lb/>to the remotest posterity, will eat of the fruit of the
		  <lb/>tree, which we have rooted and nourished, and that

	      <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">In</hi> the course of a week, <persName>Captain Standish</persName> re­
		<lb/>turned to <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, and being soon apprised of his 
		<lb/>kinsman's arrival, during his absence, for even in
		<lb/>those early days the good people found some leisure
		<lb/>to discuss the affairs of the village—he sent a mes­
		<lb/>sage to the Governor's desiring <persName>Major Atherton</persName> to
		<lb/>visit him as soon as he found it convenient and
		<lb/>agreeable. <persName>Atherton's</persName> curiousity to see a man, who
		<lb/>was regarded by the colonists as a second <persName>Joshua</persName>
		<lb/>for valour and address, induced him to accept the
		<lb/>invitation, without delay. <persName>Peregrine White</persName> at­
		<lb/>tended him as guide on the occasion, and, after a
		<lb/>walk of eight miles, they reached the house of his
		<lb/>relative just in the dusk of twilight.</p>
	      <p><persName>Peregrine White</persName> led the way without ceremony,
		<lb/>into a large, low apartment, brightly illuminated
		<lb/>by a huge fire, which was blazing on a hearth
		<lb/>occupying no inconsiderable part of the room, and
		<lb/>which diffused a cheering warmth, peculiarly agree­
		<lb/>able in a cool autumnal evening. One recess of
		<lb/>the chimney corner was occupied by a stout <name>Indian</name>
		<lb/>dressed after the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> fashion, with the addi­

		<lb/>tion of a wampum belt, and other savage ornaments,
		<lb/>strangely blended with his <rs type="properAdjective">European</rs> costume. A
		<lb/>fowling piece rested beside him, and on a ledge,
		<lb/>over the fire place, lay his still smoking pipe, which
		<lb/>seemed to have been put aside, while he satisfied
		<lb/>the cravings of hunger from a pewter basin of sa­
		<lb/>vory pottage, occasionally adding a relish from the
		<lb/>carcase of a fowl which garnished his lap. His
		<lb/>bold features were composed into the gravity, pe­
		<lb/>culiar to his race, and his tawny complexion was
		<lb/>rendered more dark by the fitful light of the flame,
		<lb/>which now flashed upon it, and again left him in­
		<lb/>volved in shadow.</p>
	      <p><persName>Captain Standish</persName>, the early hero of <placeName>New-Eng­
		  <lb/>land</placeName>, was seated in a three-cornered elbow chair,
		<lb/>beside a round oaken table, discussing the merits
		<lb/>of a brace of partidges, from which, with the as­
		<lb/>sistance of some dried fish, and a quantity of <rs type="properAdjective">In­
		  <lb/>dian</rs> cakes, he was preparing to make a hearty
		<lb/>supper. His repast was shared by his only son, a
		<lb/>robust lad, while two surly mastiffs sat erect on
		<lb/>each side of them, with their eyes fixed wistfully
		<lb/>on the well-filled platters.</p>
	      <p><persName>Captain Standish</persName> was small of stature, but his
		<lb/>well-proportioned figure, denoted great agility and
		<lb/>muscular strength; his features were spirited and
		<lb/>intelligent, his eyes dark and piercing, and his
		<lb/>whole countenance indicated a frank and hasty
		<lb/>temper, an active and decisive mind, and a warm
		<lb/>and sanguine disposition.</p>
	      <p>This group was first apprised of the approach of
		<pb n="43"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="4(4)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">43</mw>
		<lb/>visitors, by the portentous growling of the dogs,
		<lb/>who inhospitally attacked the defenceless favourite
		<lb/>of <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, which had followed, or rather
		<lb/>preceded him into the room.</p>
	      <p><said>Come away <name>Towser</name>, down with you <name>Bess</name>,</said><lb/>cried the Captain in a loud voice, <said>shall I never
		  <lb/>teach you, to be civil!</said> <said>Ah, is it you, <persName>Master Pere­
		    <lb/>grine</persName>,</said> he added, on seeing his young acquaintance
		<lb/>enter, <said>well, I am glad to see you, though you do
		  <lb/>always bring noise and confusion with you.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Thank you Captain,</said> said <persName>Peregrine White</persName>;
		<lb/><said>but, as it happens, I find the noise already here,
		  <lb/>for once, and have brought with me something
		  <lb/>which I think will be more acceptable.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Ah, my cousin <persName>Atherton</persName>!</said> exclaimed the Cap­
		<lb/>tain, rising briskly from table, and seizing his
		<lb/>hand, without the ceremony of an introduction;
	      	<lb/><said rend="pre()"><choice><sic/><corr>‘</corr></choice>you are truly welcome to <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, though I am
		  <lb/>sorry I was not here to tell you so sooner; but sit
		  <lb/>down now, and we shall be better acquainted over
		  <lb/>our soldiers' fare, if you will share it with me.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I am used to a soldier's fare,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName><choice><sic>’</sic><corr/></choice>
	      	<lb/><said rend="pre()"><choice><sic/><corr>‘</corr></choice>and thank you for a soldier's welcome; but I should
		  <lb/>judge from the appearance of your trencher, that
		  <lb/>your campaigns had been made in a fruitful land;
		  <lb/>a camp does not often furnish such a profusion of
		  <lb/>good things.</said></p>
	      <p><said>True,</said> replied the Captain, <said>the <rs type="properAdjective">Dutch</rs> burgo­
		  <lb/>masters know, as well as most people, how to
		  <lb/>regale their palates; and I served long with them
		  <lb/>in the days of our good queen <persName>Elizabeth</persName>. But we

		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">44</mw>
		  <lb/>will try what is set before us now, if you please,

		  <lb/>give your kinsman a seat; are you so hungry as 
		  <lb/>to forget your manners!</said></p>
	      <p>The boy, with a very good grace, arose and
		<lb/>placed chairs for the guests, and the important
		<lb/>business of eating, was shortly resumed with ala­
		<lb/>crity.</p>
	      <p><said>We want a light here,</said> said <persName>Captain Standish</persName>,
		<lb/>again attacking the partridges; <said><persName>Hobamock</persName>, throw
		  <lb/>away your pipe; it may not be quite so agreeable
		  <lb/>to every one, as it is to you and me; and give us
		  <lb/>a candle here quickly; we are none of us owls to
		  <lb/>see in the dark.</said></p>
	      <p>The <name>Indian</name> rolled a column of smoke from his
		<lb/>mouth, knocked the ashes from his pipe upon the
		<lb/>hearth, and gravely rising, obeyed the Captain's
		<lb/>command. He then threw some dry wood into the
		<lb/>fire, which sent forth a crackling sound, and a
		<lb/>heat that penetrated to every recess of the apart­
		<lb/>ment; after turning his eyes deliberately round
		<lb/>the room, to ascertain if any thing else required his
		<lb/>attention, reseated himself on a wooden stool, to
		<lb/>doze away the evening.</p>
	      <p>The candle, which had been placed on the table,
		<lb/>first distinctly revealed to <persName>Captain Standish</persName> the
		<lb/>features of his kinsman; he examined them a mo­
		<lb/>ment in silence, and then observed,</p>
	      <p>
		<said>I see you have true <name>Standish</name> blood in your
		  <lb/>veins, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>; and I can now trace in

		  <lb/>your countenance a strong resemblance to my cou­
		  <lb/>sin <persName>Eleanor</persName>, though it is many long years since
		  <lb/>we met. She was just sixteen, when I left <placeName>Eng­
		    <lb/>land</placeName>, and the comeliest lass in <placeName>Lancashire</placeName>. Many
		  <lb/>a joyous hour have we passed together in the halls
		  <lb/>of our fathers; but I little thought, when I last
		  <lb/>bade her farewell, that I should never see her or
		  <lb/>my country more.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>My mother often spoke of you sir,</said> returned
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>and always with affectionate interest;
		  <lb/>but I was then far from anticipating, that we should
		  <lb/>ever sit down together in this remote region of the
		  <lb/>earth.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is the fortune of war to encounter sudden
		  <lb/>reverses,</said> replied the Captain; <said>but you have reach­
		  <lb/>ed a quiet land at last, though if you love your
		  <lb/>profession, our savage neighbours will contrive to
		  <lb/>keep your sword from rusting.</said></p>
	      <p><said>My sword and best services will ever be at the

		<lb/>turned <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>but I have resigned my com­
		  <lb/>mission in the army, and expect, in future, to lead
		  <lb/>a retired and private life.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>Well, we can find employment that will suit
		  <lb/>you in either case, if you like to remain with us.
		  <lb/>Your mother has brought you up in her own reli­

	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Humph, that is unlucky; but you need not make

		  <lb/>science, though, to be sure, the good people here
		  <lb/>are rather fond of doing such things. But, may I
		  <lb/>ask, have you any particular plans to execute.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>None at all. I am at present a citizen of the 
		  <lb/>world; and have travelled hither, from mere curi­
		  <lb/>osity, and the want of other employment. I admire
		  <lb/>this country, as far as I have seen it; am charmed
		  <lb/>with the simplicity and goodness of those who in­
		  <lb/>habit it; and, if nothing occurs to change my feel­
		  <lb/>ings, may yet sojourn with you, for a long time.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Admirable!</said> cried the Captain, rising and lead­
		<lb/>ing the way to the fire. <said>I think we shall fix you
		  <lb/>here, for life. I tell you, cousin <persName>Atherton</persName>, there is
		  <lb/>no country in the world so happy, or that will be
		  <lb/>so glorious, as <placeName>New-England</placeName>. Had you seen it in
		  <lb/><date when="1620">1620</date>, when we landed, famishing and almost frozen,
		  <lb/>you might have turned back a longing eye to the
		  <lb/>goodly fields of <placeName>England</placeName>; but, by the blaze of this
		  <lb/>warm fire, and on the strength of our evening's
		  <lb/>meal, I think we can arrange a better prospect for
		  <lb/>you.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And what shall I do to keep myself out of mis­
		  <lb/>chief?</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>. <said>I have been used to an
		  <lb/>active life, which gave constant exercise, both to
		  <lb/>my mind and body.</said></p>
	      <p><said>We will contrive to amuse you, through the
		  <lb/>winter,</said> answered the Captain; <said>and, in the spring,
		  <lb/>you can learn to till a farm, and provide for a
		  <lb/>family, when you have one, which will be exercise
		  <lb/>enough.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Rather more than I had anticipated,</said> said <persName>Ather­

		  <lb/>ton</persName>, smiling; <said>a wife is a blessing I have scarcely
		  <lb/>thought of as yet.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is a thought, which is very apt to run in a 
		  <lb/>young man's head, though,</said> replied the Captain,
		<lb/><said>at least, till he is fairly tied to one. But we will
		  <lb/>not hurry you, in that matter; though I can shew
		  <lb/>you as comely maidens, and as prudent ones,
		  <lb/>withal, as you could meet with, in <placeName>Old England</placeName>
		  <lb/>itself.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Now I'll wager any thing, Captain,</said> said <persName>Pere­
	      	<lb/>grine White</persName>, <said rend="pre()"><choice><sic/><corr>‘</corr></choice>that you are thinking of <persName>Miriam

		  <lb/>but <persName>Major Atherton</persName> has seen her already.</said></p>
	      <p><said>What, seen my little rose-bud, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>;</said>
		<lb/>said the Captain. <said>You are a true soldier, to be
		  <lb/>looking about for pretty damsels, as soon as you
		  <lb/>get into new quarters.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It was quite accidental,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>;
		<lb/><said>and, after all, only a momentary glimpse, at

	      <p><said>There was no lack of peeping, though,</said> rejoined
		<lb/><persName>Peregrine</persName>, archly; <said>but her new hood is unluckily
		  <lb/>a very close covering; don't you think so, Major?</said></p>
	      <p><said>Never mind, <persName>Peregrine</persName>,</said> said the Captain sig­

		  <lb/>out of the world, for the last few months; and, to
		  <lb/>confess the truth, have been too much engrossed by
		  <lb/>my own concerns, to observe what was passing
		  <lb/>around me.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>Well, and our good king <persName>Charles</persName> has lost

	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Not enough, I fear, for his own good, or the

		<said>Yet <persName>queen Henrietta</persName> is a beautiful and accom­

	      </p>
	      <p><said>So much the worse, if her husband cannot go­

		<said>I did hear that a warrant had been issued, at

	      <p><said>The great hurricane of last year,</said> replied the

		  <lb/>berds in their hands. <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>, who spent

		  <lb/>in spite of his quality, and his grave visage, and

	      <p><said>And what are they doing to <persName>Mrs. Hutchinson</persName>?</said><lb/>enquired <persName>Peregrine White</persName>—</p>
	      <p><said>Doing to her!</said> returned the Captain with some
		<lb/>warmth, <said>what they fled from <placeName>England</placeName> to avoid
		  <lb/>themselves! These <name>Massachusetts</name> are a meddling
		  <lb/>people, and they seem to have grown so fond of
		  <lb/>persecution, since they escaped from the reach of it,
		  <lb/>that they have a mind to try its efficacy in their
		  <lb/>own church, and undertake to discipline whomso­
		  <lb/>ever they choose. God knows there is little enough
		  <lb/>of charity in <emph>our</emph> colony; but it is some comfort to
		  <lb/>find we are not quite so bad as our neighbours.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Who is this female,</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>and of
		  <lb/>what crime has she been guilty, to draw upon her­
		  <lb/>self so much reproach?</said></p>
	      <p><said>The crime of thinking differently from her op­
		  <lb/>posers,</said> said the Captain. <said>She is a respectable
		  <lb/>gentlewoman, and her husband was long a repre­
		  <lb/>sentative in the court. But she is now accused of
		  <lb/>teaching false doctrines, holding unlawful meetings,
		  <lb/>and divers other misdemeanors; and the whole
		  <lb/>country is divided into parties, for and against her.
		  <lb/>I am sure it is no such strange thing for a woman's
		  <lb/>head to be filled with idle notions; and, if the ma­
		  <lb/>gistrates would only let her alone, she would soon
		  <lb/>come to her senses; but, I am told, she is to be tried
		  <lb/>by a council, and, it is thought, will be banished
		  <lb/>from the colony.</said></p>

		  <lb/>White</persName>, <said>I only hope she will not come here; for
		  <lb/>we have meetings and exhortations enough now, to
		  <lb/>keep the elders employed, and <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName>
		  <lb/>too. But did you hear any thing about the <name>Pe­
		    <lb/>quods</name>, Captain? It is reported here, that they have
		  <lb/>murdered <persName>John Oldham</persName> at <placeName>Block Island</placeName>, and are
		  <lb/>detected in plotting against the <name>English</name>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is true; the traitorous savages!</said> said the
		<lb/>Captain, <said>and instead of treating for peace with
		  <lb/>them, the whole race ought to be exterminated.
		  <lb/><persName>Oldham</persName> was a pestilent fellow, to be sure, but that
		  <lb/>is no reason why he should be hacked up, when
		  <lb/>trading peaceably with them, in their own coun­
		  <lb/>try.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Was the unfortunate man alone,</said> asked <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName>, <said>when the crime was perpetrated?</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>No, he had with him two boys, and as many
		  <lb/><name>Narraganset Indians</name>, whose lives were all spared.
		  <lb/>The master of a bark from <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, acciden­
		  <lb/>tally fell upon the wretches, soon after the deed was
		  <lb/>accomplished, and, assisted only by a man, and two
		  <lb/>lads who were with him, retook <persName>Oldham's</persName> vessel,
		  <lb/>which was filled with hostile <name>Indians</name>, several of
		  <lb/>whom were drowned in attempting to escape. <placeName>Block
		  <lb/>Island</placeName> is subject to the <name>Narraganset</name> tribe; but they
		  <lb/>seem to have had no hand in the murder, which was,
		  <lb/>doubtless, instigated by the <name>Pequods</name>, with whom
		  <lb/>the offenders have sought refuge.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Have no farther attempts been made to punish
		  <lb/>the murderers?</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>Yes, the Governor of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> sent four-

		  <lb/>score men, under <persName>Captain Endicot</persName> of <placeName>Salem</placeName>, with
		  <lb/>offers of peace, if they would give them up; but af­
		  <lb/>ter parleying for some time, they refused, and fled
		  <lb/>into the woods.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>And <persName>Captain Endicot</persName> pursued them, I hope,</said><lb/>said <persName>Peregrine</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>No, he burnt their wigwams, destroyed their
		  <lb/>corn, staved their canoes, and returned home to
		  <lb/>seek more comfortable winter quarters. I wish I
		  <lb/>had been there,</said> continued the Captain, with ear­
		<lb/>nestness; <said>not a dog of them should have escaped;
		  <lb/>I know their metal well; and, though generally
		  <lb/>fearless of death, a few dauntless <name>Englishmen</name> can
		  <lb/>put half a tribe of them to flight. These savages,
		  <lb/><persName>Major Atherton</persName>, are so perfidious, that no treaty
		  <lb/>can bind them; and so jealous of us, as to aim con­
		  <lb/>tinually at our total ruin. Many a foul plot has
		  <lb/>been revealed to us; and, in the days of our feeble­
		  <lb/>ness, nothing but the watchful providence of God
		  <lb/>preserved us from their evil designs.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And your own valour, Captain,</said> observed <persName>Pere­
		  <lb/>grine White</persName>; <said>you always forget to bring that into
		  <lb/>the account. But I can tell <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, how
		  <lb/>you went with only eight men, to the settlement of
		  <lb/><placeName>Wessagusset</placeName>, which was filled with <name>Indians</name>, and
		  <lb/>boldly attacked the sachems <persName>Wittuwamet</persName> and <persName>Peck­
		    <lb/>suot</persName>, who were the terror of the whole land; and
		  <lb/>a great many other wonderful stories.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Yes, yes,</said> interrupted the Captain, impatiently,
		<lb/><said>nobody doubts your ability to tell wonderful sto­
		  <lb/>ries, <persName>Peregrine</persName>. I have had proof enough of it from

		  <lb/>your youth up. But there is <persName>Hobamock</persName> nodding
		  <lb/>in the corner, and <persName>Alexander</persName> fast asleep on a bench
		  <lb/>yonder. The boy seems wearied by his long march
		  <lb/>yesterday; and, in truth, his young legs have never
		  <lb/>executed so much in one day before.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And I had forgotten,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, rising,
		<lb/><said>that you had been travelling so lately, and must
		  <lb/>need repose; indeed, the evening has passed so
		  <lb/>pleasantly, that I scarcely thought of returning.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Oh, we think lightly of a walk through the
		  <lb/>woods, once or twice a year, to the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>,</said><lb/>said the Captain, <said>and should be half ashamed to
		  <lb/>acknowledge ourselves fatigued by it. But you
		  <lb/>must not leave me to night, cousin <persName>Atherton</persName>; I
		  <lb/>have a bed ready for you, such as it is, and you will
		  <lb/>not forsake the house of your kinsman, for a stran­
		  <lb/>ger's roof.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I scarcely feel that any are strangers here,</said> re­

		  <lb/>kindness and attention; but the Governor expects
		  <lb/>me to return, and I cannot leave his hospitable fa­
		  <lb/>mily with so little ceremony.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Yes, you must, indeed, go home with me,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Peregrine White</persName>, <said>or you will disappoint us all;
		  <lb/>to-morrow, you know, we are to have some sport
		  <lb/>in the shooting way, and the next day—</said></p>

		<said>Not I, at least, till you have suffered enough
		  <lb/>for your folly to cure you of it, which will be no
		  <lb/>brief period. An't now, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, promise
		  <lb/>to come back, to-morrow, and take up your abode

	      </p>
	      <p><said>To-morrow, then,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>I will see
		  <lb/>you again.</said> And cordially shaking hands, they
		<lb/>parted.</p>
	      <p><persName>Peregrine White</persName> lingered a moment behind while
		<lb/><persName>Captain Standish</persName> attended <persName>Atherton</persName> to the outer
		<lb/>door; and, feeling his habitual love of mischief pre­
		<lb/>vail, adroitly contrived to roll the sleeping <persName>Alex­
		  <lb/>ander</persName> upon the floor. He fell with a dead weight
		<lb/>on one of the surly mastiffs, which set up a howl
		<lb/>that awakened his companion, who instantly join­
		<lb/>ed in the chorus, producing a confusion of sounds,
		<lb/>that speedily recalled the Captain and <persName>Atherton</persName> to
		<lb/>the room. They entered, just as the lad was
		<lb/>scrambling up, with a somniferous growling, and
		<lb/>the <name>Indian</name>, roused by the noise, was starting on
		<lb/>his feet, and instinctively seizing his fowling piece.
		<lb/>His straight black hair, which had been discom­
		<lb/>posed by his recumbent posture, stood almost erect,
		<lb/>and his dark eyes rolled wildly round, as if seek­
		<lb/>ing the cause of the unusual commotion. <persName>Captain
		  <lb/>Standish</persName> quickly discovered the author of the bus­
		<lb/>tle; but his intention of rebuking the culprit
		<lb/>vanished, the moment he saw him, and his gravity
		<lb/>yielded to a fit of laughter, in the midst of which,
		<lb/><persName>Peregrine White</persName> made his escape.</p>

		<lb/>house to engage in the projected sports of the day.</p>
	      <p>They were accompanied, a short distance, by the
		<lb/>Governor, whose agricultural pursuits often re­
		<lb/>quired his early attendance in the field of labour;
		<lb/>for like the <rs type="properAdjective">Roman</rs> <persName>Cincinnatus</persName>, the primitive rulers
		<lb/>of <placeName>New-England</placeName> were accustomed to mingle the
		<lb/>useful arts of husbandry with the higher duties of

		<lb/>the mind, piety of heart, and rectitude and upright­
		<lb/>ness of character, they presided with dignity, and

		<lb/>inhabitants of the village, who were scattering

		<lb/>marked with pleasure, the cordial salute of the
		<lb/>Governor, equally removed from pride and mean­
		<lb/>ness, and the respect and hearty good-will with
		<lb/>which it was returned. He involuntarily compar­
		<lb/>ed it with the fatiguing splendours of royalty, and
		<lb/>the often heartless shouts of applause, which follow
		<lb/>the steps of a monarch; and his already favoura­
		<lb/>ble prepossessions of the country were augmented
		<lb/>by the comparison. They rested a few moments,
		<lb/>on the summit of a hill beyond the town; and
		<lb/>while <persName>Peregrine White</persName> amused himself with train­
		<lb/>ing his dogs to perform various feats of dexterity
		<lb/>and cunning, the Governor and <persName>Major Atherton</persName>
		<lb/>regarded in silence the varied and beautiful scene­
		<lb/>ry, which was stretched around them.</p>
	      <p><said>I love to rest on this spot,</said> said the Governor,

		  <lb/><quote>brought us out of our afflictions,</quote> and, in the lat­

		  <lb/>astonishing success of your exertions; how dreary
		  <lb/>must this place have been when you first arrived

	      <p><said>Nor is it possible, now, to form an idea of it,</said><lb/>returned the Governor. <said>Expecting to reach a

		  <lb/>fruitful and temperate climate, we found ourselves

		  <lb/>liged to struggle with disease and famine; while
		  <lb/>those, whom we most loved, were perishing misera­
		  <lb/>bly before our eyes, through excess of hardship

		  <lb/>like.</said></p>
	      <p><said>They seemed filled with dread of us, feeble as we then were,</said> said <persName>Mr. Winslow</persName>; 
		<said>we seldom saw
		  <lb/>them, except in small numbers, as we sailed along
		  <lb/>the coast, and they always fled at the report of
		  <lb/>our fire-arms. We were informed by a friendly
		  <lb/><name>Indian</name>, who came to us, in the spring, that four
		  <lb/>years previous to that time, a dreadful sickness had
		  <lb/>almost depopulated this part of the country; and
		  <lb/>we could not but regard it as a signal interposition
		  <lb/>of Providence, which had thus <quote>cast out the heath­
		    <lb/>en</quote> before us, to make way for a people, who would
		  <lb/>spread the true religion throughout the land. Had
		  <lb/>they fallen upon us, when we were sick and de­
		  <lb/>fenceless we could have opposed but little resist­
		  <lb/>ance to their savage ferocity.</said></p>

		  <lb/>the northern shore of the <placeName>Narraganset Bay</placeName>, about
		  <lb/>forty miles distant from us. A few months after
		  <lb/>our arrival, the Sachem sent us a present of furs,
		  <lb/>with a message announcing his intention of visiting
		  <lb/>us; and, shortly after, he appeared on this very
		  <lb/>hill, with a train of sixty attendants, all decorated
		  <lb/>with the skins of wild beasts, and frightfully dis­
		  <lb/>figured by paint. The chief signified his pleasure,
		  <lb/>that one of us should come to him, and being re­
		  <lb/>quested by the Governor, I went alone, and carry­
		  <lb/>ing a present; though, I assure you, <persName>Major Ather­
		    <lb/>ton</persName>, I could hardly approach such wild looking
		  <lb/>beings without trembling. I remained with them,
		  <lb/>as an hostage, while <persName>Massasoit</persName>, with twenty of his
		  <lb/>men, unarmed, descended to a brook yonder,
		  <lb/>where they were received by <persName>Captain Standish</persName>,
		  <lb/>and six of our people, who conducted the <name>Indians</name>
		  <lb/>to a house. They were seated on cushions, placed

		  <lb/><persName>Governor Carver</persName> presently entered, followed by a
		  <lb/>few musketeers, with a drum and trumpet, which
		  <lb/>caused them great astonishment and delight. We
		  <lb/>then entered into a treaty of peace and friendship
		  <lb/>with them, which has ever since been faithfully pre­
		  <lb/>served, on both sides.</said>

	      <p><said>How could you understand their barbarous dia­

	      <p><said>We found an interpreter,</said> said <persName>Mr. Winslow</persName>,
		<lb/><said>in an <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> sagamore, who early adventured
		  <lb/>amongst us, and had learned something of our lan­
		  <lb/>guage, from the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> traders and fishermen,
		  <lb/>who used to frequent the coast. There was also
		  <lb/>another savage, called <persName>Squanto</persName>, who attached him­
		  <lb/>self to us, and, on many occasions, did us good
		  <lb/>service, though he eventually proved treacherous.
		  <lb/>Several years before, he, with twenty others, were
		  <lb/>decoyed on board a vessel, by one master <persName>Hunt</persName>,
		  <lb/>(who came hither, under pretence of trading with
		  <lb/>the natives,) and carried to <placeName>Malaga</placeName>, where they
		  <lb/>were sold for slaves. <persName>Squanto</persName> was afterwards
		  <lb/>sent to <placeName>England</placeName>, and is the only one who has ever
		  <lb/>returned here. This perfidious act of our country­
		  <lb/>man, justly incensed the savages against all white
		  <lb/>people, and it is not strange, that they should wish
		  <lb/>to exclude such dangerous neighbours. But I must
		  <lb/>leave you, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>: we lead a pastoral life,
		  <lb/>here, you see, and the labour of our fields, and wel­
		  <lb/>fare of our flocks must be attended to.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I am glad my father has done his speech,</said> ex­
		<lb/>claimed <persName>Peregrine White</persName>, springing from the
		<lb/>ground, the moment he had left them. <said>But who
		  <lb/>comes here? <persName>Hobamock</persName>, as I live, with <persName>Alexander</persName>
		  <lb/>and the mastiffs.</said></p>
	      <p>And, in truth, the <name>Indian</name>, who had heard their
		<lb/>arrangements on the preceding evening, and loved
		<lb/>every wild adventure, now came running swiftly
		<lb/>towards them, followed by <persName>Alexander Standish</persName>,
		<lb/>who was tugging up the hill, almost out of breath;
		<pb n="060"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="5(6)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">60</mw>
		<lb/>and pettishly accusing his more nimble footed com­
		<lb/>panion for leaving him in the rear.</p>
	      <p><said>Why wont you stop for me <persName>Hobamock</persName>? I can't
		  <lb/>keep up with you,</said> they could hear him say.</p>
	      <p><said>Your legs be younger than mine, and I do car­
		  <lb/>ry your gun,</said> returned the Indian, who was, in
		<lb/>fact, loaded with two pieces.</p>
	      <p><said>And what have you come here for <persName>Hobamock</persName>?</said><lb/>asked <persName>Peregrine</persName>, as soon as he was within hearing.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>I come for shoot you, <persName>master Peregrine</persName>.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Shoot me, you copper-coloured rascal, do you
		  <lb/>mean so?</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Shoot for you the birds, <persName>master Peregrine</persName>, I
		  <lb/>mean, and then make a fire for eat them, in the
		  <lb/>woods.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Oh, you come to eat, did you? well, let's on
		  <lb/>then. But stop, what ails you, <persName>Alexander</persName>?</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Nothing;</said> said the boy, and snatching his
		<lb/>fowling piece from the hand of <persName>Hobamock</persName>, he fol­
		<lb/>lowed them a few moments in silence. But his
		<lb/>cheerfulness soon returned; for he was naturally
		<lb/>gay and good-tempered, though rather self-willed,
		<lb/>which might be attributed to the want of early
		<lb/>discipline, having lost his mother in infancy, and
		<lb/>his father's public duties calling him frequently
		<lb/>from home, had left him much at his own disposal.</p>
	      <p>The little party proceeded gaily on their way,
		<lb/>and soon struck into the mazes of a deep forest,
		<lb/>where <persName>Peregrine White</persName> augured they should find
		<lb/>plenty of game. They followed a winding path
		<lb/>along the margin of a clear stream, that floated on
		<pb n="061"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="6(1)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">61</mw>
		<lb/>its billows the red and decaying leaves of autumn;
		<lb/>and after struggling on its course, and frequently
		<lb/>forcing a passage over fragments of rocks and
		<lb/>trunks of fallen trees, from which they dashed in
		<lb/>broken and foaming sheets, producing miniature
		<lb/>water-falls of exquisite beauty, at length termi­
		<lb/>nated in a small lake, fringed with the quivering
		<lb/>birch and drooping willow, which dipped their
		<lb/>flexile branches in the waves, already strewed with
		<lb/>their transient foliage.</p>
	      <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName>, charmed with the romantic
		<lb/>beauty of the spot, lingered far behind his compa­
		<lb/>nions; and, busied with his own thoughts, heeded
		<lb/>not their merry voices and loud peals of laughter,
		<lb/>which grew fainter and fainter, till they were no
		<lb/>longer distinguished from the whistling of the
		<lb/>breeze, and the monotonous rippling of the waters.
		<lb/>The report of a gun at length roused him to a con­
		<lb/>sciousness of his lonely situation; and, hastening
		<lb/>to the place from whence the sound proceeded, he
		<lb/>found <persName>Peregrine White</persName> reloading his piece, with
		<lb/>an air of extreme vexation.</p>
	      <p><said>I thought we had lost you, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>,</said> he
		<lb/>said; <said>I wish you had been here, just to have seen
		  <lb/>the fine covey of partridges that I started; but the
		  <lb/>foolish birds chose to make the best of their way
		  <lb/>off, as soon as the shot began to fly.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Foolish, indeed!</said> replied <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>to make
		  <lb/>use of their wings, when such an honour awaited
		  <lb/>them; but I fear we shall not find much sport

		  <lb/>here; there seems little but dried leaves stirring
		  <lb/>to-day!</said></p>
	      <p><said>Not much else, in the bottom of that muddy
		  <lb/>pool where you have been looking this half hour,</said><lb/>said <persName>Peregrine</persName>; <said>but see there!</said> and he aimed
		<lb/>steadily at a bird which was perched at some dis­
		<lb/>tance. But the keen eye of <persName>Hobamock</persName> had already
		<lb/>marked it, and his unerring aim brought it in
		<lb/>an instant fluttering to the ground. <persName>Peregrine
		  <lb/>White's</persName> third attempt, however, proved more
		<lb/>fortunate, and abundantly recompensed him for
		<lb/>his past mortification; and each having been
		<lb/>more or less successful, they began to feel strong
		<lb/>appetites produced by their exercise, and commis­
		<lb/>sioned <persName>Hobamock</persName> to kindle a fire under the trees,
		<lb/>and cook their game. The Indian obeyed with
		<lb/>alacrity; and stripping the birds of the beautiful
		<lb/>plumage, which they had lately sported with such
		<lb/>innocent joy in their native bowers, he was pre­
		<lb/>paring to lay them on the coals, when the distant
		<lb/>echo of fire-arms announced that other sportsmen
		<lb/>were amusing themselves in the forest.</p>
	      <p><said>We will see who is here,</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName>,
		<lb/>springing forward, and crushing the brushwood
		<lb/>under his feet; <said>and do you run on, <persName>Hobamock</persName>;
		  <lb/>and if it is any of your sooty brethren, warn them
		  <lb/>to be civil to us.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I will stay and take care of the dinner,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Alexander</persName>, <said>only don't be gone long if you want
		  <lb/>me to save any for you.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You must have a lion's appetite to eat all those
		  <pb n="063"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="6(2)r"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">63</mw>
		  <lb/>birds,</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName> laughing; <said>but mind and
		  <lb/>keep a good bunch to carry home and show.</said></p>
	      <p>Again he bounded onward, and <persName>Atherton</persName>, with
		<lb/>equal agility, followed through the various intri­
		<lb/>cate windings, where the bending saplings mark­
		<lb/>ed the footsteps of <persName>Hobamock</persName>, who had left the
		<lb/>beaten track, and trusted to the guidance of his
		<lb/>ear for a nearer course to the place from whence
		<lb/>the sound had proceeded.</p>
	      <p>They at length overtook him, just on the verge
		<lb/>of a sunny slope, which for a considerable space
		<lb/>had been cleared of trees; while the ruins of a
		<lb/>wigwam and some vestiges of a cornfield shewed
		<lb/>that it had once been the abode of <name>Indians</name>. Three
		<lb/>savage warriors, in the prime of manhood, were
		<lb/>carelessly reclined on the ground, and, as usual
		<lb/>when weary or idle, regaling themselves with
		<lb/>smoking tobacco; while, at a little distance, a
		<lb/>female was busied over a large fire, apparently in
		<lb/>some culinary preparation. She occasionally
		<lb/>stooped and sung, in a low sweet tone, to an in­
		<lb/>fant child that lay on the ground beside her; and
		<lb/>which, according to their custom, was stretched on
		<lb/>a board, and its little limbs confined with cords; a
		<lb/>custom which kept it secure when travelling, on
		<lb/>the back of its mother, and, doubtless, contributed
		<lb/>to form that straightness of limb for which the
		<lb/>race are so remarkable.</p>
	      <p>The men were partially covered with deer skins,
		<lb/>extending, like trowsers, to their feet, which were
		<lb/>guarded by mocassins of the same material. From

		<lb/>their shoulders depended a sort of cloak, composed
		<lb/>of a beautiful variety of furs; their heads were
		<lb/>decked with feathers, and their faces painted with
		<lb/>divers colours, extracted from the juice of certain
		<lb/>plants, and representing the most hideous figures.
		<lb/>The eldest, and apparently a chief, was distinguished
		<lb/>by a plume of eagle's feathers, and a necklace of
		<lb/>carved bone hanging down to his waist, which was
		<lb/>encircled by a belt of wampum.</p>
	      <p>The dress of the <mcr>Squaw</mcr> differed little from the
		<lb/>others, except that with the usual predeliction of
		<lb/>her sex for ornament, she had profusely, and with
		<lb/>some taste, mingled the most gaudy colours with her
		<lb/>straight and glossy hair, and adorned her neck,
		<lb/>arms, and ancles, with bracelets of glass beads.</p>
	      <p>As soon as the keen-eyed <name>Indians</name> observed the
		<lb/>approaching figures of <persName>Major Atherton</persName> and <persName>Pere­
		  <lb/>grine</persName>, they started on their feet, with extreme quick­
		<lb/>ness; and the chief, advancing forward a few pa­
		<lb/>ces, waited to receive them, leaning on his fowling
		<lb/>piece, his companions standing on either side of
		<lb/>him, with their bows bent, prepared to take deadly
		<lb/>aim, if any violence were offered them. Nothing
		<lb/>could exceed the dignity and grace of their attitudes,
		<lb/>the vigour and symmetry of their forms, or the noble,
		<lb/>though fierce expression of their countenances. <persName>Ho­
		  <lb/>bamock</persName> hastened to meet them with words of
		<lb/>peace; and, after listening to him with profound
		<lb/>attention, they threw aside their weapons, and re­
		<lb/>seating themselves on the ground, by expressive
		<lb/>gestures, invited the young men to join their circle.
		<pb n="065"/>

		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">65</mw>
		<lb/>They accordingly seated themselves, and through
		<lb/>the interpretation of <persName>Hobamock</persName>, entered into con­
		<lb/>versation with the <name>Indians</name>, which was particularly
		<lb/>interesting to <persName>Atherton</persName>, who had much curiosity to
		<lb/>learn something of that singular race of people, and
		<lb/>to see them in their native wildness.</p>
	      <p>These warriors were of the <name><sic>Wamponeag</sic></name> tribe,
		<lb/>subjects of the sachem <persName>Massasoit</persName>, and on their way
		<lb/>to <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, to trade with the people in furs. They
		<lb/>were very courteous in their manners; and, as a
		<lb/>mark of peculiar kindness, offered each of their tran­
		<lb/>sient guests a share of their lighted tobacco, and
		<lb/>seemed much surprised that <persName>Atherton</persName> declined so
		<lb/>great a luxury, which was however accepted with
		<lb/>becoming gravity by <persName>Peregrine</persName>, though the use of
		<lb/>it excited many wry faces. The squaw was then
		<lb/>ordered to fetch an earthen vessel of <mentioned>strong water</mentioned>;
		<lb/>for so they called the ardent spirits which were giv­
		<lb/>en them by the <name>Europeans</name>, and which was even
		<lb/>then a fruitful source of traffic and of cheating; for
		<lb/>they would barter the most valuable articles to sa­
		<lb/>tisfy their thirst for what has proved the instrument
		<lb/>of their destruction.</p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName> felt obliged to put the draught to his
		<lb/>lips, though he thought it scarcely more palatable
		<lb/>than the pungent weed he had just refused; and in
		<lb/>returning the remainder to the young female who
		<lb/>stood waiting to receive it, he could not but remark
		<lb/>with admiration the timid gentleness of her manner
		<lb/>which gave a charm to the delicacy of her features,
		<lb/>and the softness of her olive complexion. She seemed

		<lb/>to regard with great tenderness the little <mcr>papoose</mcr>, who
		<lb/>awoke and began to cry; but the moment she at­
		<lb/>tempted to soothe him, she was sternly ordered back
		<lb/>by her savage lord, whose commands were impli­
		<lb/>citly obeyed; for the females of those tribes are ac­
		<lb/>customed to endure the caprice of their indolent ty­
		<lb/>rants, and to perform the most servile and fatiguing
		<lb/>labour with unrepining meekness.</p>
	      <p><persName>Peregrine White</persName> at length reminded <persName>Atherton</persName>, that
		<lb/>their dinner would be spoiled by waiting, or eaten
		<lb/>up by <persName>Alexander</persName> and his dogs; and having no in­
		<lb/>clination to lose their feast, after so long an absti­
		<lb/>nence, they parted from their friendly entertainers,
		<lb/>leaving with them a small present, which was al­
		<lb/>ways expected by an <name>Indian</name> from a white person
		<lb/>with whom he had any intercourse.</p>
	      <p>On returning to the spot where they had left their
		<lb/>game under the care of <persName>Alexander</persName>, <persName>Peregrine White</persName>
		<lb/>who preceded his companions, startled them with
		<lb/>exclaiming,</p>
	      <p>
		<said>What is here? the boy has served us a pretty
		  <lb/>trick in good truth; <persName>Alexander</persName>! <persName>Alexander</persName>!</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>But no voice replied to him, and <persName>Atherton</persName> hasten­
		<lb/>ing to the place, perceived with surprise the fire
		<lb/>which they had kindled, almost extinct, and their birds
		<lb/>lying blackened to a coal on the mouldering em­
		<lb/>bers. Those which they had reserved as trophies
		<lb/>of their success, had all disappeared with the faith­
		<lb/>less guard who was entrusted with the care of them.
		<lb/><persName>Peregrine White</persName> gave vent to his indignation by a
		<lb/>blow aimed with his foot, and with a force that
		<pb n="067"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="6(4)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">67</mw>
		<lb/>threw the half consumed brands in various direc­
		<lb/>tions, and ejected a fragment into the face of <persName>Ho­
		  <lb/>bamock</persName>, leaving a dark stain upon his swarthy
		<lb/>skin, though his countenance preserved its usual
		<lb/>gravity, mingled with an expression of astonish­
		<lb/>ment, as he regarded the impotent wrath of the
		<lb/>youth whose anger proved as transient as it had
		<lb/>been ungovernable; and yielded to a burst of mirth
		<lb/>on beholding the blackened visage of the <name>Indian</name>,
		<lb/>who began leisurely to wipe it off with a bundle of
		<lb/>dried leaves.</p>
	      <p><said>Let it be, <persName>Hobamock</persName>,</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName>, <said>it will
		  <lb/>serve you for paint as well as any other daubing.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>I use no paint, <persName>Master Peregrine</persName>, now that I
		  <lb/>live with white people.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Well, I wish it had been <persName>Alexander</persName> instead of
		  <lb/>you; but he shall pay dearly for his roguery yet.
		  <lb/>And now what can we find to eat?</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><persName>Hobamock</persName> had brought a few <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> cakes to re­
		<lb/>lish their expected repast, which, for the want of
		<lb/>better fare, they consumed with sportsmen's appe­
		<lb/>tites; and with this meagre refreshment, and a
		<lb/>draught from a pure stream, to the fountain head
		<lb/>of which <persName>Hobamock</persName> led them, (for an <name>Indian</name> will
		<lb/>long endure thirst rather than drink but at the
		<lb/>source of even the clearest water,) they returned
		<lb/>somewhat crest-fallen to the village.</p>
	      <p><persName>Peregrine White</persName> in particular, who boasted much
		<lb/>of his dexterity in shooting, and had promised in
		<lb/>the morning to return well laden with game, felt
		<lb/>no little mortification; and expecting the railery of
		<pb n="068"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="6(4)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">68</mw>
		<lb/>his family, proposed to <persName>Atherton</persName> as they passed the
		<lb/>beach, to try their luck in fishing, that they might
		<lb/>have something to carry home with them. <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName> readily consented; and hailing a boat which
		<lb/>was just pushing from the shore, they were cheer­
		<lb/>fully admitted by the man who occupied it, leaving
		<lb/><persName>Hobamock</persName>, at his own desire, to return to his fa­
		<lb/>mily.</p>
	      <p>The little bark skipped lightly over the waves,
		<lb/>and was soon without the harbour, where they an­
		<lb/>chored and prepared their baits, assured by the ex­
		<lb/>perienced fisherman who guided them, that there
		<lb/>would be no lack of nibbling. His prognostic
		<lb/>proved correct, and the place yielded such an abun­
		<lb/>dance of its finny treasure, that in a short time they
		<lb/>procured sufficient to make amends for the disas­
		<lb/>ters of the morning;—about sunset they steered
		<lb/>towards the shore. Several boats which had been
		<lb/>fishing in the bay, also tacked about and bore home­
		<lb/>ward; and in one of them <persName>Peregrine White</persName> per­
		<lb/>ceived <persName>Mr. Grey</persName> and <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName>; but they
		<lb/>were far behind, and in a larger vessel which strug­
		<lb/>gled hard against the wind.</p>
	      <p>On approaching the shore, they observed two
		<lb/>females walking the beach, and occasionally stop­
		<lb/>ping to regard them with attention. As they came
		<lb/>near enough to distinguish objects with certainty,
		<lb/><persName>Peregrine White</persName> exclaimed,</p>
	      <p>
		<said>That is <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> and her cousin <persName>Lois</persName>, as I
		  <lb/>am alive; shall we go and speak with them, <persName>Major
		    <lb/>Atherton</persName>?</said>

	      <p>
		<said>As you please; I have no objection.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>So I thought,</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName>, significantly.
		<lb/><said>Tug hard at your oars, <persName>John</persName>, or they will be off.</said></p>
	      <p>The boatman applied all his strength, but <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName> thought the bark moved slower than ever, par­
		<lb/>ticularly when the females approached near the
		<lb/>water's edge, and apparently ascertaining their
		<lb/>persons, turned carelessly away, and retreated
		<lb/>behind a cliff that entirely concealed them.</p>
	      <p><said>I will find them yet,</said> said <persName>Peregrine White</persName>,
		<lb/>leaping on the strand, which they at that moment
		<lb/>gained; <said>follow me<supplied reason="flawed-reproduction">,</supplied> and be still.</said></p>
	      <p>He sprang quickly forward, in a direction oppo­
		<lb/>site to that chosen by the persons he was seeking,
		<lb/>and, throwing down his scaly burden, began to
		<lb/>ascend a craggy rock, which projected one side
		<lb/>into the sea, and was rendered extremely slippery
		<lb/>by the adhesion of sea-weeds left by the receding
		<lb/>tide, and the spray which continually dashed over
		<lb/>it. <persName>Atherton</persName> followed him in silence to the sum­
		<lb/>mit, remaining a few paces behind, till he distinct­
		<lb/>ly heard the sound of voices, rising from beneath
		<lb/>the cliff.</p>
	      <p><persName>Peregrine White</persName> stooped, and looking down, saw,
		<lb/>as he expected, <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> and her cousin below,
		<lb/>talking together, and quite unconscious that any
		<lb/>one was observing them. He silently dropped a
		<lb/>small pebble on the head of <persName>Miriam</persName>, who, supposing
		<lb/>it accidental, continued conversing, without regard­
		<lb/>ing it; but another, and another fell on her neck
		<lb/>and shoulders; and before she had time to look
		<pb n="070"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="6(5)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">70</mw>
		<lb/>around, a large handful rattled down the crag and
		<lb/>lay scattered at her feet. She uttered an exclama­
		<lb/>tion of surprise, which brought <persName>Atherton</persName> to the
		<lb/>verge of the precipice, though he remained screen­
		<lb/>ed from observation by a fragment of the rock,
		<lb/>from whence he watched with interest the light
		<lb/>figure of <persName>Miriam Gray</persName>. She stood in an attitude
		<lb/>which expressed an intention of flight, with one
		<lb/>foot extended, as in the act of bounding forward,
		<lb/>yet still lingering on the spot, and casting an
		<lb/>eager glance around, to ascertain the cause of her
		<lb/>alarm. She had pushed back the hood that shaded
		<lb/>her countenance, which was flushed with surprize;
		<lb/>though the first impulse of womanish fear had given
		<lb/>place to an expression of spirit and resolution.
		<lb/>On looking up and perceiving <persName>Peregrine White</persName>, she
		<lb/>assumed an air of displeasure, which, however,
		<lb/>seemed unusual to her, and her features soon re­
		<lb/>sumed their wonted sweetness and vivacity, and
		<lb/>her deep blue eyes and archness peculiarly their

	      <p><persName>Lois Grey</persName>, a demure and comely damsel of
		<lb/>twenty-eight, first broke the silence.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>Your time is well employed, I think, <persName>Master
		    <lb/>Peregrine</persName>, in showering down stones upon us.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Not upon you, <persName>Lois</persName>, they did not touch so much
		  <lb/>as the hem of your garments. I only gathered a
		  <lb/>few small stones, like <persName>David</persName> of old, from the great
		  <lb/>brook yonder, to frighten <persName>Miriam</persName>, and revenge
		  <lb/>myself on her for running away when she saw
		  <lb/>me coming to her.</said>

	      <p><said>I run away from you!</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>I only
		  <lb/>saw you sailing on the water, and how could I
		  <lb/>know you were coming to me?</said></p>
	      <p><said>Ah, you knew well enough,</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName>;
		<lb/><said>but it is not the first time that you have served
		  <lb/>me so.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And it is not the first time,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, point­
		<lb/>ing, with a smile, to the pebble stones, <said>that I have
		  <lb/>had good reason for avoiding you. But I came hith­
		  <lb/>er to meet my father; did you see his boat coming in?</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>Yes, and <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName> was with him; but
		  <lb/>I suppose you know that already.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Indeed I did not,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName> eagerly, and
		<lb/>slightly colouring.</p>
	      <p><said>Well, I tell you he is,</said> returned <persName>Peregrine</persName>;
		<lb/><said>and they have this moment touched the strand;
		  <lb/>there goes the honest deacon, that is to be, with a
		  <lb/>heavy load of fish on his back; I would you were
		  <lb/>up here to look at him, <persName>Miriam</persName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said rend="post()">I have not the least curiosity on the subject,
		  <lb/>and am quite satisfied with my lowly station,<choice><sic/><corr>’</corr></choice></said> re­
		<lb/>plied the damsel; <said>but I must be gone; good bye
		  <lb/>to you, Peregrine.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Stop a moment,</said> cried <persName>Peregrine</persName>, <said>here is some­
		  <lb/>body who wants to see you.</said></p>
	      <p>Before <persName>Atherton</persName> was aware of his design, the
		<lb/>youth pulled him suddenly by his arm from behind
		<lb/>the rock, in view of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, who had instinc­
		<lb/>tively stopped, and now stood abashed before him.</p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName>, though provoked by at the awkwardness
		<lb/>of his situation, retained his self-possession; and
		<pb n="072"/><milestone unit="sig" n="6(6)v"/><mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">72</mw><lb/>on the whole, acquitted himself better than could
		<lb/>have been expected, considering the uneasiness of
		<lb/>his position on the summit of a dizzy crag. <persName>Mi­
		  <lb/>riam Grey</persName> silently courtesied to his salute; but a
		<lb/>smile played on her lips as she glanced at him
		<lb/>through her long eye-lashes, and beheld him hover­
		<lb/>ing in the air above her; then taking the arm of
		<lb/><persName>Lois</persName>, they walked quietly away, leaving <persName>Atherton</persName>
		<lb/>to deprecate the mischievous spirit of <persName>Peregrine</persName>,
		<lb/>which had led him into so ridiculous an adventure.</p>
	      <p><said>Now was'nt that well done!</said> exclaimed <persName>Pere­
		  <lb/>grine White</persName> in an exulting tone, and striking the
		<lb/>shoulder of <persName>Atherton</persName> with a force which at once
		<lb/>started him from his musing posture. <said>I tell you,
		  <lb/><persName>Major Atherton</persName>, there's not a man in <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>
		  <lb/>could have contrived a neater way of giving you a
		  <lb/>peep at a pretty girl; you ought to thank me on
		  <lb/>bended knees.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Thank you!</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName> drily, <said>for
		  <lb/>making me look like a fool: what could she think
		  <lb/>to see me perched, like a sea-gull, on this vexatious
		  <lb/>rock.</said></p>
	      <p><said><emph>She!</emph></said> returned <persName>Peregrine</persName>, with a provoking
		<lb/>laugh; <said>so you saw but one, did you? and now I
		  <lb/>think me of it, that must have been <persName>Lois</persName>; this con­
		  <lb/>founded crag was between you and <persName>Miriam</persName>; but I
		  <lb/>will call her again, since I know you are longing
		  <lb/>to look at her.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Stay,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName> quickly; <said>indeed, I saw
		  <lb/>them both; so have done with this folly, I entreat
		  <lb/>you.</said></p>

	      <p>But <persName>Peregrine</persName> had already mounted the highest
		<lb/>pinnacle of the rock, and in spite of his remon­
		<lb/>strance called aloud to <persName>Miriam</persName>, who, though now
		<lb/>far from them, turned to look back as his clear and
		<lb/>sonorous voice, rising above the dashing of the
		<lb/>waves, repeated her name.</p>
	      <p><persName>Peregrine White</persName> tore a branch from a dwarf
		<lb/>cedar which grew in a fissure of the rock, and
		<lb/>waved it on high with a motion expressive of his
		<lb/>wish for her return; but she shook her head and
		<lb/>was again turning away, when he pointed signifi­
		<lb/>cantly towards the sea shore.</p>
	      <p><persName>Miriam</persName> looked in that direction, and saw <persName>Ben­
		  <lb/>jamin Ashly</persName> advancing from it alone, and at a pace
		<lb/>unusually brisk for him; and probably construing
		<lb/>his speed into a design to overtake her, she darted
		<lb/>from the highway, and was instantly buried from
		<lb/>sight in a thick copse of evergreens. Her cousin
		<lb/>followed more leisurely; and <persName>Mr. Ashly</persName>, after
		<lb/>lingering a moment, and regarding the spot from
		<lb/>whence she disappeared with a visage evidently
		<lb/>lengthened, drew the fish over his shoulder with a
		<lb/>doubtful jerk, and quietly retreated into another
		<lb/>path.</p>
	      <p><said>Excellently well done, my pretty <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Peregrine</persName>, laughing; <said>I declare there is not an­
		  <lb/>other such witch in the country, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>She seems to have bewitched you,</said> replied
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>I hope you do not intend to enter into
		  <lb/>competition with worthy <persName>Mr. Ashly</persName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Not at all,</said> returned <persName>Peregrine</persName> carelessly; <said>but

		  <lb/><persName>Miriam</persName> and I have frolicked together ever since
		  <lb/>we were born; and I do love to see her torment
		  <lb/>that whining fool, who thinks every one, save
		  <lb/>himself and a godly few, are in the broad road to
		  <lb/>destruction. But the tide is coming in fast; so we
		  <lb/>had better get down, or we may be left standing
		  <lb/>here like flag-staffs till to-morrow morning.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And our fish may swim off in the mean time,
		  <lb/>and leave us fasting again,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>we
		  <lb/>left them at the foot of the rock.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Here they are, safe,</said> returned <persName>Peregrine</persName>, slid­
		<lb/>ing rapidly down the precipice; <said rend="pre()">a pretty joke on us
		  <lb/>it would have been, if they had vanished like the
		  <lb/>partridges. And now you will go home with me,
		  <lb/><persName>Major Atherton</persName>, and help eat some of them.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>You know I promised <persName>Captain Standish</persName> to re­
		  <lb/>turn to his house to-night.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>It is full eight miles there, and I can never
		  <lb/>walk it, in my present weak state; to speak the
		  <lb/>truth, these fasting days do'nt suit my stomach at
		  <lb/>all. There is no living without eating, <persName>Major
		    <lb/>Atherton</persName>; and it was a provident thought in good
		  <lb/>master <persName>Calvin</persName> to get released from a monkish
		  <lb/>church, that kept one starving more than half
		  <lb/>one's life.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>I shall be very glad of a good supper for my part,</said><lb/>said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>and I wish we had shot across the
		  <lb/>bay to the Captains, when we were on the water,
		  <lb/>just now.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Never mind,</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName>, <said>if you will go
		  <lb/>home with me first, I will walk back with you; I want
		  <pb n="075"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="7(2)r"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">75</mw>
		  <lb/>to pay off my debt to the little rascal who ran away
		  <lb/>with the birds, and the moon will be up in season
		  <lb/>to light me home.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> consented to the arrangement;
		<lb/>and during the remainder of the way to the Go­
		<lb/>vernors, <persName>Peregrine White</persName> was in vain exercising
		<lb/>his wits to invent some plausible excuse for the
		<lb/>morning disasters; but his mind was still unsatis­
		<lb/>fied, when he opened the door and entered a pas­
		<lb/>sage leading to the sitting room, which at that
		<lb/>hour, was entirely in darkness.</p>
	      <p><said>Is that you, brother <persName>Peregrine</persName>,</said> said a little
		<lb/>damsel, who was groping her way through the
		<lb/>place.</p>
	      <p><persName>Peregrine</persName> drew the cold slimy tails of the fish
		<lb/>across her neck, in mysterious silence; and in an
		<lb/>instant the cries of the frightened child brought all
		<lb/>the family to her assistance.</p>
	      <p><said>I should have known it was you, my son,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Mrs. Winslow</persName>, drawing the little girl to her arms,
		<lb/><said>you are apt to announce yourself in this noisy
		  <lb/>manner.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>Me, mother! I was as dumb as the fish that
		  <lb/><persName>Susy</persName> ran against, like a silly thing. But here is
		  <lb/><persName>Major Atherton</persName> half starved, as well as myself,
		  <lb/>and I am glad to see you have not done supper
		  <lb/>yet.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said><persName>Major Atherton</persName> is truly welcome,</said> said <persName>Mrs.
		  <lb/>Winslow</persName>, leading the way back to the room, <said>our
		  <lb/>repast has but just commenced, and you bring us a
		  <lb/>liberal supply, and I suppose excellent appetites
		  <lb/>after your day's amusement.</said></p>

	      <p><said>That we do,</said> returned <persName>Peregrine</persName>; <said>for I assure
		  <lb/>you, we have not been overburthened with food to
		  <lb/>day.</said></p>
	      <p><said>But where are your birds,</said> inquired the Go­
		<lb/>vernor, <said>I saw you enter the woods this morning,
		  <lb/>and have waited impatiently for the game you pro­
		  <lb/>mised us in such abundance.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And here is a bunch of as fine fresh fish, as
		  <lb/>ever smoked on the table of a prince,</said> said <persName>Pere­
		  <lb/>grine</persName>. <said>It was so fair a day, and the water look­
		  <lb/>ed so smooth and tempting, we thought best to
		  <lb/>alter our plans; no strange thing in this changea­
		  <lb/>ble world.</said></p>
	      <p><said>We are never surprised to find you wavering,</said><lb/>observed <persName>Mrs. Winslow</persName>; <said>but I hope you consult­
		  <lb/>ed <persName>Major Atherton's</persName> wishes as well as your own.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Certainly,</said> replied <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>so far as it was
		  <lb/>in his power; but we have both been the sport of
		  <lb/>an adverse destiny to day.</said></p>
	      <p>This answer led to enquires, and an explanation,
		<lb/>which afforded much amusement; and after a cheer­
		<lb/>ful and hearty meal, which received a double relish
		<lb/>from their long abstinence, <persName>Major Atherton</persName> and
		<lb/><persName>Peregrine White</persName> commenced their evenings walk.
		<lb/>Pursuing their way at a brisk pace, in spite of the
		<lb/>formidable obstacles, which they encountered at
		<lb/>every step in the shape of log bridges, half burnt
		<lb/>stumps, and straggling underwood, they at length,
		<lb/>approached the house of <persName>Captain Standish</persName>, long
		<lb/>visible from the bright unsteady light which stream­
		<lb/>ed from the windows, discovering the comforts with­
		<pb n="077"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="7(3)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">77</mw>
		<lb/>in, and promising rest to their weary feet. The
		<lb/>cheerful voice of the Captain greeted them as they
		<lb/>entered.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>Ah my lads, have you come at last? I waited
		  <lb/>for you till <persName>Alexander</persName> and the dogs growled for
		  <lb/>hunger, and now the beasts have just swallowed
		  <lb/>the very last bone.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>The bones of my partridges, I suppose,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Peregrine</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>Here is some beer to refresh you,</said> continued
		<lb/>the Captain, <said>as good as you could find brewed in
		  <lb/><placeName>London</placeName> itself; and you shall not go to bed without
		  <lb/>eating, after a days march in the wilderness. It
		  <lb/>will be lean quarters, indeed, if our larder cannot
		  <lb/>furnish something for you.</said></p>
	      <p><said>This delicious beverage is sufficient,</said> said <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName>, as he returned the foaming tankard; <said>we sup­
		  <lb/>ped at the Governor's, and too heartily to wish
		  <lb/>for any thing more to-night.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I need not ask if you had good luck in the
		  <lb/>woods to-day,</said> said the Captain, <said><persName>Alexander</persName><lb/>brought home a load of birds that I should not be
		  <lb/>ashamed to own myself; the boy knows how to
		  <lb/>take a good aim with his gun, better than most
		  <lb/>lads of his age.</said></p>
	      <p><said>A good aim with his heels! the poltroon, to run
		  <lb/>off with what do'nt belong to him,</said> cried the indig­
		<lb/>nant <persName>Peregrine</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>Not belong to me!</said> said <persName>Alexander</persName>, at that in­
		<lb/>stant thrusting his head into the door, <said>did'nt I

		  <lb/>leave your partridges broiling on the coals, and
		  <lb/>bring away only my own and <persName>Hobamock's</persName>?</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>Broiling, burning you mean, you mischievous
		  <lb/>imp! what did you leave us but cinders and black
		  <lb/>coals?</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>I do'nt know,</said> returned <persName>Alexander</persName>, coolly;
		<lb/><said>those that I eat relished very well.</said></p>
	      <p>This answer irritated <persName>Peregrine</persName> beyond all
		<lb/>bounds; and springing over a table that stood be­
		<lb/>tween them, and which he overset, extinguishing
		<lb/>the candles in its fall, he pursued the flying <persName>Alex­
		  <lb/>ander</persName>, from the room and house. <persName>Captain Stan­
		  <lb/>dish</persName> stood in amazement, and almost total dark­
		<lb/>ness, till <persName>Atherton</persName> rekindled the lights by the de­
		<lb/>caying embers, which lingered in the chimney
		<lb/>corner, and related the events that had given rise
		<lb/>to so unexpected a scene. The Captain, who re­
		<lb/>lished such jests exceedingly, had scarcely finished
		<lb/>laughing, when the objects of his mirth returned
		<lb/>amicably together, <persName>Peregrine</persName> declaring that the
		<lb/>delinquent had sued for pardon, though the roguish
		<lb/>expression of <persName>Alexander's</persName> countenance, showed any
		<lb/>thing rather than repentance for his offence.</p>
	      <p><said>Have a care, boys, have a care,</said> said the Cap­
		<lb/>tain, shaking his head, with mock gravity; <said>or
		  <lb/>we shall have fine work with your fallings out,
		  <lb/>by and bye. The next thing, I suppose, we shall
		  <lb/>see sword and dagger flourishing about your heads,
		  <lb/>and you know the end of that, <persName>Master Peregrine</persName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>To kill, or be killed, I should think it likely,</said><lb/>said <persName>Peregrine</persName>.</p>

	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">79</mw>
	      <p>
		<said>No, no, we do'nt suffer things to proceed to
		  <lb/>such extremities, in our well-ordered colony; we
		  <lb/>shall cut short the matter by tying your head and
		  <lb/>feet together, and putting you on short commons
		  <lb/>for a time.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>A summary mode of justice,</said> observed <persName>Atherton</persName>,
		<lb/><said rend="pre()">and a truly novel invention.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is of seventeen years standing, and of ap­
		  <lb/>proved efficacy,</said> said the Captain. <said>You must
		  <lb/>know, cousin <persName>Atherton</persName>, some of our Company's
		  <lb/>servants began to be unruly, when they first came
		  <lb/>to this new land, and thought themselves beyond
		  <lb/>reach of the laws; so two of them quarrelled, and
		  <lb/>challenged each other to single combat; they were
		  <lb/>both slightly wounded, but we saw fit to make an
		  <lb/>example of them, that our peace might not in future
		  <lb/>be disturbed by the foolish brawls of every coward­
		  <lb/>ly knave. We ordered them to be bent up like
		  <lb/>bows, their neck and heels strapped together, and
		  <lb/>so to lie twenty-four hours, without meat or drink;
		  <lb/>but they made humble concessions, and promises
		  <lb/>of amendment; and their masters interceded so
		  <lb/>earnestly in their behalf, that they were released;
		  <lb/>and I can tell you, the offence has never been re­
		  <lb/>peated by any one.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It was certainly a very suitable punishment,</said><lb/>returned <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>considering the rank of the
		  <lb/>offenders.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is suitable to any rank,</said> said the Captain;
		<lb/><said>our laws, thank Heaven, are impartial, and both
		  <lb/>magistrates and people are amenable to them; and
		  <pb n="080"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="7(4)v"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">80</mw>
		  <lb/>happily, our code does not admit the barbarous
		  <lb/>practice of cutting one another to pieces in cold
		  <lb/>blood.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is seldom done in <emph>cold</emph> blood, I believe,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>, smiling; <said>and, in a country like this, I
		  <lb/>should imagine one would seldom be obliged to have
		  <lb/>recourse to such fatal measures, to wip away an
		  <lb/>offence.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Neither in this, or any other country;</said> per­
		<lb/>sisted the Captain, <said>I am a military man, as well
		  <lb/>as yourself, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>; and no one can say
		  <lb/>I ever shrunk from the fight, when God and my
		  <lb/>king called me to arms; but I do believe no man
		  <lb/>who is not led away by the suggestions of the
		  <lb/>devil, will draw upon himself the guilt and infamy
		  <lb/>of murdering a fellow-being, or shedding his own
		  <lb/>blood, in a contemptible and idle quarrel.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I would not justify the practice,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>;
		<lb/><said>I most sincerely regret that custom has so long
		  <lb/>sanctioned it, and that so many, who seemed born
		  <lb/>for better things, are unhappily sacrificed to the
		  <lb/>laws of honour.</said></p>
	      <p><said><emph>Honour!</emph></said> repeated the Captain indignantly,
		<lb/><said>is it <emph>honourable</emph> to despise the laws of God? to
		  <lb/>tear asunder the most sacred ties of humanity?
		  <lb/>Is it <emph>honourable</emph> to place your life at the hazard of
		  <lb/>a scoundrel's weapon, or by taking his, to set
		  <lb/>upon your forehead the mark of <persName>Cain</persName>, and bear
		  <lb/>forever on your conscience, the stain of blood?</said></p>
	      <p><said>I acknowledge the justice of your arguments,</said><lb/>replied <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>but there are few men, who
		  <pb n="081"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="7(5)r"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">81</mw>
		  <lb/>can bear the imputation of cowardice, or who have
		  <lb/>independence enough to set at defiance the opinion
		  <lb/>of the world; or to endure its ridicule, even when
		  <lb/>conscious that their conduct is upright.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And who is the bravest man,</said> asked the Cap­
		<lb/>tain, <said>he who can despise the opinion of the world,
		  <lb/>—when that world is enlisted on the side of vice
		  <lb/>and folly,—and firmly obey the dictates of his duty
		  <lb/>and conscience, or he, who like a wavering pol­
		  <lb/>troon, yields to the dread of ridicule, and quietly
		  <lb/>submits to be led by the very fools, who pity and
		  <lb/>condemn him. No, no, <persName>Edward Atherton</persName>, that
		  <lb/>man must be at his wits ends, who seeks to regain
		  <lb/>a character in the world, or hopes to establish a
		  <lb/>reputation for bravery, by such cowardly expe­
		  <lb/>dients.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You have reason on your side of the question,
		  <lb/>Sir,</said> replied <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>and I hope the good prin­
		  <lb/>ciples of this new world will effectually exclude

	      <p><persName rend="case(smallcaps)">Major Atherton</persName> embraced the earliest oppor­
		<lb/>tunity, which the unwearied attentions of his host
		<lb/>left at his own disposal to visit his warm-hearted
		<lb/>friend, <persName>Captain Martin</persName>, whose ship was still at
		<lb/>anchor in the <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> harbour. <persName>Captain Standish</persName>
		<lb/>excused himself from attending him; for the labours
		<lb/>of a plentiful harvest required his attention; during
		<lb/>a period of repose from military duty, he had <quote>beat
		  <lb/>his sword into a plough-share,</quote> and with charac­
		<lb/>teristic activity and ardour, engaged in the pursuits
		<lb/>of agriculture.</p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName>, for the first time, left to range alone
		<lb/>through the woods, which he had only passed in the
		<lb/>obscurity of evening, was continually in danger of
		<lb/>leaving the beaten pathway in many places, nearly
		<lb/>filled by withered leaves, for the diverging tracks
		<lb/>which led in various directions, into the depths of
		<lb/>the forest, and sometimes terminated in a cleared
		<lb/>spot, where the log hut of the settler, or the blue
		<lb/>smoke curling from its <mcr>wooden</mcr> chimney, broke upon
		<lb/>the eye of the solitary pedestrian, conveying images
		<lb/>of comfort and repose, and softening the savage
		<lb/>wildness of the scene.</p>

	      <p>But the sagacity of his dog, who gambolled around
		<lb/>his feet; and in cases of difficulty, was sure to scent
		<lb/>out the right path; at length conducted him to the
		<lb/>broader highway, which led into the chief settle­
		<lb/>ment of <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, where the animal seemed quite
		<lb/>at home, and with curled tail and erect ears, pro­
		<lb/>ceeded at a very grave dog-trot, on his accustomed
		<lb/>rout towards the house of <persName>Mr. Winslow</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>This way, <name>Rover</name>,</said> said <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, turn­
		<lb/>ing in a nearer direction to the water's edge; and
		<lb/>another moment brought him to the well-remem­
		<lb/>bered residence of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>. The house cer­
		<lb/>tainly did not display any architectural elegance;
		<lb/>but <persName>Atherton</persName> remarked it as one of the largest and
		<lb/>best in the village. A peculiar air of neatness
		<lb/>seemed diffused around it, which evinced the com­
		<lb/>petence and good-management of its possessor. It
		<lb/>stood on a green bank, which, sloping to the south­
		<lb/>ern sun, still preserved a fresh and cheerful ver­
		<lb/>dure, and was half hid by a venerable oak, that
		<lb/>embraced it, in a shelter of its wide-spreading
		<lb/>branches. It was enclosed by a slight wooden
		<lb/>paling, and some tasteful hand had twined the
		<lb/>flexile branches of the sweetbriar around the win­
		<lb/>dows, and reared the wild-rose to breathe its sweet­
		<lb/>ness beside the door. In rear of the building was
		<lb/>a garden of esculent roots and herbs, with a small
		<lb/>orchard of fruit trees, and extensive fields of corn
		<lb/>and other grain.</p>
	      <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> scrutinized every object, as he
		<lb/>leisurely approached the house; but no person was
		<pb n="084"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="7(6)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">84</mw>
		<lb/>visible till he had nearly reached the little gate,
		<lb/>which led through the enclosure, when the door
		<lb/>unexpectedly opened, and <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, with a
		<lb/>smiling face, sprang lightly from its steps upon
		<lb/>the velvet turf. She did not observe him; but,
		<lb/>stooping down, seemed busied in training her rose-
		<lb/>bushes; and <persName>Atherton</persName> ventured to pause an instant
		<lb/>to admire the grace of her attitudes, and the love­
		<lb/>liness of her figure. Without perceiving it <persName>Miriam
		  <lb/>Grey</persName> had dropped a knot of ribands, that was
		<lb/>eagerly seized upon by a frisking kitten, which
		<lb/>bounded after her mistress, and forthwith began to
		<lb/>toss it high in air, and unmercifully twist it around
		<lb/>whatever came in contact with it.</p>
	      <p>But <name>Rover</name>, who held his eye fixed on his heredi­
		<lb/>tary enemy, could not long brook her insulting
		<lb/>mirth, and set up a bark of defiance, which at once
		<lb/>changed the frolic of her face into gaze of fear
		<lb/>and aversion, her mottled back rose with astonish­
		<lb/>ing dignity; and retreating a few steps she stood
		<lb/>on the defensive, elevating one paw to retain
		<lb/>the riband; but a second and fiercer shout from
		<lb/><name>Rover</name> drove her within the door, with a portentous
		<lb/>growl, where she remained secure; her dilated
		<lb/>eyes and long whiskers occasionally protruded
		<lb/>from her lurking place, to ascertain the movements
		<lb/>of the enemy. The dog was about to leap the
		<lb/>wicket in pursuit of her, when the voice and well-
		<lb/>known whistle of his master recalled him; and, at
		<lb/>the same time attracted the attention of <persName>Miriam
		  <lb/>Grey</persName>. She started in confusion and blushed deep­
		<pb n="085"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="8(1)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">85</mw>
		<lb/>ly at finding herself so closely observed. <persName>Major
		  <lb/>Atherton</persName> bowed, and passed on; but could not
		<lb/>refrain from turning his head to look back at her;
		<lb/>she was at the moment examining her disfigured
		<lb/>riband, and then patting her affrighted pet, retired
		<lb/>into the house and closed the door.</p>
	      <p><said>What is the matter with you, <persName>Miriam</persName>?</said> en­
		<lb/>quired <persName>Lois Grey</persName>, as her cousin entered the room,
		<lb/>where she was sitting, with a few female visitors:
		<lb/><said>has any thing alarmed you?</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>Nothin in the world, <persName>Lois</persName>; but see my beauti­
		  <lb/>ful ribands, which were the pride of my new cap,
		  <lb/>and now they are quite spoiled.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>It is a mere trifle, <persName>Miriam</persName>; but you are always
		  <lb/><emph>so</emph> heedless.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Dear cousin, you must blame my mischievous
		  <lb/>kitten. I would not care,</said> she added in a lower
		<lb/>tone, <said>but I have been saving them so long to grace
		  <lb/>your wedding, <persName>Lois</persName>!</said></p>
	      <p><said>Nonsense!</said> said <persName>Lois</persName>, quickly; <said>give me the
		  <lb/>knot, <persName>Miriam</persName>; you think me ingenious, and, per­
		  <lb/>haps, I can make it look tolerable again.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Such worldly vanities,</said> observed an elderly
		<lb/>female, <said>are empty and unsatisfying as the wind:
		  <lb/>and I do fear, <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, that your heart is too
		  <lb/>much bound up in them.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Not my heart, good <persName>mistress Gilbert</persName>,</said> returned
		<lb/>the damsel, <said>these vanities reach no further than
		  <lb/>my head, and sometimes touch only the outside of
		  <lb/>that.</said></p>

	      <p><said>They are all relics of popery,</said> replied the oth­
		<lb/>er, <said>we read, that the heathenish <name>Egyptians</name> were
		  <lb/>decked out in ornaments of gold, and goodly appa­
		  <lb/>rel, and were they not fearfully punished for their
		  <lb/>idolatry?</said></p>
	      <p><said>Yet,</said> returned <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>the <name>Israelites</name> borrow­
		  <lb/>ed these same ornaments for their own use, and
		  <lb/>were permitted to carry them from the land of
		  <lb/><placeName>Egypt</placeName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And the Lord gave them up to their wicked
		  <lb/>imaginations,</said> replied the dame, <said>and they made a
		  <lb/>golden calf in the wilderness and bowed down be­
		  <lb/>fore it, and worshipped it.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>Well, <persName>Mistress Gilbert</persName>, I cannot make a calf
		  <lb/>of this poor knot of ribands; and I am sure nobody
		  <lb/>will ever admire it now.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><persName>Miriam Grey</persName> rose from her seat, as she finished
		<lb/>speaking, and the brief pause which ensued, was
		<lb/>broken by a female, somewhat past the bloom of
		<lb/>youth, who was looking earnestly from a window.</p>
	      <p><said>Was not that the stranger they call <persName>Major
		    <lb/>Atherton</persName>,</said> she asked, <said>who past just as you left
		  <lb/>the door, <persName>Miriam</persName>?</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>I believe it was the same.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>He has left the crag then,</said> whispered <persName>Lois
		  <lb/>Grey</persName>, to her cousin; <said>I thought the blue knot gave
		  <lb/>you an unusual colour.</said></p>
	      <p><said>That must be the youth whom they say is near
		  <lb/>akin to our Captain,</said> observed another female, who
		<lb/>had remained silent in a corner until her compa­
		<lb/>nions began to imagine she had fallen asleep, or
		<lb/>gone into a trance.</p>

	      <p><said>It is,</said> said <persName>Lois Grey</persName>; <said>he arrived here during
		  <lb/>his kinsman's absence, and the Governor entertain­
		  <lb/>ed him in his own house, till <persName>Captain Standish</persName> re­
		  <lb/>turned from the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>.  It is said he is
		  <lb/>courteous and well-disposed.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And yet,</said> resumed the spinster, <said>he has a
		  <lb/>strange way of staring with his eyes; he looked
		  <lb/>so bold at the window as he passed, I was fain to
		  <lb/>turn away.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Indeed!</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName> gravely, though her
		<lb/>brow slightly curved, <said>he was probably admiring
		  <lb/>the view.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I wonder what has brought him to this coun­
		  <lb/>try,</said> said <persName>Lois Grey</persName>; <said>he does not seem of our
		  <lb/>religion, and has been in the service of the king.</said></p>
	      <p>The female whose silence rendered her quite a
		<lb/>prodigy in the group, answered in a mysterious
		<lb/>tone.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>They <emph>do</emph> say that he is a papist, sent over by the
		  <lb/>queen to spy out the <quote>nakedness of the land,</quote> as
		  <lb/>scripture hath it; by which I mean, to watch the
		  <lb/>chosen people of this country, to whom the rulers
		  <lb/>of the kingdom bear no good will.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>I cannot believe that,</said> said the spinster; <said>such
		  <lb/>a comely and well-favoured youth!</said> for like most
		<lb/>maidens, even old ones, her feelings balanced in
		<lb/>favour of a handsome young man.</p>
	      <p><said>The Lord forgive him, if it is so,</said> cried <persName>Mis­
		<lb/>stress Gilbert</persName>, with uplifted eyes; <said>and now I think
		  <lb/>of it, did you see how he stood at the meeting,
		  <lb/>when he first went in, with his face covered, pray­
		  <lb/>ing to himself, as it were?</said></p>
	      <pb n="088"/>

	      <p><said>He is, probably, of <orgName>the church of <placeName>England</placeName></orgName>,</said><lb/>said <persName>Lois Grey</persName>; <said>and that is one of its forms.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is an evil form, which savoureth of the mark
		  <lb/>of the beast,</said> returned <persName>Mistress Gilbert</persName>; <said>and I do
		  <lb/>much marvel, that our worthy Governor could
		  <lb/>harbour such an one in his family.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And,</said> resumed the silent one, who seemed sud­
		<lb/>denly inspired, <said>his hair was like unto <persName>Absalom's</persName>,
		  <lb/>falling over his neck and forehead to please the
		  <lb/>eyes of the vain and worldly.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is an awful thing,</said> said <persName>Mistress Gilbert</persName>, <said>to
		  <lb/>see young people given up to follow the devices of
		  <lb/>the sons of <persName>Belial</persName>. Now I think, <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>,
		  <lb/>that worthy <persName>Master Ashly</persName> is an example to our
		  <lb/>youths: it does one good to see how closely his hair
		  <lb/>is clipped.</said></p>
	      <p><said>His head certainly contains very little,</said> replied
		<lb/><persName>Miriam</persName>, with the utmost gravity.</p>
	      <p><said>That it does not,</said> returned the dame, <said>there is
		  <lb/>not on it a hair more than our godly ministers have
		  <lb/>in their pulpits and assemblies thought proper to
		  <lb/>recommend.</said></p>
	      <p><said>True,</said> answered <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>it is as smooth and
		  <lb/>round as a green pumpkin.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And it is edifying,</said> continued the other, <said>to hear
		  <lb/>him prophesy in our meetings; his <quote>words are like
		    <lb/>arrows,</quote> and they enter into the <quote>bones and mar­
		    <lb/>row.</quote></said></p>
	      <p><said>They are apt to stick long in the ear,</said> observed
		<lb/>the damsel.</p>
	      <p><said>Yes,</said> replied <persName>Mistress Gilbert</persName>, <said>he is gifted
		  <pb n="089"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="8(3)r"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">89</mw>
		  <lb/>with a spirit of utterance; and it is thought that if
		  <lb/>one of our pious deacons should be called to <quote>put off
		    <lb/>his fleshly tabernacle,</quote> he would be chosen to <quote>fill
		    <lb/>up the breach.</quote></said></p>
	      <p><said>May our worthy deacons be long continued to
		  <lb/>us,</said> said <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, <said>that our churches may
		  <lb/>have peace and be edified.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>We must leave the event to Providence, <persName>Miriam
		    <lb/>Grey</persName>; but as the aged <persName>Eli</persName> waxed in years, the peo­
		  <lb/>ple cast their eyes upon young <persName>Samuel</persName> to minister
		  <lb/>in his place.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Your doctrine savours of worldly wisdom, <persName>Mis­
		    <lb/>tress Gilbert</persName>.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>God forbid,</said> ejaculated the dame, <said>that our spi­
		  <lb/>ritual concerns should have ought to do with the
		  <lb/>affairs of this transitory state.</said></p>
	      <p>Their dialogue was here interrupted by the sound
		<lb/>of approaching footsteps, and the subject of their
		<lb/>conversation after a preparatory hem, and a slight
		<lb/>scraping of his feet, entered the apartment. The
		<lb/>female visitors exchanged knowing looks, and then
		<lb/>fixed their eyes on <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, probably to dis­
		<lb/>cover from her countenance what effect the unex­
		<lb/>pected appearance of her guest might produce upon
		<lb/>her feelings; and her easy and unembarrassed man­
		<lb/>ner evidently perplexed them. <persName>Mr. Ashly</persName> paid
		<lb/>his respects to the company with great civility, re­
		<lb/>serving his last bow for <persName>Miriam</persName>, and perhaps in­
		<lb/>tending it for his best; but by one of those unlucky
		<lb/>chances that often defeat our favourite projects, it
		<lb/>proved particularly awkward; a circumstance,

		<lb/>which not only excited a slight smile on the lips of
		<lb/>the damsel, but likewise covered the young man
		<lb/>with confusion, who plunged into the nearest chair
		<lb/>and thrice crossed his legs before he could assume
		<lb/>a comfortable position.</p>
	      <p><persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName> had long been considered the
		<lb/>lover of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>; nor did he ever deny his
		<lb/>pretensions, though he had not as yet been able to
		<lb/>extort from the maiden a word or look to support
		<lb/>them; while her alternate reserve and playful fa­
		<lb/>miliarity kept him in a state of anxious suspense.
		<lb/>Still he was encouraged by the kindness of her fa­
		<lb/>ther, who openly favoured his suit; and unable to
		<lb/>command sufficient resolution to learn his destiny
		<lb/>from her own lips, he remained the prey of doubt
		<lb/>and distrust; and with the diffidence which sincere
		<lb/>affection invariably produces on a timid mind, his
		<lb/>wish to please, and dread of offending, continually
		<lb/>embarrassed him, and destroyed the advantages he
		<lb/>might otherwise have acquired in the eyes of his
		<lb/>mistress. His person and countenance were na­
		<lb/>turally rather agreeable than otherwise, though the
		<lb/>puritanical cut of his head, which <persName>Mistress Gilbert</persName>
		<lb/>so highly commended, was certainly unbecoming;
		<lb/>and the excessive gravity of his features present­
		<lb/>ed a strong and almost absurd contrast to their
		<lb/>youthful appearance. Educated in the strict­
		<lb/>est manner of his sect, he was early taught to con­
		<lb/>sider an outward conformity to its prescribed forms,
		<lb/>of essential importance; and though really upright
		<lb/>in conduct and sincere in his professions, the bigo­
		<pb n="091"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="8(4)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">91</mw>
		<lb/>try of his principles had tended to narrow his in­
		<lb/>tellect, and prematurely to destroy the vivacity and
		<lb/>cheerfulness of youth.</p>
	      <p><said>Here is my father's elbow chair, will you take
		  <lb/>it, <persName>Mr. <choice><sic>Ashley</sic><corr>Ashly</corr></choice></persName>?</said> said <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, rising with
		<lb/>alacrity, and really anxious to dispel his embar­
		<lb/>rassment.</p>
	      <p><said>Thank you, <persName>Miriam</persName>;</said> and he settled into it
		<lb/>with a grateful look, and a smile reflected from her
		<lb/>own countenance, <said>I hope,</said> he added, <said>the good man
		  <lb/>is well!</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>Quite well, but very busy; our loaded corn­
		  <lb/>fields require much labour, and he has yet to prepare
		  <lb/>for his intended voyage.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said><persName>Captain Martin</persName> will sail shortly, I understand,</said><lb/>observed <persName>Mr. Ashly</persName>; <said>the departure of your fa­
		  <lb/>ther, <persName>Miriam</persName>, will remove a candlestick from our
		  <lb/>temple.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Do not speak of it, <persName>Mr. Ashly</persName>: I cannot yet en­
		  <lb/>dure the thought of a separation from him,</said>—and
		<lb/><persName>Miriam</persName> bent her head to conceal a tear, which she
		<lb/>in vain struggled to suppress.</p>
	      <p><said>He is in the keeping of One, who will never for­
		  <lb/>sake those who put their trust in him,</said> said the
		<lb/>youth, in a softened voice: <said>and you have many
		  <lb/>friends, <persName>Miriam</persName>, to comfort you during his brief
		  <lb/>absence.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I do not indulge in idle fears for his safety,</said> re­
		<lb/>turned <persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>but if I might be allowed to share

	      <p><said>And would you leave me alone, and in solitude?</said><lb/>asked <persName>Lois Grey</persName>, reproachfully.</p>

		  <lb/>society is far dearer to you than mine can be.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Miriam</persName> spoke in a low voice, which however
		<lb/>reached the ears of the spinster, who was remark­
		<lb/>ably acute in detecting sounds of mysterious im­
		<lb/>port.</p>
	      <p><said>I thought,</said> she said, <said>something like that would

	      <p><said>Are you speaking of a wedding, <persName>Rebecca Spin­
		    <lb/>dle</persName></said> asked <persName>Mistress Gilbert</persName>. <said>Well, you need

		  <lb/>institution, and wisely ordained for the happiness
		  <lb/>of mankind, as it is written, <quote>it is not good for man
		    <lb/>to be alone.</quote></said></p>
	      <p><said>That is as people choose to think, <persName>Mistress Gil­

		  <lb/>a wedded state. But I would not blame you, <persName>Mis­
		  <lb/>tress Lois</persName>, for holding a different mind.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Perhaps our opinions on the subject, are not so
		  <lb/>very different;</said> said <persName>Lois</persName>, smiling. <said>But do you
		  <lb/>know, <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName>, if any passengers go out
		  <lb/>in the ship with my uncle.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>I have heard of none; but there was a young
		  <lb/>gentleman, a kinsman of <persName>Captain Standish</persName>, came
		  <lb/>hither in her, as I am informed to view the coun­
		  <lb/>try; perchance, he may be ready to return at that
		  <lb/>time.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>I wish he may,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>my father would
		  <lb/>find much pleasure in the society of an agreeable
		  <lb/>companion.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Do you know aught of him,</said> asked <persName>Mr. Ashly</persName>,
		<lb/>in an anxious tone.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>Nothing, but our Governor commends his
		  <lb/>courtesy and polite accomplishments, and his coun­
		  <lb/>tenance speaks well for him.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>You have seen him, then,</said> rejoined <persName>Master
		  <lb/>Ashly</persName>.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>By chance only, once or twice; but I think he
		  <lb/>can hardly have satisfied his curiosity yet, in look­
		  <lb/>ing at this new world.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>He is a son of the church,</said> observed <persName>Mistress
		<lb/>Gilbert</persName>, <said>and what lot or portion can he have in
		  <lb/>our favoured <placeName>Zion</placeName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Churchman or not, he is certainly a most
		  <lb/>comely looking young gentleman,</said> said <persName>Mistress
		<lb/>Spindle</persName>, whose thoughts evidently reverted with
		<lb/>pleasure to the handsome stranger.</p>

		  <lb/>that the <quote>Lord looketh at the heart;</quote> these time

	      <p>
		<said>The Lord forgive you, <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>! I should
		  <lb/>have expected the child of one, so godly and gifted
		  <lb/>as thy father is, would have too much regard for
		  <lb/>our privileged mode of worship which, as our
		  <lb/>minister hath it, is derived from the apostles them­
		  <lb/>selves, and the rites of the primitive church, and
		  <lb/>is the only sure method of salvation, to be up­
		  <lb/>holding the vain superfluities of these disciples of
		  <lb/>Antichrist.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>I can value my own privileges and opinions,
		  <lb/><persName>Mistress Gilbert</persName>, and yet have some charity for
		  <lb/>those who differ from me. I doubt not there are

		    <lb/><placeName>England</placeName></orgName>.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>It may be so,</said> returned <persName>Mistress Gilbert</persName>, with
		<lb/>an incredulous shake of the head, <said>I would not be
		  <lb/>uncharitable; but there are older and wiser ones
		  <lb/>than you, child, who believe them to have gone
		  <lb/>clean astray from the word, following the devices of
		  <lb/><persName>Balaam</persName> son of <persName>Beor</persName>, who loved the wages of ini­

		<lb/>ing a hesitating look at <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>I think, <persName>Mistress
		    <lb/>Gilbert</persName> is very able in her reference to the scrip­
		  <lb/>tures, which are in truth our only sure guides;
		  <lb/>and my poor memory might furnish me with di­
		  <lb/>vers illustrations of what she hath spoken there­
		  <lb/>from—but, but,</said> he stopped abruptly; for the eye
		<lb/>of <persName>Miriam</persName> was fixed upon him, and he found it
		<lb/>impossible to withdraw his gaze from the face,
		<lb/>whose arch expression completely disconcerted
		<lb/>him; but at length relieved by a fit of coughing,
		<lb/>he ventured to proceed.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>I believe we can no where find any foundation,
		  <lb/>for the <rs type="properAdjective">Popish</rs> custom of reading prayers from a
		  <lb/>printed book, which must have been a conceit and
		  <lb/>invention of the evil one, to save careless and
		  <lb/>worldly-minded men, the trouble of composing, and
		  <lb/>digesting their own thoughts; neither can I find
		  <lb/>the custom of kneeling to repeat such prayers,
		  <lb/>authorized in the pages of Holy Writ; and I know
		  <lb/>not by what arguments you can seek to uphold
		  <lb/>it, <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>You entirely mistake me, <persName>Master Ashly</persName>,</said> re­
		<lb/>turned <persName>Miriam</persName>. <said>Heaven forbid that I should seek
		  <lb/>to justify the errors and superstitions of a church,
		  <lb/>which has loaded with calumny and persecution,
		  <lb/>those who presumed to differ from her, in forms
		  <lb/>and faith; or that I should cease to prize, far
		  <lb/>above every earthly blessing, the pure and simple
		  <lb/>worship, which our fathers have established in this

		  <lb/>ease and comfort, endured the scorn of enemies,
		  <lb/>the reproach of friends, and the loss of all, that
		  <lb/>the world esteems most dear and desirable. No,</said>
		<lb/>she added, with energy, <said>the daughter of a de­
		  <lb/>voted, self-denying <name>christian</name>, of one, who forsook
		  <lb/>fortune, kindred, and country, to plant the truth,
		  <lb/>and establish a <rs type="properAdjective">christian</rs> church and colony, in an
		  <lb/>unknown savage land, would not exchange her
		  <lb/>proud title, to become the jewelled empress of a
		  <lb/>world.</said> <persName>Mr. Ashly</persName> regarded the glowing counte­
		<lb/>nance of the maiden, with mingled awe and admi­
		<lb/>ration; but quickly resuming her usual playful­
		<lb/>ness of manner, she continued;</p>
	      <p>
		<said>I did not intend to enter the lists of contro­
		  <lb/>versy, with you, <persName>Mr. Ashly</persName>; and I crave your par­
		  <lb/>don, <persName>Mistress Gilbert</persName>, you were speaking of <persName>Major
		    <lb/>Atherton</persName>.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Yes, but I am sure I know no harm of the
		  <lb/>youth, apart from his false doctrines, of which,
		  <lb/>may he have grace given him to repent and turn
		  <lb/>away from; and I do in truth, wish him well, for
		  <lb/>the sake of his kinsman, our brave Captain.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Our Captain,</said> said <persName>Rebecca Spindle</persName>, <said>was him­
		  <lb/>self once of the church, and don't you remember,
		  <lb/><persName>Mistress Gilbert</persName>, when we first came over from
		  <lb/><placeName>Holland</placeName>, I was then but a child, as it were, that
		  <lb/>there were some, who thought he was not over
		  <lb/>sparing of <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> blood.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Yes I do;</said> returned the other, <said>they were wild
		  <lb/>savages, to be sure, who had no bowels of mercy
		  <lb/>in them; but they had souls to be saved, as well
		  <pb n="097"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="9(1)r"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">97</mw>
		  <lb/>as ourselves; and as that man of God, <persName>Mr. Robin­
		    <lb/>son</persName>,—the like of whom, I fear, will not rise up
		  <lb/>again in our <name>Israel</name>. As he wrote from <placeName>Leyden</placeName> to
		  <lb/>our church of <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, in the grief of his right­
		  <lb/>eous spirit, <quote>he would that they had converted
		    <lb/>some, before they had killed any.</quote></said></p>
	      <p><said>I am afraid,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>that none of us would
		  <lb/>have been left alive, either to kill or convert them,
		  <lb/>if he had waited their time. No, our Captain is a
		  <lb/>good man, as well as brave and fearless; as my
		  <lb/>father says, he is one who <quote>chose to suffer afflic­
		    <lb/>tion with the people of God,</quote> and <quote>through faith
		    <lb/>wax valiant in fight, and turn to flight the armies
		    <lb/>of the aliens.</quote></said></p>
	      <p><said>And his young kinsman has been long in the
		  <lb/>king's army, I understand,</said> said <persName>Lois Grey</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>I thought as much,</said> observed <persName>Mistress Spindle</persName>,
		<lb/><said>he has such an upright carriage, and moves so
		  <lb/>straight and easy, though he did twist aside, some­
		  <lb/>what, to look into this window.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And is it not strange,</said> remarked <persName>Mistress Gil­
		  <lb/>bert</persName>, <said>that a reasonable creature, who has been
		  <lb/>safely brought over the yawning deep, where he
		  <lb/>has seen the wonders of the Lord, should not
		  <lb/>render public thanks in the tabernacle for his
		  <lb/>goodness? I wonder, that, like <name>Pharaoh</name> and his
		  <lb/>host, he was not overturned in the sea, or, as
		  <lb/>another <persName>Jonah</persName>, swallowed by a monster of the
		  <lb/>floods?</said></p>
	      <p><said>Probably it is not the custom of his church,</said><lb/>said <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>.</p>

	      <p><said>Very likely,</said> returned the dame, <said>I doubt they
		  <lb/>are sparing of their offerings; these children of an
		  <lb/>idolatrous and polluted church;—but when do our
		  <lb/>chosen people delay to put up a note, to ask the
		  <lb/>prayers of the congregation in seasons of mercy
		  <lb/>or affliction?</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is, doubtless, a scriptural and edifying prac­
		  <lb/>tice,</said> rejoined <persName>Mr. Ashly</persName>, <said>for it is a good thing to
		  <lb/>give thanks unto the Lord, and praise is comely in
		  <lb/>his eyes.</said></p>
	      <p><said>If the heart is sincere,</said> observed <persName>Lois</persName>, <said>our ig­
		  <lb/>norance of forms will doubtless be forgiven.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Lois Grey</persName>, had at that moment put the finishing
		<lb/>stroke to her cousin's knot of ribands, which form­
		<lb/>ed the principal ornament to a new cap, of more
		<lb/>courtly fashion, than was usually thought consis­
		<lb/>tent with the extreme simplicity of dress, at that
		<lb/>time adopted by the <name>Puritans</name>; and, in the height
		<lb/>of her surprise and pleasure at its renovated
		<lb/>beauty, <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> forgot the recent reproof of
		<lb/><persName>Mistress Gilbert</persName>, and, flying to the looking glass,
		<lb/>began to arrange it on her head. The whole as­
		<lb/>sembly was mute during this proceeding. <persName>Mis­
		<lb/>tress Gilbert</persName> looked at her, with the air of one
		<lb/>who considered any farther words on the subject, as
		<lb/><quote rend="pre(‘)post(’)">pearls cast before swine;</quote> the silent female nodded
		<lb/>as usual; <persName>Rebecca Spindle</persName> watched her with curi­
		<lb/>osity, <persName>Lois Grey</persName>, with some interest; and the
		<lb/>quick eye of <persName>Miriam</persName> detected the figure of <persName>Mr.
		  <lb/>Ashly</persName> reflected in the mirror, sitting, as he sup­
		<lb/>posed, remote from her observation, and regarding

		<lb/>her with undisguised admiration. A spice of co­
		<lb/>quetry, perhaps, and what girl of eighteen is <emph>quite</emph>
		<lb/>free from it? induced <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> to push back
		<lb/>the lawn cap, which partly concealed her snowy
		<lb/>brow, and leisurely arrange several braids of
		<lb/>glossy brown hair, then carefully adjusting her
		<lb/>new head-gear, she turned suddenly to the abashed
		<lb/>young man, and enquired in a tone of simplicity—</p>
	      <p>
		<said>Do you like it, <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName>.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>I like every thing of thine, <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> he an­
		<lb/>swered in a low voice, and quickly approaching
		<lb/>her, for once forgetful of his habitual reserve――</p>
	      <p><said>That will do, pray sit down again, <persName>Mr. Ashly</persName>,</said><lb/>said the damsel, in a hurried accent, herself com­
		<lb/>pletely abashed by his unexpected manner and
		<lb/>reply, nor had her heightened complexion quite
		<lb/>faded to its usual delicacy, when her father enter­
		<lb/>ed the room.</p>
	      <p><persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, after paying due courtesy to his
		<lb/>guests, approached his daughter, and surveyed her
		<lb/>a moment in silence, with a look of peculiar mean­
		<lb/>ing, which did not at all lessen her confusion.</p>
	      <p><said>What are you looking at, so steadfastly, dear
		  <lb/>father,</said> enquired <persName>Miriam</persName>, turning up her face to
		<lb/>him, perhaps to observe his countenance better, or
		<lb/>it might be, to throw the blue knot into the back
		<lb/>ground; for it was, in truth, the gayest she had
		<lb/>ever ventured to wear.</p>
	      <p><said>It is this which surprises me, <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> return­
		<lb/>ed her father, laying his hand upon the riband,
		<lb/>which at once yielded to his touch.</p>

	      <p>
		<said>Dear father, pray do not crumple it so; indeed,
		  <lb/>you will quite spoil it.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>And is it in a <rs type="properAdjective">christian</rs> assembly, <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>,
		  <lb/>that you would exhibit this vain bauble?</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Any where, no where, if you will spare it, fath­
		  <lb/>er; my kitten has pulled it in pieces once to-day;
		  <lb/>but she did it in sport, and <persName>Lois</persName> has been so kind
		  <lb/>as to repair it for me.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>It is too, too gay,</said> said her father; <said>I would
		  <lb/>not see you, my child decked out in garlands, like
		  <lb/>a victim prepared for sacrifice, or a pagan image
		  <lb/>set up for worship.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>I am sure, father, no one would liken a woman
		  <lb/>to an image, who was within the sound of her
		  <lb/>tongue.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>And where did you get this gaudy thing, <persName>Mi­
		    <lb/>riam</persName>?</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>My aunt sent it me from <placeName>England</placeName>,</said> returned
		<lb/><persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>it came with my new hood and scarf,
		  <lb/>and you remember, that you thought <emph>they</emph> looked
		  <lb/>very brave, at first; but, in a little time, you grew
		  <lb/>familiar with them, and said they would do for a
		  <lb/>giddy young thing like me—now dear father,</said> and
		<lb/>she laid her hand playfully on his arm—<said>my head
		  <lb/>is not much older or wiser than it was then, so I
		  <lb/>think <emph>this</emph> will not displease you, by and bye.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Do you know, <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> resumed <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>,
		<lb/><said>that a law of our land, has enacted fines and
		  <lb/>penalties against those who indulge in costly ap­
		  <lb/>parel and immodest fashions?</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>I remember it well, father; for, at that very
		  <pb n="101"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="9(3)r"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">101</mw>
		  <lb/>time, my kind aunt had given me an embroidered
		  <lb/>'kerchief, which I was compelled to lay aside, till
		  <lb/>it was quite ruined. But I am sure this cap is not
		  <lb/>immodest, and it cost me nothing, but the trouble
		  <lb/>of writing an epistle of thanks.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Your aunt is very mindful of you, <persName>Miriam</persName>; but
		  <lb/>she is apt to forget that <emph>we</emph> have renounced those
		  <lb/>vanities, which allure the worldly to their destruc­
		  <lb/>tion. What says the apostle <persName>Paul</persName> upon the sub­
		  <lb/>ject?</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>I forget the exact words,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>some­
		  <lb/>thing it is about plaiting the hair, and wearing
		  <lb/>goodly apparel.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>Go, learn the passage from your Bible, <persName>Miriam</persName>,
		  <lb/>and I will leave the application to your own con­
		  <lb/>science.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Indeed, I will not wear any thing which is dis­
		  <lb/>pleasing to you, dear father; and, in truth, the
		  <lb/>sacrifice is too trifling to cause one moment's re­
		  <lb/>gret.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Consult your inclinations, my child,</said> returned
		<lb/>her father, <said>I know you would not willingly give
		  <lb/>the world occasion to speak reproachfully of your­
		  <lb/>self or me; and I am only anxious to see you adorn­
		  <lb/>ed with the <quote>ornament of a meek and quiet spirit,</quote>
		  <lb/>which is indeed a <quote>jewel of great price.</quote></said></p>
	      <p>When <persName>Lois Grey</persName> retired to her chamber at night,
		<lb/>she found her cousin busily engaged in twining the
		<lb/>obnoxious ribands around the frame of a small pic­
		<lb/>ture, which ornamented the apartment, represent­
		<lb/>ing a thick waisted <rs type="properAdjective">Dutch</rs> peasant girl, glowing in

		<lb/>the richness of <rs type="properAdjective">Flemish</rs> colours, though divers fear­
		<lb/>ful cracks in the canvass bore undoubted witness
		<lb/>to her great antiquity. <persName>Miriam</persName> turned round with
		<lb/>a smiling countenance as <persName>Lois Grey</persName> entered the
		<lb/>room.</p>
	      <p><said>I am hanging this up for a peace offering, <persName>Lois</persName>,</said><lb/>she said; <said>and I am sure good <persName>Mistress Gilbert</persName>
		  <lb/>herself would not do it with greater pleasure,
		  <lb/>though she might bring forward more texts of scrip­
		  <lb/>ture, than I can, just now, think of, to prove the
		  <lb/>necessity of it.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>Are you <emph>quite</emph> willing, to give it up, <persName>Miriam</persName>?</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Do I look unwilling, <persName>Lois</persName>? no, it is rather gay
		  <lb/>for me, and, on the whole, I think something else
		  <lb/>will look as well for the wedding.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>The wedding seems a great event with you,
		  <lb/><persName>Miriam</persName>; is it because <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName> is to be in­
		  <lb/>vited!</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said><persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName>! good night, <persName>Lois</persName>, I am fast

	      </p>
	      <p>

		<lb/>and, if the testimony of <persName>Mistress Rebecca Spindle</persName>
		<lb/>may be relied on, who related the circumstance,
		<lb/>with an air of mysterious caution, to some half
		<lb/>dozen of wondering female friends, on the following
		<lb/>day—he was seen loitering around the dwelling of
		<lb/><persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, precisely at the hour, when the mu­
		<lb/>sic of the vesper psalm was heard to issue from a
		<lb/>room, where occasionally a figure flitting before the
		<lb/>shaded windows, denoted the family were assembled.</p>
	      <p>Perhaps it was a gossip's story; but, however
		<lb/>that may be, his absence was prolonged, till <persName>Cap­
		  <lb/>tain Standish</persName> became uneasy; and, fearful that he
		<lb/>had missed his way in the forest, dispatched a stout
		<lb/>young man, who served him in various capacities,
		<lb/>both within doors, and without, to search for his
		<lb/>kinsman, and guide him back. But the heart of
		<lb/>the emissary quaked, when he found himself alone,
		<lb/>at the entrance of a forest of lofty trees, so thick­
		<lb/>ly matted, that scarcely a ray of the rising moon
		<lb/>could pierce their foliage; and, after listening with
		<lb/>trembling nerves, till fancy had conjured up a
		<pb n="104"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="9(4)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">104</mw>
		<lb/>thousand terrific sounds, he thought fit to retire
		<lb/>from the danger; and, ashamed to encounter his
		<lb/>master's eye, entered an out-building, and threw
		<lb/>himself on a bundle of straw. There he lay, list­
		<lb/>ening for the returning steps of <persName>Atherton</persName>, as a sig­
		<lb/>nal to sally out; but, unfortunately, long before
		<lb/>they reached his ears, he sunk into a deep slumber,
		<lb/>from which he was, at length, unceremoniously
		<lb/>aroused by a smart blow from the flat side of the
		<lb/>Captain's broad sword, accompanied by the angry
		<lb/>tones of his voice.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>Is this the way you obey my commands, you
		  <lb/>lazy loon?</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>The man started on his feet, simultaneously rub­
		<lb/>bing his eyes, and the shoulder which had received
		<lb/>the blow; and, more alarmed than he had been in
		<lb/>the woods, began to stammer forth an apology.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>I did go, please your honour; but the wolves
		  <lb/>made a fearful howling, and I thought no <rs type="properAdjective">christian</rs>
		  <lb/>man would want me to put myself in their mouths.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>The wolves! you poltroon! no fear that they
		  <lb/>would relish such a cowardly knave; no, no, <persName>Da­
		    <lb/>vid</persName>, even the wild beasts would snuff at thee; they
		  <lb/>love to pick the bones of braver men than thou art.
		  <lb/>But the next time you escape their jaws in this
		  <lb/>way, I'll have you tied to the whipping-post, or put
		  <lb/>in the stocks till your legs ache: so, away with
		  <lb/>you.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><persName>David</persName>, obedient to orders, commenced his re­
		<lb/>treat with as much alacrity, as his illustrious name­
		<lb/>sake evinced, when eluding the javelin of <persName>Saul</persName>;
		<pb n="105"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="9(5)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">105</mw>
		<lb/>but, on the way, he received another stroke, in
		<lb/>the rear, which not a little accelerated his speed.
		<lb/><persName>Captain Standish</persName> and his attendants then left
		<lb/>the building, to which they had been attracted by
		<lb/>observing the dog which followed <persName>David</persName>, lying
		<lb/>at the entrance; where the sonorous music of the
		<lb/>young man's nose betrayed his situation within;
		<lb/>for <persName>Major Atherton</persName> had returned without meeting
		<lb/>him, and the party set out to learn his fate.</p>
	      <p><said>Well, cousin <persName>Atherton</persName>,</said> said <persName>Captain Standish</persName>,
		<lb/>as they rose from breakfast the next morning,
		<lb/><said>since you have not engaged a passage back to
		  <lb/><placeName>England</placeName>, with <persName>Captain Martin</persName>, I conclude you in­
		  <lb/>tend to winter amongst us; and, before spring ar­
		  <lb/>rives, perhaps, we may persuade you to pitch your
		  <lb/>tent with us, for life,—ha, Major?</said></p>
	      <p><said>You may find it necessary to exert your per­
		  <lb/>suasive powers in the opposite scale,</said> replied <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName>; <said>I confess I am so happy here, that the time
		  <lb/>of my return seems every day more distant and
		  <lb/>uncertain. I am here, too, removed from the scene
		  <lb/>of active duties, which lately occupied me, and feel
		  <lb/>less keenly the sacrifice I have been compelled to
		  <lb/>make, in relinquishing my profession.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>Ah, you left both that, and your country, in
		  <lb/>good time, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, if you have no mind
		  <lb/>to be set about fighting with your own flesh and
		  <lb/>blood. There must be warm work in <placeName>England</placeName>, be­
		  <lb/>fore long, if <persName>King Charles</persName> makes such a fuss about
		  <lb/>his parliaments, and continues to persecute his dis­
		  <lb/>senting subjects, as he has lately done.</said>

	      <p><said>He has bad counsellors,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>but
		  <lb/>is, himself, a virtuous and humane prince, and re­
		  <lb/>ally solicitous for the happiness of his people.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I believe it, from my heart,</said> replied the Cap­
		<lb/>tain; <said>and I would cheerfully shed the last drop of
		  <lb/>my blood, to sustain the honour of his illustrious
		  <lb/>name; but I still maintain, that every man has a
		  <lb/>right to judge for himself, in matters of faith and
		  <lb/>conscience; and, so long as we remain peaceable
		  <lb/>and loyal subjects, neither king, nor bishop, is pri­
		  <lb/>vileged to molest us, for thinking differently from
		  <lb/>themselves.</said></p>
	      <p><said>An established religion is certainly desirable,</said><lb/>said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>and I am inclined to believe, that
		  <lb/>those who fled from persecution, and have here
		  <lb/>founded a church, on what you term apostolic prin­
		  <lb/>ciples, would be as severe towards those, of diffe­
		  <lb/>rent modes and opinions, and as much influenced
		  <lb/>by prejudice, as <orgName>the church of <placeName>England</placeName></orgName> has ever
		  <lb/>been, in regard to her dissenting children.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>Well, well, cousin <persName>Atherton</persName>, we will not begin
		  <lb/>with calling you to account, unless some amongst
		  <lb/>us should see fit to imitate the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> peo­
		  <lb/>ple, who are always fond of raising a breeze. But
		  <lb/>they have got a woman in hand now, who, I
		  <lb/>doubt not, will give them trouble enough, with her
		  <lb/>Antinomianism, and other conceits of the devil,
		  <lb/>who has been a friend to the sex, ever since he had
		  <lb/>such good luck with mother <persName>Eve</persName>. But I am go­
		  <lb/>ing to walk, now; and if you have no better way
		  <lb/>of amusing yourself, will ask you to accompany
		  <lb/>me.</said>

	      <p>
		<said>With all my heart: shall we try the woods
		  <lb/>again?</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>No, I should like to give you a glimpse of our
		  <lb/><placeName>Canaan</placeName>, from the top of mount <placeName>Pisgah</placeName>, yonder,</said><lb/>replied the Captain, pointing to a hill, which rose
		<lb/>to a considerable height, above the level of the Bay;
		<lb/>and to this day, is known by the name of the <mentioned rend="slant(upright)pre(‘)post(’)">Cap­
		  <lb/>tain's Hill.</mentioned></p>
	      <p><said>This,</said> he continued, as he led the way to its
		<lb/>summit, by a tolerable easy ascent, <said>this hill, and
		  <lb/>the beautiful stretch of land, which you see running
		  <lb/>into the Bay, was assigned to me, by the <orgName><placeName>Plymouth</placeName><lb/>company</orgName>; and I think I may say without boasting,
		  <lb/>that my farm looks as well as any of my neigh­
		  <lb/>bours, though I hardly knew a hoe from a pitch­
		  <lb/>fork, till I was obliged to use them, to satisfy the
		  <lb/>cravings of hunger; for we had scanty rations,
		  <lb/>when we first came over here.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And why were you located so far from the first
		  <lb/>settlement?</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>We found it necessary to remove as our num­
		  <lb/>bers increased, to give each other elbow-room, and
		  <lb/>land enough to cultivate; and the old colony is still
		  <lb/>sending forth her children to people new settle­
		  <lb/>ments. That village, lying at a short distance,
		  <lb/>north of us, is <choice><sic>call</sic><corr>called</corr></choice> <placeName>Scituate</placeName>, and is the only town
		  <lb/>that has yet been incorporated; even <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>
		  <lb/>has no bounds affixed to it, though the little clus­
		  <lb/>ters of houses, which you see here and there, bid
		  <lb/>fair to limit it, ere long.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Have you given any name to this tract of land?</said><pb n="108"/><milestone unit="sig" n="9(6)v"/><mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">108</mw><lb/>asked <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>you seem to have already gath­
		  <lb/>ered a flourishing village around you.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>The <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> name is <placeName>Mattakeeset</placeName>; but we begin
		  <lb/>to call it <placeName>Duxborough</placeName>, and hope, at the next sit­
		  <lb/>ting of our court, to have it incorporated. It is
		  <lb/>now nearly ten years since we first felled the trees,
		  <lb/>and began to build our houses; and, till within two
		  <lb/>or three, I continued to reside at <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, during
		  <lb/>the winter season; that being our head-quarters;
		  <lb/>and it was a long march through the snow-banks
		  <lb/>to do military duty; for we were obliged to keep
		  <lb/>on the look-out, lest the barbarous savages should
		  <lb/>rally their undisciplined tribes, and come howling
		  <lb/>upon us, unawares.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>This is, indeed, a glorious view,</said> said <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName>, who, lost in admiration at the prospect open­
		<lb/>ing before him, had scarcely heeded the last re­
		<lb/>mark. <said>With what grandeur the swelling ocean
		  <lb/>tosses its troubled waves, till lost, as it were, in the
		  <lb/>immensity of space, it mingles with the dusky
		  <lb/>clouds that rise, like gigantic mountains, from its
		  <lb/>foaming bosom! Here it seems lulled to rest, and
		  <lb/>scarcely ripples upon the silver beach; and, again,
		  <lb/>it rolls proudly along the indented shore; and,
		  <lb/>curving into a broad, full basin, breaks against the
		  <lb/>sandy and barren promontory, which stretches
		  <lb/>yonder, as if in defiance of its fury.</said></p>
	      <p><said>That is <placeName>Cape Cod</placeName>,</said> said <persName>Captain Standish</persName>;
		<lb/><said>the most southerly point of the <placeName>Massachusetts
		    <lb/>Bay</placeName>; and a dreary place we found it, when we
		  <lb/>landed there, in the frosts of <name>November</name>. Our
		  <pb n="109"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="10(1)r"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">109</mw>
		  <lb/>ship was driven in amongst dreadful shoals and
		  <lb/>breakers, and right thankful we were, to step
		  <lb/>ashore on almost any spot. It was there we com­
		  <lb/>bined ourselves into a body politic, enacted our
		  <lb/>first laws, and elected a Governor for the follow­
		  <lb/>ing year; but the place being found inconvenient
		  <lb/>to winter in, we made several voyages around the
		  <lb/>coast, to discover a better situation, and Pro­
		  <lb/>vidence at length guided us to this harbour.
		  <lb/>We put into it in a storm of wind and snow,
		  <lb/>in a dark and fearful night, and landed on the
		  <lb/>fine wooded island, which you see just below us,
		  <lb/>near by the beach. It is named <placeName><persName>Clark's</persName> island</placeName>,
		  <lb/>from the mate of the ship, who first stepped upon
		  <lb/>it; that other one, joined to the <placeName>Gurnet's Nose</placeName>, by
		  <lb/>a strip of sand, is called <placeName>Sanguish</placeName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>They are pleasant objects,</said> replied <persName>Atherton</persName>;
		<lb/><said>and agreeably diversify the scene; but how mag­
		  <lb/>nificent is the distant view! how beautifully the
		  <lb/>flitting clouds riot, for a moment, on the dark and
		  <lb/>undulating forests, and then pass off and leave
		  <lb/>them glittering in the morning sun, and varied
		  <lb/>with the thousand tints of autumn! And, to the
		  <lb/>north, far as my eye can stretch, beyond these slop­
		  <lb/>ing hills, and hanging woodlands, and above the
		  <lb/>summits of the tallest trees, I see a range of lofty
		  <lb/>mountains, blue as the skies which shelter them,
		  <lb/>rising like monarchs of the surrounding wilder­
		  <lb/>ness.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Those are the <placeName>blue hills</placeName> of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>,</said> an­
		<lb/>swered the Captain; <said>they are the highest in the

		  <lb/>colony, and the first point of land visible, as you
		  <lb/>approach this coast. This is, indeed, a noble pros­
		  <lb/>pect, and well worth the trouble of scrambling up
		  <lb/>here, to gaze at. Look down, now, upon my
		  <lb/>house; and see how warmly it is sheltered in that
		  <lb/>sunny valley. Those trees, which shade it, were
		  <lb/>but saplings when I first knew the spot; and no
		  <lb/>foot, but the wild <name>Indian's</name>, had trod those fields,
		  <lb/>where the ripened grains now wave in the light
		  <lb/>sea-breeze.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I think, Sir,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>you have disco­
		  <lb/>vered much taste, as well as good husbandry, in
		  <lb/>your improvements. Those groups of trees are
		  <lb/>finely disposed about the dwelling; but what is
		  <lb/>that single one, shooting its branches, with so
		  <lb/>much regularity, from the aspiring trunk, and
		  <lb/>dropping its leaves into the stream, which rushes
		  <lb/>by it; it is tricked out in gaudy colours, and, at
		  <lb/>this distance, might be mistaken for a crimson
		  <lb/>banner, floating on a citadel.</said></p>
	      <p><said>To me,</said> said the Captain laughing, <said>it looks
		  <lb/>more like a fair weather officer, dressed up for a
		  <lb/>gala day; and, like many who strut well at a field
		  <lb/>review, is the first to shrink from peril. The
		  <lb/>slightest touch of frost changes its hue, and its
		  <lb/>gay foliage is conspicuous in our forests, long be­
		  <lb/>fore any other tree has dropped a withered leaf;
		  <lb/>it is the <name>Maple</name>, and I planted that one with my
		  <lb/>own hand. I lived long enough in <placeName>England</placeName>, <persName>Ma­
		    <lb/>jor Atherton</persName>, to learn the value of fine trees,
		  <lb/>though many here seem to think there are enough
		  <pb n="111"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="10(2)r"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">111</mw>
		  <lb/>in the woods, without keeping them around their
		  <lb/>doors. Perhaps my taste arises from the predilec­
		  <lb/>tions of youth; for, I well remember, my father
		  <lb/>would as soon have seen the old walls of <placeName><persName>Standish</persName>
		    <lb/>Hall</placeName> rased to the foundations, as an old tree cut
		  <lb/>down from the lawn.</said></p>
	      <p><said>They are certainly no novelty in this country,</said><lb/>returned <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>but, to me, it seems a strange
		  <lb/>perversion of taste, which can induce any one to
		  <lb/>prefer those blackened stumps, or desert plains, to
		  <lb/>the living green, which would so agreeably shelter
		  <lb/>their roofs. I perceive, too, Sir, that you have
		  <lb/>paid some regard to minor ornaments; that luxu­
		  <lb/>riant sweet-briar, chequering the casement with
		  <lb/>its dancing leaves, reminds me of the simplicity
		  <lb/>and neatness of an <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> cottage.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Ah, that is not to my liking,</said> replied the Captain;
		<lb/><said>the prickly things are springing up, every where,
		  <lb/>and tearing one, without mercy; but I left that
		  <lb/>growing, to please—my little rose-bud, <persName>Miriam
		    <lb/>Grey</persName>, who is for having every thing sweet and
		  <lb/>flowering about her. She took a great fancy to
		  <lb/>this one, and begged its life of me; and, I know
		  <lb/>not how it is, but these pretty maidens will con­
		  <lb/>trive to make us do any thing they like.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is even so,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName> smiling; <said>but that
		  <lb/>bush certainly looks very well, though it seems to
		  <lb/>require the pruning knife, just now; and, if you
		  <lb/>will allow me, I will try my skill in training those
		  <lb/>crooked branches.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>Do, if your fingers are proof against the thorns;
		  <pb n="112"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="10(2)v"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">112</mw>
		  <lb/>and now we will return to the house, if it please
		  <lb/>you;—yet stop, a moment, cousin <persName>Atherton</persName>, and
		  <lb/>look once again around you.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>I could scarcely weary of doing so,</said> replied
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>and shall often ascend this hill, when
		  <lb/>I wish to regale my eyes with the charms of na­
		  <lb/>ture.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And could you be content to remain here for
		  <lb/>life?</said> asked the Captain. <said>If you could, cast
		  <lb/>your eyes on the spot which pleases you, and it is
		  <lb/>yours.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And would you have me renounce my country
		  <lb/>and religion?</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>Your country will shortly renounce you,</said> re­
		<lb/>plied the Captain, <said>unless you unsheath your
		  <lb/>sword against the defenders of a faith which your
		  <lb/>mother loved; you must become persecutor, or per­
		  <lb/>secuted.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>And who will sustain the honour of my father's
		  <lb/>name, if the last, who bears it, flies from the land
		  <lb/>which gave him birth?</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>It is only transplanting it to another region;
		  <lb/>our country is the same, and we are all subjects
		  <lb/>of the same gracious king.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Consider, dear sir,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>that I am
		  <lb/>yet but just landed on your shores; all is novelty
		  <lb/>to me; and though I am at present well-pleased
		  <lb/>and happy, time alone can strengthen or remove
		  <lb/>my prepossessions.</said></p>
	      <p><said>True,</said> said the Captain, who perceived he had
		<lb/>been premature in disclosing his wishes. <said>We will
		  <pb n="113"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="10(3)r"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">113</mw>
		  <lb/>wait patiently till spring arrives; young men
		  <lb/>are apt to waver in their minds, I know. At your
		  <lb/>age, I little dreamed of ending my days in that
		  <lb/>cottage; but we know not what is before us; those
		  <lb/>who deprived me of my lawful inheritance, and
		  <lb/>obliged me to resign the privileges of my rank,
		  <lb/>and the home which sheltered my infancy, to seek
		  <lb/>a name and subsistance in a foreign land, doubtless
		  <lb/>intended it for evil to me; but Providence, I trust
		  <lb/>has made it instrumental of good to myself and
		  <lb/>those who have relied on my arm for defence, in
		  <lb/>this wilderness; and I can now truly say, I would
		  <lb/>not exchange my situation for all the luxuries of
		  <lb/>my youth, and all the distinctions, which then
		  <lb/>seemed within my grasp.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is well,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>that happiness is
		  <lb/>not confined to any particular place or circum­
		  <lb/>stances; I am even inclined to think, that I could
		  <lb/>pass the remainder of my life in such a cottage,
		  <lb/>without casting many fond looks after the gay
		  <lb/>world which I have left behind me; but at pre­
		  <lb/>sent I am a wanderer on the face of the earth,
		  <lb/>and shall probably visit many climes, before I re­
		  <lb/>turn to <placeName>England</placeName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>We will think of that another time,</said> returned
		<lb/>the Captain, <said>and now that you have seen the
		  <lb/>goodliness of the land, I have but to shew you
		  <lb/>some of its comely daughters, and we can boast
		  <lb/>of many ruddy cheeks and bright eyes here, <persName>Major
		    <lb/>Atherton</persName>.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>So I have seen, Captain; but spare my heart

		  <lb/>in pity. You know I cannot give that away to
		  <lb/>one of your demure little <name>puritans</name>, without shaving
		  <lb/>my head; and I should by no means relish the al­
		  <lb/>ternative.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>We shall see,</said> answered the Captain, as they
		<lb/>descended the hill; and, after walking for a time
		<lb/>about his farm,—for he would explain all its ar­
		<lb/>rangements and conveniences,—they returned to
		<lb/>the house, at an early dinner hour.</p>
	      <p>When the repast was ended, <persName>Major Atherton</persName> left
		<lb/>his kinsman to enjoy a solitary pipe of tobacco,
		<lb/>and commenced a zealous attack upon the sweet-
		<lb/>briar, which he intended to make resemble as
		<lb/>nearly as possible, the beautiful one he had ob­
		<lb/>served around the windows of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>; but
		<lb/>owing to his want of skill, perhaps, he lopped
		<lb/>away branch after branch, till nothing but a mere
		<lb/>skeleton remained. Dissatisfied with his own
		<lb/>work, he was in the act of abandoning it, when the
		<lb/>dashing of oars in the water attracted his atten­
		<lb/>tion, and looking round, he perceived a small boat
		<lb/>approaching the shore, and occupied by four per­
		<lb/>sons; two of whom were regarding him with par­
		<lb/>ticular attention. These, he quickly discovered
		<lb/>to be <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> and <persName>Peregrine White</persName>, who
		<lb/>seemed engaged in a merry conversation, of which
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName> fancied himself the subject, though the
		<lb/>damsel averted her eyes, and half turned her light
		<lb/>figure from him, when she found herself observed.
		<lb/>On the seat beside her, reclined her father, with
		<lb/>folded arms, as if engrossed by his own medita­
		<pb n="115"/>

		<lb/>tions: his eyes, now fixed upon the watery deep,
		<lb/>and then turned upwards, apparently to watch the
		<lb/>swelling clouds, which began to flit rapidly before
		<lb/>a rising autumnal blast. <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName> wielded
		<lb/>the oars with slow, but determined accuracy, and
		<lb/>evidently listened to the conversation of his com­
		<lb/>panions, with a degree of interest that rendered
		<lb/>him inattentive to his manual exertions; for the
		<lb/>boat was gliding past the spot where <persName>Major
		  <lb/>Atherton</persName> stood, when <persName>Peregrine White</persName>, starting on
		<lb/>his feet, and standing firm and erect in the tossing
		<lb/>bark, seized the arm of <persName>Ashly</persName>, with a force and
		<lb/>suddenness, that almost ejected the oar from his
		<lb/>hand, and bowed the side of the vessel to the wa­
		<lb/>ter's edge.</p>
	      <p><said>Bless me, <persName>Peregrine</persName>,</said> said <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, catch­
		<lb/>ing her father's arm; <said>you give us more exercise
		  <lb/>than the winds, and in truth, I think they are less
		  <lb/>rude than your boyish tricks.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>Now don't be angry, <persName>Miriam</persName>; for it was not
		  <lb/>me after all; but this grampus floundering about
		  <lb/>here. Ho! <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName>, are you asleep again?
		  <lb/>I believe, on my conscience, you were nodding at
		  <lb/>the oars just now.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>It would be well, <persName>Master Peregrine</persName>, if you
		  <lb/>would be quiet a little oftener,</said> replied the other
		<lb/>in a grave voice.</p>
	      <p><said>Better said than done, that, <persName>Mr. Ashly</persName>; but are
		  <lb/>you steering out to <placeName>Cape Cod</placeName>?</said> and, without
		<lb/>ceremony he snatched the oars from his hand, and
		<lb/>dashed them into the water, with quick and pow­
		<pb n="116"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="10(4)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">116</mw>
		<lb/>erful strokes, which brought them in a moment
		<lb/>to the strand.</p>
	      <p><said>Why do you bring us here, young man?</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, sternly; <said>is it to serve thy gamesome
		  <lb/>humour at our expense?</said></p>
	      <p><said>No sir,</said> replied <persName>Peregrine</persName>, an air of respect
		<lb/>mingling with his habitual levity; <said>but I wish to
		  <lb/>speak with <persName>Major Atherton</persName> who stands gazing
		  <lb/>at us from under the rose-bush, yonder; and I am
		  <lb/>mistaken if my absence be much regretted here.</said></p>
	      <p><said>None on my word as we value our lives and
		  <lb/>comfort,</said> said <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>; and the sweet and
		<lb/>sportive tunes of her voice fell like music on the
		<lb/>ear of <persName>Atherton</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>Fare you well then,</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName>, springing
		<lb/>on the shore; <said>here are the paddles, <persName>Master Ben­
		    <lb/>jamin Ashly</persName>; so paddle yourself off swiftly, and dex­
		  <lb/>terously; but have a care that you dont flounce
		  <lb/>about and upset; for the damsel there, though she
		  <lb/>is light enough, cannot float forever, and you
		  <lb/>would shoot to the bottom like a bullet.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Methinks our voyage will prosper,</said> said <persName>Mi­
		  <lb/>riam</persName>, <said>now that we are no longer burthened with
		  <lb/>a <persName>Jonas</persName> to endanger us.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You will see me again in season to pilot you
		  <lb/>home,</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName>, elevating his voice, as they
		<lb/>receded from the shore, <said>and I will bring the Cap­
		  <lb/>tain, with me, shall I, <persName>Miriam</persName>?</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Miriam</persName> nodded assent.</p>
	      <p><said>And <persName>Major Atherton</persName>?</said> he added; but the dam­
		<lb/>sel probably did not hear; for she turned, at the
		<pb n="117"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="10(5)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">117</mw>
		<lb/>moment to address her father, and <persName>Peregrine</persName>
		<lb/>laughing, proceeded towards the house.</p>
	      <p><said>Well now, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>,</said> exclaimed the
		<lb/>youth, <said>why don't you speak to me, instead of
		  <lb/>staring at the water as if there was a whale spout­
		  <lb/>ing in it?</said></p>
	      <p><said>I am truly glad to see you,</said> returned <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName>, <said>but I was busily watching the boat you
		  <lb/>have just left; see how fast it scuds before the
		  <lb/>wind!</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is a trim little bark enough,</said> replied <persName>Pere­
		  <lb/>grine</persName>, <said>and decked out with fair lading, as I doubt
		  <lb/>not you were thinking.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It dances like an egg-shell,</said> pursued <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName>; <said>and I should think there are few females,
		  <lb/>who would not feel some degree of alarm on such
		  <lb/>tossing waves.</said></p>
	      <p><said>There is really no danger,</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName>;
		<lb/><said>and <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> would be the last person in
		  <lb/>the world, to imagine it; she is used to such
		  <lb/>things, and never plagues one with her idle fears,
		  <lb/>like other women.</said></p>
	      <p><said>How far are they going?</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>Just round the bay, to a house near the beach,
		  <lb/>north of us. I fell in with them by good luck, as
		  <lb/>they were pushing off from <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, and I was
		  <lb/>thinking how I should get here this afternoon with­
		  <lb/>out taxing my legs with the trouble of bringing
		  <lb/>me. It was long though, before I could make that
		  <lb/>round-eared <persName>Ashly</persName> hear my call; for which I owe
		  <lb/>him a ducking, and I have some idea, that the old
		  <pb n="118"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="10(5)v"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">118</mw>
		  <lb/>man, himself, would have been as well pleased if I
		  <lb/>had staid behind.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>You mean to wait here till they return?</said> asked
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>No, I'll not trust to their stopping for me, and
		  <lb/>I want you and <persName>Captain Standish</persName> to go with me
		  <lb/>and meet them at worthy <persName>Mr. Woodman's</persName>. You
		  <lb/>shall have a treat from <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName>, who, I
		  <lb/>know, means to hold forth, like a saint; and <persName>Mi­
		    <lb/>riam Grey</persName> will look—</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Like an angel, I suppose you would say,</said> inter­
		<lb/>rupted <persName>Atherton</persName>, with a smile; <said>but here comes the
		  <lb/>Captain, who can speak for himself.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Ah!</said> said <persName>Captain Standish</persName>, at that moment
		<lb/>thrusting his head from the door. <said>I thought you
		  <lb/>were here, <persName>Master Peregrine</persName>; I can no more mis­
		  <lb/>take the sound of your tongue, than I could the
		  <lb/>clapper of a wind-mill.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You mean that they both make a noise, I sup­
		  <lb/>pose,</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName>; <said>and in my mind, they
		  <lb/>were both made for that purpose.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Yes, and they are both used to grinding out
		  <lb/>chaff,</said> said the Captain.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>Which shews that there is some good grain at
		  <lb/>the bottom, and so Captain, I expect mine will
		  <lb/>sprout up, and produce a wonderful harvest some
		  <lb/>of these days.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>May the time be hastened,</said> said the Captain;
		<lb/><said>or we shall begin to think it is choked by the
		  <lb/>tares.</said></p>
	      <pb n="119"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="10(6)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">119</mw>
	      <p>
		<said>All in good time, Captain. And now I will
		  <lb/>deliver my message, if it please you to hear.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Speak on, young man.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Well,</said> continued <persName>Peregrine</persName>, <said>you see yon skiff,
		  <lb/>dipping into the waves like a sea-gull! It landed
		  <lb/>me safe in your dominions, and a certain laughing
		  <lb/>damsel, called <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>,</said>—</p>
	      <p><said>Ah! my little rose-bud!</said> interrupted the Cap­
		<lb/>tain, <said>and why did she come so near without stop­
		  <lb/>ping to see me?</said></p>
	      <p><said>I do not know, indeed,</said> replied the youth, <said>un­
		  <lb/>less <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, who was standing there, like
		  <lb/>a giant to defend your castle, frightened her
		  <lb/>away.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I should be sorry to produce such an effect on
		  <lb/>her,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, laughing.</p>
	      <p><said>You are right,</said> returned <persName>Peregrine</persName> archly. <said>I
		  <lb/>am thinking you meditated something entirely dif­
		  <lb/>ferent.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Young maidens are not apt to be alarmed at
		  <lb/>the sight of a gallant young man,</said> observed the
		<lb/>Captain; <said>but, bless me, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, what
		  <lb/>have you been doing to this briar-bush?</said></p>
	      <p><said>Trimming it,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>though I must
		  <lb/>confess, it is done clumsily enough. I intended it
		  <lb/>should look precisely like <persName>Miriam Grey's</persName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It looks as much like hers,</said> said <persName>Peregrine
		  <lb/>White</persName>, <said>as she does like mistress <persName>Rebecca Spindle</persName>;
		  <lb/>but I crave your pardon, Captain; perhaps the
		  <lb/>spinster is a favourite of yours.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>You are a saucy lad, <persName>Peregrine</persName>, and not worth
		  <pb n="120"/>

		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">120</mw>
		  <lb/>the minding, or I should try to mend your man­
		  <lb/>ners with the point of my sword.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>With your leave, Captain, I think it might help
		  <lb/>to make a breach in my manners; but I doubt if it
		  <lb/>would readily mend them.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>No, no, boy; they are past all mending; but,
		  <lb/>if it please you, unburthen yourself of the remainder
		  <lb/>of that message; I am waiting to hear it now.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>The message? oh, it is that you will go with
		  <lb/>me to <persName>master Woodman's</persName>, and spend an hour or so;
		  <lb/><persName>Miriam Grey</persName> expects you, and likewise <persName>Major
		    <lb/>Atherton</persName>.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Take care <persName>master Peregrine</persName>,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>,
		<lb/><said>remember I was near to you, and could hear all
		  <lb/>that past.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>True, and now I recollect, Major, she did not
		  <lb/>want you; but you do not know what she said be­
		  <lb/>fore we reached the shore.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Perhaps it was something I should not care to
		  <lb/>hear.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>It was nothing very remarkable,</said> said <persName>Pere­
		  <lb/>grine</persName>; <said>she only wondered who that tall savage
		  <lb/>could be, who was hacking up her rose bush so un­
		  <lb/>mercifully, and said—</said></p>
	      <p><said>That is quite enough,</said> interrupted <persName>Atherton</persName>.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>Oho, you have not had the cream of it. She
		  <lb/>says—</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Never mind the girl,</said> interposed the Captain;
		<lb/><said>she is privileged to say any thing that suits her;
		  <lb/>and now let me know, <persName>Peregrine</persName>, who is with her
		  <lb/>in the boat. But the wind grows raw and bluster­
		  <pb n="121"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="11(1)r"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">121</mw>
		  <lb/>ing, and it is my mind that we have stood in it long
		  <lb/>enough.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Her father and <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName>,</said> said <persName>Pere­
		  <lb/>grine</persName>, as he followed into the house; <said>and the last
		  <lb/>mentioned personage, I believe, has been putting
		  <lb/>his brains in order to settle the dubious points of
		  <lb/>faith and doctrine to-night; for he towed us along
		  <lb/>like a snail, dragging a cockle-shell.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And do you mean to render him assistance,
		  <lb/>with your knowledge and experience?</said> asked
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>Not I truly; they would look upon me with as
		  <lb/>much astonishment, as the people of old did, when
		  <lb/>they found <persName>Saul</persName> among the prophets.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>You had better stay the evening with us then,</said><lb/>said the Captain; <said>it is far to go; and unless <persName>Ma­
		    <lb/>jor Atherton</persName> wishes it, I had rather remain at
		  <lb/>home.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>Certainly not, I should by no means wish to
		  <lb/>intrude myself into the house of an entire stranger.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>I wish I had kept on in the boat then,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Peregrine White</persName>; <said>for I have no fancy for a lone­
		  <lb/>ly jaunt, with nothing but a dog, or my walking
		  <lb/>stick to speak with. But where is <persName>Alexander</persName>?</said></p>
	      <p><said>He has been out with <persName>Hobamock</persName> to fish since
		  <lb/>morning,</said> said the Captain. <said>I believe the boy will
		  <lb/>turn <name>Indian</name> before long; he is so won over by their
		  <lb/>wandering sort of life.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I should like very well to walk part of the way
		  <lb/>with you, <persName>Peregrine</persName>,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>but you can
		  <lb/>stay with us yet an hour or two.</said></p>

	      <p><said>Be it so then,</said> replied <persName>Peregrine</persName>; <said>the savory
		  <lb/>smell of a venison pasty, which reaches me from
		  <lb/>the kitchen, is very refreshing, and will, doubtless
		  <lb/>prove as substantial as <persName>Benjamin Ashly's</persName> exhorta­
		  <lb/>tions, and be far more quickly dispatched.</said></p>
	      <p>The evening proved dark and chilly; but, with
		<lb/>health and spirits, which bade defiance to its in­
		<lb/>clemency, the young men, at a seasonable hour,
		<lb/>commenced their walk towards the house of <persName>Mr.
		  <lb/>Woodman</persName>. It was two or three miles from the
		<lb/>residence of <persName>Captain Standish</persName>; and the few stars,
		<lb/>that now and then broke through the general gloom,
		<lb/>served to direct their course, which, after a short
		<lb/>distance, seemed to diverge from the abodes of man,
		<lb/>and at one moment, led them through the intricacies
		<lb/>of a wood, and the next brought them to the shore
		<lb/>of the restless ocean.</p>
	      <p><said>Heaven defend us from a cold bath!</said> said <persName>Pere­
		  <lb/>grine White</persName>. <said>I am not inclined to try my skill
		  <lb/>in swimming on such a night as this!</said></p>
	      <p><said>Since we have escaped those break-neck stumps
		  <lb/>which threatened our downfall in the woods,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>I think we may find our path clear for
		  <lb/>the remainder of the way. Yonder is a light, if I
		  <lb/>mistake not.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Yes, and that is the end of our journey,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Peregrine</persName>, joyfully.</p>
	      <p><said>Here then we must part,</said> rejoined <persName>Atherton</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>Go with us,</said> replied <persName>Peregrine</persName>, <said>and we can
		  <lb/>land you at the Captain's on our return, without
		  <lb/>the least difficulty. It is a tedious walk for you

	      <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> house to which <persName>Peregrine White</persName> directed
		<lb/>his steps, was situated near the extremity of a nar­
		<lb/>row beach which separated the ocean from a pro­
		<lb/>jecting bay; and <persName>Atherton</persName> paused till the little
		<lb/>party had exchanged their last adieus, and <persName>Miriam
		  <lb/>Grey</persName>, leaning on her father's arm, approached the
		<lb/>bark, which was loosed from the moorings, and
		<lb/>shortly commenced its passage across the Bay.
		<lb/>The morning of that day had been serene and
		<lb/>brilliant, but with the variableness so common in
		<lb/>the capricious climate of <placeName>New-England</placeName>, its noon-
		<lb/>tide splendour was overcast by dark, though pass­
		<lb/>ing clouds, and the setting sun was shrouded in a
		<lb/>lurid mist, portending an approaching change of
		<lb/>weather. Still, however, the clouds hung back, as
		<lb/>if unwilling to collect and blacken the pure arch
		<lb/>of heaven; and as <persName>Major Atherton</persName> yet lingered on
		<lb/>the spot where his companion had left him, the
		<lb/>heavy masses seemed rolling away, leaving large

		<lb/>tracts of blue and spangled sky; and the waning
		<lb/>moon, encircled by a broad zone of crimson vapour,
		<lb/>began to rise from her watery bed, and to shoot a
		<lb/>trembling light across the track of the lonely voy­
		<lb/>agers.</p>
	      <p>Actuated by a latent interest, which he however
		<lb/>ascribed to the mere impulse of curiosity, <persName>Major
		  <lb/>Atherton</persName> enveloped himself more closely in the
		<lb/>ample folds of a military cloak, to ward off the
		<lb/>piercing blast; and turning from the path that led
		<lb/>back to his kinsman's house, proceeded with rapid
		<lb/>steps along the beach, which, extending nearly
		<lb/>three miles in a south-easterly direction, terminated
		<lb/>in an eminence called the <placeName>Gurnet's Nose</placeName>, then
		<lb/>joined to the <placeName>Sauguish</placeName> by a strip of sand, though it
		<lb/>is now many years since the encroaching waves
		<lb/>have insulated it. On his left, the <placeName>Atlantic</placeName> tossed
		<lb/>its foaming billows, sending forth suppressed and
		<lb/>sullen murmurs, and seeming to await the rising
		<lb/>blast to lash them into fury; while on the other
		<lb/>side the agitated waters of the Bay dashed fearfully
		<lb/>against the strand, as if seeking to submerge the
		<lb/>slight barrier which separated them from the
		<lb/>boundless deep. The moon was struggling with
		<lb/>the clouds that constantly flitted across her disk,
		<lb/>affording to <persName>Atherton</persName> but partial glimpses of the
		<lb/>little bark, which he continued to watch with an

		<lb/>quired the most strenuous efforts of the young men,
		<lb/>who plied the oars with a dexterity and skill that
		<lb/>promised ultimate and well-earned success. They
		<lb/>were still near the beach, to which, in spite of their
		<lb/>exertions, the wind continually impelled them; and
		<lb/>as a ray of light occasionally glanced on the coun­
		<lb/>tenance of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, <persName>Atherton</persName> remarked with
		<lb/>admiration the serenity of its expression, and the
		<lb/>air of calmness, mingled with awe, with which she
		<lb/>regarded the angry elements. Apparently unmov­
		<lb/>ed by fear or anxiety, she gently reclined on her
		<lb/>father's protecting arm, while both maintained a
		<lb/>profound and unbroken silence. Indeed all were
		<lb/>so much engrossed by their peculiar situation or
		<lb/>reflections, that <persName>Atherton</persName> was entirely disregarded,
		<lb/>though frequently so near that the sound of his
		<lb/>footsteps, on a calm evening, might have been dis­
		<lb/>tinctly heard by them. Presently, the voice of
		<lb/><persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, more sweet and touching from the
		<lb/>contrast of discordant sounds which raved around
		<lb/>her, stole upon the ear of <persName>Atherton</persName>, as in solemn

	      <p>As she proceeded in the last verse, her voice be­
		<lb/>came slightly tremulous; for the wind, which at
		<lb/>the commencement of it seemed dying away, as if
		<lb/>lulled to silence by her melody, suddenly rose with
		<lb/>redoubled energy, and the darkened sky almost
		<lb/>concealed from his view the frail bark, which was
		<lb/>at one moment borne on the top of a tremendous
		<lb/>wave, and the next, almost engulphed beneath it.
		<lb/>They were now nearly opposite the <placeName>Gurnet's Nose</placeName>,
		<lb/>and the wind, eddying around the point of land,
		<lb/>rendered their endeavours to keep out in the open

	      <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> could no longer distinguish any

		<lb/>to know if the countenance of <persName>Miriam</persName>, still retained
		<lb/>the sweet tranquillity he had just remarked on it;
		<pb n="128"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="11(4)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">128</mw>
		<lb/>and which struck him as even more fascinating
		<lb/>than its usual sportive gayety. But he heard only
		<lb/>the heavy strokes of the oars which became moment­
		<lb/>ly more and more distant; and satisfied that they
		<lb/>were well acquainted with the navigation of the
		<lb/>Bay, his fears for their safety gradually subsided,
		<lb/>though it was not till convinced they were beyond
		<lb/>his observation, that he began to feel his own situ­
		<lb/>ation to be uncomfortable, if not hazardous.</p>
	      <p>The wind, which had exhausted its fury, and
		<lb/>seemed to be sinking away in hollow murmurs,
		<lb/>had indeed, enabled the party in the boat, to make
		<lb/>some progress in the direction they wished; but its
		<lb/>violence was shortly redoubled, and the light skiff
		<lb/>appeared totally unable to resist the combined force
		<lb/>of the winds and waves, that threatened to dash it
		<lb/>among the shoals and rocks, around the <placeName>Gurnet</placeName>.
		<lb/>The only hope of safety remaining to them, was
		<lb/>the chance of reaching a spot where they could land
		<lb/>in safety; but at which, amidst the darkness of
		<lb/>the night, and the roaring of the waves, it seemed
		<lb/>almost impossible to arrive.</p>
	      <p>Until the moment of extreme peril, <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>
		<lb/>remained by the side of his daughter; and, while
		<lb/>pressed by his encircling arm, <persName>Miriam</persName> felt in com­
		<lb/>parative safety; but when the danger became more
		<lb/>pressing and required his experience and skill to
		<lb/>assist the exertions of his younger companions, all
		<lb/>the fortitude and resignation of a vigorous and
		<lb/>well principled mind could hardly support her,
		<lb/>amidst the terrors of a scene, which might have
		<pb n="129"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="11(5)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">129</mw>
		<lb/>appalled even the stoutest heart. <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, agon­
		<lb/>ized with apprehensions for his daughter, which
		<lb/>rendered him almost insensible to personal danger,
		<lb/>pressed her to his bosom with the mingled sorrow
		<lb/>and affection which the danger inspired, and silently
		<lb/>commending her to the protection of Him, who
		<lb/>directs the storm, and controls the raging winds,
		<lb/>he applied himself with all the promptitude and
		<lb/>energy which the exigence demanded, to guide the
		<lb/>tossing bark, amidst the jarring of the contending
		<lb/>elements. <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> covered her face with both
		<lb/>her hands, if possible, to screen her eyes from the
		<lb/>threatening danger, though she could not shut her
		<lb/>ears against the terrific sounds; and endeavouring
		<lb/>to collect her agitated thoughts, and compose her
		<lb/>mind to meet the will of Providence, awaited in
		<lb/>profound stillness, the event. <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName>,
		<lb/>who felt a double pang in prospect of the fate
		<lb/>which seemed to await himself and the woman
		<lb/>whom he devotedly loved;—feeling his affection
		<lb/>rising above its usual reserve, approached with
		<lb/>language that expressed his powerful interest, and
		<lb/>endeavoured to inspire her with a hope which she
		<lb/>left to be fast gliding away.</p>
	      <p><said>Leave me, I entreat you,</said> she faltered out; <said>as
		  <lb/>you value our safety, suffer no thought, no fear
		  <lb/>for me, to distract your attention at this critical
		  <lb/>moment.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Ashly</persName> pressed her hand with silent emotion.</p>
	      <p><said>God reward you for all your kindness to me,</said><lb/>added the maiden, the tears quickly coursing each
		<pb n="130"/><milestone unit="sig" n="11(5)v"/><mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">130</mw><lb/>other down her cheeks; <said>and forgive me, <persName>Ashly</persName>,
		  <lb/>if I have at any time done aught to give you pain.</said></p>
	      <p>Before he had time to reply, <persName>Peregrine White</persName>
		<lb/>exclaimed, joyfully,</p>
	      <p>
		<said>Yonder is a deep cove; I know it well; pull
		  <lb/>away like a man, <persName>Ashly</persName>, and if we can pass these
		  <lb/>breakers, with the help of Heaven we shall find
		  <lb/>safe landing.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>The young man seized the oar, which <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>
		<lb/>relinquished to him, and for one moment every heart
		<lb/>beat high with renovated hope; the next, <persName>Ashly</persName>
		<lb/>cried in a tone of despair, <said>We are lost!</said> and, at
		<lb/>the same instant a loud crash proceeding from the
		<lb/>oar which had broken in his hand, struck like a
		<lb/>knell on every ear. The boat, propelled by the
		<lb/>sudden shock, swung swiftly round; and, though
		<lb/><persName>Peregrine White</persName> with admirable presence of mind,
		<lb/>endeavoured to counteract the danger by his skilful
		<lb/>management of the remaining oar, it was swept
		<lb/>back by a tremendous wave rolling towards the
		<lb/>strand, and left fast grounded on a rock, surround­
		<lb/>ed by foaming breakers which threatened its speedy
		<lb/>destruction. The violence of the gale had passed
		<lb/>away, and the moon breaking through the clouds
		<lb/>served but to render their situation more frightful,
		<lb/>by exhibiting all its horrors, embittered by their
		<lb/>recent hopes of reaching the wished-for shore, that
		<lb/>lay at a short distance, now visibly inaccessible,
		<lb/>by reason of a boiling surge. A deadly chill seem­
		<lb/>ed to have seized on every heart; but the rushing
		<lb/>of the waves, which soon began to fill the shallow
		<pb n="131"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="11(6)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">131</mw>
		<lb/>bark, renewed their energies with the additional
		<lb/>consciousness of their extreme peril.</p>
	      <p><said>Now may God have mercy on us! there is no
		  <lb/>longer any hope from man!</said> ejaculated <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>
		<lb/>in a solemn voice; and he folded his daughter in
		<lb/>his arms with the tenderness of a last embrace.</p>
	      <p><said>Say not so!</said> said <persName>Peregrine White</persName>, vainly en­
		<lb/>deavouring to speak with firmness; <said>we will not
		  <lb/>give up life without an effort to preserve it; we
		  <lb/>can swim, and perhaps,—</said></p>
	      <p><said>And <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>,</said> interrupted <persName>Ashly</persName> in great
		<lb/>agitation; <said>think you that <emph>she</emph> can struggle with
		  <lb/>these waves.</said></p>
	      <p><said>If you can save my child,</said> exclaimed the father,
		<lb/>with deep emotion, <said>I shall die contented.</said></p>
	      <p><said>No, we will perish together,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>; and
		<lb/>she twined her arms more closely around her fath­
		<lb/>er's neck. <said>Dearest father,</said> she added, <said>it is but
		  <lb/>a brief, though stormy passage to a world where
		  <lb/>all will be sunshine and happiness forever.</said></p>
	      <p>Scarcely had she spoken, when the loud barking
		<lb/>of a dog was heard from the shore; and, with a
		<lb/>sudden revulsion of feeling, every heart bounded
		<lb/>with the hope of approaching succour. A sound,
		<lb/>as of some one plunging into the water instantly
		<lb/>followed; and through the gloom, they could per­
		<lb/>ceive a figure, buffeting with the waves; another
		<lb/>moment of expectation, and <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> felt her­
		<lb/>self gently, but firmly grasped, and a well-remem­
		<lb/>bered voice said to her,</p>
	      <p>
		<said>Fear not, but trust yourself with me, and you
		  <lb/>will soon be in safety.</said>

	      <p><said><persName>Major Atherton</persName>! is that you?</said> said <persName>Peregrine

	      <p>
		<said>Yes, follow me, and we shall shortly reach the
		  <lb/>strand.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName> leaped first into the surge, with his
		<lb/>half lifeless burthen, whom he firmly supported
		<lb/>with one arm, while with the other, he resisted the
		<lb/>violence of the tide, and, at length reached the
		<lb/>shore, though nearly exhausted by the effort, which
		<lb/>his uncommon muscular strength, alone, had ena­
		<lb/>bled him to make. <persName>Atherton</persName> thought only of the
		<lb/>lovely being, whom he had rescued from an early
		<lb/>grave; and, wrapping his warm and dry cloak
		<lb/>around her, he gently seated her on a bank, at some
		<lb/>distance from the water's edge, and, kneeling by
		<lb/>her side, supported her head against his shoulder;
		<lb/>holding her wet and chilled hands between his own.
		<lb/><persName>Miriam</persName> had not fainted; but conflicting emotions,
		<lb/>and acute feeling, for a time, nearly deprived her
		<lb/>of sensation; and, when she began to revive, it
		<lb/>was with difficulty she could arrange her bewilder­
		<lb/>ed thoughts, or comprehend her singular situation.
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>, by the imperfect light, which still glim­
		<lb/>mered from the heavens, watched, with intense in­
		<lb/>terest, the returning animation of her countenance,
		<lb/>and saw, with delight, a faint colour stealing over
		<lb/>her pale features.</p>
	      <p>As <persName>Miriam</persName> revived to perfect consciousness, she
		<lb/>withdrew, in maiden bashfulness, from the support
		<lb/>of <persName>Atherton</persName>, and disengaging her hand, which he
		<lb/>felt slightly tremble between his own, leaned against
		<pb n="133"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="12(1)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">133</mw>
		<lb/>the trunk of a pine, at the root of which, she was
		<lb/>seated. <persName>Atherton</persName> arose from his lowly posture,
		<lb/>and respectfully withdrew a few paces from her.
		<lb/><persName>Miriam</persName> also rose, and, in an instant, <persName>Atherton</persName> was
		<lb/>again by her side. She looked at him, with a coun­
		<lb/>tenance full of gratitude, but felt that language
		<lb/>was powerless to express the deep emotions, which
		<lb/>his disinterested exertions had inspired. In silent
		<lb/>eloquence, she again offered him the hand, that she
		<lb/>had just withdrawn; and <persName>Atherton</persName> pressed it to his
		<lb/>heart, with all the passion, which his active ardour
		<lb/>and a newly awakened enthusiasm could inspire.
		<lb/><persName>Miriam</persName> bent her head upon her bosom; she could
		<lb/>only articulate, in a tone of deep anxiety, <said>my
		  <lb/>father!</said> and burst into a flood of tears.</p>
	      <p><said>Your father is safe, I trust,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>I
		  <lb/>even now hear his voice from the beach, and will
		  <lb/>go and bring him to you</said> and he left her, believing
		<lb/>that, at such a moment, solitude would be most ac­
		<lb/>ceptable to her.</p>
	      <p>The party had all reached the shore in safety;
		<lb/>and <persName>Atherton</persName> found the young men reclining on the
		<lb/>ground, and <persName>Mr. Grey</persName> standing apart, with folded
		<lb/>arms, while <name>Rover</name> lay motionless and panting at
		<lb/>his feet, though, the moment he saw his master,
		<lb/>the faithful animal flew to meet him, wagging his
		<lb/>tail, and whining to attract his notice and caresses,
		<lb/>as a reward for his exertions. He had, indeed,
		<lb/>been of essential service to <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, whom, with
		<lb/>the sagacity of his nature he discovered to be the
		<lb/>most indifferent swimmer, and, by keeping fast

		<lb/>hold of his clothes, had greatly assisted him in
		<lb/>struggling through the waves. <persName>Atherton</persName> patted
		<lb/>him, with many kind expressions, which the dog
		<lb/>seemed perfectly to understand; but, at the sound
		<lb/>of his <choice><sic>vioce</sic><corr>voice</corr></choice>, <persName>Mr. Grey</persName> started, and turned sudden­
		<lb/>ly round, with a degree of animation, that strongly
		<lb/>contrasted with his usual calmness; and, grasping
		<lb/>his hand, he said, with energy—</p>
	      <p>
		<said>To you, young man, under God, I am, this
		  <lb/>night, indebted for the life of my only child; accept
		  <lb/>a father's blessing, and may the God of mercy re­
		  <lb/>ward you.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>You esteem my services too highly, sir,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>they were nothing more than duty and
		  <lb/>humanity enjoined; and I shall ever bless God for
		  <lb/>conducting me hither, in such an hour of need.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Again I thank you, young man,</said> said <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>,
		<lb/>in an accent of strong feeling; <said>and I trust we
		  <lb/>shall shortly meet again; but at present, my heart
		  <lb/>yearns to behold my daughter.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I will conduct you to her, sir,</said> returned <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName>; and he led the way to <persName>Miriam</persName>; but, without
		<lb/>intruding upon their interview, immediately re­
		<lb/>turned to the beach.</p>
	      <p><said>You have done us good service to-night, <persName>Major
		    <lb/>Atherton</persName>,</said> said <persName>Peregrine White</persName>, rising to meet
		<lb/>him, with extreme seriousness; <said>and I hold myself
		  <lb/>deeply indebted to you.</said></p>
	      <p><said>To your own exertions rather say,</said> replied

		  <lb/>keep afloat so long, on such a sea.</said></p>

	      <p><said>Ah! but when we struck on that rock!</said> answer­
		<lb/>ed <persName>Peregrine</persName>; <said>I shall never think of it, without
		  <lb/>shuddering; and, I am sure, we should never, all
		  <lb/>of us, have got away from it, but for your assist­
		  <lb/>ance. As for <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, he would not have held
		  <lb/>out long, but for the help of your dog; and I am
		  <lb/>sure, none of us could have beat the waves as you
		  <lb/>did, with <persName>Miriam</persName> tugging at your arm.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You speak without knowledge, <persName>Master Pere­
		    <lb/>grine</persName>,</said> said <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName>, who, perhaps, felt a
		<lb/>twinge of jealousy at <persName>Atherton's</persName> success; <said>of this
		  <lb/>be assured, that my arm should not have been slack
		  <lb/>to uphold the maiden, amidst the buffetings of the
		  <lb/>waves.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Your arm! <persName>Master Ashly</persName>,</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName>, los­
		<lb/>ing his brief fit of gravity; <said>why, you puffed like
		  <lb/>a porpoise, man, and, moreover, pulled at my arm,
		  <lb/>ever and anon, to keep your nostrils out of water,
		  <lb/>so that, for my own safety, I was obliged to shake
		  <lb/>you off, as the apostle <persName>Paul</persName> did the viper.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is your custom to use unseemly jests, <persName>Pere­

		<lb/>concerted; <said>but, nevertheless, I tell you, that I
		  <lb/>would have saved the damsel, <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, or
		  <lb/>perished with her.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Now, from the last mentioned act of kindness,
		  <lb/><persName>Mr. Ashly</persName>,</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName>, <said>I think she would
		  <lb/>hold herself excused; it is my mind, that she has
		  <lb/>seen enough of you, in this world, without going
		  <lb/>out of it in your company. So after all, we are
		  <lb/>obliged to my friend <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, for his as­
		  <lb/>sistance.</said></p>

	      <p><said>Consumed! friend <persName>Ashly</persName>,</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName>, <said>say
		  <lb/>drowned, washed away, any thing but consumed;
		  <lb/>it is a most far-fetched word in this frozen region,
		  <lb/>though I wish, most truly that some of these trees
		  <lb/>were consuming, for us to warm ourselves by; I
		  <lb/>am shivering with the cold;</said> and, as he spoke his
		<lb/>teeth began to chatter violently.</p>
	      <p><said>Our quarters are indeed uncomfortable,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>and, in our wet condition, it is perilous
		  <lb/>to remain here long; we had better make some ar­

		  <lb/>plight, either to go or stay.</said></p>
	      <p><said>The wind has subsided, and the tide is going
		  <lb/>down,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>perhaps, we can get the
		  <lb/>boat off, and return in it.</said></p>

		  <lb/>but there is <persName>Miriam</persName>, poor thing! tired enough, I
		  <lb/>suppose, and soaked through like a sponge, withal.
		  <lb/>I doubt, Major, you did not bring her through the

	      <p><said>This is one of our deliverers, <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> said her
		<lb/>father; <said>and he craves your notice for his late ser­
		  <lb/>vices.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Thou art a brave fellow,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, stooping
		<lb/>down to caress him; <said>and I can never, never forget
		  <lb/>thy services; but to-night I feel unable to express
		  <lb/>my obligations as I ought to any one.</said> She stole a
		<lb/>timid glance at <persName>Atherton</persName>, and again bent her face
		<lb/>upon the short curly hair of his dumb favourite.
		<lb/><said>What arrangements shall we make, sir, for our
		  <lb/>return home?</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, addressing <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>;
		<lb/><said>if <emph>we</emph> can endure cold and wet, I fear your daugh­
		  <lb/>ter will suffer severely from this long exposure.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I find a warm shelter within your cloak,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>though I ought not perhaps to deprive
		  <lb/>you of its comforts.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It would be rather an incumbrance to me,</said> re­

		  <lb/>its weight in walking; it was made for a soldier's
		  <lb/>wear, rough weather and a camp, not to shield the
		  <lb/>delicate form of a woman; though I am most happy
		  <lb/>if it can contribute to your comfort or protect you
		  <lb/>from danger.</said></p>
	      <p>A short consultation was then held; but it was
		<lb/>presently broken off by the unexpected appearance
		<lb/>of a bright flame rising at a short distance from
		<lb/>behind a copse of evergreens, and flashing its red
		<lb/>light upon the still troubled waters. While they
		<lb/>were yet looking and wondering, <persName>Peregrine White</persName>,
		<lb/>whose absence for a few moments they had scarce­
		<lb/>ly observed, came running towards them with an
		<lb/>exulting air.</p>
	      <p><said>Come and warm yourselves,</said> said he, <said>I found
		  <lb/>a few embers which were doubtless left by some
		  <lb/>charitable fishermen for our use, and have kindled
		  <lb/>a fire to cheer us before we take up our line of
		  <lb/>march.</said></p>
	      <p>So saying, he seized the arm of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>,
		<lb/>and hurried her along with great velocity in spite
		<lb/>of the cumbrous cloak which impeded her progress;
		<lb/>the rest of the party followed more leisurely, and
		<lb/>found a huge pile of underwood and dried branch­
		<lb/>es lighted up, which soon rendered them dry and
		<lb/>comfortable.</p>
	      <p><said>Here are some of the planks of our poor boat,</said><lb/>said <persName>Peregrine</persName>, <said>which the sea has washed ashore,
		  <lb/>and we may be thankful that none of us are cling­
		  <lb/>ing to them; but they make a bright flame to warm
		  <lb/>us.</said></p>

	      <p><said><persName>Master White</persName>,</said> said <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, <said>methinks your
		  <lb/>levity is ill-timed and unbecoming, after the signal
		  <lb/>mercy we have this night experienced; it behoves
		  <lb/>us to shew our thankfulness by a composed and
		  <lb/>cheerful deportment, but not to indulge in idle
		  <lb/>mirth.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I was never more serious in my life, sir, than I
		  <lb/>have been to-night,</said> returned <persName>Peregrine</persName>; <said>and that
		  <lb/>for an unusual length of time. But now, like <persName>Da­
		    <lb/>vid</persName> of old, I have washed myself, and would like
		  <lb/>him eat and drink with a hearty good will, if there
		  <lb/>was any thing to set before me.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Hark!</said> exclaimed <persName>Atherton</persName>, starting up, <said>if I
		  <lb/>mistake not, I hear the distant sound of oars.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is so,</said> said <persName>Ashly</persName>, <said>and yonder is a boat mov­
		  <lb/>ing over the waters.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You must be akin to the owl, <persName>Master Ashly</persName>, if
		  <lb/>you can see so far in the dark,</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName>;
		<lb/><said>but blow up the flame for a beacon, and I will
		  <lb/>crawl up the <placeName>Gurnet's Nose</placeName> with this brand; it
		  <lb/>would be a bad joke if they should pass us.</said></p>
	      <p>Snatching a flaming stick from the fire, he ran
		<lb/>quickly up the highest eminence, where now stands
		<lb/>the light-house, and waved it aloft as a signal of
		<lb/>distress; and they soon saw a stout boat with three
		<lb/>men in it, advancing towards the cove, which they
		<lb/>had vainly endeavoured to reach before striking
		<lb/>upon the rock. Every one approached the spot
		<lb/>with more or less haste, except <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, who
		<lb/>retained her station on the trunk of an uprooted
		<lb/>pine, from whence she could distinguish the various
		<pb n="140"/>

		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">140</mw>
		<lb/>figures in the broad glare of the flame, and distinct­
		<lb/>ly hear most of their conversation. <persName>Atherton</persName> was
		<lb/>the last to leave her; indeed he lingered near the
		<lb/>spot under various pretexts till <persName>Miriam</persName> observed,
		<lb/>with a smile,—</p>
	      <p>
		<said>I suspect, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, you fear from my
		  <lb/>drowsy countenance, that I shall fall asleep by this
		  <lb/>warm fire; but curiosity will keep me wakeful, for I
		  <lb/>am really all eagerness to learn who has visited our
		  <lb/>barren island.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Some one I hope who will soon convey you to a
		  <lb/>comfortable shelter,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>. <said>Your looks
		  <lb/>do indeed betray your fatigue and need of repose.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Nay, but you pay me an ill compliment,</said> return­
		<lb/>ed <persName>Miriam</persName>, playfully; <said>though I have no glass to
		  <lb/>consult, I had fancied this cloak extremely becom­
		  <lb/>ing; and thought that bright flame would not deny
		  <lb/>me the ruddy tinge it lavishes so freely on every
		  <lb/>other object.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Shall I be more gallant then,</said> replied <persName>Atherton</persName>,
		<lb/><said>and declare that <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> can require no ar­
		  <lb/>tificial aid to render her lovely!</said></p>
	      <p><said>No,</said> returned <persName>Miriam</persName>, in some confusion, <said>I
		  <lb/>did not intend to extort flattery from your lips.</said></p>
	      <p><said>The language of flattery is unknown to me,</said><lb/>said <persName>Atherton</persName>, turning his dark eyes full upon her
		<lb/>blushing face; <said>I speak only what truth and feel­
		  <lb/>ing dictate;</said> and bowing low he reluctantly quit­
		<lb/>ted her.</p>
	      <p><persName>Miriam Grey</persName> looked after him a moment with a

		<lb/>ed to regard attentively the wild scenery which sur­
		<lb/>rounded her; and particularly the group collected
		<lb/>on the shore, where the crimson flame glanced
		<lb/>brightly, giving a peculiar and at times fantastic
		<lb/>expression to their features, and reflecting their
		<lb/>dark shadows in the broken waves.</p>

		<lb/>springing from the boat, <said>what sort of a frolic is

	      <p><said>One of <persName>Beelzebub's</persName> tunes I think, Captain,</said><lb/>said <persName>Peregrine White</persName>; <said>and here is <persName>Hobamock</persName>, on

	      <p><said>Explain, boy, explain,</said> said the Captain, impa­

		  <lb/>older and wiser speak for you. But what means

		<lb/>surprise, as his kinsman that moment approached

	      <p><said>Yes,</said> resumed <persName>Peregrine</persName>; <said>he has been chief

		  <lb/>ed they had kept her on solid ground, this dark

	      <p><said>My daughter,</said> said <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, <said>is safe and

	      <p><said>You have done well, <persName>Edward</persName>,</said> said the Cap­

		  <lb/>us has ever yet turned his back upon danger!
		  <lb/>But I must know all, every thing that has hap­

	      <p><said>The substance of the matter is this;</said> answered
		<lb/><persName>Peregrine White</persName>; <said>our boat was driven on a rock
		  <lb/>by a violent head wind, and stove to pieces; and
		  <lb/>so being all fairly ducked in the sea, we made use
		  <lb/>of our fins to good advantage, and with the help of

		  <lb/>and sound, but unluckily found no <quote>barbarous
		    <lb/>people</quote> to <quote>shew us kindness.</quote></said></p>
	      <p><said>You were not in the boat then, cousin <persName>Ather­

	      <p><said>I was wandering on the beach,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>,
		<lb/>evading a direct answer; <said>and fortunately per­

		<pb n="144"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="12(6)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">144</mw>
		<lb/>Captain, <said>and it is no odd mistake for a stranger;
		  <lb/>we have not made broad <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> highways through
		  <lb/>our woods as yet; and you would hardly under­
		  <lb/>stand our rustic land-marks.</said></p>
	      <p><said>To what cause,</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>are we in­
		  <lb/>debted for the unexpected pleasure of seeing you.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Principally to <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName>,</said> replied the Cap­
		<lb/>tain, <said>with whom I must make you acquainted;</said>—
		<lb/>and he turned to address a young man who had
		<lb/>accompanied him in the boat, and was talking
		<lb/>apart with <persName>Mr. Grey</persName> and <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said><persName>Calvert</persName>!</said> repeated <persName>Atherton</persName> thoughtfully; for
		<lb/>the name sounded familiar, and he regarded with
		<lb/>more attention the stranger whom he had before
		<lb/>scarcely remarked. His figure was slight, but pe­
		<lb/>culiarly graceful; his complexion sallow; his
		<lb/>countenance strongly marked, and animated by
		<lb/>intelligent features and piercing black eyes, with
		<lb/>hair of the most jetty hue. There was a degree
		<lb/>of singularity in his appearance rather attractive
		<lb/>than pleasing; and <persName>Atherton</persName> as soon as he had
		<lb/>heard his voice, identified him as a native <name>Virgi­
		  <lb/>nian</name> who had been sent to <placeName>England</placeName> for some education,
		<lb/>and served some time as lieutenant in the same regi­
		<lb/>ment with himself; but quitted the profession about
		<lb/>two years previous, being recalled by the death of his
		<lb/>father, to take possession of a valuable plantation.
		<lb/><persName>Major Atherton</persName> knew that he was insinuating and
		<lb/>unprincipled, and master of those specious talents
		<lb/>and artful manners which enabled him to support
		<lb/>any character that suited his inclination; and he
		<pb n="145"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="13(1)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">145</mw>
		<lb/>was therefore not surprised to find him treated
		<lb/>with marked attention even by the scrupulous <persName>Mr<choice><sic/><corr>.</corr></choice>
		<lb/>Grey</persName>.</p>
	      <p>As <persName>Atherton</persName> advanced toward <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName> he
		<lb/>expressed his recognition by politely bowing,
		<lb/>which the latter instantly returned, at the same
		<lb/>time observing,—</p>
	      <p>
		<said>I did not anticipate the pleasure of meeting
		  <lb/>with <persName>Major Atherton</persName> in this new world.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>And the pleasure of seeing you, sir, was equal­
		  <lb/>ly unexpected,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>. <said>A voyage
		  <lb/>from your distant Province I have always consi­
		  <lb/>dered nearly as formidable as one from the parent
		  <lb/>country.</said></p>
	      <p><said>We endeavour to keep up a good neighbour­
		  <lb/>hood,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>and it is quite a deed of
		  <lb/>charity to convey intelligence occasionally through
		  <lb/>our thinly scattered settlements; not to mention
		  <lb/>the powerful suggestions of interest, or the old-
		  <lb/>fashioned claims of friendship.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It was a good chance at any rate which brought
		  <lb/>you here to-night,</said> said <persName>Peregrine White</persName>; <said>for
		  <lb/>though I don't exactly know how, the Captain says
		  <lb/>we are indebted to you for succour.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Not exactly so;</said> returned <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName>. <said>I
		  <lb/>arrived at <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> about noon to-day; and early
		  <lb/>in the evening crossed the Bay to visit <persName>Captain
		    <lb/>Standish</persName>. I found him very uneasy about his
		  <lb/>friends; and as I had felt the violence of the wind
		  <lb/>in my short passage, which boded no good to so
		  <lb/>light a skiff as he told me you were in, I proposed

		  <lb/>enlisting <persName>Hobamock</persName> in my service and sailing out
		  <lb/>in quest of you. The Captain insisted on accom­
		  <lb/>panying me, and we were soon directed in our
		  <lb/>course by your blazing watch fire, though it also
		  <lb/>excited considerable anxiety respecting your situa­
		  <lb/>tion.</said></p>
	      <p><said>We have cause to regret the trouble and con­
		  <lb/>cern you have sustained on our account,</said> said <persName>Mr.
		  <lb/>Grey</persName>, <said>though Providence has doubtless permitted
		  <lb/>it for some wise and benevolent purpose.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Peradventure for the trial of our faith and
		  <lb/>love,</said> said <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>I dare say there will some love come out of it,</said><lb/>whispered <persName>Peregrine White</persName> to <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>and I
		  <lb/>do believe after all, <persName>Master Ashly</persName> would rather
		  <lb/>have been drowned with <persName>Miriam</persName> than have had
		  <lb/>you save her.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is my mind,</said> said <persName>Captain Standish</persName>, <said>that
		  <lb/>we had better think of returning home; the night
		  <lb/>wanes, and my little rose-bud I know begins to
		  <lb/>droop her head.</said></p>
	      <p>So saying he walked with hasty steps to <persName>Miriam
		  <lb/>Grey</persName>, and had exhausted a score of congratulations
		<lb/>before his more tardy companions could overtake
		<lb/>him; though the echo of a hearty salute, which he
		<lb/>bestowed on her cheek, reached them even at a
		<lb/>distance.</p>
	      <p><said>That went off like a cannon ball!</said> cried <persName>Pere­
		  <lb/>grine White</persName>. <said>I should think, Captain, you were
		  <lb/>charging the enemy with a full round of grape
		  <lb/>shot!</said></p>
	      <pb n="147"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="13(2)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">147</mw>
	      <p><said>Have a care, young man,</said> said the Captain, <said>or
		  <lb/>I will give you a shot about the ears, that will
		  <lb/>make you cry out for quarter, before you can have
		  <lb/>time to retreat.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Miriam</persName> at that moment, rose to receive <persName>Mr. Cal­
		  <lb/>vert</persName>, who greeted her with the familiarity of long
		<lb/>acquaintance; and taking her passive hand, con­
		<lb/>veyed it to his lips, with the most easy gallantry,
		<lb/>leaving <persName>Atherton</persName> at a loss, whether the bright
		<lb/>blush which mantled her cheeks, was excited by
		<lb/>pleasure or bashfulness; and before he could solve
		<lb/>the doubt to his own satisfaction, she was leaning
		<lb/>on her father's arm, and directing her steps to the
		<lb/>boat. The sea was still rough, and the wind keen,
		<lb/>though it had tacked about to a point more favoura­
		<lb/>ble for their progress; but <persName>Miriam</persName> could not avoid
		<lb/>shuddering, as she entered the boat, and again en­
		<lb/>trusted her safety to the keeping of the elements,
		<lb/>from whose wrath she had so severely and recently
		<lb/>suffered. These natural emotions were, however,
		<lb/>transient, and passed away even before the bark
		<lb/>had glided from the cove, which was still burnish­
		<lb/>ed with the light of the expiring fire.</p>
	      <p><persName>Captain Standish</persName> would allow no one to share
		<lb/>with himself and <persName>Hobamock</persName> the toil of rowing,
		<lb/>insisting that they were fresh and vigorous, and
		<lb/>the others wearied by exertion; and claimed, as
		<lb/>his only recompence, that they would proceed no
		<lb/>farther than his house that night; where he had
		<lb/>ordered preparations to be made for their accom­
		<lb/>modation, in case of need. His hospitality was
		<pb n="148"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="13(2)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">148</mw>
		<lb/>cheerfully accepted by all, but <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName>, whose
		<lb/>affairs obliged him to return to <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>; and as
		<lb/>it was agreed that <persName>Hobamock</persName> should go with him,
		<lb/>to convey intelligence of their safety, to the friends
		<lb/>of those who remained behind.</p>
	      <p>The little party then sunk into almost total si­
		<lb/>lence, each apparently exhausted in spirits; and
		<lb/>the boat moved slowly over the heavy waves, while
		<lb/>at intervals, the <name>Indian</name> burst into a low, solemn
		<lb/>chaunt, in the harsh and guttural language of his
		<lb/>nation. The animated voice of the Captain, at
		<lb/>length roused them.</p>
	      <p><said>Haul up, <persName>Hobamock</persName>,</said> he said; <said>here we are
		  <lb/>safe and ready to land.</said></p>
	      <p>As he spoke, the boat was made fast to the shore,
		<lb/>and all, except <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName> and the <name>Indian</name>, leaped
		<lb/>from it with joyful hearts, and proceeded to the
		<lb/>house, which stood at no great distance.</p>
	      <p><persName>Mistress Saveall</persName>, <persName>Captain Standish's</persName> provident
		<lb/>housekeeper, rightly judging, from her master's
		<lb/>prolonged absence, that he would not return unac­
		<lb/>companied by those, whom he went out to succour,
		<lb/>had piled high the blazing logs in the ample fire
		<lb/>place, and marshalled round it a goodly row of
		<lb/>comfortable elbow chairs, ready for their reception.
		<lb/>As they entered the room, she was, with bustling
		<lb/>activity, preparing a liberal table to satisfy their
		<lb/>farther wants, though the disordered appearance
		<lb/>of the guests so strongly excited her curiosity, and
		<lb/>her ears were so fully engrossed by the conversa­
		<lb/>tion, from which she hoped to gather an account of
		<pb n="149"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="13(3)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">149</mw>
		<lb/>what had passed, that her task proceeded very
		<lb/>slowly, when a sharp rebuke from the Captain,
		<lb/>whose commands were equally peremptory in his
		<lb/>house and garrison—discharged her from the room
		<lb/>with the swiftness of an arrow, though her counte­
		<lb/>nance, for some time, marked her resentment of the
		<lb/>indignity. In a few minutes, a substantial repast
		<lb/>engrossed the attention of every one; and the culi­
		<lb/>nary skill of <persName>Mistress Saveall</persName> was discussed, so
		<lb/>much to her satisfaction,—for the worthy dame was
		<lb/>seldom out of hearing,—that her smiles and exer­
		<lb/>tions were speedily redoubled, and the late affront
		<lb/>seemed quite forgotten.</p>
	      <p><said>Let <persName>Mistress Saveall</persName> alone for cooking, to my

		  <lb/>Grey</persName>, whose countenance evinced a slight degree
		<lb/>of vexation, mingled with an expression of archness,
		<lb/>which increased, as she stole a glance from under
		<lb/>her long eye-lashes at her abashed lover; while
		<lb/><persName>Captain Standish</persName> indulged in a long and loud
		<lb/>laugh.</p>
	      <p><said>You whisper over loud, <persName>master Peregrine</persName>,</said> he
		<lb/>said, at its conclusion; <said>but we never mind you;

		<lb/>plate with a quantity of broken corn, boiled, and

		<lb/>tinued,—</p>
	      <p>
		<said>I dare say, Captain, this corn is descended from
		  <lb/>the very ears, you had the christian charity to steal
		  <lb/>from the poor <name>Indians</name>, when you first landed in
		  <lb/>their dominions.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Young man,</said> said <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, in a severe tone,
		<lb/><said rend="pre()"><choice><sic><corr>‘</corr></sic></choice>you speak lightly, or are ill-informed of that which
		  <lb/>your fathers have done in this wilderness. Provi­
		  <lb/>dence, which manifestly brought us out from our
		  <lb/>native land, and watched over us in all our straits,
		  <lb/>was pleased, in our hour of extremity, to avert the
		  <lb/>horrors of famine, by conducting our steps to the
		  <lb/>subterranean granaries of the idolatrous heathen,
		  <lb/>whereby we were supplied with food to eat, and
		  <lb/>seed for the future harvest.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And left the owners thereof to starve,</said> returned
		<lb/>the unabashed youth. <said>That was a way of cutting
		  <lb/>off the enemy without the trouble of driving them
		  <lb/>out before you, to come into possession of their good­
		  <lb/>ly inheritance.</said></p>
	      <p><said>We did them no injustice,</said> resumed <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>;
		<lb/><said>we found the country desolate and deserted for ma­
		  <lb/>ny leagues from the coast, as we afterwards learn­
		  <lb/>ed by reason of a great plague which the Lord had
		  <lb/>visited upon this people who knew him not. In the
		  <lb/>succeeding autumn we sent an embassy to <persName>Aspinet</persName>,
		  <lb/>sachem of the <name>Nauset</name> tribe, from whom we had ta­
		  <lb/>ken the corn, to repay them from our substance that
		  <lb/>which they demanded as recompense; and they

		  <lb/>having sufficient left for their own use, were well
		  <lb/>satisfied to <emph>truck</emph> with us.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I suppose,</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName>, <said>you paid them for
		  <lb/>their grain, with rusty penknives and glass beads.</said></p>
	      <p><said>They have found to their cost,</said> replied the Cap­
		<lb/>tain, <said>that we know how to pay off our debts, even
		  <lb/>with good round shot and cold steel. It is my mind,
		  <lb/>they would not greet us again with a shower of ar­
		  <lb/>rows when we came to take peaceable possession of
		  <lb/>the land in God's name and the king's.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Strange enough,</said> observed <persName>Peregrine White</persName>,
		<lb/><said>that the dusky rascals should not be willing to
		  <lb/>give up their rights to us comely white people!</said></p>
	      <p><said>At least,</said> said the Captain, <said>they have learned
		  <lb/>to fear us, and that with a very few lessons; aye,
		  <lb/>they took to their heels at the first musket shot, on­
		  <lb/>ly one fellow dared defend himself, behind a tree,
		  <lb/>and he soon ran after the rest, with half a score of
		  <lb/>our bullets in him.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Hark! it is raining fast,</said> exclaimed <persName>Peregrine
		  <lb/>White</persName>, <said>I am right glad that we went no farther
		  <lb/>to-night.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I wish we had prevailed on <persName>Calvert</persName> to remain,</said><lb/>said the Captain; <said>he will be half drowned ere he
		  <lb/>get to <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Why did you not persuade him to stay, <persName>Miriam</persName>?</said><lb/>asked <persName>Peregrine</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>To tell the truth, I scarcely thought of it,</said> re­
		<lb/>turned the damsel; <said>and if I had, should probably
		  <lb/>have had no interest with him.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Do you think so?</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName>, significant­
		<pb n="153"/>

		<lb/>ly; <said>with your leave I should like to whisper a
		  <lb/>word in your ear.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You will not have my leave to be so uncivil,</said><lb/>said <persName>Miriam</persName>, smiling; <said>besides, your whispers are
		  <lb/>apt to be very audible.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Another time will do, then,</said> returned <persName>Peregrine</persName>,
		<lb/>as they all rose from the table; and soon after <persName>Cap­
		  <lb/>tain Standish</persName> caused his household to assemble and
		<lb/>close the day with their customary devotions, which
		<lb/>on that evening were rendered peculiarly impres­
		<lb/>sive, by the circumstances of danger and difficulty
		<lb/>from which so many present had been providential­
		<lb/>ly delivered. The psalm selected as a portion of
		<lb/>the exercise, chanced to be one which <persName>Atherton</persName> had
		<lb/>often heard warbled from the lips of his mother;
		<lb/>and it awakened associations that thrilled his heart
		<lb/>with sad yet pleasing recollections, and compelled
		<lb/>him, almost involuntarily, to unite in the song of
		<lb/>praise and thanksgiving, which arose like a cloud
		<lb/>of incense from the family altar of the <name>puritans</name>. He
		<lb/>caught the eye of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, as his fine and
		<lb/>manly voice mingled with her own, and a false note
		<lb/>from which she instantly recovered, shewed a mo­
		<lb/>mentary abstraction of mind, that was however per­
		<lb/>fectly natural, and perhaps shared with her by all
		<lb/>who heard him; for in those days of rigid separa­
		<lb/>tion, when every sect proclaimed by actions, if not
		<lb/>in word, <quote>stand off, for I am holier than thou;</quote>
		<lb/>the act of countenancing, much more of assisting
		<lb/>each other, in their different forms of worship, ar­
		<lb/>gued an unusual degree of lenity or an unpardon­
		<pb n="154"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="13(5)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">154</mw>
		<lb/>able indifference to prevailing modes and opinions.
		<lb/>The family and guests soon after separated for the
		<lb/>night; and <persName>Mistress Saveall</persName> insisted on attending
		<lb/><persName>Miriam Grey</persName> to her chamber, to administer a com­
		<lb/>posing draught which she had prepared, to ward off
		<lb/>the effects of her recent exposure.</p>
	      <p>The opening and closing of doors, and tread of
		<lb/>footsteps above and around the apartment of <persName>Major
		  <lb/>Atherton</persName>, was succeeded by a profound silence
		<lb/>throughout the house, long before he could divert his
		<lb/>thoughts from the events of the evening; and the
		<lb/>occurrences of the few last weeks, which had so
		<lb/>strongly impressed his imagination, as to banish
		<lb/>from his pillow the repose which his late exertions
		<lb/>rendered necessary. The situation into which he
		<lb/>was so unexpectedly cast, possessed a tinge of ro­
		<lb/>mance peculiarly calculated to excite the enthusi­
		<lb/>asm of his character, at a moment too, when he was
		<lb/>gradually recovering from a deep depression of spi­
		<lb/>rits, occasioned by the loss of a parent whom he
		<lb/>devotedly loved, and the subsequent abandonment
		<lb/>of a profession, on which he had, with well founded
		<lb/>ambition, rested his future hopes of glory and ad­
		<lb/>vancement.</p>
	      <p>Till that period arms had been his passion, and
		<lb/>fame his mistress; and when obliged to relinquish
		<lb/>them, he had turned with restless eagerness to the
		<lb/>shores of the new world, as a scene where he might
		<lb/>again find exercise for the energy and activity of
		<lb/>his mind. At a distance, he had listened with in­
		<lb/>terest to descriptions of its local advantages, its
		<pb n="155"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="13(6)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">155</mw>
		<lb/>majestic scenery, and its rising importance. He
		<lb/>had regarded it as an asylum for the persecuted,
		<lb/>and the future home of a free and virtuous people.
		<lb/>On a near approach, he found that description had
		<lb/>fallen short of reality; and fancy but faintly por­
		<lb/>trayed the magnificence of its untamed landscapes.
		<lb/>He viewed with astonishment and admiration, its
		<lb/>gigantic mountains, its lofty hills and fruitful val­
		<lb/>leys; its boundless forests, its dashing torrents, and
		<lb/>broad and fertilizing rivers. Where the wildness
		<lb/>of nature had yielded to the hand of cultivation,
		<lb/>villages were arising, and the soil teemed with all
		<lb/>the rich and varied bounties which could spring up
		<lb/>to reward the labours of the husbandman. He re­
		<lb/>garded too, the men whom the prejudiced and world­
		<lb/>ly minded stigmatized as bigots, and seditious en­
		<lb/>thusiasts; they were men who had forsaken power,
		<lb/>and riches, and distinction, for the <quote>gospel's sake;</quote>
		<lb/>who with holy lives and blameless conversation,
		<lb/>shared with each other the tender charities of life,
		<lb/>and the sweetness of social and domestic inter­
		<lb/>course; while many whom opportunity favour­
		<lb/>ed, had drunk deeply at the fountain of intellectual
		<lb/>knowledge. He admired the wisdom of their poli­
		<lb/>tical compact, which, while it rendered them sub­
		<lb/>servient to the laws of <placeName>England</placeName>, provided for the
		<lb/>internal peace and prosperity of the colony, the ad­
		<lb/>ministration of justice, and the promotion of order,
		<lb/>piety and learning. If their doctrines were cen­
		<lb/>sured as intolerant, and their morals as too rigid,
		<lb/>it was an extreme produced by the spirit of the
		<pb n="156"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="13(6)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">156</mw>
		<lb/>times, and which might naturally appear essential
		<lb/>to those who had separated from a church, which
		<lb/>under the influence of a dissolute court and vindic­
		<lb/>tive prelacy, openly countenanced vice, and secret­
		<lb/>ly connived at bribery and corruption.</p>
	      <p>Yet there were softer thoughts, and fairer ima­
		<lb/>ges, imprinted on the mind of <persName>Atherton</persName>. The lovely
		<lb/>figure of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, her playful sweetness, the
		<lb/>brilliant beauty of her countenance, its spirit and
		<lb/>intelligence, the graceful timidity and unaffected
		<lb/>artlessness of her manners, were all registered in
		<lb/>his memory, and delineated on his heart. In his
		<lb/>native land, he had seen as fair, perhaps fairer
		<lb/>maidens: the gay, the beautiful, and high-born;
		<lb/>and the smiling idol of a courtly throng, and the rustic
		<lb/>belle, whose charms relieved the dulness of country
		<lb/>quarters, had alternately claimed from him the
		<lb/>brief homage of a compliment, or the passing tri­
		<lb/>bute of a sigh; but never, till now, had he felt the
		<lb/>sorcery of a woman's eye, or the resistless spell
		<lb/>which sports in her smile and lurks beneath her
		<lb/>blushes. Romance lent her aid to heighten the en­
		<lb/>chantment, and involved him in her shadowy but
		<lb/>delightful mazes. A lover of music, and himself
		<lb/>well skilled in the harmony of sweet sounds, from
		<lb/>the moment he had listened to the voice of <persName>Miriam</persName>,
		<lb/>on the evening of his arrival, his curiosity had been
		<lb/>awakened, and the transient glimpse he soon ob­
		<lb/>tained of her, deepened that curiosity to a powerful
		<lb/>interest. It was a vision, of which he had never
		<lb/>dreamed, and, least of all, expected to realize,
		<pb n="157"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="14(1)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">157</mw>
		<lb/>amidst the wild scenery of <placeName>New-England</placeName>. Every
		<lb/>succeeding interview increased his interest, and
		<lb/>the late scene, which seemed so closely to connect
		<lb/>them, kindled the latent spark into enthusiasm.
		<lb/>As yet, however, it had not become a sentiment,
		<lb/>but a pleasing fancy which future circumstances
		<lb/>were to enliven or destroy; but it was already
		<lb/>sufficiently powerful to engross his midnight
		<lb/>thoughts, and the rain had ceased to beat against
		<lb/>the casements, and the moon shone brightly on his
		<lb/>uncurtained bed, long before his eyelids were clo­
		<lb/>sed in slumber.</p>
	      <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> slept long enough, on the fol­
		<lb/>lowing morning, to make amends for the restless­
		<lb/>ness of the night; and <persName>Captain Standish</persName> and his
		<lb/>guests had been some time assembled, before he
		<lb/>joined them in the breakfast room. He was ap­
		<lb/>prised of his remissness, as he was descending the
		<lb/>stairs, by the impatient voice of <persName>Mistress Saveall</persName>
		<lb/>rising from the kitchen, who declared to <persName>David</persName>,
		<lb/>that <said>the venison steak were well nigh done to
		  <lb/>death, and all because the Captain would wait for
		  <lb/>the young Major to get up.</said> <said>And I am sure</said> re­
		<lb/>sponded <persName>David</persName>, who was pounding corn with all
		<lb/>his might between two stones, <said>if <persName>Master Ashly</persName>
		  <lb/>should be for making one of his long prayers, the
		  <lb/>chocolate will be clear boiled away.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName>, thus warned of his tardiness,
		<lb/>expected to be greeted with raillery by his kins­
		<lb/>man, but the Captain was struck with the unusual

		<lb/>languor of his countenance, and, as he entered the
		<lb/>parlour exclaimed,――</p>
	      <p>
		<said>Well, cousin <persName>Atherton</persName>, I thought something
		  <lb/>must ail you, to keep you in bed so long; and here
		  <lb/>you are, looking as pale as a <rs type="properAdjective">Dutch</rs> ghost.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>I know not how I could oversleep myself so
		  <lb/>strangely, on so bright a morning as this,</said> return­
		<lb/>ed <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>you have a capricious climate, Cap­
		  <lb/>tain, and storms and sunshine succeed each other
		  <lb/>so rapidly, that we have scarcely time to guard
		  <lb/>against the one, or enjoy the other. Last evening,
		  <lb/>I scarcely expected to see blue sky again for a
		  <lb/>week at least.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Our southerly gales,</said> said the Captain, <said>are
		  <lb/>short and violent; and, had you asked me, I could
		  <lb/>have told you, last night, that it would be fair
		  <lb/>weather to-day. But that is nothing to the pur­
		  <lb/>pose; so tell me truly now, if that confounded
		  <lb/>game of swimming has not washed away your
		  <lb/>colour, and given you a cold.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I am perfectly well,</said> replied <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said rend="pre()">and I
		  <lb/>believe my colour is not on the surface, to be rub­
		  <lb/>bed off so easily.</said></p>
	      <p><said>As for that,</said> said the Captain, <said>my little rose-­
		  <lb/>bud here, has generally as bright a tinge as most
		  <lb/>damsels, on her cheek; but just look at her now,
		  <lb/>she is as wan and drooping as a lily.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName> <emph>was</emph> looking at her, and with an anx­
		<lb/>ious expression, which, as his eyes encountered
		<lb/>those of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, suffused her face with the
		<lb/>deepest blush, which again gradually faded into its
		<lb/>former paleness.</p>

	      <milestone unit="sig" n="14(2)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">159</mw>
	      <p><said>How now?</said> said the Captain, regarding her
		<lb/>with attention; <said>I believe the girl is feverish, such
		  <lb/>a flush, and all for nothing; <persName>Mistress Saveall</persName> must
		  <lb/>steep you some more of her herbs, and mess you
		  <lb/>up, in her way.</said></p>
	      <p><said>No, no,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName> laughing,<choice><sic>’</sic><corr/></choice>
		<said rend="pre()">I only wanted
		  <lb/>to contradict you, Captain; and, not daring to do
		  <lb/>it with my lips, conjured up that colour, which was
		  <lb/>a modest way of saying you are mistaken, sir.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And a very pretty way, truly,</said> returned the
		<lb/>Captain, <said>and I were a few years younger, <persName>Miriam</persName>,
		  <lb/>there is no knowing what effect it would have upon
		  <lb/>my heart.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Now I pray you, Captain,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, blush­
		<lb/>ing more deeply than before, probably from ob­
		<lb/>serving the gaze of <persName>Atherton</persName>, who was admiring
		<lb/>the bright glow—<said>do not give me the trouble of
		  <lb/>trying it again; to tell you the truth, I have a keen
		  <lb/>appetite this morning, and have been wishing for
		  <lb/>breakfast, for the last half hour or two.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I am sorry to have caused so much delay by
		  <lb/>my indolence,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>Nay,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName> gaily <said>but you must take
		  <lb/>more leisure, if you mean to apologise, <persName>Major
		    <lb/>Atherton</persName>; there is <persName>master Peregrine</persName>, looking very
		  <lb/>hungry; and my father, I know, is in haste to re­
		  <lb/>turn home.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, had expressed a wish, to return, as
		<lb/>early as possible to <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>. <persName>Captain Standish</persName>,
		<lb/>therefore ordered a boat to be prepared; and, soon
		<lb/>after breakfast, they were all in readiness to de­

		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">160</mw>
		<lb/>part. <persName>Atherton</persName> felt a strong desire to go with
		<lb/>them, which he was hesitating to make known,
		<lb/>when the Captain said,</p>
	      <p>
		<said>I had thoughts of taking a trip with you, <persName>Mr.
		    <lb/>Grey</persName>, if it pleased you to accept my company, and
		  <lb/>cousin <persName>Atherton's</persName>; but, on second thoughts, he had
		  <lb/>enough of the water last night, and had better rest
		  <lb/>awhile.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Indeed, sir,</said> replied <persName>Atherton</persName>,<choice><sic>’</sic><corr/></choice> <said rend="pre()"><choice><sic/><corr>‘</corr></choice>I am perfectly
		  <lb/>well; and, if not, this elastic air might restore
		  <lb/>health to an invalid.</said></p>
	      <p><said>We have many such days in autumn,</said> said the
		<lb/>Captain; <said>and if <persName>Hobamock</persName> were here, I think he
		  <lb/>would predict an <name>Indian summer</name> to us, after this
		  <lb/>storm; so we will see you soon, <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, and I
		  <lb/>will teach <persName>Major Atherton</persName> to harvest corn this
		  <lb/>morning.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName> tried not to look vexed, though he real­
		<lb/>ly felt so; and <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, with much cordiality,
		<lb/>expressed a hope that he should see him as soon,
		<lb/>and as often as he could find it convenient; a hope
		<lb/>which <persName>Atherton</persName> fancied was confirmed by <persName>Miri­
		  <lb/>am's</persName> eyes, and to which he yielded a ready assent.</p>
	      <p><said>All's ready,</said> said <persName>Peregrine White</persName>; <said>so good

		  <lb/>us all adrift again:</said> and, looking back, he called
		<lb/>out, <said>I pray you, Captain, to look sharp at your
		  <lb/>corn, and not teach <persName>Major Atherton</persName> to bind it into
		  <lb/>sheafs, like wheat, as you did me once, I can tell

	      <p><said>It would be well, if he had no other trouble with
		  <lb/>you,</said> said the Captain. <said><persName>Master Peregrine</persName>,</said> he
		<lb/>added to <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>is like a king's jester, privi­
		  <lb/>leged to say aught that pleases him, without giv­
		  <lb/>ing offence; and if he is rude at times, we don't
		  <lb/>mind him; for the lad means well and is kind at
		  <lb/>heart, though he has come near being spoiled by
		  <lb/>indulgence. His father died soon after birth,
		  <lb/>and I suppose the Governor does not care to
		  <lb/>meddle much with his mother's management.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is natural, that he should not,</said> said <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName> who answered almost mechanically; for his
		<lb/>eyes were following the boat, as it shot rapidly
		<lb/>across the Bay; and he was perhaps admiring
		<lb/>the deep blue of the heavens, the glassy smoothness
		<lb/>of the waters, dimpled by the dipping oars, and
		<lb/>slightly furrowed by the track of the light vessel,
		<lb/>which soon dwindled to a fairy skiff. The figure
		<lb/>of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> was no longer distinguishable,
		<lb/>and <persName>Atherton</persName>, whistling carelessly to his dog, re­
		<lb/>turned to the house.</p>

	      <p>As <persName>Captain Standish</persName> was reviewing the labour
		<lb/>of his fields after dinner with <persName>Major Atherton</persName>,
		<lb/>they observed <persName>Hobamock</persName> approaching towards
		<lb/>them, on the road from <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>.</p>
	      <p><said>There comes my trusty messenger,</said> said the
		<lb/>Captain; <said>I wonder what brings him back here
		  <lb/>to-day.</said></p>
	      <p><said>He seems swift-footed,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>;
		<lb/><said>and you must find him very serviceable in your
		  <lb/>colony.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Yes,</said> replied the Captain, <said>and he is shrewd
		  <lb/>and faithful, and moreover exceedingly brave, be­
		  <lb/>ing what the <name>Indians</name> call a <term>Paniese</term>, which means
		  <lb/>a chief of great courage who, they think, has had
		  <lb/>intercourse with the devil, to render him invinci­
		  <lb/>ble.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Has he resided long with you?</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>He came to us, within a year after we landed
		  <lb/>and we have since employed him in our service.
		  <lb/>He has been our interpreter and guide, amongst
		  <lb/>the savage tribes, and a good soldier too, after his
		  <pb n="163"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="14(4)r"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">163</mw>
		  <lb/>manner, in all our <choice><sic>engagments</sic><corr>engagements</corr></choice>. But he begins to
		  <lb/>lose the agility of youth. I doubt civilization does
		  <lb/>not agree with him.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><persName>Hobamock</persName>, at that moment, stood before them
		<lb/>bowing with profound respect.</p>
	      <p><said>Well <persName>Hobamock</persName>, what news do you bring us?</said><lb/>said the Captain.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>No news, Captain; come to walk, and see if
		  <lb/>you want me for do any thing.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>No, nothing;</said> returned the Captain; <said>but stop;
		  <lb/>have any vessels come into <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, this day or
		  <lb/>two?</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>Yes, one last night, from the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>;
		  <lb/>and young <persName>Master Weldon</persName>, come in him.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said><persName>Master Weldon</persName>, ha! well we must brush up
		  <lb/>for a wedding, <persName>Edward</persName>; that is <persName>Lois Grey's</persName> lover.
		  <lb/>You may go into the house <persName>Hobamock</persName>, and tell
		  <lb/><persName>Mistress Saveall</persName> to give you something to eat.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>The <name>Indian</name> obeyed with alacrity.</p>
	      <p><said>I think,</said> continued the Captain, <said>if you please,
		  <lb/>cousin <persName>Atherton</persName>, we will go to the old town, this
		  <lb/>afternoon; I should like to see <persName>Henry Weldon</persName>,
		  <lb/>and it is long since we were at the Governor's.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I will go with pleasure;</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>do
		  <lb/>you try the land or water?</said></p>
	      <p><said>Land, I think,</said> replied the Captain,<choice><sic>’</sic><corr/></choice> <said rend="pre()"><choice><sic/><corr>‘</corr></choice>I have
		  <lb/>two horses, and you may take your choice of
		  <lb/>them.</said></p>
	      <p>In a short time they were both mounted, and on
		<lb/>the way to <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>; and quickly clearing the
		<lb/>intermediate woods, the village and harbour lay in
		<lb/>full prospect before them.</p>

	      <p><said>There is the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>' shallop,</said> said the
		<lb/>Captain; <said>she has been here before, on trading
		  <lb/>voyages, and that stout pinnace, at anchor near
		  <lb/>her, must be the <name>Virginian</name>. I will warrant, there
		  <lb/>is a goodly hoard of tobacco stowed away in her.</said></p>
	      <p><said><persName>Mr. Calvert</persName> seems well known to you,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>has he made frequent voyages to <placeName>New-
		    <lb/>England</placeName>?</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>Only one, about a year since; but he cultivates
		  <lb/>a large plantation, and has often sent vessels here,
		  <lb/>and to the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>. He has ever dealt ho­
		  <lb/>nourably with us, and conducted himself discreetly,
		  <lb/>so as to gain the good will of the people; but you
		  <lb/>probably know more of him that we do?</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>I saw him seldom, except on duty, even when
		  <lb/>we served together;</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>. <said>But here
		  <lb/>are two roads, which of them shall we take?</said></p>
	      <p><said>You can go on to <persName>Mr. Grey's</persName>, if you like,</said> re­
		<lb/>turned the Captain, <said rend="pre()">and I will shortly join you
		  <lb/>there; I have some business, that leads me first
		  <lb/>in the opposite direction.</said></p>
	      <p>They accordingly separated, and a few moments
		<lb/>brought <persName>Major Atherton</persName> to the residence of <persName>Mr.
		  <lb/>Grey</persName>. He alighted and fastening his horse to the
		<lb/>wooden paling, knocked at the outer door. No
		<lb/>one appeared, and after repeating the knock se­
		<lb/>veral times, without being heard, he ventured to
		<lb/>lift the latch, and enter a small apartment, which
		<lb/>seemed to be the usual sitting room. It was ex­
		<lb/>tremely neat, and conveniently furnished but un­
		<lb/>occupied; and <persName>Atherton</persName>, while waiting for some

		<lb/>person to answer his summons, had leisure to
		<lb/>examine every object which it contained. True,
		<lb/>there was nothing remarkable in it; the heavy
		<lb/>chairs, the wooden-framed looking-glass, and
		<lb/>carved oaken table, though brightly polished by
		<lb/>time and industry, might be seen in any other
		<lb/>place; there was a beaufet too, carefully decorat­
		<lb/>ed with china and a few vessels of massive plate;
		<lb/>and over the fire-place hung a piece of embroid­
		<lb/>ery, representing the <placeName>garden of Paradise</placeName>, in all its
		<lb/>original splendour. It was crowded with a gay
		<lb/>assortment of colours, wrought into flowers and
		<lb/>birds, and <quote>all manner of four-footed beasts,</quote>—
		<lb/>and some with no feet at all,—with our first pa­
		<lb/>rents standing under the <quote>tree of good and evil,</quote>
		<lb/>which spread forth its goodly branches, loaded with
		<lb/>a kind of non-descript fruit, of a tempting red and
		<lb/>yellow. Around the trunk, a serpent of prodi­
		<lb/>gious dimensions had awfully twined himself,
		<lb/>stretching out his head to gaze at the guilty pair,
		<lb/>with eyes that resembled bullets.</p>
	      <p>The ingenious specimen of female industry bore
		<lb/>the date of <date when="1616">1616</date>; it could not, therefore, be the
		<lb/>production of <persName>Miriam's</persName> needle; and <persName>Atherton</persName>, in
		<lb/>turning from it was attracted by a small <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs>
		<lb/>basket of curious workmanship. Some unfinished
		<lb/>work lay in it, with several implements of house­
		<lb/>wifery, as if recently left, and probably he thought
		<lb/>by <persName>Miriam</persName> herself. He had taken up, and was
		<lb/>examining with the eye of a connoisseur, a pocket-
		<lb/>book of famous tent-stitch, when the door opened,
		<pb n="166"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="14(5)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">166</mw>
		<lb/>and not <persName>Miriam</persName>—but a tidy looking house-maid
		<lb/>entered. She started with some surprise on seeing
		<lb/>a stranger, and so employed, and <persName>Atherton</persName> hastily
		<lb/>replacing the basket and its contents, enquired for
		<lb/><persName>Mr. Grey</persName>. The family were all from home, and
		<lb/>it was uncertain when they would return.</p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName> left the house in disappointment; and
		<lb/>remounting his horse, struck into a bye-way which
		<lb/>led in a circuitous route to the Governors. He
		<lb/>was presently surprised to hear the quick trampling,
		<lb/>as of several horses approaching him, in that unfre­
		<lb/>quented road; and on turning a sudden angle, he
		<lb/>came in full view of two damsels mounted on a
		<lb/>spirited palfrey; nor did it require a second glance,
		<lb/>to convince him, that the light maiden who rode
		<lb/>with so much grace, and managed her steed with
		<lb/>such ease and dexterity, was <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>; and,
		<lb/>on a pillion behind her he recollected the features
		<lb/>of her cousin <persName>Lois</persName>. <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName>, apparently in
		<lb/>high spirits, followed close in the rear, for there was
		<lb/>not room for two abreast; and <persName>Atherton</persName> caught the
		<lb/>gay tones of his voice as <persName>Miriam</persName> at the moment,
		<lb/>looked back to speak with him.</p>
	      <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> drew up on one side to let them
		<lb/>pass; and <persName>Miriam</persName>, as soon as she saw him, checked
		<lb/>her horse and looked, as if hesitating whether to
		<lb/>speak or wait for him to address her. But <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName>, from one of those unaccountable sensations,
		<lb/>peculiar to lovers, particularly in the incipient
		<lb/>stages of their disease, contented himself with a
		<lb/>passing salute, and continued his course in silence.</p>
	      <pb n="167"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="14(6)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">167</mw>
	      <p><persName>Miriam</persName> seemed to regard him with surprise and
		<lb/>perplexity; she however courteously returned his
		<lb/>salutation; but as they passed each other, with
		<lb/>some difficulty, in the narrow defile, her slender
		<lb/>foot caught in the stirrup of his saddle. He instant­
		<lb/>ly stopped, but she extricated himself before he had
		<lb/>time to assist her, or even speak as he then felt
		<lb/>strongly inclined; and slightly touching the curved
		<lb/>neck of her steed, she set off with a speed that
		<lb/>almost alarmed <persName>Atherton</persName> for her safety. He bit
		<lb/>his lip with vexation, and vainly deprecated the
		<lb/>perverse feeling which had suffered him to pass her
		<lb/>in silence. He looked back again; she maintained
		<lb/>her seat with the utmost firmness, and in another
		<lb/>moment had passed beyond his sight. <persName>Atherton</persName>
		<lb/>sunk into a deep reverie; and the animal he rode,
		<lb/>which had been used to plough, and thereby lost
		<lb/>the exuberance of his spirits, and become fond of
		<lb/>his ease, encouraged by the lenity of his rider and
		<lb/>attracted by a spot of fresh grass, endeavoured, by
		<lb/>a vigorous shake, to free himself from all incum­
		<lb/>brances, to enjoy the tempting morsel at his leisure.
		<lb/>But <persName>Atherton</persName>, completely aroused by the exertion,
		<lb/>plunged his spurs into the sides of the reluctant
		<lb/>beast, and urged him to a gallop which soon brought
		<lb/>him to <persName>Mr. Winslow's</persName> gate.</p>
	      <p><persName>Peregrine White</persName> saw him approaching from a
		<lb/>window, and hastened to the door to welcome him.</p>
	      <p><said>I am heartily glad to see you, Major,</said> said he,
		<lb/><said>though methinks you might as well have come
		  <lb/>with us in the morning, as to burthen this misera­

		  <lb/>ble old sheep, which looks as if it was going to <mcr>baa</mcr>,
		  <lb/>at this very moment. The Captain has a high-
		  <lb/>mettled steed, that he might have lent you, instead
		  <lb/>of this shaggy thing.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I had my choice of the two,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>;
		<lb/><said>but as he was coming with me, I left the best for
		  <lb/>his own use.</said></p>
	      <p><said>That was vastly civil of you,</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName>;
		<lb/><said>but if you had been with us, I would have treated
		  <lb/>you with some rare sport.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You are very liberal with such entertainment,</said><lb/>said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>how was it served up this morn­
		  <lb/>ing?</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>Oh, it was <persName>Benjamin Ashly's</persName> own contrivance.
		  <lb/>You must know, he was the last to leave the boat,
		  <lb/>and twisting about in his clumsy fashion, he tipped
		  <lb/>it on one side, and went, souse into the water to
		  <lb/>his neck. I wish you could have seen him! there
		  <lb/>he stood, with his jaws distended like a crocodile's,
		  <lb/>and croaking for all the world, like a frog.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>I suppose you had no hand in the accident?</said><lb/>said <persName>Atherton</persName>.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>No hand in it, on my honour; though I can't
		  <lb/>say but my foot might possibly have touched the
		  <lb/>keel; it was purely accidental, however.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Oh, of course, we could not suppose you mis­
		  <lb/>chievous; but I hope you helped him out of the
		  <lb/>difficulty.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>He crawled out like a great mud turtle,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Peregrine</persName>, <said>and how he got home I know not; for
		  <lb/>I came off with the pretty <persName>Miriam</persName>, who could not,

		  <lb/>for her life help laughing, though her father tried
		  <lb/>to frown us both into long faces to suit the cut of
		  <lb/>the young deacon's woeful visage.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I should think <persName>Mr. Ashly</persName> would keep aloof
		  <lb/>from you,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>you are apt to come
		  <lb/>into rude contact with him. But we had better go
		  <lb/>into the house now, if you are ready.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>Whenever you please; but I forgot to tell you
		  <lb/>there is some half dozen of good people in there,
		  <lb/>who seem very well satisfied with themselves, but
		  <lb/>in my opinion are terribly stupid.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Perhaps I shall intrude on them,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>Oh no, you will not; and it may be you will
		  <lb/>enliven them a little; I am sure I have been half
		  <lb/>asleep for an hour past, and once do verily believe
		  <lb/>my head dropped on mistress <persName>Rebecca Spindle's</persName>
		  <lb/>shoulder; the last thing in the world I should
		  <lb/>choose for a pillow.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Let us go then,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>they will won­
		  <lb/>der that we stay so long on the threshold.</said></p>
	      <p><said>No matter,</said> returned the careless youth; <said>they
		  <lb/>have been talking about you all the afternoon;
		  <lb/>and it will give them time to wind off with a good
		  <lb/>grace.</said></p>
	      <p>So saying, he entered and threw open the par­
		<lb/>lour door, at which <persName>Atherton</persName> was met by the Gover­
		<lb/>nor, with his habitual courtesy, and introduced to
		<lb/>his guests. <persName>Mrs. Winslow</persName> also rose with matronly
		<lb/>dignity to receive him; and the usual civilities
		<lb/>being ended on all sides, she returned to her sta­
		<lb/>tion with her female friends, who were seated in a

		<lb/>formal row on one side of the apartment, and the
		<lb/>conversation was resumed which had been suspend­
		<lb/>ed on the entrance of <persName>Major Atherton</persName>.</p>
	      <p>The subject in discussion was certain heretical
		<lb/>opinions, that were said to be gaining ground in
		<lb/>the <placeName>Massachusetts Bay</placeName>; and, concerning which,
		<lb/>reports, probably exaggerated, had been received
		<lb/>by the late arrival from that place. These here­
		<lb/>sies were considered by all as dreadful, and till of
		<lb/>late, unheard of enormities, though their precise
		<lb/>nature seemed to be imperfectly understood, and
		<lb/>variously interpreted. That a woman should be­
		<lb/>come the promulgator of such doctrines, was evi­
		<lb/>dently no slight addition to the crime.</p>
	      <p><said>To think,</said> as <persName>Mistress Spindle</persName>, judiciously re­
		<lb/>marked, <said>that a frail woman should take it on
		  <lb/>herself to set forth new, and strange doctrines! it
		  <lb/>was an awful thing!</said></p>
	      <p><said>But,</said> said <persName>Peregrine White</persName>, who could seldom
		<lb/>keep silence, <said>all women are not so frail, <persName>Mistress
		  <lb/>Spindle</persName>, as your experience may lead you to be­
		  <lb/>lieve; and this <persName>Mrs. Hutchinson</persName>, we are told, has
		  <lb/>the sense and spirit of a lion.</said></p>
	      <p><said>The spirit of a devil!</said> exclaimed a little austere
		<lb/>looking man;<choice><sic>’</sic><corr/></choice> <said rend="pre()">and when our youth rise up to de­
		  <lb/>fend such in their apostacy, well may we tremble
		  <lb/>for the ark, which we have builded here.</said></p>
	      <p><said>My son did not mean to defend her principles,</said><lb/>said <persName>Mrs. Winslow</persName>; <said>but, with his usual haste, has
		  <lb/>spoken unadvisedly with his lips.</said></p>
	      <p><said>No, mother, I did not speak,</said>—<persName>Peregrine</persName> began;
		<pb n="171"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="15(2)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">171</mw>
		<lb/>but the Governor, in a mild, though decisive tone,
		<lb/>interposed.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>We will wave that discussion, at present, <persName>Pere­
		    <lb/>grine</persName>, and, if it please you, attend to what <persName>Mr.
		    <lb/>Bradford</persName> hath to say.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><persName>Peregrine</persName> yielded, with a very good grace; and
		<lb/><persName>Mr. Bradford</persName> related the substance of certain in­
		<lb/>formation he had received from <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName>, re­
		<lb/>specting the ecclesiastical affairs of their <placeName>Massa­
		  <lb/>chusetts'</placeName> brethren; and concluded with some judi­
		<lb/>cious remarks, which strikingly exhibited the can­
		<lb/>dour and liberality of his mind.</p>
	      <p><persName>Mr. Bradford</persName> had been eminently useful in the
		<lb/>settlement and advancement of the <placeName>Plymouth colony</placeName>;
		<lb/>he was still in the meridian of life; his counten­
		<lb/>ance and deportment were prepossessing, dignified,
		<lb/>and grave, without austerity, and strongly expres­
		<lb/>sive of that good-sense and benevolence, solid
		<lb/>judgment and fervent piety, which had early won
		<lb/>the entire confidence and affection of the people
		<lb/>with whom he was associated. Their unanimous
		<lb/>suffrages had continued him in the executive chair
		<lb/>from the death of the lamented <persName>Carver</persName>, through
		<lb/>sixteen successive years; with the exception of one
		<lb/>only, when at his own urgent request, he was per­
		<lb/>mitted to resign it to <persName>Mr. Winslow</persName>. It cannot be
		<lb/>supposed that the office of chief magistrate was
		<lb/>considered otherwise than as a post of honour,
		<lb/>even in that early period of the country; but so far
		<lb/>from being an object of contention, or <quote>root of bit­
		  <lb/>terness,</quote> the humility and disinterestedness of the

		<lb/>primitive settlers induced them rather to decline
		<lb/>the distinction, and prefer others before themselves;
		<lb/>insomuch, that an act of the general court was
		<lb/>past, imposing a fine of twenty pounds on any one
		<lb/>who should refuse the office of Governor, unless

	      <p><said>I am well-pleased,</said> said the Governor, when
		<lb/><persName>Mr. Bradford</persName> had concluded, <said>that young <persName>Weldon</persName>
		  <lb/>is so prosperous in his worldly estate; he seems
		  <lb/>modest and well disposed; and is, moreover, about
		  <lb/>to bear away from us one of our choicest vines.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I think,</said> returned the little man, <said>we have no
		  <lb/>authority to speak with confidence of him, seeing
		  <lb/>he is the blossom of a strange branch, and but a

	      <p><said>We are bound, in the judgment of charity, to

		  <lb/>slow</persName>; <said>for he has ever borne himself discreetly
		  <lb/>with us, and the church and people with whom he

		  <lb/>aright,</said> replied <persName>Mr. Bradford</persName>; <said>and even as <persName>Moses</persName>
		  <lb/>and <persName>Aaron</persName> led the children of <name>Israel</name> through the
		  <lb/>desert of <placeName>Sinai</placeName>, so have those godly ministers of

		  <lb/>congregation through a trackless wilderness, more
		  <lb/>than an hundred miles from the spot which their
		  <lb/>hands had planted.</said></p>
	      <p><said>What,</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>could induce them to
		  <lb/>remove so far from their first settlement, and, it
		  <lb/>must be, into the midst of savages?</said></p>
	      <p><said>They went forth in the name of the Lord,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Mr. Bradford</persName>, <said>and trusted in his mercy for pro­
		  <lb/>tection. If you have not visited our sister colony
		  <lb/>of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, you can scarce­
		  <lb/>ly form an idea of its rapid growth and prosperity.
		  <lb/>The foundations of many flourishing towns are
		  <lb/>laid, even to the extremest limits of the patent;
		  <lb/>and the increase of cattle, with the great numbers
		  <lb/>who annually arrive from <placeName>England</placeName>, has caused
		  <lb/>many to remove to distant parts. Plantations are
		  <lb/>already formed on the banks of the great river
		  <lb/><placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, which, being beyond the charter of
		  <lb/><placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, has been created a separate juris­
		  <lb/>diction and is governed by its own laws, without
		  <lb/>being considered amenable to the mother colony.</said></p>
	      <p><said>The church of <placeName>Newtown</placeName>, to which <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName>
		  <lb/>belongs,</said> said the Governor to <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>was
		  <lb/>among the first that contemplated a removal thith­

		  <lb/>company arrived from <placeName>England</placeName>, which purchased
		  <lb/>their estates, and left them at liberty to commence
		  <lb/>their toilsome march. They penetrated through
		  <lb/>the pathless wilderness, upwards of an hundred and
		  <lb/>twenty miles, to a place called <placeName>Suckiang</placeName>, now
		  <lb/><placeName>Hartford</placeName>, which they had fixed upon for their abode,
		  <lb/>and to which they were nearly a fortnight in tra­
		  <lb/>velling. They took with them their wives and
		  <lb/>little ones; their cattle and all their substance.
		  <lb/>Their only guide was the compass; the rocks were
		  <lb/>their pillows, and the heavens their covering. They
		  <lb/>subsisted on the milk of their kine, and the herbs
		  <lb/>and wild fruits of the earth; they had rivers to
		  <lb/>ford; and deep morasses and high mountains beset
		  <lb/>their path: nevertheless, the Lord watched over
		  <lb/>them, and led them by the right way, and in peace,
		  <lb/>to the desired land. <persName>Mr. Hooker</persName>, their minister,
		  <lb/>and <persName>Mr. Stone</persName>, teacher of their church, went with
		  <lb/>them; for in all their wanderings, our people of
		  <lb/><placeName>New-England</placeName> are encouraged and edified, by the
		  <lb/>presence and council of the pastors, whom their
		  <lb/>own choice, and the consent of the neighbouring
		  <lb/>churches, have connected with them.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Your civil and religious concerns appear to be
		  <lb/>so closely blended,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>that the cler­
		  <lb/>gy must possess an influence equal, if not superi­
		  <lb/>our, to that of the secular rulers.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is an influence which we cheerfully yield to
		  <lb/>them,</said> returned <persName>Mr. Winslow</persName>; <said>and which they
		  <lb/>must exercise, so long as we retain the views and
		  <lb/>principles that led us to endure reproach and ex­

		  <lb/>ile, rather than submit to the discipline of a church,
		  <lb/>which we consider unscriptural and corrupt.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Your situation is peculiar,</said> resumed <persName>Atherton</persName>;
		<lb/>and, so far as my limited observation enables me
		<lb/>to judge, your laws and institutions approximate
		<lb/>more nearly to the ancient patriarchal government,
		<lb/>than I should have supposed practicable at this
		<lb/>late period of the world.</p>
	      <p><said>We may be said, almost to possess a world of
		  <lb/>our own,</said> said <persName>Mr. Bradford</persName>; <said>we are so remote
		  <lb/>from the countries of <placeName>Europe</placeName>, that the government,
		  <lb/>even of our own sovereign, can only impose on us
		  <lb/>certain general laws, while the interior regulations
		  <lb/>of the colony must rest entirely on ourselves; and
		  <lb/>in this, and all our concerns, we endeavour to make
		  <lb/>the word of God our rule and guide.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is a guide, which every church professes to
		  <lb/>follow,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>but its political code, I
		  <lb/>believe, has not been found adapted to the genius
		  <lb/>of any nation, since the <rs type="properAdjective">christian</rs> era.</said></p>
	      <p><said rend="post()">Yet, as far as circumstances permit,</said> <choice><sic>‘</sic><corr/></choice>returned
		<lb/><persName>Mr. Bradford</persName>, <said>we have followed the law of <persName>Moses</persName>,
		  <lb/>which, being delivered by the Most High, must be

		  <lb/>wants of man, than any which human wisdom can
		  <lb/>devise; and therefore most worthy the regard of
		  <lb/><name>christians</name>, who wish to establish a colony, not
		  <lb/>from motives of human ambition, but for the ad­
		  <lb/>vancement of pure religion.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And the Lord has conducted us, even as he did

	      <p><said>And made us a chosen people,</said> responded <persName>Re­

	      <p><said>Those who are not of us, <persName>Mistress Spindle</persName>,</said> re­
		<lb/>turned the other, glancing at <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>understand
		  <lb/>none of these things, and our words seem unto
		  <lb/>them like idle tales.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Perhaps, sir, your counsel may enlighten us,</said><lb/>said <persName>Atherton</persName>, looking at the little man, who had
		<lb/>evidently intended the observation for him, and
		<lb/>whose countenance expressed no small degree of
		<lb/>spiritual pride, with that <soCalled>long favoured contraction</soCalled>,
		<lb/>if the term may be allowed, which always arises
		<lb/>from sectarian prejudice. With undaunted self-
		<lb/>complacence, however he replied,</p>
	      <p>
		<said>They who wilfully indulge the errors of prela­
		  <lb/>cy, are like as the <quote>death adder, which stoppeth her
		    <lb/>ears against the voice of the charmer, charm he
		    <lb/>never so wisely;</quote> and it is but <quote>casting pearls be­
		    <lb/>fore swine,</quote> to intermeddle with them.</said>

	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName> could not repress a smile, but avoided
		<lb/>any farther controversy with one, whose narrow
		<lb/>intellect seemed to admit but a single idea; and an
		<lb/>embarrassing pause of a moment was relieved by
		<lb/>the entrance of <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, and <persName>Captain Standish</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>Well, cousin <persName>Atherton</persName>,</said> said the latter, when he
		<lb/>had bowed with military precision to the company,
		<lb/><said>I expected you would be here before me, I met my

		  <lb/>with the <name>Virginian</name>.</said></p>

	      <p><said>And she told you,</said> interrupted <persName>Atherton</persName>,<choice><sic>’</sic><corr/></choice> <said rend="pre()">that
		  <lb/>I did not find her, or any one at home.</said></p>
	      <p><said>No she did not;</said> replied the Captain. <said>I ask­
		  <lb/>ed her if she had seen you, and she said that she
		  <lb/>had met your spirit in the woods; but it was dumb;
		  <lb/>so she put no questions to it.</said></p>
	      <p><said>She seemed in haste,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>and
		  <lb/>both her own horse and <persName>Mr. Calvert's</persName> were fleet
		  <lb/>and spirited.</said></p>
	      <p><said>This reminds me, sir,</said> said <persName>Mrs. Winslow</persName>, to
		<lb/><persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, <said>of a report in circulation, that <persName>Mr. Cal­
		    <lb/>vert</persName> has returned hither, in the hope of conveying
		  <lb/>your daughter back to <placeName>Virginia</placeName> with him.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And you gave no credit to such a rumour, I
		  <lb/>trust,</said> said <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>I was loath to believe it, for a moment,</said> return­
		<lb/>ed <persName>Mrs. Winslow</persName>; <said>I am sure <persName>Miriam</persName> would not
		  <lb/>willingly remove so far from her father's house,
		  <lb/>and the privileges of her own people.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And to marry an idolatrous churchman,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Mistress Spindle</persName>, <said>and go amongst those blind
		  <lb/><name>Egyptians</name>, who know not the ways of <name>Zion</name>.</said> But
		<lb/>as the good woman concluded, she recollected the

		  <lb/>their outward observances; for some, doubtless,
		  <lb/>may have pure hearts, though they are led astray
		  <lb/>to follow <quote>cunningly devised fables.</quote></said></p>
	      <p><said>This is a strange story,</said> said <persName>Captain Stand­
		  <lb/>ish</persName>; <said>but I well know, there can be no truth in it.</said></p>

		<lb/><said>my daughter knows her duty too well, to enter in­
		  <lb/>to a covenant with the enemies of our faith.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Ay, I thought as much;</said> replied the Captain;
		<lb/>but <persName>Calvert</persName> is a sober youth, and well-disposed,
		<lb/>and withal, of an honourable descent.</p>
	      <p><said>He claims kindred with the noble <persName>lord of <placeName>Bal­
		    <lb/>timore</placeName></persName>, I think,</said> said the Governor, <said>to whom the
		  <lb/>king has granted a patent for the territory of <placeName>Ma­
		    <lb/>ryland</placeName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And who,</said> said <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, <said>has brought over
		  <lb/>the crafy inventions of popery, to corrupt this new
		  <lb/>world, which might otherwise, have remained free
		  <lb/>from such abominable delusions.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Yea,</said> rejoined <persName>Mr. Scruple</persName>, <said>and did not the
		  <lb/><persName>lord of <placeName>Baltimore</placeName></persName> name his possessions in honour
		  <lb/>of the papist queen of <persName>Charles</persName>? and when his bro­
	      <lb/>ther, the <persName>Governor Calvert</persName>, with upwards of two
		  <lb/>hundred souls, landed in the province, with idola­
		  <lb/>trous mockery they set up a cross, that relic of su­
		  <lb/>perstition, and ensign of the Pope, who is none
		  <lb/>other than the horned beast of the Revelations.</said></p>
	      <p><said>But,</said> said <persName>Mrs. Winslow</persName>, <said>they appear to have
		  <lb/>been conscientious; and certainly conducted their
		  <lb/>affairs with integrity and wisdom, so as to give no
		  <lb/>offence, even to those who differed from them in
		  <lb/>modes of worship; and, if they act honestly, ac­
		  <lb/>cording to the knowledge which is in them, nothing
		  <lb/>more can be expected or required.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It may be so,</said> returned the other; <said>but it is an
		  <lb/>awful thing to have the banner of the Pope, that
		  <lb/>prince of darkness, planted in the midst of our
		  <pb n="179"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="15(6)r"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">179</mw>
		  <lb/>land, for an example to the heathen and stumbling
		  <lb/>block to weak brethren.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is well that you are not there to be tempted,
		  <lb/><persName>Mr. Scruple</persName>,</said> said <persName>Captain Standish</persName>; <said>I acknow­
		  <lb/>ledge, for my part, a high respect, for the charac­
		  <lb/>ter of <persName>Governor Calvert</persName>, papist as he is; he has
		  <lb/>purchased the lands fairly of the natives, which
		  <lb/>planters do not always think necessary, and esta­
		  <lb/>blished good government, and granted liberty of
		  <lb/>conscience and equal privileges to all sects of <name>chris­
		    <lb/>tians</name>,—and what more or better could be done, I
		  <lb/>pray you?</said></p>
	      <p><said>Truly the outward part appeareth fair,</said> replied
		<lb/>the other, <said>but the worshipping of saints and ima­
		  <lb/>ges I hold to be a corruption of <quote>the faith once
		    <lb/>delivered to the saints.</quote></said></p>
	      <p><said>He has brought forth good fruit,</said> said <persName>Mrs.
		  <lb/>Winslow</persName>; <said>and it is not for us to judge his heart,
		  <lb/>or to speak uncharitably of his actions.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Spoken like a true woman and a good one,</said><lb/>cried the Captain; <said>what say you to that, <persName>Mr.
		    <lb/>Bradford</persName>?</said></p>
	      <p><said>He has doubtless been an instrument in the
		  <lb/>hand of Providence,</said> said <persName>Mr. Bradford</persName>, <said>of es­
		  <lb/>tablishing a well-ordered colony, and flourishing
		  <lb/>according to human wisdom; but it may be ques­
		  <lb/>tioned if these benefits are not overbalanced by
		  <lb/>the spiritual errors which are mingled with them.</said></p>
	      <p><said>We must humbly trust,</said> said <persName>Mr. Winslow</persName>,
		<lb/><said>that these errors will in time be washed away,
		  <lb/>even as they have gradually declined in the parent
		  <lb/>country.</said></p>

	      <p><said>And what has followed to fill up the breach?</said><lb/>asked <persName>Mr. Scruple</persName>, <said>even the blindness of prelacy,
		  <lb/>the putting on of robes and mitres, and kneeling
		  <lb/>down to repeat prayers from printed books; these
		  <lb/>are the gods to whom the people have bowed
		  <lb/>down.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Our ancestors—those of us who had any,</said> said
		<lb/>the Captain, <said>were all <name>Catholics</name>; for which rea­
		  <lb/>son we are bound to speak lightly of their errors.
		  <lb/>My great grandfather's uncle, who was Bishop of
		  <lb/><placeName>St. Asaph</placeName> in the reign of <persName>Henry the eighth</persName>, was
		  <lb/>a learned prelate; and I have too much respect
		  <lb/>for his memory not to be in charity with his per­
		  <lb/>suasion. But here is <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName>, we will ask his
		  <lb/>opinion.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You have come just in time, <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName>,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Mrs. Winslow</persName>, <said>to settle a disputed question.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And what is it, madam?</said> asked <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>It is,</said> said <persName>Mrs. Winslow</persName>, <said>whether the settle­
		  <lb/>ment of <placeName>Maryland</placeName> has been beneficial or otherwise
		  <lb/>to the country at large?</said></p>
	      <p><said>No one would doubt the advantage, I think,</said><lb/>replied <persName>Calvert</persName>, <said>who could witness its rapid im­
		  <lb/>provement in the short space of the three years
		  <lb/>which have elapsed since the arrival of the Gover­
		  <lb/>nor and first planters; and the wise administra­
		  <lb/>tion and salutary laws which have marked its pro­
		  <lb/>gress.</said></p>
	      <p><said>But the religion which they have established,</said><lb/>said <persName>Mrs. Winslow</persName>;—<said>have we not cause to dread
		  <lb/>its consequences on our land?</said></p>

	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">181</mw>
	      <p><said>Of that I am incompetent to judge,</said> returned
		<lb/><persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>but I can say from personal observa­
		  <lb/>tion that no Governor south of <placeName>New-England</placeName> has
		  <lb/>been more beloved and respected by every sect
		  <lb/>and party. My opinion is disinterested, for the
		  <lb/>patent of <persName>lord Baltimore</persName> has dismembered many
		  <lb/>fair acres from our ancient colony; and we have
		  <lb/>in vain sought redress from the monarch, whose
		  <lb/>favour to that distinguished nobleman is exercised
		  <lb/>in defiance of our superior claims.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I think we need not quarrel about waste lands
		  <lb/>in this country till we have more hands to plant
		  <lb/>them;</said> said <persName>Captain Standish</persName>; <said>but I hope what
		  <lb/>remains of your fine province is in a flourishing
		  <lb/>state!</said></p>
	      <p><said>Extremely so,</said> returned <persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>though I
		  <lb/>am sorry to say that our government has been less
		  <lb/>liberal than that of <placeName>Maryland</placeName>, and that its recent
		  <lb/>laws against sectaries have caused many to aban­
		  <lb/>don the territory, and prevented others from com­
		  <lb/>ing into it.</said></p>
	      <p><said>In my humble judgment,</said> said the Captain,
		<lb/><said>you <name>Virginians</name> have ever been a turbulent people,
		  <lb/>and apt to verge on extremes. At one time you
		  <lb/>were almost exterminated by famine, and when
		  <lb/>a supply reached you it was wasted in extrava­
		  <lb/>gance; again you were all running wild without
		  <lb/>government, moral or religious, and now you are
		  <lb/>for making every man worship in your own way
		  <lb/>or pay a penalty.</said></p>

		  <lb/>in the days of our infancy that we were so undisci­

		  <lb/>before we attain to the purity and strictness of
		  <lb/><placeName>New-England</placeName> principles.</said></p>
	      <p><said>The early <orgName><placeName>Virginia</placeName> Companies</orgName>,</said> said the Go­
		<lb/>vernor, <said>were too anxious for its rapid settlement;
		  <lb/>and it must require many years to obliterate the
		  <lb/>effects of that blind policy which induced them to
		  <lb/>transport dissolute and criminal persons into a
		  <lb/>young country.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And <persName>king James</persName> in later days,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>,
		<lb/><said>graciously improved upon the hint, and we have
		  <lb/>yet living mementos of his royal clemency which
		  <lb/>let loose upon our society the malefactors destined
		  <lb/>for his own prisons.</said></p>
	      <p><said>A less acceptable cargo, I suppose,</said> said the
		<lb/>Captain, <said>than the young and handsome females
		  <lb/>whom the Company sent over to be help-mates for
		  <lb/>your batchelors.</said></p>
	      <p><said>By far,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>. <said><persName>Sir Edwin Sandys</persName>
		  <lb/>did justice to <rs type="properAdjective">Virginian</rs> gallantry in proposing so
		  <lb/>fair a freight; and as wives were in great requisi­
		  <lb/>tion at that time, a hundred and fifty pounds of
		  <lb/>tobacco, the price demanded, was not considered
		  <lb/>too much for a good one.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I think though,</said> said the Captain, <said>your trea­
		  <lb/>surer should have been more impartial; and in­

	      <p><said>I hope, Captain</said> returned <persName>Calvert</persName>, <said>that if
		  <lb/>your <placeName>Plymouth Colony</placeName> should have recourse to a
		  <lb/>foreign traffic for wives, you will adopt that amend­
		  <lb/>ment; but I can answer for our southern planters,
		  <lb/>that <persName>Sir Edwin's</persName> proposition is far better suited to
		  <lb/>their taste.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I do not doubt you,</said> said the Captain; <said>but I
		  <lb/>take it you have enough of that commodity now
		  <lb/>for home consumption, and have no need of an out­
		  <lb/>ward trade to supply yourselves.</said></p>
	      <p><said>There is certainly no necessity for it,</said> replied
		<lb/><persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>but it is well to keep up a friendly com­
		  <lb/>merce with our neighbours, particularly the few
		  <lb/>whom we can call such on this side the <placeName>Atlantic</placeName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Well, I heard <persName>Major Atherton</persName> talk about visit­
		  <lb/>ing <placeName>Virginia</placeName> the other day,</said> said the Captain; <said>but
		  <lb/>whether he intends to turn merchant or married
		  <lb/>man, I hav'nt yet discovered.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Neither at present,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>but I
		  <lb/>have ever felt a strong curiosity to see that coun­
		  <lb/>try, which from its first discovery has excited so
		  <lb/>much interest in <placeName>England</placeName>, and is moreover asso­
		  <lb/>ciated with many pleasing and romantic recollec­
		  <lb/>tions. The adventurous courage of <persName>Smith</persName>, the
		  <lb/>chivalrous spirit of the unfortunate <persName>Raleigh</persName>, and
		  <lb/>the devoted heroism of <persName>Pocahontas</persName>, would alone
		  <lb/>render it immortal.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You should add the raising of tobacco, cousin
		  <lb/><persName>Edward</persName>,</said> said the Captain, laughing, <said>You know
		  <lb/>it is a favourite plant of mine, and a great pro­
		  <lb/>moter of good-humour. I hope, <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName>, it
		  <lb/>continues in demand and produces good crops.</said></p>

	      <p><said>The crops are plentiful enough,</said> returned <persName>Cal­

		  <title rend="pre(“)post(”)">Counter­

		  <lb/>sons to try the effect of a weed, which their sove­
		  <lb/>reign deigned to exercise his royal talents in writ­
		  <lb/>ing a book to condemn.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I never could agree with his Majesty on that
		  <lb/>subject,</said> said the Captain, <said>not to mention some
		  <lb/>others; and I will not give up my comfortable pipe
		  <lb/>of tobacco, though he is pleased to say, it is only <quote>fit
		    <lb/>to regale the devil after dinner.</quote></said></p>
	      <p>A summons to <persName>Mrs. Winslow's</persName> hospitable sup­

		<lb/>was obliged to leave home on business; and, hav­
		<lb/>ing charged <persName>Alexander</persName> to entertain <persName>Major Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName> till he returned, the lad proposed his favourite
		<lb/>amusement of fishing. They were soon launched
		<lb/>upon the Bay; but, from whatever cause, the fish
		<lb/>proved shy; which, however, only stimulated the
		<lb/>perseverance of <persName>Alexander</persName>, who toiled manfully;
		<lb/>and with much of his father's ardour, applied himself
		<lb/>to the task, as if his life depended on success.</p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName> was certainly less zealous; his eyes
		<lb/>continually reverted to the distant shores of the
		<lb/><placeName>Gurnet</placeName>, and his thoughts were probably occupied by
		<lb/>certain associations connected with it; for his
		<lb/>companion, while skilfully managing his own line,
		<lb/>observed that his kinsman's remained long in the
		<lb/>water, and only stirred by the dull motion of the
		<lb/>waves. When he finally drew it out, the hook was
		<lb/>without bait, and <persName>Alexander</persName>, who had seen it glit­
		<lb/>ter before it reached the surface, exclaimed,</p>
	      <p>
		<said>Upon my word, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, that fish had a

		  <lb/>worked cautiously to take it off, without pricking
		  <lb/>his gills.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Really,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>there is no sport for
		  <lb/>us to-day; I think the scaly race have all gone to
		  <lb/>bed in broad sun-shine.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Look, here are two notable fellows I have
		  <lb/>caught,</said> returned <persName>Alexander</persName>, <said>and here comes an­
		  <lb/>other;—no, he has bit, and gone off with himself.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I should like to be off, too, <persName>Alexander</persName>, if it
		  <lb/>please you,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>there is really more
		  <lb/>toil than pleasure in this tedious angling.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I will land you, if you wish it</said>, said <persName>Alexander</persName>,
		<lb/><said>and return here by myself; my father will laugh
		  <lb/>at us, if we carry home no more spoil.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Yonder is <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>if we can
		  <lb/>push in there, I will pass an hour or two, and be
		  <lb/>ready to return with you.</said></p>
	      <p>In a few moments, <persName>Major Atherton</persName> stood on the
		<lb/><placeName>Plymouth</placeName> beach, and while deliberating what
		<lb/>course to pursue, he moved slowly on, and, as if
		<lb/>unconscious what path his feet had chosen, started
		<lb/>at finding himself by the oak tree, which shaded
		<lb/>the dwelling of <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>. <said>I will not call again
		  <lb/>to-day,</said> he thought, and passed leisurely on, though
		<lb/>not without a strict survey of the premises. No
		<lb/>person was visible; and <persName>Miriam's</persName> kitten, which
		<lb/>lay sunning herself on the door-step, was the only
		<lb/>animated object in the vicinity. Retracing his
		<lb/>steps, <persName>Atherton</persName> was soon again on the sea shore,
		<lb/>and not far from the <name>Pilgrim's</name> rock, close to which
		<lb/>the <placeName>Virginia</placeName> pinnace lay at anchor. Thin groves
		<pb n="187"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="16(4)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">187</mw>
		<lb/>of trees were here and there scattered along the
		<lb/>shore, apparently the second growth of large
		<lb/>forests, which had undoubtedly once covered the
		<lb/>plain where the village now stood, and which, on
		<lb/>the first arrival of the colony, presented the ap­
		<lb/>pearance of a level field, though retaining vestiges
		<lb/>of former cultivation, and bearing marks of the
		<lb/>rude implements with which the natives were ac­
		<lb/>customed to till their ground, and prepare the
		<lb/>ridges for their corn plantations. These appear­
		<lb/>ances, confirmed the report of some friendly sava­
		<lb/>ges, that it had once been the site of a flourishing
		<lb/><rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> town, whose inhabitants were swept away
		<lb/>by a contagious malady, which had desolated the
		<lb/>country, from the <placeName>Bay of Plymouth</placeName> to the shores
		<lb/>of the <placeName>Narraganset</placeName>.</p>
	      <p>As <persName>Major Atherton</persName> was passing along the skirts
		<lb/>of a small wood, a faint rustling among the wither­
		<lb/>ed branches, caused him to look round; and, at the
		<lb/>same instant, the low humming of a sweet female
		<lb/>voice, directed his attention to a spot, where, lean­
		<lb/>ing carelessly against the trunk of a tree, his eyes
		<lb/>rested on the figure of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>. She evident­
		<lb/>ly did not see him, and was busily arranging some
		<lb/>gay autumnal flowers, and fresh evergreens into a
		<lb/>boquet, occasionally stopping to examine them with
		<lb/>minute attention, while her countenance expressed
		<lb/>the pleasure derived from her simple amusement.
		<lb/>It is uncertain how long <persName>Atherton</persName> might have con­
		<lb/>tinued to admire in silence, the graceful negligence
		<lb/>of her attitude, and listen to the plaintive melody
		<pb n="188"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="16(4)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">188</mw>
		<lb/>of her voice, if, in changing her position, a corres­
		<lb/>ponding motion on his part, had not apprised her
		<lb/>of his proximity. A vivid blush, which dyed even
		<lb/>her forehead with crimson, convinced <persName>Atherton</persName> that
		<lb/>he was observed, and her confusion was in a slight
		<lb/>degree shared by himself. In the first start of sur­
		<lb/>prise, <persName>Miriam</persName> had dropped a part of her nosegay;
		<lb/>and to relieve his embarrassment, at which he felt
		<lb/>surprised, <persName>Atherton</persName> sprang forward, and raising it
		<lb/>from the ground, returned it to her; retaining,
		<lb/>however, a sprig of evergreen, which he gallantly
		<lb/>placed in his own bosom, without receiving even a
		<lb/>reproving glance, unless a still deeper glow could
		<lb/>be interpreted as one.</p>
	      <p><said>I hope,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>I shall not interrupt
		  <lb/>your employment, though I have sadly deranged
		  <lb/>the flowers which you were assorting with so much
		  <lb/>taste.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It will only prolong my occupation,</said> returned
		<lb/><persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>which, trifling as it is, has served to pass
		  <lb/>away a few moments, while waiting for my cousin
		  <lb/><persName>Lois</persName>, who has wandered away, I know not whither.
		  <lb/>But perhaps, you have met with her?</said></p>
	      <p><said>I have not;</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>though, indeed,
		  <lb/>my walk has not been extended far from this spot,
		  <lb/>at least, since I caught the sound of your voice,
		  <lb/>which attracted me to it.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I was scarcely aware,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>that my
		  <lb/>idle hum rose into an audible sound, or I should
		  <lb/>have been more guarded, in a place like this.</said></p>
	      <p><said>A place exposed to intruders, would you say?</said><pb n="189"/><milestone unit="sig" n="16(5)r"/><mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">189</mw><lb/>asked <persName>Atherton</persName>, smiling—<said>Believe me, my intru­
		  <lb/>sion was unpremeditated, and I hope you will not
		  <lb/>punish me, by regretting that you charmed me
		  <lb/>awhile, though unconsciously, with the delightful
		  <lb/>melody of your voice.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I should scarcely expect,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>that
		  <lb/>our <placeName>New-England</placeName> music could have any charms for
		  <lb/>you, who have been accustomed to the skilful har­
		  <lb/>mony of your own country.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And yet,</said> replied <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>no music was ever
		  <lb/>so pleasant to my ear, as the simple psalmody of
		  <lb/>your congregation, which my mother used to sing,
		  <lb/>and delighted to teach me in my childhood. It is
		  <lb/>long,</said> he added, after a brief pause, <said>since I listen­
		  <lb/>ed to those strains which your voice recals to my
		  <lb/>memory, like the charm of renewed happiness.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I fear it has also awakened unpleasant remem­
		  <lb/>brances,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, who observed a shade of
		<lb/>sadness pass over his countenance.</p>
	      <p><said>They are recollections of pure and heartfelt
		  <lb/>happiness,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>and though alloyed
		  <lb/>by many painful hours which have since interven­
		  <lb/>ed, I would not for worlds, obliterate them from
		  <lb/>my memory.</said></p>
	      <p><said>But,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>would it not be prudent to
		  <lb/>repel associations which have at least as much pain
		  <lb/>as pleasure mingled with them.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Not if you exclude music,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>that
		  <lb/>is one of the last enjoyments I should be willing to
		  <lb/>sacrifice; and never has my heart more deeply felt
		  <lb/>its influence, than when listening to the melody of
		  <pb n="190"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="16(5)v"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">190</mw>
		  <lb/>untutored voices in your assemblies, and by your
		  <lb/>fire-sides.</said></p>
	      <p><said>We humble <name>puritans</name>,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, with arch
		<lb/>gravity, <said>are a psalm singing people, but our un­
		  <lb/>taught harmony is rarely honoured with the appro­
		  <lb/>bation of those who chaunt to the sound of the or­
		  <lb/>gan in high places.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Their commendation,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>must
		  <lb/>at least be sincere and disinterested.</said></p>
	      <p><said>We regard it but as the incense of a vain sacri­
		  <lb/>fice,</said> replied <persName>Miriam</persName>, in the same tone; and then
		<lb/>quickly resuming her usual manner, she added,
		<lb/><said>but it will be night ere we reach home, if we wait
		  <lb/>much longer for <persName>Lois</persName>; I know not but she may be
		  <lb/>already there, though she left me only to go a short
		  <lb/>distance, and promised to return directly.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Shall I seek her, and tell her you have been
		  <lb/>waiting long and impatiently?</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>,
		<lb/>who feared his presence embarrassed her, or might
		<lb/>be considered improper, in a place where strictness
		<lb/>of manners was carried to an extreme.</p>
	      <p><said>I have not been very impatient,</said> returned <persName>Mi­
		  <lb/>riam</persName>, <said>though were it not for giving you so much
		  <lb/>trouble—</said></p>
	      <p><said>Do not speak of trouble,</said> interrupted <persName>Atherton</persName>;
		<lb/><said>any thing which obliges you will give me pleasure;
		  <lb/>so farewell, and in a few moments I hope to return
		  <lb/>successful.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName> looked back more than once as he pur­
		<lb/>sued the way in the direction which <persName>Miriam</persName> point­
		<lb/>ed out, and saw her still on the spot where he had
		<pb n="191"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="16(6)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">191</mw>
		<lb/>left her, and again busied with her flowers, until the
		<lb/>windings of the path concealed her from his view.
		<lb/>But though her fingers were employed with the
		<lb/>flowers, her thoughts seemed wandering to other
		<lb/>subjects; for she had plucked every blossom from
		<lb/>its stem, and strewed the ground with their leaves,
		<lb/>and when only a single stalk remained in her hand,
		<lb/>she looked at in surprise, and exclaimed audibly,</p>
	      <p>
		<said>My beautiful flowers!<choice><sic>’</sic><corr/></choice> what have I done to
		  <lb/>them?</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>And may I ask, fair <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> said a voice be­
		<lb/>hind her, <said>what subject of contemplation has so en­
		  <lb/>tirely absorbed your mind?</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Miriam</persName> started, and turning round, saw <persName>Mr.
		  <lb/>Calvert</persName> by her side; and with perfect calmness she
		<lb/>replied,</p>
	      <p>
		<said>It would be difficult to answer your question,
		  <lb/>sir; I am myself scarcely conscious what ideas en­
		  <lb/>grossed me at the moment you appeared.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Perhaps,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>, in a tone of irony very
		<lb/>usual with him; <said>perhaps you were admiring the
		  <lb/>beauties of nature, or drawing moral reflections
		  <lb/>from the fall of the autumnal leaf.</said></p>
	      <p><said>No</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, pointing to the scattered
		<lb/>flowers, <said>I was destroying the beauties of nature,
		  <lb/>instead of admiring them, and my reflections were
		  <lb/>certainly less melancholy than the season and this
		  <lb/>place are calculated to excite.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And what is there of melancholy connected with
		  <lb/>this place?</said> asked <persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>just now it seemed to
		  <lb/>me a scene of happiness which almost excited my
		  <lb/>envy.</said></p>
	      <pb n="192"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="16(6)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">192</mw>
	      <p><persName>Miriam</persName>, without noticing his last remark, point­
		<lb/>ed to a level bank, which rose abruptly from the
		<lb/>ocean directly at their feet; it appeared to have
		<lb/>been once cultivated, but was then covered with
		<lb/>coarse grass, and a few stinted evergreens.</p>
	      <p><said>This,</said> she said, <said>is the burial place where our
		  <lb/>poor colony, during the dreadful winter which suc­
		  <lb/>ceeded their arrival, were obliged to consign more
		  <lb/>than half their number who fell victims to the dis­
		  <lb/>tress and fatigue of their situation. Many an ho­
		  <lb/>noured and virtuous head reposes here, who, while
		  <lb/>their memory is fading away on earth, are doubt­
		  <lb/>less receiving a bright reward for their sufferings
		  <lb/>and pious labours, where there are no more trials,
		  <lb/>nor any change.</said></p>
	      <p><said>But I see no graves,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>not even a
		  <lb/>single stone to mark it as a place of interment.</said></p>
	      <p><said>No,</said> returned <persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>for so much were we
		  <lb/>reduced by sickness and death, that it was thought
		  <lb/>expedient to level the ground and plant it, lest the
		  <lb/>natives should discover our weakness, and take ad­
		  <lb/>vantage of it, when we were unable to resist them.
		  <lb/>But the spot is no less sacred in our eyes, than if
		  <lb/>marked by the most stately monuments of marble.</said></p>
	      <p><said>In a few years,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>, <said>all will be for­
		  <lb/>gotten, and even now the living have ceased to
		  <lb/>mourn for those who lie here.</said></p>
	      <p><said>They are no longer mourned,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>;
		<lb/><said>but their untimely fate cannot be remembered with­
		  <lb/>out feelings of tenderness and regret; particularly
		  <pb n="193"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="17(1)r"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">193</mw>
		  <lb/>by those who shared their dangers, and were mer­
		  <lb/>cifully spared to longer and happier days.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You have imbibed these feelings,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>,
		<lb/><said>from the gloomy traditions of the good people
		  <lb/>around you; you were then an infant, and incapa­
		  <lb/>ble of realizing dangers or misfortunes.</said></p>
	      <p><said>True,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>yet every affecting inci­
		  <lb/>dent is impressed upon my mind as strongly as if
		  <lb/>I had then been mature in age and reason; and I
		  <lb/>should think even a stranger would feel a touch of
		  <lb/>interest and sympathy in such calamities.</said></p>
	      <p><said>They do,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>, <said>and none more deeply
		  <lb/>than myself, in all which concerns the colony, in
		  <lb/>all that interests you, <persName>Miriam</persName>; but pardon me, if I
		  <lb/>say this cloud of sadness is less suited to your coun­
		  <lb/>tenance than smiles which usually adorn it.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Your trifling is ill-timed, sir;</said> replied <persName>Miriam</persName>,
		<lb/><said rend="pre()">and we will drop a subject which seems to have wea­
		  <lb/>ried you. Now, that I have answered all your ques­

		  <lb/>has brought you hither so unexpectedly.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Accident,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>, <said>has often fortunately
		  <lb/>conducted me to you.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Yesterday, for instance,</said> interrupted <persName>Miriam</persName>,

		  <lb/>upon us to the great alarm of my palfrey, and the

	      <p><said>Yes, yesterday,</said> continued <persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>but to-day
		  <lb/>my intrusion is entirely voluntary; and I confess
		  <lb/>I was drawn here by a spell which my heart is
		  <lb/>unable to resist.</said></p>

		  <lb/><persName>Mr. Calvert</persName>, I do not understand you.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Then you must be the only one who is ignorant
		  <lb/>of the witchery of your charms,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>Have you witches in <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, sir?</said> asked <persName>Mi­

	      <p><persName>Calvert</persName> looked at her in some perplexity, to dis­
		<lb/>cover if the grave simplicity of her manner was
		<lb/>real or affected; but before his doubts were satis­
		<lb/>fied, she added,—</p>
	      <p>
		<said>Perhaps I am indebted to their counsel for the
		  <lb/>favour of this interview.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>No,</said> replied <persName>Calvert</persName>, <said>I have long regarded
		  <lb/>you from my pinnace yonder, and only waited till
		  <lb/>you should be left alone before I joined you.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Indeed!</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>I was not aware of
		  <lb/>being a subject of observation; but had you reached
		  <lb/>this place a few moments sooner, you would have
		  <lb/>conferred on <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, as well as myself,
		  <lb/>the pleasure of your society.</said></p>
	      <p><said>That,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>, <said>can be desired by neither
		  <lb/>of us; and what I would say to you <persName>Miriam</persName>, can
		  <lb/>concern yourself alone, least of all the person whom
		  <lb/>you have mentioned.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I must beg you to be brief then,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>;
		<lb/><said>for I momently expect his return as he left me
		  <lb/>but to seek my cousin, and methinks I even now
		  <lb/>hear their footsteps.</said></p>
	      <p>As she spoke, she turned from him with the air
		<pb n="195"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="17(2)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">195</mw>
		<lb/>of one who listens attentively; and <persName>Calvert</persName>, with
		<lb/>ill-concealed impatience and vexation, retreated
		<lb/>from her a few paces in silence. But as no one
		<lb/>appeared he presently returned, and looking at her
		<lb/>attentively, asked,—</p>
	      <p>
		<said>How is it that a stranger like <persName>Major Atherton</persName>
		  <lb/>has excited so much interest in this place, where
		  <lb/>till within a few weeks, his very name was un­
		  <lb/>known?</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Like all other strangers, of fair and honourable
		  <lb/>character,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>he has claims upon our
		  <lb/>hospitality which it is our duty to discharge.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And what evidence have you,</said> asked <persName>Calvert</persName>,
		<lb/><said>that this character belongs to <persName>Major Atherton</persName>?</said></p>
	      <p><said>All that we can have of a foreigner,</said> said <persName>Mi­
		  <lb/>riam</persName>,—<said>the evidence of those friends whose letters
		  <lb/>commended him to our favour: and his good con­
		  <lb/>duct since he has been with us has gained him the
		  <lb/>esteem of many, who are not used to bestow it
		  <lb/>lightly and without cause.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Not to mention his heroic attempt to save your
		  <lb/>life,</said> returned <persName>Calvert</persName>, <said>which has doubtless ob­
		  <lb/>tained your individual regard.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Miriam</persName> was about to reply when they heard the
		<lb/>sound of approaching voices; and immediately <persName>Lois
		  <lb/>Grey</persName> with <persName>Henry Weldon</persName> and <persName>Atherton</persName>, emerged
		<lb/>from the grove of trees, directly against them.
		<lb/><persName>Major Atherton</persName> who was speaking with animation,
		<lb/>stopped abruptly when he saw <persName>Calvert</persName> conversing
		<lb/>alone with <persName>Miriam</persName>; and the idea that she had
		<lb/>perhaps wished his absence to receive the visit of
		<pb n="196"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="17(2)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">196</mw>
		<lb/>another, excited feelings which he could with diffi­
		<lb/>culty repress. <persName>Calvert</persName> marked the variations of
		<lb/>his countenance, which he considered a confirma­
		<lb/>tion of suspicions he had before entertained; nor
		<lb/>did he fail to notice the deep blush of <persName>Miriam</persName>,
		<lb/>excited by the apprehension that her situation might
		<lb/>be misunderstood by one whose good opinion she
		<lb/>felt unwilling to forfeit. Shaking off her confusion
		<lb/>as much as possible however, she advanced to meet
		<lb/>them, and taking her cousin's arm said to her,—</p>
	      <p>
		<said>I have been long expecting you, <persName>Lois</persName>; but the
		  <lb/>delay is sufficiently explained, since I find you
		  <lb/>have not been indulging a solitary ramble.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>No,</said> said <persName>Lois</persName>, <said>I chanced to meet <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName>,
		  <lb/>and,—</said></p>
	      <p><said>And you walked on,</said> interrupted <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>quite
		  <lb/>forgetful of your promise and my lonely state.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I will not trouble you with an explanation,</said><lb/>returned <persName>Lois</persName>, <said>as you have probably been so agree­
		  <lb/>ably engaged that my absence was scarcely regret­
		  <lb/>ted.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Well,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>we must now hasten;
		  <lb/>for it is already past the time when we promised
		  <lb/>my father to be at home.</said></p>
	      <p>They shortly regained the highway, where <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName> separated from the party, though urged by <persName>Lois
		  <lb/>Grey</persName> to return with them; pleading, as his excuse,
		<lb/>that <persName>Alexander Standish</persName> would be waiting for him.
		<lb/><persName>Alexander</persName> however was not on the beach; nor was
		<lb/>his boat visible on the water; and <persName>Atherton</persName> conclud­
		<lb/>ing he had returned without him, determined to
		<pb n="197"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="17(3)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">197</mw>
		<lb/>walk back to <persName>Captain Standish's</persName>, which as he
		<lb/>chanced to be in a musing mood, was by no means
		<lb/>a disagreeable alternative.</p>
	      <p>It was then nearly dark, and <persName>Atherton</persName> was pass­
		<lb/>ing hastily along, when he met <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName> just
		<lb/>issuing from the gate at <persName>Mr. Grey's</persName>. <persName>Calvert</persName>
		<lb/>looked at him in surprise.</p>
	      <p><said>I thought, sir,</said> he said, <said>you were long since
		  <lb/>comfortably seated in the Captain's warm quarters;
		  <lb/>you will be late if you have all that distance to
		  <lb/>walk to-night.</said></p>
	      <p><said>That is of little consequence,</said> replied <persName>Atherton</persName>,
		<lb/><said>the path is as familiar to me by night, as in the
		  <lb/>noon-day.</said></p>
	      <p><said>But you have taken the longest way,</said> pursued
		<lb/><persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>this road is leading you far round from
		  <lb/>the direct rout.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is a matter of choice,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>;
		<lb/><said>and I presume I am at liberty to take whichever
		  <lb/>suits my convenience or pleasure.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Certainly,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>, <said>and I am myself too
		  <lb/>sensible of the peculiar attractions of this, to be
		  <lb/>surprised at your preference.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Calvert</persName> spoke in a sarcastic tone, which was
		<lb/>calculated to irritate the feelings of <persName>Atherton</persName>; but
		<lb/>he prudently refrained from answering, and coldly
		<lb/>bidding him good night, pursued his solitary way.</p>
	      <p><persName>Captain Standish</persName> had been expecting the return
		<lb/>of <persName>Major Atherton</persName> with some impatience; and
		<lb/>when he at last heard him enter the house, he
		<lb/>knocked the ashes from his pipe and called loudly
		<mw type="vol" rend="align(left)case(allcaps)indent(+1)">Vol. I.</mw>
		<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">17*</mw>
		<pb n="198"/>

		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">198</mw>
		<lb/>to bid <persName>Mistress Saveall</persName> put the supper on the table
		<lb/>instantly.</p>
	      <p>But <persName>Mistress Saveall's</persName> shrill voice answered
		<lb/>from her dominions, that <said>it took time for all
		  <lb/>things; and <persName>master Alexander's</persName> fish could not be
		  <lb/>fried in a minute.</said></p>
	      <p><said>They have been at home a good hour, or more,</said><lb/>said the Captain; <said>and less time than that might
		  <lb/>suffice to make them as brown as a hazle-nut.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Yes,</said> replied the dame; <said>and as cold as a stone,
		  <lb/>withal; and then who but me would be blamed
		  <lb/>when they were served up, and not fit to eat.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Use your hands, Mistress, instead of your
		  <lb/>tongue, and it please you,</said> said the Captain; <said>these
		  <lb/>women can do nothing without prating like mag­
		  <lb/>pies all the time about it.</said></p>
	      <p>He pushed the door, not very gently, as he con­
		<lb/>cluded; and the reply of the house-keeper, who,
		<lb/>with the becoming spirit of her sex, seemed resolv­
		<lb/>ed to give the last word, was lost to the ear of
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>, who had been entertained by the rest of
		<lb/>the domestic dialogue; from which he inferred,
		<lb/>that his prolonged absence had been displeasing to
		<lb/>all parties.</p>
	      <p>But the Captain's good humour returned the
		<lb/>moment his kinsman entered the room; and rising
		<lb/>from his elbow-chair, he said, gaily,—</p>
	      <p>
		<said>Well, <persName>Edward</persName>, you are really taken with a
		  <lb/>roving spirit; but if you play the truant often, I
		  <lb/>fear good <persName>Mistress Saveall's</persName> small stock of patience
		  <lb/>will be quite exhausted.</said>
	      </p>
	      <pb n="199"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="17(4)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">199</mw>
	      <p><said>Perhaps,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>occasional exercise
		  <lb/>may strengthen that valuable property; and I
		  <lb/>think, sir, you would have reason to thank me for
		  <lb/>any improvement of the kind.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Why, yes;</said> returned the Captain; <said>but to tell
		  <lb/>the truth, I am not over-anxious to have my own
		  <lb/>patience put to the test very often. I fear it would
		  <lb/>not come forth, like gold from the furnace, purified
		  <lb/>by the trial.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I believe the virtue is not apt to flourish well in
		  <lb/>our profession,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>. <said>But I have
		  <lb/>not yet explained the cause of my absence, which,
		  <lb/>I am sorry to believe, has kept you so long waiting
		  <lb/>for me.</said></p>
	      <p><said>No matter,</said> replied the Captain; <said>it has given
		  <lb/>us better appetites, and we can talk over the mat­
		  <lb/>ter while eating our supper.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Here comes <persName>Alexander</persName>,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>and
		  <lb/>now I may hope to know if he forgot his promise to
		  <lb/>stop for me at the beach.</said></p>
	      <p><said>No,</said> said <persName>Alexander</persName>, <said>I waited for you till
		  <lb/>almost sunset, and then I met <persName>Hobamock</persName>, who told
		  <lb/>me he saw you in the woods with <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>;
		  <lb/>so I thought you would go home with her, and it
		  <lb/>was of no use to stay longer.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I chanced to meet her, in walking, as I was
		  <lb/>about to inform you, Captain,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, care­
		<lb/>lessly, <said>and her cousin <persName>Lois</persName>, with <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName> and
		  <lb/><persName>Calvert</persName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>But <persName>Hobamock</persName> told me you were alone with
		  <lb/><persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> returned <persName>Alexander</persName>; <said>and shall I tell
		  <pb n="200"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="17(4)v"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">200</mw>
		  <lb/>you, Major, something more that he said about
		  <lb/>you?</said></p>
	      <p><said>No,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, quickly; <said><persName>Hobamock's</persName>
	      	<lb/>eyes are waxing dim, I fancy; and he must have
		  <lb/>mistaken the rest of our party for pine stumps, or
		  <lb/>savin trees.</said></p>
	      <p><said><persName>Hobamock's</persName> eyes are sharp enough,</said> said the
		<lb/>Captain; <said>but you say <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName> was there?
		  <lb/>I think that young gallant will find himself mis­
		  <lb/>taken, if he hopes to carry away our rose-bud from
		  <lb/><placeName>New-England</placeName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Women are said to be fond of novelty and va­
		  <lb/>riety,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>and perhaps she may prefer
		  <lb/>the warmer and brighter climate of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>No; no such thing,</said> returned the Captain;
		<lb/><said>besides, <persName>Calvert</persName> is a churchman, and her father
		  <lb/>would almost as soon see her married to the Pope
		  <lb/>or of <placeName>Rome</placeName>, if his Holiness might be permitted to take
		  <lb/>unto himself a lawful wife.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> paused till he had twice mea­
		<lb/>sured the room with his steps; but willing to learn
		<lb/>more of the Captain's opinion on the subject, he
		<lb/>at length said,—</p>
	      <p>
		<said><persName>Calvert</persName> is insinuating in his manners and ad­
		  <lb/>dress, and may overcome the scruples of <persName>Miriam</persName>,
		  <lb/>if not her father's; it is hardly possible that <persName>Mr.
		    <lb/>Grey</persName> would withhold his consent, if the happiness
		  <lb/>of his only child were concerned.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Now, <persName>Edward Atherton</persName>,</said> said the Captain,
		<lb/>smiling, <said>I perceive you judge of us from your own
		  <lb/>good mother, who was all mildness and charity;
		  <pb n="201"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="17(5)r"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">201</mw>
		  <lb/>she was a <name>Puritan</name>, too; but we, true <name>Nonconform­
		    <lb/>ists</name>, <name>Separatists</name>, <name>Independents</name>, or as godly <persName>Mr.
		    <lb/>Cotton</persName> of the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> has at last styled us,
		  <lb/><name>Congregationalists</name>, hold it a sin to enter into a
		  <lb/>covenant with you heretics and idolaters; and be­
		  <lb/>lieve me, even <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> herself would rather
		  <lb/>marry that prosing, preaching <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName>,
		  <lb/>than to choose from among the best of you.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Really, sir,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, almost indignantly,
		<lb/><said>you would give us an exalted idea of <persName>Miriam
		    <lb/>Grey's</persName> taste and discernment.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Not so;</said> said the Captain; <said>but it is a part of
		  <lb/>her creed; and she would think it rebelling against
		  <lb/>the light of conscience, to err one jot or tittle
		  <lb/>from that. I do not think, though, that the girl
		  <lb/>has any fancy for <persName>Master Ashly</persName>, unless it may
		  <lb/>be, to indulge her merry humour in laughing at
		  <lb/>him now and then; for she hath a light heart; ay,
		  <lb/>and as innocent too, as the smile on her rosy lips.
		  <lb/>But here is a savoury smell of supper, and I think
		  <lb/>we may all do tolerable justice to it to-night.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I can answer for myself,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>that
		  <lb/>it was never more welcome; a long walk certainly
		  <lb/>promotes the appetite wonderfully.</said></p>
	      <p><said>A long walk and a long fast,</said> returned the
		<lb/>Captain; <said>so now for a vigorous onset.</said> And,
		<lb/>drawing their chairs around the table, <persName>Mistress
		<lb/>Saveall's</persName> choice dishes and good cookery soon di­
		<lb/>verted the conversation to more epicurean topics.</p>
	      <p>But the interesting subject which had previously
		<lb/>engaged them was still predominant in the mind
		<lb/>of <persName>Atherton</persName>, and followed him even to the retire­
		<pb n="202"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="17(5)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">202</mw>
		<lb/>ment of his own apartment. The incipient predi­
		<lb/>lection which he had imbibed for <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>
		<lb/>was heightened by a renewed opportunity of seeing
		<lb/>and conversing with her; and the undisguised ad­
		<lb/>miration of <persName>Calvert</persName>, which seemed to set every com­
		<lb/>petitor at defiance, only stimulated his interest.
		<lb/>While both pride and affection shrunk from the
		<lb/>idea of yielding to his claims, or being superseded
		<lb/>by his superior address, his heart became insen­
		<lb/>sibly animated with the hope of success, and every
		<lb/>obstacle served only to increase the ardour of his
		<lb/>pursuit. The religious prejudices of her father,
		<lb/>and perhaps her own, <persName>Atherton</persName> considered but too
		<lb/>lightly, and in spite of all that <persName>Captain Standish</persName>
		<lb/>had said, with the sophistry of love he pursuaded
		<lb/>himself that, could he win her affections, it would be
		<lb/>easy to remove every doubt and difficulty from her
		<lb/>mind. He remembered the happy union of his pa­
		<lb/>rents, which their difference of faith had never, for
		<lb/>an instant, interrupted; and the slight barrier of a
		<lb/>creed appeared to him too vain to excite any serious
		<lb/>uneasiness. His imagination glowing with enchant­
		<lb/>ing hopes and visions of happiness, he resigned him­
		<lb/>self to repose, and in sleep pursued the airy dreams
		<lb/>which had occupied his waking thoughts.</p>
	      <p>The next day and the next passed away, and
		<lb/><persName>Major Atherton</persName> was prevented by a variety of cir­
		<lb/>cumstances from revisiting <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>; but on the
		<lb/>afternoon of the third, which was <name>Sunday</name>, he re­
		<lb/>collected to have been particularly edified by the
		<lb/>preaching of <persName>Mr. Reynal</persName>, and expressed to the Cap­
		<lb/>tain a wish to hear him again.</p>
	      <pb n="203"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="17(6)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">203</mw>
	      <p><said>Just as you please, cousin <persName>Atherton</persName>,</said> said the
		<lb/>Captain, <said><persName>Mr. Reynal</persName> is a sound and orthodox di­
		  <lb/>vine; and perhaps his wholesome doctrine may help
		  <lb/>to settle your doubts, if you have any, and lead you
		  <lb/>into the right way. But I hope before long, we
		  <lb/>shall have a worthy minister of our own; it is now
		  <lb/>four years since we separated from the church of
		  <lb/><placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, and in all that time we have had only
		  <lb/>the prophesying and exhortations of the gifted
		  <lb/>brethren, for our public teaching.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName> declined the Captain's offer of his best
		<lb/>horse, which he would fain have pressed into his
		<lb/>service; and having become well accustomed to the
		<lb/>way, he walked on at a brisk pace, and reached the
		<lb/>place of his destination just as the people were as­
		<lb/>sembling for the afternoon service. As he mingled
		<lb/>with the congregation who were ascending the hill
		<lb/>leading to the place of worship, he observed <persName>Mr.
		  <lb/>Calvert</persName> at a short distance, apparently endeavour­
		<lb/>ing to overtake him. <persName>Atherton</persName> did not wish to
		<lb/>avoid him; he therefore slackened his pace, and in
		<lb/>a moment was joined by <persName>Calvert</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>Really, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>, <said>you
		  <lb/>must be marvellously fond of exercise, to walk hith­
		  <lb/>er so very often.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And you,</said> returned Atherton, <said>seem equally
		  <lb/>averse to it; <persName>Captain Standish</persName> was only yesterday
		  <lb/>remarking on your long absence from his house.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I have business and other affairs which engage
		  <lb/>my time,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>, carelessly; <said>but pray tell
		  <pb n="204"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="17(6)v"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">204</mw>
		  <lb/>me, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, if you have turned <name>puritan</name> in
		  <lb/>good earnest?</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>Why do you ask me that question, sir? I have
		  <lb/>never avowed any deviation from the principles in
		  <lb/>which I was educated.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>And being educated by parents of different per­
		  <lb/>suasions,</said> replied <persName>Calvert</persName>, <said>you were probably in­
		  <lb/>structed in the faith of both, and feel at liberty to
		  <lb/>adopt whichever shall suit your inclination; at pre­
		  <lb/>sent you seem much inclined to favour the religion
		  <lb/>of this land.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I have ever followed the faith which my father
		  <lb/>professed,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>though I am not so bi­
		  <lb/>gotted as to absent myself from the worship of those
		  <lb/>who differ from me.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is a good rule,</said> returned <persName>Calvert</persName>, with a smile
		<lb/>of peculiar meaning, <said>to conform in matters of such
		  <lb/>trifling importance, and doubtless very politic in
		  <lb/>certain cases.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I do not perfectly comprehend you, sir,</said> replied
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>and if it is not too much trouble, must
		  <lb/>beg you to explain.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Oh, I dislike explanations above all things,</said><lb/>said <persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>but now be candid, Major, and tell
		  <lb/>me if you really came eight miles to hear good <persName>Mr.
		    <lb/>Reynal's</persName> long sermon, or to catch a stray beam
		  <lb/>from certain bright eyes, which may chance to
		  <lb/>wander this way?</said></p>
	      <p><said>Probably, sir, you judge of my motives from
		  <lb/>your own feelings and wishes,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, co­
		<lb/>louring highly.</p>

	      <milestone unit="sig" n="18(1)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">205</mw>
	      <p><said>Very likely,</said> returned <persName>Calvert</persName>, coolly; <said>and I
		  <lb/>know of no more rational way of judging of what
		  <lb/>lies beyond our observation.</said></p>
	      <p><said>In that case,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>I should choose to
		  <lb/>know that my judge was a man of correct and ho­
		  <lb/>nourable feelings.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Certainly,</said> replied <persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>and of course you
		  <lb/>will not dispute my pretensions to the office, though
		  <lb/>I never set myself up for a miracle of goodness, as
		  <lb/>some officers in our regiment did; there was <persName>Cap­
		    <lb/>tain R—</persName> for instance, not to mention one or two
		  <lb/>others.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I believe you were never accused of raising your
		  <lb/>standard of perfection too highly,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>No, I hate canting, and never try to pass for
		  <lb/>better than I am,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>, pointedly; <said>ex­
		  <lb/>cept,</said> he added, <said>in cases of necessity; for instance,
		  <lb/>here we are at the entrance of the tabernacle, and
		  <lb/>must strive to look as demure as possible; for it is
		  <lb/>as much the fashion to wear long faces in a <rs type="properAdjective">puritan</rs>
		  <lb/>meeting-house, as it is to practice smiles and bows
		  <lb/>at court.</said></p>
	      <p>As he finished speaking, they both entered the
		<lb/>house, and accepted of seats which were civilly of­
		<lb/>fered them near the door. A moment after <persName>Mr.
		  <lb/>Grey</persName> and his family came in, and passed on to their
		<lb/>usual places. This circumstance seemed unnoticed
		<lb/>by <persName>Calvert</persName>, till the eagerness with which the eyes
		<lb/>of <persName>Atherton</persName> pursued them, excited a transient smile;
		<lb/>and during the remainder of the services, his coun­
		<lb/>tenance was marked by a gravity which might have

		<lb/>passed for the expression of a serious and devout
		<lb/>mind. As soon as the congregation was dismissed,
		<lb/>he took the arm of <persName>Atherton</persName>, who was disposed to
		<lb/>linger behind, and walked to the bottom of the hill
		<lb/>with him, where they stopped by mutual, though
		<lb/>tacit consent.</p>
	      <p><said>May I ask what direction you are about to
		  <lb/>take?</said> said <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>Home, that is to <persName>Captain Standish's</persName>,</said> replied
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>and if you are disposed to return with
		  <lb/>me, I will promise you a welcome reception from
		  <lb/>my host.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Another time I will try it,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>but
		  <lb/>now I am going to our friend <persName>Mr. Grey's</persName>, and will
		  <lb/>make you the tempting offer to accompany me; now
		  <lb/>do not say you have no wish to go there.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I shall not,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>on the con­
		  <lb/>trary, it would give me pleasure; but they are ac­
		  <lb/>customed to keep this day so sacred, that the visit
		  <lb/>of a stranger might not be acceptable.</said></p>
	      <p><said>As you please,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>but I have never
		  <lb/>been received otherwise than graciously, at any
		  <lb/>time.</said></p>
	      <p><said>If,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>you can suit your conver­
		  <lb/>sation to circumstances, as well as you have your
		  <lb/>countenance this afternoon, I am not surprised at
		  <lb/>their forbearance.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Far better,</said> replied <persName>Calvert</persName>. <said>I discourse of
		  <lb/>theology with the father, and settle all controvert­
		  <lb/>ed points to his full satisfaction; and sing psalms
		  <lb/>with the daughter and niece, till they believe me on
		  <pb n="207"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="18(2)r"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">207</mw>
		  <lb/>the point of abjuring the mother church, with all
		  <lb/>her pomps and ceremonies; and if they don't end
		  <lb/>by begging me to crop my hair, and round off my
		  <lb/>ears, I shall be satisfied.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And that is not trying to appear better than you
		  <lb/>are, is it?</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>Not better, only a little different,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>;
		<lb/><said>besides, you forget my saving clause, and this is
		  <lb/>a case of necessity. But hush!—they are close by
		  <lb/>us, even now.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName> looked round, and saw <persName>Miriam</persName> and
		<lb/><persName>Lois Grey</persName>, almost at his side; but they were busily
		<lb/>engaged in conversation, and did not observe them,
		<lb/>till <persName>Miriam</persName> accidentally dropping her handker­
		<lb/>chief, <persName>Atherton</persName> and <persName>Calvert</persName>, at the same instant,
		<lb/>stooped to raise it from the ground. The latter
		<lb/>gained the prize, and <persName>Miriam</persName> received it from his
		<lb/>hand with a smile; though <persName>Atherton</persName> fancied a still
		<lb/>brighter one animated her features, as she return­
		<lb/>ed his salutation; and the idea lessened the mortifi­
		<lb/>cation of his defeat, and the reluctance he felt to
		<lb/>part from her. <persName>Calvert</persName> bade him farewell, with
		<lb/>an air of triumph, which seemed to say, <said>I have
		  <lb/>the advantage over you;</said> and <persName>Atherton</persName>, conquering
		<lb/>a strong inclination to join them, turned into
		<lb/>another direction, and was soon in the well-known
		<lb/>path, which led to the residence of <persName>Captain Stan­
		  <lb/>dish</persName>.</p>

	      <p><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">On</hi> the ensuing week, <persName>Major Atherton</persName> was an
		<lb/>almost daily visitant at the house of <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>.
		<lb/>Every morning he found some excuse for going to
		<lb/><placeName>Plymouth</placeName>; and <persName>Captain Standish</persName>, who was at that
		<lb/>time particularly occupied with some affairs of his
		<lb/>own, was pleased to hear of his kinsman's frequent
		<lb/>engagements at the Governor's, or <persName>Mr. Bradford's</persName>;
		<lb/>though not always aware that these engagements
		<lb/>were concluded in the society of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>.
		<lb/>He was received by every member of the family
		<lb/>with the utmost cordiality; and the eloquent blush­
		<lb/>es of <persName>Miriam</persName>, the engaging confidence and graceful
		<lb/>timidity which alternately marked her manner
		<lb/>towards him, encouraged his hopes, and increased
		<lb/>the attachment he cherished for her; which be­
		<lb/>came deeper and stronger, as every interview dis­
		<lb/>closed to him some new charm in her mind and
		<lb/>character. There was, also, enough of variety,
		<lb/>uncertainty and doubt, to create perplexity and
		<pb n="209"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="18(3)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">209</mw>
		<lb/>induce him to conceal his sentiments, till more fully
		<lb/>convinced that they would meet with a favourable
		<lb/>reception.</p>
	      <p>The conduct of <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName> was well calculated
		<lb/>to render <persName>Atherton</persName> mistrustful of <persName>Miriam's</persName> affec­
		<lb/>tion; he was continually near her; and <persName>Atherton</persName>
		<lb/>often sighed as he observed her, with apparent
		<lb/>pleasure, enter into conversation with him, and lis­
		<lb/>ten to his descriptions of foreign countries, and
		<lb/>the adventures of other days, which he had always
		<lb/>at command, and possessed the pleasing art of re­
		<lb/>lating with a spirit and humour that could not fail
		<lb/>to amuse.</p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName>, like other lovers, was ingenious in tor­
		<lb/>menting himself wth visionary fears, and too little
		<lb/>skilled in the female heart, to detect the subtle
		<lb/>evasions, to which it has recourse to conceal an
		<lb/>acknowledged prepossession: his hopes were con­
		<lb/>stantly fluctuating; and often depressed by circum­
		<lb/>stances, from which, with more experience, he would
		<lb/>have drawn the most flattering inferences. <persName>Calvert</persName>
		<lb/>always assumed the aspect of a favoured lover:
		<lb/>conscious of his advantages, he seemed secure of
		<lb/>conquest; or, if at any time uncertain, he artfully
		<lb/>concealed it, and wore an air of presumption, from
		<lb/>which the more delicate and honourable mind of
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName> revolted. He was evidently no stranger
		<lb/>to the views and feelings of his rival; but he ap­
		<lb/>peared totally to disregard them, and resolved not
		<lb/>to admit the possibility, that he could become a
		<lb/>successful candidate for the favour of his mistress.

		<lb/>His manners were frank and careless; but <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName>, as his visits became more frequent, remarked
		<lb/>an occasional caprice and coldness; he also fanci­
		<lb/>ed that <persName>Mr. Grey</persName> began to regard the attentions,
		<lb/>which both himself and <persName>Calvert</persName> directed to his
		<lb/>daughter, with a suspicious eye. He had no wish
		<lb/>to conceal his sentiments, and only waited for a
		<lb/>favourable opportunity to disclose them, both to
		<lb/><persName>Miriam</persName> and her father.</p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName> called at the house one evening, and
		<lb/>was not displeased, on entering the parlour, to find
		<lb/>it occupied by <persName>Miriam</persName> alone. She was carelessly
		<lb/>reclining in a huge elbow chair, with her eyes fixed
		<lb/>on the blazing fire, which glanced brightly on her
		<lb/>figure and countenance, and revealed an expression
		<lb/>of unusual pensiveness. Without raising her eyes
		<lb/>as he entered, she continued to hum the air of a tune
		<lb/>which <persName>Atherton</persName> had himself taught her, and of which
		<lb/>he was particularly fond, because it had been a
		<lb/>favourite with his mother. It was a beautiful
		<lb/>sacred melody, that even <persName>Mr. Grey</persName> approved; and,
		<lb/>though the flageolet on which <persName>Atherton</persName> played with
		<lb/>uncommon skill, was not of <rs type="properAdjective">puritanical</rs> invention,
		<lb/>he had frequently listened with pleasure as its soft
		<lb/>melody mingled with the sweet and rich tones of
		<lb/>his daughter's voice.</p>
	      <p><persName>Miriam</persName> however perceived <persName>Atherton</persName> even sooner
		<lb/>than he wished; and, hastily rising, she offered
		<lb/>him a seat, saying with a smile,—</p>
	      <p>
		<said>Excuse my inattention, sir, but I thought it was
		  <lb/><persName>Lois</persName> who entered.</said>
	      </p>

	      <milestone unit="sig" n="18(4)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">211</mw>
	      <p><said>And you, I hope,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>will forgive
		  <lb/>my interrupting the reverie which you seemed to be
		  <lb/>enjoying.</said></p>
	      <p><said>The interruption is quite fortunate,</said> returned
		<lb/><persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>for I was at that moment attempting
		  <lb/>your favourite air, and need your assistance to go
		  <lb/>through with it. I fear my ear must be growing
		  <lb/>dull, for I never made so much discord in a simple
		  <lb/>tune.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Mine must be dull, indeed, if you did,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>for I was admiring the ease and cor­
		  <lb/>rectness with which you sung it. But you must
		  <lb/>allow me to hear you again, in order to judge which
		  <lb/>of us is mistaken.</said></p>
	      <p><said>If you will accompany me,</said> replied <persName>Miriam</persName>
		<lb/><said>and in the mean time, some lights will look more
		  <lb/>cheerful than this fitful blaze.</said></p>
	      <p><said>They will spoil this pleasant twilight, which is
		  <lb/>the most delightful season of the day,</said> said <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName>.</p>
	      <p>he took the flageolet from his pocket as he spoke,
		<lb/>and <persName>Miriam</persName>, who had nearly reached the door, re­
		<lb/>turned; and, after <choice><sic>stiring</sic><corr>stirring</corr></choice> the fire into a brighter
		<lb/>glow, commenced the song, which she executed
		<lb/>without a single false note; though the sound of
		<lb/>the instrument often died away, as <persName>Atherton</persName>, in
		<lb/>listening to her, seemed fearful that the softest
		<lb/>breath might interrupt the harmony which she
		<lb/>created.</p>
	      <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> was at all times strongly alive
		<lb/>to the charms of music; but the voice of <persName>Miriam
		  <pb n="212"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="18(4)v"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">212</mw>
		  <lb/>Grey</persName> had acquired an influence over his feelings,
		<lb/>at which he was often surprised, yet seldom en­
		<lb/>deavoured to resist. As soon as she had finished,
		<lb/>he rose abruptly from his chair, and for several
		<lb/>moments paced the room in silence. <persName>Miriam</persName> per­
		<lb/>plexed at his conduct, regarded him almost with
		<lb/>alarm; but she at length ventured to say, in a
		<lb/>timid accent,—</p>
	      <p>
		<said>I fear I have done wrong, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, and
		  <lb/>again, unfortunately awakened some painful re­
		  <lb/>membrances.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName> suddenly stopped, and advancing to­
		<lb/>wards her, took her hand, and looking earnestly in
		<lb/>her face, replied,—</p>
	      <p>
		<said><emph>You</emph> do wrong <persName>Miriam</persName>? <emph>you</emph> awaken painful
		  <lb/>remembrance? no; believe me;—when with <emph>you</emph>,
		  <lb/>the past is forgotten, and my presumptuous hopes
		  <lb/>dare to image scenes of future happiness, which
		  <lb/>your smiles have encouraged, and your lips alone
		  <lb/>can sanction.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><persName>Miriam</persName>, in silent confusion, averted her blushing
		<lb/>face from his ardent gaze; but, as he eagerly
		<lb/>watched the variations of her countenance, the bril­
		<lb/>liant glow faded into a deadly paleness, and
		<lb/>with a look of alarm, she hastily withdrew her
		<lb/>hand, which he still retained within his own.
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName> followed the direction of her eyes, and
		<lb/>with a start of surprise, beheld <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, who had
		<lb/>entered unperceived, standing with folded arms,
		<lb/>and regarding them with severe and fixed atten­
		<lb/>tion. <persName>Atherton</persName> instantly recovered his self-posses­
		<pb n="213"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="18(5)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">213</mw>
		<lb/>sion, and with the calmness of conscious integrity,
		<lb/>awaited the expected reproof. But <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, af­
		<lb/>ter the first scrutiny, resumed his usual gravity,
		<lb/>and taking a chair, he coolly said,—</p>
	      <p><said>I would not interrupt you, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>;
		  <lb/>you would doubtless say nothing to my daughter,
		  <lb/>which may not reach my ear, also.</said></p>
	      <p><said>By no means, sir;</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>and I
		  <lb/>have long wished for an opportunity to explain my­
		  <lb/>self on a subject, which nearly concerns my happi­
		  <lb/>ness.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is a subject to which I may not listen,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Mr. Grey</persName>. <said>Young man,</said> he added, emphatically;
		<lb/><said>you have gained my esteem, and I owe you a
		  <lb/>debt of gratitude, which can never be cancelled;
		  <lb/>yet my religion and my principles are more pre­
		  <lb/>cious unto me, than the gratification of any world­
		  <lb/>ly feelings, the enjoyment of any temporal plea­
		  <lb/>sure;—even than the earthly happiness of my child.
		  <lb/>Deceive not yourself, therefore, with the vain be­
		  <lb/>lief, that I shall sacrifice my duty to the idle wishes
		  <lb/>of an indiscreet and youthful passion.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Mr. Grey</persName> spoke with mildness, but in a tone of
		<lb/>decision, which chilled the ardent hopes of <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName>, who was about to answer, and plead his suit,
		<lb/>with the earnestness of passionate feeling, when a
		<lb/>glance of entreaty, from <persName>Miriam</persName>, checked his ut­
		<lb/>terance; and the entrance of <persName>Lois Grey</persName>, at the
		<lb/>same moment, determined him to defer the conver­
		<lb/>sation till a more fitting time. He was, how­
		<lb/>ever, too much disturbed to enter into general dis­
		<pb n="214"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="18(5)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">214</mw>
		<lb/>course, and soon after took his leave; depressed in
		<lb/>spirits by his unexpected repulse, though still resolv­
		<lb/>ed to bear up against all difficulties, and if possi­
		<lb/>ble, to overcome them.</p>
	      <p><persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, after the departure of <persName>Atherton</persName>, re­
		<lb/>mained a few moments absorbed by his own re­
		<lb/>flections; and then seating himself by his daughter's
		<lb/>side, he fixed his eyes upon her, as if searching
		<lb/>her inmost thoughts.</p>
	      <p><said>Why do you look at me so earnestly, sir?</said><lb/>asked <persName>Miriam</persName>, endeavouring to shake off the em­
		<lb/>barrassment which his manner, combined with re­
		<lb/>cent circumstances, had caused.</p>
	      <p><said>I have ever been accustomed, <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> he re­
		<lb/>plied, <said>to read in your countenance the feelings of
		  <lb/>your heart; I would learn, if I may still rely on it,
		  <lb/>and expect your confidence.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Can you doubt it?</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>till I have
		  <lb/>once deceived you, father, you cannot, ought not, to
		  <lb/>suspect me.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>I do not, my child.—<persName>Major Atherton</persName>, too is
		  <lb/>candid, and he has not sought to disguise his senti­
		  <lb/>ments, which were apparent to me, even before the
		  <lb/>events of this day.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Dear father,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, deeply blushing,<choice><sic>’</sic><corr/></choice>
		<lb/><said>you mistake;—he has not, he only――</said></p>
	      <p><said>I will spare your blushes, <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> interrupted
		<lb/><persName>Mr. Grey</persName>. <said>It is not my intention to question
		  <lb/>you, concerning what he said; though had I not
		  <lb/>unexpectedly heard his words, the confusion which
		  <lb/>my presence excited could not be mistaken.</said></p>

	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">215</mw>
	      <p>
		<said>You regard the subject too seriously, sir. I beg
		  <lb/>it may not occasion you one moment of anxiety.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Did it concern you less deeply, <persName>Miriam</persName>, it
		  <lb/>would not; but the dread that your affections may
		  <lb/>become engaged to one with whom you can have
		  <lb/>no connection, has already given me much uneasi­
		  <lb/>ness.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>I trust my inclination will never render me for­
		  <lb/>getful of my duty,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>; but less firmly
		<lb/>than she had before spoken.</p>
	      <p><said>Most fervently do I hope so,</said> returned <persName>Mr.
		  <lb/>Grey</persName>, again regarding her with attention; <said>and
		  <lb/>I place much confidence, <persName>Miriam</persName>, in the strength
		  <lb/>and rectitude of your principles.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I do not think they will be tried, very severely
		  <lb/>in this instance,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, smiling.</p>
	      <p><said>Take heed, lest you fall into a snare through
		  <lb/>presumption and vain self-confidence, <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said><lb/>said her father. <said>I have fore-warned you of the
		  <lb/>danger, and it remains with you to avoid or over­
		  <lb/>come it.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I know not how to avoid it,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>,
		<lb/>gravely; <said>but it is written, <quote>resist the devil, and
		    <lb/>he will flee from you;</quote> and I think, father, <persName>Major
		    <lb/>Atherton</persName> cannot prove more irresistible than he.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>If you rely on your own strength alone, <persName>Miriam</persName>,
		  <lb/>you may find too late, that you have <quote>leaned on a
		    <lb/>broken reed.</quote></said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Dear father,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, archly, <said>do you
		  <lb/>think <persName>Major Atherton</persName> so very attractive, that I
		  <lb/>cannot see him, without danger of admiring him,
		  <lb/>more than you approve?</said></p>

		  <lb/>and, in his outward conduct, since he has sojourned

	      </p>

	      <p><said>Most assuredly it has;</said> said <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, <said>never­
		  <lb/>theless, <persName>Miriam</persName>, we do endanger our faith, by hold­
		  <lb/>ing familiar intercourse with the zealots of a per­
		  <lb/>verse and antichristian church; with whom we are
		  <lb/>commanded to have no fellowship, but rather to re­
		  <lb/>prove them; except, as the apostle doubtless meant,
		  <lb/>so far as the laws of hospitality and courtesy shall
		  <lb/>require.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>But, sir, we know that <persName>Major Atherton</persName> has
		  <lb/>been taught to respect our opinions, and even im­
		  <lb/>bibed from his mother a prejudice in their favour;
		  <lb/>and, at all times he has cheerfully conformed to our
		  <lb/>customs, and devoutly joined in our worship.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>We can place no dependence, my child, on an
		  <lb/>outward conformity, without some evidence of a
		  <lb/>willing spirit, and this external reverence is most
		  <lb/>likely to mislead your inexperience and conceal
		  <lb/>the real danger.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Dear father,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, earnestly; <said>you
		  <lb/>shall find I am not so very weak and irresolute,
		  <lb/>but that, though only a timid girl, I possess some
		  <lb/>portion of the resolution which enabled you
		  <lb/>to endure and overcome so much, for the estab­
		  <lb/>lishment of that pure religion which you have
		  <pb n="217"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="19(1)r"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">217</mw>
		  <lb/>taught me, by precept and example, to prize so
		  <lb/>highly. No,</said> she added with a blush;—<said>even
		  <lb/>should your fears be realized, I could never be­
		  <lb/>come an apostate from the faith which I have re­
		  <lb/>ceived from you.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Continue to value it more dearly than your
		  <lb/>life,</said> said <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>; <said>and never for an instant,
		  <lb/>place it in competition with any earthly passion.
		  <lb/>However firm, however sincere, you may now feel
		  <lb/>yourself to be, believe me there would be no secu­
		  <lb/>rity for your principles if the sophistry of love were
		  <lb/>united with the perverse, but plausible arguments
		  <lb/>which the sons of prelacy can so well command
		  <lb/>and urge for their subversion.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>And do you believe, father, that the truth can
		  <lb/>so readily yield to error and falsehood?</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Women are born to submit,</said> returned <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>;
		<lb/><said>and as the weaker vessel, it is meet they should
		  <lb/>be guided by those who have rule over them. I
		  <lb/>well know how easily they become converts to such
		  <lb/>as they regard with affection. Your mother, <persName>Miri­
		    <lb/>am</persName>, was wandering in the mazes of error when I
		  <lb/>first beheld her; and though Providence was pleased
		  <lb/>to give me favour in her eyes, and to make me the
		  <lb/>instrument of plucking her, as a brand from the
		  <lb/>burning; yet but for the love which she bore me,
		  <lb/>she would probably have lived and died in the
		  <lb/>bosom of an idolatrous church.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You were armed with the weapons of truth,</said><lb/>said <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>and she could not resist their force;
		  <lb/>but you will not, father, deny the influence of our

		  <lb/>sex. If the entreaties of <persName>Dalilah</persName> could subdue
		  <lb/><persName>Samson</persName>, how much more powerful must be the
		  <lb/>arguments of religion from the lips of a virtuous
		  <lb/>woman. Even the Apostle saith, <quote>The believing
		    <lb/>wife shall sanctify the unbelieving husband.</quote></said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>It may have been so, my daughter; but the
		  <lb/>same apostle also saith, <quote>Be ye not yoked to­
		    <lb/>gether with unbelievers;</quote>—which is but to pro­
		  <lb/>voke the displeasure of Heaven, and incur its judg­
		  <lb/>ments as did the children of <name>Israel</name>, when they took
		  <lb/>them wives from the daughters of the land.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Yet father did not <persName>Moses</persName> marry an <rs type="properAdjective">Ethiopian</rs>
		  <lb/>woman? and was not <persName>Miriam</persName>, the prophetess re­
		  <lb/>proved, and smitten with leprosy, because she spake
		  <lb/>evil against it?</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>That cannot be an ensample to us,</said> said <persName>Mr.
		  <lb/>Grey</persName>,—<said>to whom the Lord doth not, as unto his
		  <lb/>servant <persName>Moses</persName>, speak face to face; and though your
		  <lb/>temporal happiness is most dear to me, <persName>Miriam</persName>,
		  <lb/>never could I consent to promote it by permitting
		  <lb/>your union with one, who might endanger your
		  <lb/>eternal interests by leading you to trust in baseless
		  <lb/>ceremonies and to bow down to the graven images
		  <lb/>of Episcopacy.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Fear not for me, father,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>I have
		  <lb/>at present no wish to change my situation; and
		  <lb/>if ever I shall be induced to quit you, it must be
		  <lb/>with your free consent, your full and decided appro­
		  <lb/>bation.</said></p>

		<said>I fully trust your word, <persName>Miriam</persName>; yet I wish
		  <lb/>not like unhappy <persName>Jephtha</persName>, to bind my daughter to

		  <lb/>a state of celibacy. I would rather urge you to
		  <lb/>increase your usefulness by a worthy choice, and
		  <lb/>like a true <quote>mother in <name>Israel</name>,</quote> faithfully discharge
		  <lb/>the duties of your sex and station; that before my
		  <lb/>eyes are closed, I may have the satisfaction of see­
		  <lb/>ing my descendants rising up to honour and ad­
		  <lb/>vance those civil and religious institutions, of which
		  <lb/>we, <quote>through much tribulation,</quote> have laid the
		  <lb/><quote>foundation stone.</quote></said>
	      </p>
	      <p><persName>Miriam</persName> made no reply; and after a few moments
		<lb/>of unbroken silence, <persName>Mr. Grey</persName> resumed the dis­
		<lb/>course.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>I feel my heart eased of a heavy burthen by this
		  <lb/>conversation with you, <persName>Miriam</persName>; and in the strength­
		  <lb/>ened conviction that you have sufficient discretion
		  <lb/>and virtue to direct you, I shall commence my
		  <lb/>voyage with more resolution, and feel the pain of
		  <lb/>parting from you less severe.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>If I <emph>could</emph> be permitted to go with you!</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>indeed, father, I cannot reconcile myself
		  <lb/>to the thought of a separation; but I can submit
		  <lb/>to any thing if you will only take me with you.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is impossible,</said> said <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>: <said>the difficulties
		  <lb/>of the voyage, the persecutions which still await
		  <lb/>our devoted sect,—every thing forbids it. You
		  <lb/>must remain here, <persName>Miriam</persName>, and strive not to indulge
		  <lb/>any anxious thoughts or repining wishes.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>But so many long months must pass away be­
		  <lb/>fore you will return, father! and till now you have
		  <lb/>never gone from me scarcely for one short week.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>The time will fly swiftly, my child, though it
		  <pb n="220"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="19(2)v"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">220</mw>
		  <lb/>seems long in looking forward; and with your
		  <lb/>cousin <persName>Lois</persName>, who has ever been dear as a sister to
		  <lb/>you, it cannot pass unhappily. I feel comforted in
		  <lb/>leaving you with her; she is older and more expe­
		  <lb/>rienced than yourself, and fully competent to advise
		  <lb/>you in every circumstance and situation.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>But <persName>Lois</persName> will soon have other claims on her
		  <lb/>affection,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>and I begin already to
		  <lb/>fear that <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName> will engross more than his
		  <lb/>share.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You need have no fear on that subject, <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said><lb/>said <persName>Lois</persName>, who had hitherto remained silent. <said>I
		  <lb/>think my heart is large enough to contain more
		  <lb/>than one object of affection.</said></p>
	      <p><said>But there is one whom I need not name, <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said><lb/>said <persName>Mr. Grey</persName> with some hesitation, <said>whose heart
		  <lb/>has long been bound to you; and I would fain see
		  <lb/>you disposed to reward his faithful love with the
		  <lb/>favour it has merited.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Indeed, father,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>I would be con­
		  <lb/>tented with the smallest corner of <persName>Lois's</persName> heart,
		  <lb/>rather than to possess the whole of his.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>You always speak lightly on this subject, <persName>Miri­
		    <lb/>am</persName>; yet you know it is one which I have long
		  <lb/>regarded with satisfaction; and I do still hope that
		  <lb/>you will not always remain wilfully blind to the
		  <lb/>excellent qualities of <persName>master Ashly</persName>.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Now do not call me a stubborn girl, father;
		  <lb/>but in truth I cannot value his goodness as it de­
		  <lb/>serves; and it would be unjust for me to snatch the
		  <lb/>prize from some maiden more enamoured of <choice><sic>hi</sic><corr>his</corr></choice>
		  <lb/>worth.</said>

		<said>Bring forth your <soCalled rend="pre(“)post(”)">strong reasons,</soCalled> <persName>Miriam</persName>,
		  <lb/>and tell me what you particularly object to in him.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Nothing in <emph>particular</emph>, but every thing, in <emph>gene­
		    <lb/>ral</emph>; forgive me father, but he has really no one
		  <lb/>quality, which I should call agreeable.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>And is piety and sincerity nothing?</said> asked <persName>Mr.
		  <lb/>Grey</persName>; <said>are integrity and uprightness of character
		  <lb/>so very disagreeable?</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>No, indeed, father; but I would choose a compa­
		  <lb/>nion who has a lighter heart and less solemn coun­
		  <lb/>tenance, to lead me through the journey of life;
		  <lb/>I fear I should tire of virtue itself, if always before
		  <lb/>my eyes in so ungentle a form. <persName>Master Ashly</persName> is
		  <lb/>so image-like withal; that though in no danger of
		  <lb/>worshipping him, I might possibly commit the sin
		  <lb/>of converting him into a laughing-stock.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>You cannot object to his person, <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, with an air of displeasure; <said>the youth
		  <lb/>is well-favoured, and tall and comely as a cedar of
		  <lb/><placeName>Lebanon</placeName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Yes, quite tall enough,</said> returned <persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>and
		  <lb/>as <persName>Captain Standish</persName> once said, as stiff as the ram­
	      	<lb/>rod of his musket. <persName>Cousin Lois</persName>,</said> continued the laugh­
		<lb/>ing damsel, <said>did it ever strike you that <persName>Mistress
		  <lb/>Rebecca Spindle</persName> would make a suitable help-mate
		  <lb/>for him? a little too ancient perhaps, but other­
		  <lb/>wise far better qualified than myself; and it may
		  <lb/>be less inclined to shun so advantageous an al­
		  <lb/>liance.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You are strangely perverse, <persName>Miriam</persName>;</said> said <persName>Mr.

		  <lb/>to be thus trifled with; you must be unaccountably
		  <lb/>prejudiced, or else prepossessed in favour of some
		  <lb/>other. I hope <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName> has not caused you to
		  <lb/>misprise our plain <placeName>New-England</placeName> youths.</said></p>
	      <p><said>No, sir;</said> replied <persName>Miriam</persName>; <said><persName>Mr. Calvert</persName> is very
		  <lb/>well in his way; but he wants some of <persName>Benjamin
		    <lb/>Ashly's</persName> rare qualities. I would choose a man
		  <lb/>more like,—like myself, father, with just a plea­
		  <lb/>sant mixture of the good and agreeable.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And the evil you should add, child,</said> said her
		<lb/>father, smiling.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>I left that for you, father; and rightly judged
		  <lb/>that you would not forget the addition.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>As she finished speaking <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName> entered
		<lb/>the room; he was less animated than usual, and
		<lb/>seemed inclined to remain silent and thoughtful.</p>
	      <p><said>You are unusually serious to-night, <persName>Mr. Cal­
		    <lb/>vert</persName>,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>and look like the bearer of
		  <lb/>ill-tidings; pray let us hear quickly if you have
		  <lb/>any thing to communicate.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I have nothing to tell, nothing at all,</said> replied
		<lb/><persName>Calvert</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>Are you unwell then?</said> asked <persName>Lois Grey</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>No, but to tell you the truth,</said> he said, with an
		<lb/>air of frankness, <said>I am rather out of temper.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Oh if that is all we need not be alarmed,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>it is not often a fatal malady, though
		  <lb/>I understand it is a very common one in warm
		  <lb/>climates.</said></p>
	      <p><said>But the climate does not justify the offence,</said><lb/>said <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, <said>and the scripture saith, <quote>he that
		    <pb n="223"/>
		    <milestone unit="sig" n="19(4)r"/>
		    <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">223</mw>
		    <lb/>ruleth his spirit is better than he that taketh a
		    <lb/>city.</quote></said></p>
	      <p><said>I find I must justify myself at all events,</said> re­
		<lb/>turned <persName>Calvert</persName>, <said>though it is a foolish affair, and
		  <lb/>not worth mentioning. I met <persName>Major Atherton</persName> as
		  <lb/>he came from here just now, and he seemed in a
		  <lb/>very ill-humour, and resolved to quarrel with me;
		  <lb/>but I was fortunate enough to calm him, and save
		  <lb/>myself from being run through with his sword.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Calvert</persName> observed the complexion of <persName>Miriam</persName> va­
		<lb/>ry as he spoke; and <persName>Mr. Grey</persName> in a tone of real
		<lb/>concern enquired,</p>
	      <p>
		<said>And what was the occasion of all this, sir?</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>I really cannot tell,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>it seemed
		  <lb/>to arise from a mere trifle, and I attributed it to
		  <lb/>some circumstance which had taken place here.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I thought,</said> replied <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, <said>that <persName>Major
		    <lb/>Atherton</persName> had better principles and more command
		  <lb/>over his passions than to engage so lightly in a
		  <lb/>quarrel.</said></p>
	      <p><said>As to that, sir,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>, carelessly, <said>you
		  <lb/>know we of the church are not all of us so strict
		  <lb/>as perhaps we should be; and the Major has been
		  <lb/>in the army quite long enough to acquire high no­
		  <lb/>tions of honour and a love of fighting.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I will speak to him touching this matter,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Mr. Grey</persName>. <said>A word in season is <quote>like apples of
		    <lb/>gold in pictures of silver,</quote> and a friendly admoni­
		  <lb/>tion perchance may prove of service to him.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I think, sir,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>, <said>it can be of no
		  <lb/>avail, and all will be forgotten between us in a few
		  <pb n="224"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="19(4)v"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">224</mw>
		  <lb/>days. <persName>Major Atherton</persName> is hasty but not ill-dispos­
		  <lb/>ed, and it is very possible I may have said some­
		  <lb/>thing to vex him.</said></p>
	      <p>After this apparent frank apology and conces­
		<lb/>sion, which were certainly calculated to set his
		<lb/>own disposition in a favourable point of view, <persName>Mr.
		  <lb/>Calvert</persName> immediately changed the conversation.
		<lb/>He hoped he had said sufficient to impress the
		<lb/>mind of <persName>Mr. Grey</persName> unfavourably towards <persName>Atherton</persName>,
		<lb/>whose growing intimacy in the family he viewed
		<lb/>with jealousy, and began to entertain serious ap­
		<lb/>prehensions that he would eventually interfere
		<lb/>with his plans, and supersede him in the affections
		<lb/>of <persName>Miriam</persName>.</p>

	      <p><persName rend="case(smallcaps)">Major Atherton</persName> had quitted the house of
		<lb/><persName>Mr. Grey</persName> with feelings of chagrin and disappoint­
		<lb/>ment more keen than he had ever before experienc­
		<lb/>ed. It was true, in the blushing confusion of <persName>Mi­
		  <lb/>riam</persName> he had read nothing to reprove his presump­
		<lb/>tion, or discourage his hopes; but the language of
		<lb/>her father, too plain to be misunderstood, convinc­
		<lb/>ed him that he would never sanction the marriage
		<lb/>of his daughter with one whom he considered wil­
		<lb/>fully bound in the fetters of error and supersti­
		<lb/>tion; and under such circumstances he could
		<lb/>scarcely expect or even wish to attach the affec­
		<lb/>tions or receive the hand of <persName>Miriam</persName>. These
		<lb/>thoughts engaged his mind as he slowly retraced
		<lb/>his steps from the door, which he had recently en­
		<lb/>tered with very different feelings; and his hand
		<lb/>yet rested on the wicket, and his eyes lingered on
		<lb/>the casement still faintly lighted by the blazing
		<lb/>fire within, when he was startled by a slight touch
		<lb/>upon his shoulder, and turning quickly round he
		<lb/>saw <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName> standing by his side.</p>

	      <p><said>To pass through the gate when you see proper
		  <lb/>to quit your hold of it,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName> in his usual
		<lb/>careless manner.</p>
	      <p><said>It is entirely at your service now;</said> returned
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>, with recovered composure. <said>I was not
		  <lb/>aware that I detained you from entering;</said> and at
		<lb/>the same time he threw open the gate and walk­
		<lb/>ed on.</p>
	      <p><persName>Calvert</persName> deliberately closed it and followed him.</p>
	      <p><said>We will let it rest for the present,</said> he said,
		<lb/><said>though I apprehended just now you were about to
		  <lb/>bear it away as <persName>Samson</persName> did the doors of the <name>Phi­

		  <lb/>Major; it is not the first time I have found you

	      <p><said>You do me great honour, sir,</said> replied <persName>Atherton</persName>,
		<lb/><said>by interesting yourself so warmly in my con­
		  <lb/>cerns; am I to understand that you have become a
		  <lb/>spy upon my actions? or do I interrupt your own
		  <lb/>walks and arrangements?</said></p>
	      <p><said>A little of both,</said> returned <persName>Calvert</persName>. <said>As to the
		  <lb/>first, you well know it is desirable to learn the
		  <lb/>force and position of an adversary whom one may
		  <lb/>be called to engage; and for the second I believe
		  <lb/>we are both drawn hither by the same attraction,
		  <lb/>and it is a pity our plans should interfere.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I have no wish to enter into competition with
		  <lb/>you, sir,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, haughtily; <said>and may ask,

		  <lb/>are privileged to walk in his high-way, I shall
		  <lb/>take the liberty of going, wherever it suits my
		  <lb/>pleasure.</said></p>
	      <p>The manner, even more than the words of <persName>Cal­
		  <lb/>vert</persName>, irritated the already harassed feelings of
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>, and stopping abruptly, he said,—</p>
	      <p><said>I would counsel you, to keep at my sword's
		  <lb/>length, sir, or you may have cause to repent of your
		  <lb/>temerity;</said> and as he spoke, he laid his hand on the
		<lb/>hilt of his weapon.</p>
	      <p><said>Nay,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>, composedly, <said>if two cannot
		  <lb/>walk without falling out by the way, it is indeed
		  <lb/>time to separate. If this should reach the long-
		  <lb/>eared generation of <name>Puritans</name>, we might be put in
		  <lb/>the stocks; or perhaps be degraded from the title
		  <lb/>of gentlemen, which is a marvellously ingenious
		  <lb/>punishment of their own invention, for the special
		  <lb/>correction of all naughty grown up boys.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And perhaps deserve it too;</said> returned <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName>, almost instantly repenting of his haste. <said>I
		  <lb/>have no wish to signalize my courage in a foolish
		  <lb/>quarrel with you; and, if I mistake not, yours
		  <lb/>was sufficiently tested, by a duel, some few years
		  <lb/>since.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Yes,</said> replied <persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>and my sword is still
		  <pb n="228"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="19(6)v"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">228</mw>
		  <lb/>of the same good metal, and entirely at your ser­
		  <lb/>vice. Meet me in <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, <placeName>England</placeName>, or even
		  <lb/>here, when I am the husband, or rejected lover of
		  <lb/><persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, and we will try our skill on the
		  <lb/>most friendly terms; but a rupture, at present,
		  <lb/>would at once destroy all hopes of success.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Neither now or ever, shall I meet you in that
		  <lb/>way;</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>and I should despise my­
		  <lb/>self, were I capable of harbouring a revengeful
		  <lb/>purpose, and delayed the execution, from motives
		  <lb/>of policy, or through the mean hypocrisy of ap­
		  <lb/>pearing better than I am.</said></p>
	      <p><said>In plain words,</said> replied <persName>Calvert</persName>, <said>you would
		  <lb/>say that you despise me; I admire sincerity,
		  <lb/>above all things Major, and thank you, heartily,
		  <lb/>for your opinion; but to be consistent methinks,
		  <lb/>you should fly into a passion with the fair <persName>Miriam</persName>,
		  <lb/>as you have with me; it would impress her quite
		  <lb/>differently from the sweet melody of your flageolet.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Perhaps I shall, when she uses the insulting
		  <lb/>language which you have holden to me,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>, with difficulty bridling his indignation.</p>
	      <p><said>As to that,</said> replied <persName>Calvert</persName>, <said>if you can obtain
		  <lb/>her hand, trust me, you will be enough favoured
		  <lb/>with such music; these sweet-tempered damsels,
		  <lb/>are mighty apt to become shrews, when galled with
		  <lb/>the yoke of matrimony.</said></p>
	      <p><said>If such are your ideas,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>I
		  <lb/>wonder you should court an evil, which it is so easy
		  <lb/>to avoid.</said></p>

		<lb/><persName>Calvert</persName>: <said>and it is meet to choose from among
		  <lb/>the fairest and most promising, to render to con­
		  <lb/>ditions as easy as possible; and you will allow,
		  <lb/>Major, that a little timely competition, is a wonder­
		  <lb/>ful stimulant in seeking such an one. I shall really
		  <lb/>think myself irresistible, if my simple eloquence
		  <lb/>prevails against you, aided as you are, by that
		  <lb/>bewitching musical pipe, whose silver tones, reach­
		  <lb/>ed my ears just now, as you tuned it to your mis­
		  <lb/>tress' praise.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You can have been in waiting at the gate no
		  <lb/>short time,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>to have heard what
		  <lb/>passed within so long before I met with you.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I was listening in silent admiration,</said> said <persName>Cal­
		  <lb/>vert</persName>, <said>even as the trees and stones of old, did to
		  <lb/>the lyre of <persName>Orpheus</persName>; but that heathenish compari­
		  <lb/>son would be thought downright heresy here.—I
		  <lb/>should say like unto <persName>Saul</persName>, who was charmed by
		  <lb/>the harp of <persName>David</persName>, when he played with his hand
		  <lb/>skilfully before him.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And the evil spirit was not laid in either case
		  <lb/>it would seem;</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>but I should think
		  <lb/>you would have been more comfortably situated by
		  <lb/>a cheerful fire, on such a chilly night as this.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I was unwilling to interrupt a delightful
		  <lb/>scene,</said> returned <persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>a forbearance which
		  <lb/>you would doubtless exercise, in similar circum­
		  <lb/>stances.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I have certainly given you strong proofs of
		  <lb/>my forbearance this evening,</said> replied <persName>Atherton</persName>.</p>

		  <lb/>will no longer oblige you to exercise it, but take
		  <lb/>your vacant seat by the side of <persName>Miriam</persName>, and try
		  <lb/>to dispel the fascination which your music may
		  <lb/>have thrown around her. Indeed, Major, that is
		  <lb/>love's own language, and gives you a decided ad­
		  <lb/>vantage over me, I tell you frankly, I shall exert
		  <lb/>myself to counteract its influence.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You will keep within the limits of truth, and
		  <lb/>honour, I trust,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>Of course,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>I think I shall
		  <lb/>have no occasion to resort to stratagem, though
		  <lb/>you know, it is always considered allowable in
		  <lb/>love and war. So good night to you; and may
		  <lb/>pleasant dreams—but not of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>—hover
		  <lb/>round your bed.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName> parted from him, with a hearty good­
		<lb/>will, and a firm resolution, to avoid as much as
		<lb/>possible so troublesome a companion for the future;
		<lb/>and be also resolved during his long walk, to ab­
		<lb/>stain for a time at least, from the dangerous society
		<lb/>of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>.</p>
	      <p>But the following morning was so mild and bril­
		<lb/>liant, that <persName>Major Atherton</persName> was strongly tempted
		<lb/>to resume his pedestrian habits; and, though still
		<lb/>determined to shun the presence of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>,
		<lb/>he was soon after breakfast, far advanced on the
		<lb/>road to <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>. He had gained the midst of
		<lb/>the woods, through which his path lay, when he
		<lb/>heard the sound of several voices, and particularly
		<lb/>distinguished that of <persName>Peregrine White</persName>, which rose
		<lb/>above the others; and in an instant the young man
		<lb/>perceived and called to him.</p>

	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">231</mw>
	      <p><said>You are the very person I was seeking,</said> he ex­
		<lb/>claimed, springing over the under-brush to meet
		<lb/>him; <said>and now you make good the old proverb,<choice><sic>’</sic><corr/></choice>
		  <lb/><quote>the devil is always nearest, when you are speak­
		    <lb/>ing of him.</quote></said></p>
	      <p><said>I thank you for the flattering comparison,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>but why is my presence so much de­
		  <lb/>sired, just now? You seem to have a goodly band
		  <lb/>of attendants, already, and collected for some war­
		  <lb/>like purpose, I should judge from their appear­
		  <lb/>ance.</said></p>
	      <p>As he was speaking half a dozen young men
		<lb/>joined them, all armed with muskets, among whom
		<lb/>were <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName> and <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>We will choose you for our leader, <persName>Major Ath­
		    <lb/>erton</persName>,</said> said <persName>Peregrine White</persName>, <said>so put yourself at
		  <lb/>our head, and give the word of command.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Perhaps we shall not obey it,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>;
		<lb/><said>and I, for my part, nominate <persName>Mr. Ashly</persName> for Cap­
		  <lb/>tain General.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I am a man of peace,</said> replied <persName>Ashly</persName>, <said>and
		  <lb/>unused to wield the weapons of carnal warfare;
		  <lb/>being called only to maintain a strife with the foes
		  <lb/>that are within me.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You must be a valiant warrior if you can keep
		  <lb/>them all in subjection,</said> said <persName>Peregrine White</persName>; <said>I
		  <lb/>would rather undertake to conquer a whole tribe of
		  <lb/><name>Indians</name>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>But what enemy are we to attack, now?</said> asked
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>is it visible or invisible, man or beast?</said></p>
	      <p><said>Nothing more or less, than a half-starved wolf,</said><pb n="232"/><milestone unit="sig" n="20(2)v"/><mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">232</mw><lb/>returned <persName>Peregrine</persName>, <said>which has taken up his abode
		  <lb/>in these woods, and having, probably, heard of
		  <lb/><persName>Master Ashly's</persName> hospitable disposition, and finding
		  <lb/>his house convenient, has paid several visits among
		  <lb/>his sheep, and last night made bold to feast on the
		  <lb/>fatted calf.</said></p>
	      <p><said>A troublesome enemy, truly!</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>;
		<lb/><said>and I would gladly help you to get rid of him, but
		  <lb/>there are already so many of you, that my presence
		  <lb/>would be quite useless, particularly, as I have no
		  <lb/>fire-arms with me.</said></p>
	      <p><said>No matter,</said> returned <persName>Peregrine</persName>, <said>you must go
		  <lb/>with us, if it is only to see our sport; though I
		  <lb/>dare say <persName>Master Ashly</persName> will lend you his gun;
		  <lb/>for he scarcely knows which end to fire out of, and,
		  <lb/>in case of danger, he can run up into a tree and
		  <lb/>look on.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You speak without knowledge, <persName>Master Pere­
		    <lb/>grine</persName>,</said> said <persName>Ashly</persName>; <said>for, though I was not bred a
		  <lb/>soldier, I have been well instructed how to carry a
		  <lb/>musket.</said></p>
	      <p><said>How to carry it is one thing, and how to use it
		  <lb/>another,</said> returned <persName>Peregrine</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>But I will use it,</said> replied <persName>Ashly</persName>, doggedly,
		<lb/><said>against the destroyer of my flocks and herds, even
		  <lb/>as <persName>David</persName>, who rose up and slew the bear, that stole
		  <lb/>the lambs from his father's sheep-fold.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Oh that was nothing,</said> said Peregrine, <said>com­
		  <lb/>pared with this wolf, which is the fiercest beast of
		  <lb/>the forest; have a care, <persName>Master Ashly</persName>, that you do
		  <lb/>not turn your back upon him, or you may chance to
		  <lb/>have an unpleasant gripe from his tusks.</said></p>

	      <p><said>I trust we shall be preserved from his rage,</said><lb/>said <persName>Ashly</persName>, <said>like as the prophet <persName>Daniel</persName> was saved
		  <lb/>from the jaws of the lions, in their den.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I begin to be of <persName>Major Atherton's</persName> opinion,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Calvert</persName>, <said>that there are too many of us; seven
		  <lb/>armed men against one or two poor beasts, is quite
		  <lb/>unmerciful, besides the danger of frightening them
		  <lb/>into their strong holds; and so, Major, if you are
		  <lb/>inclined to turn back, I will accompany you; and,
		  <lb/>I fancy, I can guess whither you are bound.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I have decided to remain here,</said> returned <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName>; <said>but, if you intend to return, and will trust
		  <lb/>your gun with me, I will engage to make a good
		  <lb/>use of it.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Excuse me,</said> replied <persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>it was merely in
		  <lb/>the wish of enjoying your society, that I made the
		  <lb/>proposal; but I am too accommodating to be repuls­
		  <lb/>ed by trifles; and since you conclude to proceed,
		  <lb/>whither you go, there will I go likewise.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Your extreme complaisance quite perplexes me,</said><lb/>said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>and I feel totally unable to return
		  <lb/>it as it deserves.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Pray do not trouble yourself;</said> replied <persName>Calvert</persName>;
		<lb/><said rend="pre()">I would not have you for a competitor, in every
		  <lb/>thing; and it quite encourages me, to hear so for­
		  <lb/>midable a rival acknowledge his deficiency, even

	      <p><said>I confess my deficiency in many things, in
		  <lb/>which you seem to excel,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>though
		  <lb/>I certainly do not, at present, feel any desire to
		  <lb/>attain them.</said></p>

	      <p><said>That last clause in your sentence,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>,
		<lb/><said>has quite cancelled my gratitude, for the compli­
		  <lb/>ment contained in the first; I presume you do not
		  <lb/>always deem it expedient to administer an antidote
		  <lb/>against the poison of your flattery?</said></p>
	      <p><said>I never make use of the latter,</said> replied <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName>, <said>and of course, have no occasion for the for­
		  <lb/>mer.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You must possess a rare talent of pleasing the
		  <lb/>fairer sex, if you can dispense with so powerful an
		  <lb/>auxiliary,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>I have never found it essential;</said> replied <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName>; <said>and I believe there are few females, worthy
		  <lb/>of our regard, who do not prefer the language of the
		  <lb/>heart.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You may call it the language of the heart,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>but it must pass through the lips, em­
		  <lb/>bellished by a few tropes and figures, drawn from
		  <lb/>the fountain of their charms, and kindled by the
		  <lb/>brilliance of their eyes; or, hang me, if you ever
		  <lb/>reach their hearts, or receive one smile for your
		  <lb/>trouble.</said></p>
	      <p><said>If that is your <emph>real</emph> opinion,</said> returned <persName>Ather­

	      <p><said>Which is no small proportion of the sex;</said> said

		  <lb/>not gifted with the power of creating sweet
		  <lb/>sounds, at will, and must therefore use my voice to
		  <lb/>the utmost advantage, in whatever it is capable of

	      <p><said>I am sure, <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName>,</said> said <persName>Peregrine
		  <lb/>White</persName>, <said>I have heard you sing psalm tunes, like a
		  <lb/>deacon, many a time, since you have been here, at
		  <lb/>meeting and elsewhere; though, to be sure, you
		  <lb/>have not the unrivalled <emph>bass</emph> voice of our friend
		  <lb/><persName>Ashly</persName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>My voice would be admirable,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>,
		<lb/><said>if I had taken as much pains to trill and modify
		  <lb/>it, as some others have; but, as it is, I can fortu­
		  <lb/>nately get through your harmonious tunes very
		  <lb/>well, and your good—hem—<persName>Mr. Ashly</persName> what say
		  <lb/>you?</said></p>
	      <p><said>I think it our duty to sing psalms in the con­
		  <lb/>gregation,</said> said <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName>, <said>albeit our voices
		  <lb/>are not attuned to harmony; we can, as the psalm­
		  <lb/>ist saith, <quote>make melody in our hearts unto the
		    <lb/>Lord.</quote></said></p>
	      <p><said>I have ever been accustomed, <persName>Master Ashly</persName>,</said><lb/>said <persName>Calvert</persName> gravely, <said>to chaunt the anthems of
		  <lb/>our excellent liturgy, as the service of our holy
		  <lb/>church requires.</said></p>
	      <p><said>That is but an abomination offered unto idols,</said><lb/>said <persName>Ashly</persName>, regarding <persName>Calvert</persName>, almost with hor­
		<lb/>ror; <said>and though, peradventure, I may offend, it
		  <lb/>must be that I lift up my voice against it.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Another time, if it please you, <persName>Mr. Ashly</persName>,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Calvert</persName>, <said>or the enemy may take advantage of our
		  <lb/>controversy to steal some one of us, as he did your
		  <lb/>sheep. But, hark! the hounds are barking, and
		  <lb/>I'll warrant have got scent of him.</said></p>
	      <p>This sound was a signal for a general onset;
		<pb n="236"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="20(4)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">236</mw>
		<lb/>and in a moment, the whole party were on the alert
		<lb/>to discover the track of the animal. <persName>Benjamin
		  <lb/>Ashly</persName> was the least forward in the chase; quite un­
		<lb/>accustomed to such scenes, he seemed instinctively
		<lb/>to shrink from the encounter, till <persName>Peregrine White</persName>,
		<lb/>who observed him loitering behind, called out,—</p>
	      <p>
		<said>Move your legs faster, <persName>Mr. Ashly</persName>; if ever they
		  <lb/>were of use to you, they may be so now.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>The Lord taketh no pleasure in the legs of a
		  <lb/>man,</said> replied <persName>Ashly</persName>; <said>but he directeth us whither­
		  <lb/>soever he will.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Such snail's legs as yours, I should think were
		  <lb/>neither for use or pleasure,</said> returned <persName>Peregrine</persName>;
		<lb/><said>but have a care, <persName>Master Ashly</persName>, that your musket's
		  <lb/>balls don't fly out amongst us; and remember, if
		  <lb/>you stray into the wolf's mouth, your texts of scrip­
		  <lb/>ture wont bring you out with a whole skin.</said></p>
	      <p>So saying, he ran swiftly after his companions,
		<lb/>followed more leisurely by <persName>Mr. Ashly</persName>, who had no
		<lb/>mind to be left far in the rear. The wolf was by
		<lb/>this time started from his covert, and pursued at
		<lb/>full speed by dogs and sportsmen, though the nu­
		<lb/>merous impediments of trees and underwood, pre­
		<lb/>vented the latter from gaining upon the animal,
		<lb/>which contrived to escape their fire and elude the
		<lb/>fangs of his canine enemies, by crouching in the
		<lb/>lurking places of the forest, till again discovered,
		<lb/>and compelled to have recourse to flight for safety.</p>
	      <p>In the heat of the pursuit, <persName>Major Atherton</persName> and
		<lb/><persName>Peregrine White</persName>, who chanced to be near together,
		<lb/>were suddenly startled by a voice, as of some one
		<pb n="237"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="20(5)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">237</mw>
		<lb/>in distress; and after listening a moment, they
		<lb/>heard their own names distinctly repeated.</p>
	      <p><said>It is <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName>,</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName>, <said>con­
		  <lb/>found his slow motions; I have a mind not to wait
		  <lb/>for him.</said></p>
	      <p><said>He must be in some difficulty,</said> returned <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName>; <said>we had better go to his relief.</said></p>
	      <p><said>He deserves it, for keeping back like a coward­
		  <lb/>ly loon,</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName>; <said>but come on this way,
		  <lb/>only hear him, he is roaring like a wild bull of <placeName>Ba­
		    <lb/>shan</placeName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Here he is,</said> cried <persName>Peregrine White</persName>, after he had
		<lb/>retraced his steps for a short distance; and a loud
		<lb/>burst of laughter succeeded the exclamation. <persName>Ath­
		  <lb/>erton</persName> quickened his pace to overtake <persName>Peregrine</persName>,
		<lb/>who had outstripped him, and learn the cause of
		<lb/>his merriment; nor could he refrain from joining
		<lb/>in it, though less loudly, when he beheld the tall,
		<lb/>stiff figure of <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName> entangled in an <rs type="properAdjective">In­
		  <lb/>dian</rs> deer-trap, which springing as his feet became
		<lb/>fastened in the noose, had lifted his heels high in
		<lb/>the air, leaving his head scarcely resting on the
		<lb/>earth. He was struggling lustily, and at the same
		<lb/>time with dismay painted on his countenance, cal­
		<lb/>ling loudly for assistance, to liberate him from his
		<lb/>unpleasant but ludicrous predicament.</p>
	      <p><said>How is all this, <persName>Master Ashly</persName>,</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName>,

	      <p><said>The wicked have spread their gins for me, and
		  <lb/>I have fallen into the net of the ungodly,</said> replied
		<lb/><persName>Ashly</persName>, with a truly woful tone and expression.</p>

	      <p><said>I think it was put here to entrap a more savory
		  <lb/>animal,</said> returned <persName>Peregrine</persName>; <said>and in my mind they
		  <lb/>would not be well pleased to find you kicking about
		  <lb/>in the room of a good fat buck. But how did you
		  <lb/>contrive to get caught so neatly?</said></p>
	      <p><said>I took not heed to my ways,</said> said <persName>Ashly</persName>, <said>nei­
		  <lb/>ther pondered the path of my feet, and the adver­
		  <lb/>sary hath taken me at will.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Good!</said> exclaimed <persName>Peregrine White</persName>, rubbing his
		<lb/>hands, and retreating a few steps to examine him
		<lb/>at all points, <said>I would <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName> and the others
		  <lb/>were here to help us admire you. But is not your
		  <lb/>head dizzy, <persName>Master Ashly</persName>? If the wolf had chan­
		  <lb/>ced to come this way, he might have had a glorious
		  <lb/>pull at it.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName> seemed to shrink at the idea;
		<lb/>but reddening with vexation, he said,—</p>
	      <p>
		<said>Will you not help me out, <persName>Master Peregrine</persName>,—
		  <lb/><persName>Major Atherton</persName>? It is written, <quote>he that is glad at
		    <lb/>calamities, shall not go unpunished.</quote></said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>All in good time,</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName>, detaining
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>, who was about to release him; <said>but we
		  <lb/>want to examine this cunning device a little lon­
		  <lb/>ger; your legs do not ache, I hope?</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>Truly, <persName>Master Peregrine</persName>, my <quote>legs are not of
		    <lb/>brass, nor my sinews of iron,</quote> that they should en­
		  <lb/>dure forever; and verily they do weary of this
		  <lb/>bondage.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>At this instant, a loud shout was heard from a
		<lb/>distance, mingled with the report of fire arms.</p>

	      <p><said>There, they have killed the wolf,</said> exclaimed <persName>Pe­
		  <lb/>regrine</persName>, impatiently, <said>while we have been watch­
		  <lb/>ing this game that can be got at every day and we
		  <lb/>choose.</said></p>
	      <p>A brief silence however which ensued, was again
		<lb/>broken by the howling of the savage beast, and <persName>Pe­
		  <lb/>regrine White</persName> bounded forward, exclaiming as he
		<lb/>went,—</p>
	      <p>
		<said>We may be there in season, yet; and so good
		  <lb/>bye to you, <persName>Mr. Ashly</persName>.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Truly, the voice of the beast is like the rushing
		  <lb/>of mighty winds,</said> said <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName>, casting his
		<lb/>eyes fearfully around, and then almost in despair
		<lb/>at his imprisoned feet, <said>I will go with you, if—</said></p>
	      <p><said>If you can be free,</said> interrupted <persName>Atherton</persName>, at
		<lb/>the same time releasing him from bondage; <said>and
		  <lb/>perhaps we shall need your assistance in the con­
		  <lb/>test, <persName>Mr. Ashly</persName>.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Mr. Ashly</persName>, happy to be released, <mcr>righted</mcr> himself
		<lb/>with all convenient speed, and having rubbed his
		<lb/>feet and ancles with great care, moved briskly
		<lb/>from the spot, often applying his hand to his head
		<lb/>as he went along, probably to allay the uneasy sen­
		<lb/>sation occasioned by the inverted position which
		<lb/>had distended every vein, so that they appeared
		<lb/>starting through his scanty crop of hair.</p>
	      <p>The trap which had so unluckily mistaken its
		<lb/>prey, was in itself a curious specimen of savage in­
		<lb/>genuity. It was formed by a young sapling bent
		<lb/>to the ground like a bow, with acorns strewed un­
		<lb/>der it, to decoy the deer; and so contrived with a
		<pb n="240"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="20(6)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">240</mw>
		<lb/>noose attached to it, that when the nimble footed
		<lb/>animal came near enough to taste the food, his
		<lb/>movements disengaged the fastenings, and the pli­
		<lb/>ant tree suddenly springing up, held him entangled
		<lb/>beyond the power of escape.</p>
	      <p>When <persName>Atherton</persName> had sufficiently admired this sam­
		<lb/>ple of <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> sagacity, he hastened after his com­
		<lb/>panions; and directed by their voices, found them
		<lb/>arranged in a semi-circle, awaiting the motions of
		<lb/>the wolf which they held at bay, though he had
		<lb/>found refuge from their immediate attack, within
		<lb/>the shelter of a narrow cave.</p>
	      <p><said>Where are your spoils, <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName>?</said> asked
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>from the noise of your firing just now,
		  <lb/>I was fearful of coming too late to share the vic­
		  <lb/>tory.</said></p>
	      <p><said>No; he is safe yet,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>, <said>and stands
		  <lb/>bullets, as if dressed out in a coat of mail. But I
		  <lb/>understood,</said> he added, lowering his voice, <said>that
		  <lb/>you have been viewing a different sort of game; it
		  <lb/>must have been rare sport to see <persName>master Ashly</persName>
		  <lb/>rolling his clipped head on the ground.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Better sport to us than to him, I suspect,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>but where is the wolf? not slipped
		  <lb/>from you, I hope.</said></p>
	      <p><said>No, but almost as bad,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>we had
		  <lb/>got him fairly in the chase, and fired off our mus­
		  <lb/>kets, with deadly aim, as we thought, when, all at
		  <lb/>once, this confounded cave, came in his way, and
		  <lb/>he retreated quietly into it.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Not very quietly, I think,</said> said <persName>Peregrine White</persName>;
		<pb n="241"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="21(1)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">241</mw>
		<lb/><said>for we heard his roaring afar off: but, at any
		  <lb/>rate, it was more convenient than a deer trap
		  <lb/>would have been; do'nt you think so, <persName>Mr. Ashly</persName>?</said></p>
	      <p>But <persName>Mr. Ashly</persName> was conveniently deaf at the mo­
		<lb/>ment; an infirmity which often seized him, on like
		<lb/>occasions, and which generally served to increase
		<lb/>the mirth of <persName>Peregrine White</persName>. Every one was
		<lb/>now engrossed by the common enemy, which had
		<lb/>kept close in his retreat, till impatient of the de­
		<lb/>lay, some proposed firing into the narrow aper­
		<lb/>ture, and others suggested expedients to draw him
		<lb/>from it.</p>
	      <p><said>Wait a little longer,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>, who was
		<lb/>the most experienced sportsman in the group, <said>and
		  <lb/>I can answer for it, he will put his nose out to look
		  <lb/>at us, when we will give him a pinch of gunpowder
		  <lb/>to smell of.</said></p>
	      <p>And in fact, he had scarcely done speaking,
		<lb/>when the animal, which was confined within nar­
		<lb/>row limits, and probably alarmed by the noise
		<lb/>around him, came to the entrance of the cavern,
		<lb/>and with a hideous growl, and eyes flashing like
		<lb/>balls of fire, stood surveying them with fierce and
		<lb/>determined courage. On a given signal, every gun
		<lb/>was at once discharged; but at the first flash, he
		<lb/>darted back into the cave, though not without re­
		<lb/>ceiving a severe wound; and mad with pain, he
		<lb/>returned to the combat, and crouching low, prepar­
		<lb/>ed to spring upon his antagonists. At that instant,
		<lb/>before the party had time to reload, another piece
		<mw type="vol" rend="align(left)case(allcaps)indent(+1)">Vol. I.</mw>
		<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">21</mw>
		<pb n="242"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="21(1)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">242</mw>
		<lb/>was presented, and with surer aim; the ball pierced
		<lb/>his breast, and prevented the meditated attack.</p>
	      <p>The wounded animal rolled in agony on the
		<lb/>ground, which was already dyed with his blood;
		<lb/>and then as if exerting the last energies of dispair,
		<lb/>raised himself in a menacing attitude, and grinding
		<lb/>his tusks with mingled rage and pain, he seemed
		<lb/>making a final effort to revenge himself on his as­
		<lb/>sailants. But a second and more effectual volley
		<lb/>decided the conflict, and put a speedy end to the
		<lb/>sufferings of the victim.</p>
	      <p><said>We have done it now,</said> said <persName>Captain Standish</persName>,
		<lb/>coming forward into the circle; <said>but the old vete­
		  <lb/>ran of the woods fought it bravely to the last.</said></p>
	      <p><said>So it was you, Captain, who did us that good
		  <lb/>service just now,</said> said <persName>Peregrine White</persName>; <said>I thought
		  <lb/>it must be an experienced hand to take such deadly
		  <lb/>aim.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Yes, I have had long experience among the
		  <lb/>beasts of the forest, of every description;</said> return­
		<lb/>ed the Captain; <said>these ugly wolves used to prowl
		  <lb/>round us, without ceremony, and grin at our very
		  <lb/>feet, when we first came over; but we soon taught
		  <lb/>them better manners; and it is long since one has
		  <lb/>been so bold as this grim monster. <persName>Master Ashly's</persName>
		  <lb/>barn-yard must have been very tempting I think.</said></p>
	      <p><said>We have at least had good exercise on this cool
		  <lb/>morning,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>but, may I ask, Cap­
		  <lb/>tain, how you came here so opportunely?</said></p>
	      <p><said><persName>Hobamock</persName> told me what sport you were engag­
		  <lb/>ed in,</said> said the Captain, <said>and I had a mind to join
		  <pb n="243"/>

		  <lb/>you. But where is <persName>Master Ashly</persName>, <persName>Peregrine</persName>? I
		  <lb/>do not see him here.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I do'nt know what has become of him,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Peregrine</persName>; <said>I saw him just now, behind that big
		  <lb/>tree, pointing his gun to the clouds, I think.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You speak that you do not know, <persName>Master Pere­
		    <lb/>grine</persName>,</said> said <persName>Ashly</persName>, emerging from the shelter of
		<lb/>some trees, <said>I levelled my gun fairly at the beast,
		  <lb/>and did but step behind that tree to save myself
		  <lb/>from the jaws of destruction, when the terrible
		  <lb/>creature glared upon me, and seemed to single me
		  <lb/>out for his prey.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Perhaps,</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName>, gravely, <said>he mistook
		  <lb/>you for another calf.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Touching thy foolish talking, <persName>Master Pere­
		    <lb/>grine</persName>,</said> returned <persName>Ashly</persName>, <said>it harms me not; neither
		  <lb/>thy jesting, which is not convenient.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Not convenient to you, perhaps,</said> replied <persName>Pere­
		  <lb/>grine</persName>; <said>but as we walk along, I will shew <persName><choice><sic>Cap­<lb/>taid</sic><corr>Cap­<lb/>tain</corr></choice>
		   Standish</persName> that cunning trap, which caught you
		  <lb/>like a <quote>ram in the thicket,</quote> just now.</said></p>
	      <p><said>What!</said> said the Captain, laughing, <said><persName>Mr.
		    <lb/>Ashly</persName> caught in a deer trap! I would I had been
		  <lb/>here sooner; methinks it must have been worth the
		  <lb/>looking at.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is a pit into which we may all be left to slide,</said><lb/>said <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName>; <said>and let him that <quote>thinketh
		    <lb/>he standeth, take heed lest he fall.</quote></said></p>
	      <p><said>And pray, <persName>Master Benjamin</persName>,</said> asked the Cap­
		<lb/>tain, <said>were you stooping to pick up acorns or
		  <lb/>how came you into the snare?</said></p>
	      <pb n="244"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="21(2)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">244</mw>
	      <p><said>No,</said> replied <persName>Peregrine</persName>, <said>it took him at the
		  <lb/>lower extremity, and lifted his legs up between
		  <lb/>heaven and earth, leaving his head resting on a soft
		  <lb/>pillow of chesnut burs. But look, Captain! here
		  <lb/>is the unlucky place; and the trap quite spoiled for
		  <lb/>further use.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I have often seen them,</said> said the Captain.
		<lb/><said>These savages are ingenious enough; but so im­
		  <lb/>provident, that they are content to live on what
		  <lb/>they can find one day, and run the risk of starv­
		  <lb/>ing the next. <persName>Mr. Bradford</persName> got entangled in a
		  <lb/>trap like this, in one of our roving excursions, to
		  <lb/>search the country, and was laughed at almost as
		  <lb/>much as you have been, <persName>Master Ashly</persName>; so you
		  <lb/>need not mind what this wild boy, <persName>Peregrine</persName>, says
		  <lb/>to you.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I regard it not,</said> returned <persName>Ashly</persName>; <said>it is as idle
		  <lb/>as the <quote>crackling of thorns under a pot,</quote> and for­
		  <lb/>gotten as soon as it entereth into my ears.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Perhaps it is lost while going in there,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Peregrine</persName>; <said>they are stately portals to pass
		  <lb/>through,</said>—and he glanced his mirthful eyes at
		<lb/><persName>Benjamin's</persName> prominent ears.</p>
	      <p><said>Come, come,</said> said the Captain, <said>we must
		  <lb/>quicken our pace, my lads, if we would reach home
		  <lb/>in season for dinner; I wish that were a fat deer
		  <lb/>instead of a carrion wolf we killed yonder; we
		  <lb/>might have a dainty feast from it.</said></p>
	      <p><said rend="post()">If you keep on at this quick march, Captain,</said><lb/>said <persName>Peregrine White</persName>, <said>I, for one, shall hardly live
		  <lb/>to eat my dinner; I have been ranging about since

		  <lb/>sunrise, and begin to wax faint and weary; good
		  <lb/><persName>Master Ashly</persName>, we are commanded to <quote>bear one
		    <lb/>another's burthens,</quote> and I would you were inclin­
		  <lb/>ed to obey, and relieve me of my musket for a
		  <lb/>season.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Let every man provide for himself, <persName>Master Pe­
		    <lb/>regrine</persName>,</said> replied <persName>Ashly</persName>, with unusual asperity; and
		<lb/>I exhort you to mind your own affairs, and leave
		<lb/>me in peace.</p>
	      <p><said>You speak most wisely,</said> returned <persName>Peregrine</persName>;
		<lb/><said>but nevertheless, I must admonish you to take heed
		  <lb/>to your ways, and fall not into another deer-trap.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Mr. Ashly</persName> deigned no further reply, and the
		<lb/>party soon after left the woods, and dispersed to
		<lb/>their different abodes. <persName>Captain Standish</persName> proposed
		<lb/>calling a few moments at <persName>Mr. Grey's</persName>, and both
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName> and <persName>Calvert</persName> readily consented to accom­
		<lb/>pany him. But <persName>Major Atherton</persName> fancied himself
		<lb/>received less cordially than usual by <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>,
		<lb/>while <persName>Miriam</persName>, from whatever cause, evidently
		<lb/>shunned his attentions, and with her usual gaiety,
		<lb/>conversed almost entirely with the Captain and
		<lb/><persName>Mr. Calvert</persName>. Rejoiced that the interview proved
		<lb/>short, <persName>Atherton</persName> left the house depressed in spirits,
		<lb/>and strongly inclined to accuse the father of injus­
		<lb/>tice, and the daughter of caprice; and for the first
		<lb/>time, was heartily sorry that he had ever touched
		<lb/>the shores of <placeName>New-England</placeName>.</p>

		<lb/>frained from visiting <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>; a sacrifice of incli­
		<lb/>nation which cost him no inconsiderable effort, though
		<lb/>he endeavoured to conceal his uneasiness from the
		<lb/>keen eyes of <persName>Captain Standish</persName>, and busied himself,
		<lb/>almost constantly, in writing letters to his friends
		<lb/>in <placeName>England</placeName>. <persName>Captain Martin</persName>, who was to be the
		<lb/>bearer of them, and had just returned from a trad­
		<lb/>ing voyage to the <placeName>Massachusetts Bay</placeName>, expected
		<lb/>shortly to sail from <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, and <persName>Mr. Grey</persName> had
		<lb/>taken passage in his vessel, being constrained to visit
		<lb/><placeName>England</placeName>, on some business which required his per­
		<lb/>sonal attention. It was, however, with feelings of
		<lb/>regret rather than pleasure, that he anticipated a
		<lb/>return to his native land after an absence of so
		<lb/>many years, during which he had become weaned
		<lb/>from all the friendships of his youth, and bound by
		<lb/>every tie of affection to his adopted country.</p>
	      <p><persName>Mr. Grey</persName> had in early life formed an attachment
		<lb/>for a young woman of respectable family, and
		<lb/>whose personal attractions, though great, were
		<lb/>surpassed by the purity and excellence of her mind
		<pb n="247"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="21(4)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">247</mw>
		<lb/>and character. But her friends, who had at first
		<lb/>sanctioned his addresses, withdrew their approba­
		<lb/>tion, when in subsequent years, he became a con­
		<lb/>vert to the opinions of the <name>Brownists</name>, and exerted
		<lb/>his utmost influence to induce her to embrace the
		<lb/>same tenets. Yet, though these tenets were at that
		<lb/>time too obnoxious to harmonize with her feelings,
		<lb/>his change of faith did not remove the deep-rooted
		<lb/>affection she cherished for him; and persisting in
		<lb/>her resolution to become the wife of no other man,
		<lb/>her father at length yielded a reluctant consent to
		<lb/>their union. But his prejudice against the religion
		<lb/>of <persName>Mr. Grey</persName> was insuperable, and from that time
		<lb/>his tenderness for her seemed to diminish; and as
		<lb/>the arguments of the husband proved more persua­
		<lb/>sive than those of the lover, and the spirit of perse­
		<lb/>cution had already commenced its reign, <persName>Mrs. Grey</persName>
		<lb/>was induced to join the <name>Puritans</name>, who fled for
		<lb/>safety to <placeName>Holland</placeName>, and united with a church at
		<lb/><placeName>Leyden</placeName>. <persName>Mrs. Grey</persName>, however, after their removal
		<lb/>to <placeName>America</placeName>, had the satisfaction of receiving many
		<lb/>affectionate letters from her father, whose displea­
		<lb/>sure at her marriage was gradually softened by
		<lb/>time, and the intercession of his eldest daughter, who
		<lb/>discreetly pleaded the cause of her absent sister, to
		<lb/>whom she was devotedly attached. On the death
		<lb/>of <persName>Mrs. Grey</persName>, this attachment was transferred to
		<lb/><persName>Miriam</persName>, whom she loved for her mother's sake,
		<lb/>and wished to adopt as her own child; but the
		<lb/>objections of <persName>Mr. Grey</persName> were invincible, and too
		<lb/>reasonable to be disputed. Still, <persName>Miriam</persName> was con­
		<pb n="248"/>

		<lb/>stantly receiving from her aunt, tokens of kindness
		<lb/>and remembrance; and though her father some­
		<lb/>times thought them too costly or too gay, yet if
		<lb/>any feeling of worldly pride ever entered his breast,
		<lb/>it was when he saw the native charms of his daugh­
		<lb/>ter enhanced by a becoming dress, suited to her
		<lb/>age and station; and her own sense of propriety,
		<lb/>as well as his peculiar notions of duty, rejected
		<lb/>whatever was superfluous. On the death of his
		<lb/>father-in-law, <persName>Mr. Grey</persName> became trustee of the pro­
		<lb/>perty which <persName>Miriam</persName> received from him, in her
		<lb/>mother's right; and it was somewhat relative to
		<lb/>the settlement of it, which obliged him to encounter
		<lb/>the fatigues of a voyage to <placeName>England</placeName>.</p>
	      <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName>, in the meantime, became weary
		<lb/>of his voluntary exile from <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>; and on
		<lb/>the fourth day, after revolving the subject in

		<lb/>indispensable to pay his parting respects to <persName>Mr.
		  <lb/>Grey</persName>, when his meditations were suddenly put to
		<lb/>flight by the entrance of <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName>, who saluted
		<lb/>him with his usual freedom, and even more than

		  <lb/>most agreeable companion, and <persName>Alexander</persName> is at all
		  <lb/>times ready to hunt and fish with me.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Are there any bright eyes to hunt after, here?</said><lb/>asked <persName>Calvert</persName>. <said>If there are, I pray you let me
		  <lb/>join in the chase; for it is tiresome to gaze forever
		  <lb/>on one face, be it ever so beautiful.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I have seen none peeping from wood or brake;
		  <lb/>nor yet sporting on the glassy waves;</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>Dryads and Naiads, I suspect, are all
		  <lb/>frighted from this rugged clime, by these cold
		  <lb/>autumnal blasts.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You have grown enamoured of solitude then?
		  <lb/>That is a bad sign,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>but if you
		  <lb/>would turn recluse, Major, I pray thee go for the
		  <lb/>whole; my bead-telling kinsman of <placeName>Maryland</placeName> will
		  <lb/>give thee good thanks to establish a monastery of
		  <lb/>holy friars in his fair province.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Ah! <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName>,</said> said the Captain, who had
		<lb/>just entered, <said>nobody but you would dare to speak
		  <lb/>openly of such papistical things in this region
		  <lb/>of the world; but tell me whence you come, and
		  <lb/>whither are you going? Sit down first, though, if
		  <lb/>it please you.</said></p>
	      <p><said rend="pre()">It would please me to sit a long time,</said> replied
		<lb/><persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>but I can stay only one moment. I shot
		  <lb/>across the Bay in a high wind and a light skiff,
		  <lb/>and came to tell you <persName>Mr. Grey</persName> hopes to see you
		  <lb/>all to-morrow. The banns are published, the
		  <lb/>priest is ready, and demure <persName>Mistress Lois</persName> is wait­
		  <lb/>ing to become a bride. I promised to deliver the
		  <lb/>tidings to you, so witness all, that I have done it—
		  <lb/>and now, good bye to you.</said></p>

	      <p><said>Soft and easy, good sir,</said> said the Captain.
		<lb/><said>You have but half done your duty, if you wait not
		  <lb/>for an answer to your message; mine is plain yes,
		  <lb/>and a merry wedding to them; and, though cousin
		  <lb/><persName>Atherton</persName> seems to be deliberating, I think I may
		  <lb/>vouch for his attendance also. Am I right, <persName>Ed­
		    <lb/>ward</persName>?</said></p>
	      <p><said>Certainly, sir,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>I have no ex­
		  <lb/>cuse to offer if I were disposed to decline.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Perhaps we can frame one for you if you are
		  <lb/>very reluctant to go,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>So far from it,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>I would not
		  <lb/>on any account forego the expected pleasure.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I should think it strange if you would,</said> replied
		<lb/><persName>Calvert</persName>, <said>when there are so many attractions to
		  <lb/>allure you there.</said></p>
	      <p><said>We all know your opinion on that subject, <persName>Mr.
		    <lb/>Calvert</persName>,</said> said the Captain; <said>but methinks a tongue
		  <lb/>so eloquent as thine should have won your cause
		  <lb/>ere this.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>I am proof against flattery in all its forms,
		  <lb/>Captain; so do not try to excite my vanity.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Never fear,</said> said the Captain; <said>there have
		  <lb/>been enough before me to do that, and with good
		  <lb/>success I should judge; so I will deal to you a
		  <lb/>simple truth; the boldest wooer is not always suc­
		  <lb/>cessful.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Thank you, sir;</said> returned <persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>but lest
		  <lb/>you should depress my courage too much, I will be
		  <lb/>off for <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> again.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Bear my best wishes to my little rose-bud,</said><pb n="251"/><milestone unit="sig" n="21(6)r"/><mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">251</mw><lb/>said the Captain; <said>and bid her take counsel from
		  <lb/>her cousin <persName>Lois</persName> on this occasion.</said></p>
	      <p><said>With all my heart,</said> returned <persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>and so
		  <lb/>once more, fare thee well.</said></p>
	      <p><said><persName>Calvert</persName> is a clever fellow,</said> said the Captain,
		<lb/>when he was gone; <said>but I hope the girl will not
		  <lb/>be foolish enough to marry him.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And why do you hope so, sir?</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>Because she is the pride of <placeName>New-England</placeName>,</said> said
		<lb/>the Captain, <said>and I would not have her trans­
		  <lb/>planted to the tobacco fields and rice plantations
		  <lb/>of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>; besides――</said></p>
	      <p>The Captain suddenly stopped, and looking
		<lb/>through the window seemed watching the motions
		<lb/>of <persName>Calvert</persName>, who had again entered the boat and
		<lb/>was pushing from the shore. After a moment's
		<lb/>silence he turned quickly to <persName>Atherton</persName>, and looking
		<lb/>steadily in his face enquired,—</p>
	      <p>
		<said>And what do <emph>you</emph> think of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, <persName>Ed­
		    <lb/>ward Atherton</persName>?</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Think of her?</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, startled by the
		<lb/>abruptness of the question. <said>She is as beautiful and
		  <lb/>lovely as an angel; and I think her a jewel wor­
		  <lb/>thy the diadem of a prince.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Pretty high flown, on my word,</said> said the Cap­
		<lb/>tain laughing. <said>I do'nt think I could have done
		  <lb/>better myself, even at your age, Major; and so I
		  <lb/>suppose if she were not a <name>Puritan</name> you might be
		  <lb/>inclined to take her <quote>for better for worse,</quote> as
		  <lb/>your crafty prayer-book hath it.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Really, sir,</said> replied <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>to be frank with
		  <pb n="252"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="21(6)v"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">252</mw>
		  <lb/>you, that would be a very slight objection in my
		  <lb/>mind.</said></p>
	      <p><said>That is right, <persName>Edward</persName>,</said> returned the Captain.
		<lb/><said>I love a candid liberal spirit; but let me tell
		  <lb/>you, they are not often to be met with; and if you
		  <lb/>would take this jewel to yourself, you must believe
		  <lb/>with the rulers of the land.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I would not,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>for any personal
		  <lb/>advantage or gratification sacrifice my religious
		  <lb/>opinions till convinced they are incorrect; and at
		  <lb/>present I am far from being so.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You are right again, cousin,</said> replied the Cap­
		<lb/>tain; <said>yet after all it is but rejecting a few idle
		  <lb/>ceremonies, which have no authority in scripture;
		  <lb/>and we all believe alike at bottom.</said></p>
	      <p><said>We all believe the Bible,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>,
		<lb/><said>or profess to believe; but there are different ways
		  <lb/>of interpreting it; and our church considers cer­
		  <lb/>tain articles and forms essential, which you de­
		  <lb/>nounce as idolatrous.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Well,</said> said the Captain, <said>you must get our
		  <lb/>ministers or elders to discuss these points with you;
		  <lb/>or <persName>Mr. Bradford</persName>, who is as knowing as any of
		  <lb/>them on such subjects, and can bring forward ar­
		  <lb/>guments like a Bishop. He even learned the <rs type="properAdjective">He­
		    <lb/>brew</rs> tongue, purposely, as he says, that he might
		  <lb/>read with his <quote>own eyes the ancient oracles of
		    <lb/>God in their native beauty.</quote></said></p>
	      <p><said>I am afraid it would be dangerous to encounter
		  <lb/>so skilful an antagonist,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, smiling;
		<lb/><said>for I already admire the simplicity of your wor­
		  <pb n="253"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="22(1)r"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">253</mw>
		  <lb/>ship more perhaps, than most of my <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs>
		  <lb/>friends would approve.</said></p>
	      <p><said>So much the better,</said> replied the Captain; <said>and
		  <lb/>we will leave you to time and opportunity, hoping
		  <lb/>they will bring you into the right way at last; and
		  <lb/>then, Major, some other plans can be settled at
		  <lb/>leisure.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>I have a plan in my head now which I would
		  <lb/>mention to you, Captain; for I believe it is nearly
		  <lb/>time to put it in execution.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Well, speak it out, cousin <persName>Atherton</persName>; but I hope
		  <lb/>it will not take you away from us.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Only for a season, to the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>. I
		  <lb/>have a strong inclination to see that place, which
		  <lb/>rumour seems so fond of magnifying, and propose
		  <lb/>to visit it shortly if a convenient opportunity
		  <lb/>should offer.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Not at this season of the year!</said> said the Cap­
		<lb/>tain, <said>You can see nothing but the frozen ground
		  <lb/>and leafless trees; but wait till spring and I will
		  <lb/>go with you.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>That is certainly a very tempting proposal,
		  <lb/>Captain; but I may then feel compelled to make
		  <lb/>a longer voyage, even to the green shores of
		  <lb/><placeName>England</placeName>.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Any other spring will do as well, and better
		  <lb/>than the next for that voyage;</said> said the Captain;
		<lb/><said>so I pray you give up your scheme for the pre­
		  <lb/>sent.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I will take it into consideration, and give you
		  <lb/>seasonable notice of my departure,</said> returned Ather­

		<lb/>ton. <said>But I must leave you now, Captain, to pre­
		  <lb/>pare my packet for <persName>Captain Martin</persName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Well, have all things in readiness for to-mor­
		  <lb/>row,</said> said the Captain; <said>remember I am a punc­
		  <lb/>tual man, and it would not be handsome to keep
		  <lb/>the good people waiting on such a joyful occa­
		  <lb/>sion.</said></p>
	      <p>But it was not necessary to remind <persName>Major
		  <lb/>Atherton</persName> of his duty in that particular; he was
		<lb/>equipped in excellent season on the following day,
		<lb/>and waiting with some impatience for the appoint­
		<lb/>ed hour. This was as early as could reasonably
		<lb/>be expected, even in an age, when it was the fash­
		<lb/>ion to visit in the afternoon, and return with the
		<lb/>setting sun, instead of trespassing as now, upon
		<lb/>the hours of night, and prolonging the dance and
		<lb/>revel till the dawning of the morn. <persName>Captain
		  <lb/>Standish</persName>, who exercised a sort of military preci­
		<lb/>sion, even in the minute affairs of life, was extreme­
		<lb/>ly punctilious in regard to time on so important
		<lb/>an occasion; but his calculations were defeated by
		<lb/>the perversity of the wind, which died into a calm
		<lb/>as they were crossing the Bay, and their progress
		<lb/>was so retarded by the unlucky accident, that the
		<lb/>company were all assembled, and waiting at <persName>Mr.
		  <lb/>Grey's</persName> when they arrived at his house.</p>
	      <p>The room was well filled with guests, among
		<lb/>whom <persName>Atherton</persName> recognised the Governor and his
		<lb/>family, and many others who were slightly known
		<lb/>to him; but <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> engrossed his whole at­
		<lb/>tention, and her cordial smiles quickly effaced the
		<pb n="255"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="22(2)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">255</mw>
		<lb/>remembrance of her late fancied indifference. She,
		<lb/>however, soon left the room, and the slight bustle
		<lb/>which had prevailed, was succeeded by a general
		<lb/>pause;—the men looked grave, and even the good­
		<lb/>ly row of matrons and maidens was hushed to si­
		<lb/>lence as if awaiting some important event. Every
		<lb/>eye was turned expectantly toward the door; and
		<lb/>in a few moments <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> re-entered, accom­
		<lb/>panied by the bride and bridegroom, who advanc­
		<lb/>ed to seats left vacant for them, at the upper end
		<lb/>of the apartment, where the clergyman and magis­
		<lb/>trate stood ready to officiate. <persName>Lois Grey</persName> sustain­
		<lb/>ed the gaze of observation with modest firmness:
		<lb/>she wore the simple but not unbecoming garb of
		<lb/>her sect, with no adornment except the native
		<lb/>charms of an intelligent and ingenuous counte­
		<lb/>nance; and throughout acquitted herself with a de­
		<lb/>gree of propriety and composure, which could only
		<lb/>result from deliberate reflection on the step she was
		<lb/>about to take, and a perfect confidence in the man
		<lb/>to whose keeping she had entrusted her earthly
		<lb/>happiness.</p>
	      <p>Among many of the early non-conformists, and
		<lb/>particularly throughout the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>' settle­
		<lb/>ments, marriage was regarded merely as a civil
		<lb/>contract; and accordingly, the ceremony was al­
		<lb/>ways performed by a magistrate instead of a minis­
		<lb/>ter of religion. As <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName> had imbibed that
		<lb/>opinion, the Governor was requested to conduct the
		<lb/>marriage service, though in compliment to <persName>Mr.
		  <lb/>Reynel</persName>, the clergyman who was present, he was
		<pb n="256"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="22(2)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">256</mw>
		<lb/>invited to make the concluding prayer and offer
		<lb/>some advice adapted to the occasion.</p>
	      <p>The short, but deeply interesting ceremony was
		<lb/>soon concluded; and the whole company successive­
		<lb/>ly approached the new-married pair to present their
		<lb/>compliments and congratulations. The long estab­
		<lb/>lished custom of saluting, and being saluted was
		<lb/>not forgotten. <persName>Mr. Winslow</persName>, in virtue of his office
		<lb/>set the example by touching his lips to the blushing
		<lb/>cheek of the bride, while <persName>Mrs. Winslow</persName> received
		<lb/>the salutation of the bridegroom. They were fol­
		<lb/>lowed by the elder part of the company in due
		<lb/>order, each leading forward his spouse; and finally
		<lb/>the young people succeeded them in high glee, and
		<lb/>bandying jokes, which were doubtless considered
		<lb/>excellent at the time; but are now unfortunately
		<lb/>for posterity, entirely forgotten.</p>
	      <p><persName>Peregrine White</persName> not quite satisfied with kissing
		<lb/>the bride alone, seemed strongly inclined to extend
		<lb/>the practice more generally; and was so far encou­
		<lb/>raged by a nod of approbation from <persName>Captain Stan­
		  <lb/>dish</persName>, that he turned suddenly to <persName>Mistress Rebecca
		  <lb/>Spindle</persName>, who chanced to be next him, and before
		<lb/>she was aware of his intention, startled her by a
		<lb/>hearty salute.</p>
	      <p><said>La! <persName>Master Peregrine</persName>,</said> exclaimed the spinster,
		<lb/><said>you always take one so at unawares!</said></p>
	      <p>But <persName>Peregrine</persName> had already fixed his eyes on the
		<lb/>rosy cheek of a laughing girl; though before he
		<lb/>could approach her or his companions and had found
		<lb/>courage to imitate his boldness, the amusement was
		<pb n="257"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="22(3)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">257</mw>
		<lb/>interdicted by a grave elderly man, who with an
		<lb/>air of authority not to be disputed, remarked, that
		<lb/><said>the custom of indiscriminate salutations between
		  <lb/>young men and maidens, ought not to be tolerated
		  <lb/>in a <rs type="properAdjective">christian</rs> assembly, since it was no where
		  <lb/>authorized in scripture, except where the apostle
		  <lb/>commanded the brethren to <quote>greet one another with
		    <lb/>a holy kiss,</quote> which could not be interpreted to
		  <lb/>sanction a frolic introduced like the present, by a
		  <lb/>giddy youth.</said></p>
	      <p>This appeal was considered unanswerable by a
		<lb/>majority of the guests; but <persName>Peregrine White</persName> whis­
		<lb/>pered apart to <persName>Atherton</persName>,—</p>
	      <p>
		<said>I think that long exhortation might have been
		  <lb/>spared, when we have met together on purpose to
		  <lb/>make merry; but I wish I had begun with some
		  <lb/>one more tempting than <persName>Mistress Spindle</persName>; I would,
		  <lb/>had I known my sport was to be ended so speedily.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>But the low murmurs of his discontent were hap­
		<lb/>pily interrupted by the distribution of cake and
		<lb/>wine;—from time immemorial as indispensible at a
		<lb/>wedding festival as the nuptial benediction. The
		<lb/>health and happiness of <persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName>
		<lb/>were cheerfully pledged by each individual; some
		<lb/>adding to the compliment a sententious remark, or
		<lb/>a word of advice adapted to their new situation;
		<lb/>while those to whom it was addressed, agreeably to
		<lb/>the usage of the times, maintained their station by
		<lb/>each other as immoveably, as if the words which
		<lb/>pronounced them man and wife, had actually made
		<lb/>them one person.</p>

	      <p><persName>Miriam Grey</persName> retained a seat by the side of <persName>Lois</persName>,
		<lb/>occasionally mingling with the guests as civility
		<lb/>required; and <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, whose eyes conti­
		<lb/>nually followed her, fancied her countenance was
		<lb/>less animated and her smile more pensive than usual.
		<lb/>It was natural that she should feel a degree of sad­
		<lb/>ness on an event so replete with solemn interest to
		<lb/>her cousin; and which, she was aware, would soon
		<lb/>remove from her the long tried and beloved friend
		<lb/>of her childhood and youth. <persName>Miriam</persName> however en­
		<lb/>deavoured to repress these feelings; and <persName>Mr. Cal­
		  <lb/>vert</persName>, who perhaps also observed the shade on her
		<lb/>open brow, exerted his peculiar address to engage
		<lb/>her in conversation, and call forth the usual gaiety
		<lb/>of her spirits.</p>
	      <p><said>I hope, cousin <persName>Atherton</persName>,</said> said <persName>Captain Standish</persName>,
		<lb/>who saw him regarding them attentively, <said>you do
		  <lb/>not envy the bridegroom that you look so long and
		  <lb/>earnestly in that direction.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Not in the least, sir,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>though
		  <lb/>he appears so happy that one might almost be
		  <lb/>tempted to do so; but I was not even thinking of
		  <lb/>him just then.</said></p>
	      <p><said>No, I'll engage you were not,</said> said <persName>Peregrine
		  <lb/>White</persName>; <said>and I think Captain, if the Major was
		  <lb/>envying any one, it might have been <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You take it upon yourself to think at all times,
		  <lb/>and for every body, <name>Master Malapert</name>,</said> said the
		<lb/>Captain; <said>but what were <emph>you</emph> thinking of when
		  <lb/>you ventured to offend <persName>Mistress Spindle</persName> by kissing
		  <lb/>her?</said></p>

	      <p><said>I was thinking of a fairer cheek beyond her,</said><lb/>replied <persName>Peregrine</persName>, laughing; <said>but thought it would
		  <lb/>not be courteous to pass by hers; and I believe,
		  <lb/>she has very graciously pardoned the offence.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Fairly done,</said> said the Captain, <said>and I think
		  <lb/>no one will contest your choice, <persName>Peregrine</persName>. But
		  <lb/>come with me, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>; we will draw
		  <lb/>nearer the happy couple since they are tied up so
		  <lb/>that they cannot come to us.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I will follow, with your leave;</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName>.
		<lb/><said><persName>Miriam</persName> looks this way as though she had some­
		  <lb/>thing to say to me; or it may be to you, <persName>Major
		    <lb/>Atherton</persName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I have been half inclined to forbid your banns,
		  <lb/><persName>Mr. Weldon</persName>,</said> said the Captain, as he drew near
		<lb/>him. <said>Methinks it is hardly lawful in you to
		  <lb/>leave your distant province of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, and
		  <lb/>steal away a fair daughter from our land.</said></p>
	      <p><said>The theft was committed with the consent of
		  <lb/>all parties concerned,</said> returned <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName>; <said>and
		  <lb/>it is now too late to enter a protest against our
		  <lb/>proceedings.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Yes, you are pretty sure of your prize now,</said><lb/>replied the Captain; <said>but I am glad to hear you
		  <lb/>intend to remain at <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> for this winter,
		  <lb/>were it only for the sake of <persName>Miriam</persName>, who could
		  <lb/>hardly do without her cousin at this time.</said></p>

		  <lb/>vations and hardships of a new colony in the wil­
		  <lb/>derness, at this season of the year,</said> replied <persName>Mr.

		  <lb/>I think we may venture there with a fair prospect

		  <lb/>then.</said></p>
	      <p><said>As much as I <emph>can</emph> be, you mean,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>;

		  <lb/>turns.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Perhaps we may yet induce you to go with us,</said><lb/>said <persName>Lois</persName>; <said>will you not assist us to persuade her,
		  <lb/><persName>Captain Standish</persName>?</said></p>
	      <p><said>Not I,</said> replied the Captain; <said>it is quite enough
		  <lb/>to lose <emph>you</emph>, and we will not suffer <persName>Miriam</persName> to go,
		  <lb/>even for a short time.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Not to such a place,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>, <said>where the
		  <lb/>trees are yet scarcely felled, or the ground prepar­
		  <lb/>ed to bring forth food for the scanty inhabitants;
		  <lb/>she might as well think of a voyage to the <placeName>north
		    <lb/>pole</placeName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I suppose <emph>you</emph> would rather recommend the
		  <lb/>balmy breezes of the south, <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName>,</said> said the
		<lb/>Captain.</p>
	      <p><said>Yes,</said> returned <persName>Calvert</persName>, fixing his eyes on <persName>Mi­
		  <lb/>riam</persName>; <said>there is some enjoyment in life, where the
		  <lb/>earth is ever verdant, the flowers in almost perpe­
		  <lb/>tual bloom, and the trees laden with delicious
		  <lb/>fruits.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I should think one would grow weary from very
		  <lb/>sameness,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>and really my own cli­
		  <lb/>mate of <placeName>New-England</placeName> seems far pleasanter to me,
		  <lb/>even with its snow storms and bleak winds, which
		  <lb/>but render the return of spring more grateful.</said></p>

	      <p><said>That is exactly what you ought to say and think,
		  <lb/>my little rose-bud,</said> said the Captain. <said>I have seen
		  <lb/>many countries, but no one fairer than this, or more
		  <lb/>desirable; so do not let <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName> persuade you
		  <lb/>there is any thing better to be found under the hot
		  <lb/>sun of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>There is no danger of it, sir,</said> replied <persName>Miriam</persName>;
		<lb/><said>I am very incredulous on this subject, and cannot
		  <lb/>readily believe any land happier or more beautiful
		  <lb/>than the one I have lived in, almost from my birth.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Not even Old <placeName>England</placeName>?</said> asked <persName>Peregrine White</persName>,
		<lb/>archly. <said><persName>Major Atherton</persName> can tell you wonderful
		  <lb/>stories about that, <persName>Miriam</persName>; and some which may
		  <lb/>change your mind, perhaps.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Not in the least,</said> replied <persName>Miriam</persName>, smiling, but
		<lb/>deeply blushing; <said>it is our mother country, and I
		  <lb/>have always been taught to love it, but—</said></p>
	      <p><said>Keep in your own colony,</said> interrupted the Cap­
		<lb/>tain, <said>this exploring of the wilderness is a seeking
		  <lb/>out of new inventions, which does not suit me, so
		  <lb/>long as we have room enough and to spare about
		  <lb/>us.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You did not think so, Captain,</said> said <persName>Lois</persName>, <said>se­
		  <lb/>venteen years ago, when you used to toss <persName>Miriam</persName>
		  <lb/>in your arms, and run after me round the deck of
		  <lb/>the <name>Mayflower</name>, in our passage over from <placeName>Holland</placeName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I was seventeen years younger then,</said> replied
		<lb/>the Captain, <said>and you a romping child, instead of
		  <lb/>a grave matron, <persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName>; and we came for
		  <lb/>the rights of conscience, which you cannot plead in
		  <lb/>excuse for removing farther off; but your husband
		  <pb n="262"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="22(5)v"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">262</mw>
		  <lb/>may be right for all that, <persName>Lois</persName>; it is well to pro­
		  <lb/>vide ample space for a family; and at any rate, you
		  <lb/>cannot mend the matter now.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I hope she will never have cause to wish it,</said><lb/>said <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>I hope not,</said> returned the Captain; <said>but repen­
		  <lb/>tance will sometimes creep in after marriage; it is
		  <lb/>a short ceremony, but apt to bring a long reckon­
		  <lb/>ing.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Yes,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>you have invented a very
		  <lb/>summary way of joining people together; and it
		  <lb/>seems to me quite an improvement on the ancient
		  <lb/>mode of our church; one is saved a vast deal of
		  <lb/>time, to say nothing of the formidable array of book,
		  <lb/>ring, and kneeling.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I am glad to hear you condemn such superflui­
		  <lb/>ties,</said> said <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, <said>which savour much of the
		  <lb/>wordly spirit of vain glory. I hope, <persName>Major Ath­
		    <lb/>erton</persName>, that you have judged as favourably of our
		  <lb/>forms?</said></p>
	      <p><said>I see nothing to condemn in the form,</said> returned
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>but I must confess myself still preju­
		  <lb/>diced in favour of that which I have been accusto­
		  <lb/>med to witness; and cannot but consider it more
		  <lb/>solemn and impressive.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Is there any thing more binding,</said> asked <persName>Mr.
		  <lb/>Grey</persName>, <said>in the giving and receiving a ring, or in
		  <lb/>kneeling, rather than standing?</said></p>
	      <p><said>No,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>nor is the simple act
		  <lb/>of joining the hands, which we all allow, in itself
		  <lb/>binding; yet custom has equally sanctioned them

		  <lb/>with us; and it is not easy to divest one's self of its
		  <lb/>influence.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Even as the children of <placeName>Canaan</placeName> clave unto their
		  <lb/>graven images, so do the sons of prelacy put their
		  <lb/>trust in the vain pomps and ceremonies of their re­
		  <lb/>ligion,</said> said the elderly man who had reproved <persName>Pe­
		  <lb/>regrine White</persName>, and now lent an attentive ear to the
		<lb/>conversation.</p>
	      <p><said>I hope, sir, you will absolve us from wilful ido­
		  <lb/>latry,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>we follow the path which
		  <lb/>our fathers pointed out, as most congenial to the
		  <lb/>spirit of the gospel, and the practice of its early fol­
		  <lb/>lowers.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It is blindly building an altar to the <quote>unknown
		    <lb/>God,</quote></said> replied the other, <said>and seeking to please
		  <lb/>him with offerings and oblations, in which he hath
		  <lb/>no pleasure.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I do not feel myself very bigotted to forms,</said> re­
		<lb/>plied <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>but some are undoubtedly expedi­
		  <lb/>ent; and long experience has proved the efficacy of
		  <lb/>those which we have adopted.</said></p>
	      <p><said>The wedding ring, for instance,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>,
		<lb/><said>I should hope some of our forms were more happy
		  <lb/>in their effects, than that sometimes proves to be.</said></p>
	      <p><said><persName>Major Atherton</persName> knows nothing of that yet,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Captain Standish</persName>, who had listened with evident
		<lb/>impatience to his kinsman's defence of such obnoxi­
		<lb/>ous ceremonies; <said>and I will be bound for him, if
		  <lb/>he can get a wife to his liking, he will not stand
		  <lb/>upon rings, or kneeling, or any such troublesome
		  <lb/>inventions of priestcraft.</said></p>

	      <p><said>Now who would think,</said> said <persName>Mistress Rebecca
		  <lb/>Spindle</persName>, <said>of using a ring and a book to be married
		  <lb/>with, unless it were a papist, or some such like.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And yet it is better than not to be married at
		  <lb/>all,</said> replied <persName>Peregrine White</persName>; <said>don't you think so,
		  <lb/><persName>Mistress Rebecca</persName>?</said></p>
	      <p><said>Heaven forbid, that I should uphold such idola­
		  <lb/>trous practices,</said> ejaculated the spinster.</p>
	      <p><said>But tell us now, <persName>Mistress Spindle</persName>,</said> returned
		<lb/><persName>Peregrine</persName>, <said>when are we to drink your health at
		  <lb/>your own wedding?</said></p>
	      <p><said>It must be all in the Lord's own good time,</said> re­
		<lb/>plied <persName>Rebecca</persName>, in a tone of resignation.</p>
	      <p><said>But you doubtless pray that the time may be
		  <lb/>shortened,</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName>, gravely.</p>
	      <p><said>Be it sooner or later, matters little for me to
		  <lb/>know,</said> returned the other, <said>our times are not in
		  <lb/>our own hands.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I think it cannot be much later,</said> replied <persName>Pere­
		  <lb/>grine</persName>, <said>what say you, <persName>Miriam</persName>?</said></p>
	      <p><said><persName>Mistress Rebecca</persName> can best judge of that mat­
		  <lb/>ter herself,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>unless you may feel in­
		  <lb/>clined to decide it for her.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I had rather undertake to do it, for you,</said> an­
		<lb/>swered <persName>Peregrine</persName>; <said>and I believe, there would be
		  <lb/>more than one ready to assist me.</said></p>
	      <p><said>No doubt of that,</said> said the Captain; <said>but I tell
		  <lb/>you, <persName>Master Peregrine</persName>, <persName>Miriam</persName> does not need any
		  <lb/>of your interference; she is well able to take care
		  <lb/>of her own affairs.</said></p>

		  <lb/>crave your assistance oftener, to drill <persName>Master
		    <lb/>Peregrine</persName> into good behaviour; he is very apt to
		  <lb/>rebel against me.</said></p>
	      <p><said>It would be a good piece of service to us all, if
		  <lb/>I could do so,</said> replied the Captain; <said>but I would
		  <lb/>sooner undertake to discipline a whole regiment of
		  <lb/>recruits.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I will remove myself before you begin,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Peregrine</persName>; <said>this seems a second part of the good
		  <lb/>man's discourse, who lectured me about kissing
		  <lb/>just now; and I will make room for <persName>Master
		    <lb/>Ashly</persName>, who is coming this way, to hear the con­
		  <lb/>clusion.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Farewell,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>I hope the exhorta­
		  <lb/>tion has proved a <quote>word in season to you.</quote></said></p>
	      <p><said>We will prove that by and bye,</said> returned

		  <lb/>stay behind, and throw the stocking.</said></p>
	      <p>The guests at that moment began to separate;
		<lb/>and the elderly and married ones, after shaking
		<lb/>hands with the bride and bridegroom, and re­
		<lb/>peating their good wishes returned home, leaving

	      <p><persName rend="case(smallcaps)">Major Atherton</persName> was among the last who
		<lb/>quitted <persName>Mr. Grey's</persName>; and, as the evening was ra­
		<lb/>ther advanced, he was readily induced to return
		<lb/>with <persName>Peregrine White</persName> and pass the night at the
		<lb/>Governor's. A strong north-west wind on the
		<lb/>following morning, proved favourable for the de­
		<lb/>parture of <persName>Captain Martin's</persName> vessel; and soon
		<lb/>after breakfast, <persName>Mr. Winslow</persName> proposed calling to
		<lb/>take leave of <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, in the expectation that
		<lb/>he was about to sail. <persName>Atherton</persName> readily acceded
		<lb/>to the proposal, and unwilling to intrude on his
		<lb/>domestic privacy, at the moment of separation
		<lb/>from his family, they proceeded directly to the ves­
		<lb/>sel, intending to await his arrival there. They
		<lb/>found him already on board; for <persName>Captain Martin</persName>,
		<lb/>who had been long detained by adverse winds,
		<lb/>and found the winter approaching, held every thing
		<lb/>in readiness, to take advantage of the first favour­
		<lb/>able breeze; and was then preparing to weigh
		<lb/>anchor and depart.</p>
	      <p><persName>Mr. Grey</persName> was standing on the fore-castle of
		<lb/>the ship, with his eyes fixed on the shore, where
		<pb n="267"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="23(2)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">267</mw>
		<lb/>his own house was just visible in the distance; and
		<lb/>so engaged in meditation that he did not perceive
		<lb/>the approach of the Governor and <persName>Major Atherton</persName>,
		<lb/>till they stood directly before him.</p>
	      <p><said>The Captain has been expeditious in making
		  <lb/>his arrangements,</said> said <persName>Mr. Winslow</persName>; <said>I hoped
		  <lb/>for a longer conference with you, before your de­
		  <lb/>parture.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Our farewell must be brief,</said> returned <persName>Mr.
		  <lb/>Grey</persName>; <said>I perceive they are already waiting for
		  <lb/>us; but it is well, perhaps, that we have no longer
		  <lb/>time; for I feel that the moment of separation is
		  <lb/>too bitter to be prolonged.</said></p>
	      <p><said>They whom you leave behind,</said> said the Go­
		<lb/>vernor, <said>are safe, I trust, in the protection of Hea­
		  <lb/>ven, and surrounded by friends who will watch
		  <lb/>over their safety, and minister to their comfort and
		  <lb/>welfare.</said></p>
	      <p><said>That thought has power to console me,</said> re­
		<lb/>plied <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>; <said>while I cheerfully entrust my
		  <lb/>child to the guardian care of Him, who is better
		  <lb/>than any earthly parent; I feel persuaded also,
		  <lb/>that I may confide in your friendship, should any
		  <lb/>unexpected misfortune arise to perplex or distress
		  <lb/>her.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Suffer no anxious thought for her to disturb
		  <lb/>your mind,</said> returned <persName>Mr. Winslow</persName>; <said>she shall be
		  <lb/>unto me as mine own daughter, and to my wife
		  <lb/>she is no less dear.</said></p>
	      <p><said>May God bless you, my friend,</said> said <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>,
		<lb/>with emotion; <said>and now, farewell! Cease not to
		  <lb/>make mention of me in your prayers.</said></p>

	      <p><said>Farewell!</said> repeated <persName>Mr. Winslow</persName>; <said>and may
		  <lb/>He, who commands the winds and stills the roar­
		  <lb/>ing of the waves, guide and protect you in all
		  <lb/>your ways, and return you in safety to us again.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Amen,</said> said <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, with solemn emphasis, as
		<lb/>he slowly released his hand from the Governor, and
		<lb/>offered it to <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, who had remained a
		<lb/>silent but deeply interested auditor; and scarcely
		<lb/>able to repress the impulse, which urged him to
		<lb/>confess his attachment for <persName>Miriam</persName>, and entreat
		<lb/>permission of her father, to become himself her
		<lb/>protector and husband. But the recollection of
		<lb/>their late interview, with a conviction that it
		<lb/>would now be useless, and might increase his
		<lb/>anxiety respecting her, dissuaded him from the
		<lb/>attempt, while, in some embarrassment he waited
		<lb/>for <persName>Mr. Grey</persName> to address him.</p>
	      <p><said><persName>Major Atherton</persName>,</said> he at length said, <said>I may
		  <lb/>meet with your friends or kindred, whither I am
		  <lb/>going; and if I can do you aught of service
		  <lb/>with them, command me and I will do it cheer­
		  <lb/>fully; for you have shewn much kindness unto me
		  <lb/>and mine.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I have left few there to feel interested for my
		  <lb/>fate,</said> replied <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>and to them I have al­
		  <lb/>ready written; but there are some valued friends
		  <lb/>of my mother, whom you may chance to meet;
		  <lb/>and if they enquire concerning me, say to them
		  <lb/>that I am happy and contented.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And shall I tell them,</said> asked <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, <said>that
		  <lb/>you will sojourn yet a long time in this land?</said></p>

	      <p><said>I am still undecided,</said> replied <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>it
		  <lb/>may be but a few months, and possibly for many
		  <lb/>years.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Commit your ways to Him, who ordereth all
		  <lb/>things for the best;</said> returned <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>; <said>and, if
		  <lb/>I meet you here on my return, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>,
		  <lb/>may it be in peace, and with the same sentiments
		  <lb/>of regard and confidence, with which I now part
		  <lb/>from you.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I trust you will find no cause to withdraw your
		  <lb/>confidence and regard from me, sir,</said> replied <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName>; and the firmness of his voice, and the calm­
		<lb/>ness with which he restrained the searching glance
		<lb/>of <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, seemed to reassure the latter, who
		<lb/>shook him cordially by the hand; and having ex­
		<lb/>changed their parting adieus, the Governor and
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName> returned to the shore.</p>
	      <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> soon after separated from <persName>Mr.
		  <lb/>Winslow</persName>, and ascending a slight eminence, which
		<lb/>commanded a view of the noble <placeName>Bay of Plymouth</placeName>,
		<lb/>he watched, with extreme interest, the progress of
		<lb/>the vessel, as with swelling sails she rode proudly
		<lb/>over the waves. It was nearly three months since
		<lb/>the same bark had brought him from the land to
		<lb/>which she was now returning, like a white winged
		<lb/>messenger; and, <said>why,</said> he asked himself, <said>am I
		  <lb/>exiled from the country which gave me birth?
		  <lb/>why do I still linger on these shores, an unknown
		  <lb/>individual, in a clime which scarcely bears a
		  <lb/>name on the map of civilization?</said> He started, as
		<lb/>these reflections crossed his mind, and looked more

		<lb/>eagerly upon the receding ship, as if desirous that
		<lb/>it should waft him back to the home he had for­
		<lb/>saken. But it was already far off in the dis­
		<lb/>tance; the busy hum of the sailors, the command­
		<lb/>ing voice of the Captain, were borne away on the
		<lb/>winds; and <persName>Atherton</persName> repeated, with a sigh, <said>Why
		  <lb/>should I revisit the scenes of my boyhood and
		  <lb/>youth? where there is no loved voice to welcome
		  <lb/>me, where all whom I held most dear, have been
		  <lb/>prematurely snatched from my embrace, and where
		  <lb/>my ambitious hopes of honour and distinction have
		  <lb/>been blighted in the bud. Here there is at least
		  <lb/><emph>one</emph> being to attach me, and here I will remain, un­
		  <lb/>til her lips decide my destiny.</said></p>
	      <p>With this resolution, <persName>Major Atherton</persName> walked
		<lb/>quickly onwards, till he found himself by the well-
		<lb/>known wicket, which led to the house of <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>.
		<lb/>He looked earnestly in the windows, but no person
		<lb/>was visible; and fearful that a visit from him, at
		<lb/>that time, would be unwelcome, he was passing by
		<lb/>with reluctant steps, when the door opened and
		<lb/>closed again, with some violence; and looking
		<lb/>round, he saw <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName> coming from it and ad­
		<lb/>vancing towards him.</p>
	      <p><said>Upon my word, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>,</said> he said, <said>you
		  <lb/>haunt this spot, like the ghost of a despairing lo­
		  <lb/>ver; at morning, noon, and night, I find you hover­
		  <lb/>ing round it,—</said></p>
	      <p><said>Which proves your frequent visits also,</said> re­
		<lb/>plied <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>and are they made in the same
		  <lb/>unhappy spirit which you attribute to me?</said></p>

		  <lb/>son like the present,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>when she can
		  <lb/>scarcely feel in spirits to receive the visit even of a
		  <lb/>friend.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Your scruples are certainly very delicate,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Calvert</persName>, sarcastically; <said>but my acquaintance, you
		  <lb/>will remember, is of longer standing, which enti­
		  <lb/>tles me to greater freedom.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And you are not very fastidious about trifles, I
		  <lb/>think,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>but, may I ask, how
		  <lb/>you found the family within?</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>If you mean <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName>, and old <persName>Jemima</persName>, the
		  <lb/>house-maid, they seemed as well as usual.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Were your efforts at consolation directed en­
		  <lb/>tirely to them?</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>To tell you the truth, I saw no others to exer­
		  <lb/>cise it upon, unless it were <persName>Miriam's</persName> kitten,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Calvert</persName>, pettishly.</p>
	      <p><said rend="post()">You did not see <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, then?</said> returned
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>; and he could not suppress a smile of
		<lb/>pleasure.</p>
	      <p><said>You need not look so much pleased about it,</said><lb/>replied <persName>Calvert</persName>. <said>I am sure it is no strange thing
		  <lb/>for girls to shew off their importance, by such capri­
		  <lb/>cious airs; and <persName>Lois</persName> would doubtless like to dis­
		  <lb/>play her authority, now she has become a matron.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Did <persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName> prohibit <persName>Miriam</persName> from ap­
		  <lb/>pearing?</said> enquired <persName>Atherton</persName>.
		<lb/><said>Very likely,</said> said <persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>but I did not see

		  <lb/>her either; they were wailing together, in some
		  <lb/>dark corner, for aught I know; but you had bet­
		  <lb/>ter go in, Major; perhaps you will be more suc­
		  <lb/>cessful.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Excuse me;</said> replied <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>I am not fond
		  <lb/>of making experiments; and it would be particu­
		  <lb/>larly rash, when you have so recently failed.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You are too cautious, to be a dangerous rival,</said><lb/>said <persName>Calvert</persName>; <said>so I forgive your joy at my defeat
		  <lb/>just now; which really does not cause me the
		  <lb/>least inquietude. Women are fickle beings at the
		  <lb/>best; and may well be allowed their whims before
		  <lb/>marriage, since no man of sense will indulge them
		  <lb/>afterwards. And so, good morning to you.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> returned home, in unusually
		<lb/>good spirits, which led <persName>Captain Standish</persName> to re­
		<lb/>mark, <said>that the wedding had produced a whole­
		  <lb/>some effect on him; and that he hoped to congra­
		  <lb/>tulate him on his own before long.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName> was not displeased at the wish; nor at
		<lb/>a succeeding proposition, that they should, the fol­
		<lb/>lowing day, pay their respects to <persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName> and
		<lb/>see how <persName>Miriam</persName> fared in her father's absence.</p>
	      <p>The visit was accordingly made; and they
		<lb/>found <persName>Miriam</persName> more cheerful than they expected,
		<lb/>and almost reconciled to the separation. <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName> spoke of her father, and mentioned that he had
		<lb/>seen him, at the moment of his departure; a cir­
		<lb/>cumstance which seemed to give him additional in­
		<lb/>terest with her; and she asked numberless ques­
		<lb/>tions respecting him, that he was never weary of
		<pb n="273"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="23(5)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">273</mw>
		<lb/>answering. An hour or two passed by; and when
		<lb/>the Captain spoke of their return, <persName>Atherton</persName> thought
		<lb/>them the shortest and most delightful he had ever
		<lb/>spent; nor was it without evident reluctance that
		<lb/>he rose to accompany him.</p>
	      <p>Another week glided away, almost the happiest
		<lb/>of <persName>Major Atherton's</persName> life; for some portion of every
		<lb/>day he passed in the society of <persName>Miriam</persName>, and his
		<lb/>approach was welcomed by her, with a brighter
		<lb/>smile, and deeper glow than usually adorned her
		<lb/>countenance. These expressions of pleasure, of
		<lb/>which, with an artlessness that rendered them more
		<lb/>attractive, she seemed perfectly unconscious, <persName>Ath­
		  <lb/>erton</persName> could not fail to regard as indications that
		<lb/>he had awakened some interest in her affections;
		<lb/>and with the sanguine hopes which time had not
		<lb/>yet taught him to distrust, he indulged the most
		<lb/>flattering dreams, forgetful of her father's inter­
		<lb/>diction, and of every obstacle which could oppose
		<lb/>his wishes. Frank and undisguised in his dispo­
		<lb/>sition, <persName>Captain Standish</persName> easily penetrated his views
		<lb/>and feelings; but he made no comment on them;
		<lb/>and only occasionally hazarded a jest on his fre­
		<lb/>quent visits to <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>. In these visits he
		<lb/>was sometimes his companion, and readily detect­
		<lb/>ed, through the delicate reserve, perhaps conscious­
		<lb/>ness, which led <persName>Miriam</persName> to direct her attentions and
		<lb/>conversation less freely to <persName>Atherton</persName> than any
		<lb/>other; an incipient preference, which, thus dis­
		<lb/>guised, might have escaped an unobservant eye.</p>
	      <p>To the mind of <persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName>, the situation of her
		<pb n="274"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="23(5)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">274</mw>
		<lb/>cousin, occasioned many anxious and perplexing
		<lb/>thoughts. Too solicitous for her happiness, not to
		<lb/>remark the attachment which appeared to be daily
		<lb/>strengthening, between <persName>Miriam</persName> and <persName>Major Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName>, she yet felt unable to avert it, or to interrupt
		<lb/>their intercourse, which she knew must meet the
		<lb/>disapprobation of her father, and probably termi­
		<lb/>nate in disappointment to them both. <persName>Mr. <choice><sic>Gray</sic><corr>Grey</corr></choice></persName>
		<lb/>had ever placed unbounded confidence in the dis­
		<lb/>cretion of his niece, and in the dutiful affection of
		<lb/>his daughter; and <persName>Lois</persName> felt a degree of responsi­
		<lb/>bility during his absence which increased her un­
		<lb/>easiness, and determined her to remind <persName>Miriam</persName> of
		<lb/>her duty, and the submission which she owed to the
		<lb/>wishes of her father.</p>
	      <p>One day, when <persName>Major Atherton</persName> had not been
		<lb/>with them as usual, and <persName>Miriam</persName> discovered many
		<lb/>symptoms of disappointment, <persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName>, after
		<lb/>observing her for some time in silence, at length
		<lb/>said,—</p>
	      <p>
		<said>You are unusually grave to day, <persName>Miriam</persName>; has
		  <lb/>any thing happened to give you uneasiness?</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>No, nothing, <persName>Lois</persName>,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>but I be­
		  <lb/>lieve the dulness of the weather affects my spirits.</said>
		<lb/>—And she arose from her chair, and crossing the
		<lb/>room, seated herself by a window.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>You did not use to regard such trifles, <persName>Miriam</persName>,
		  <lb/>but were as cheerful in storms as in sunshine.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Yes, when my father was at home; but I can­
		  <lb/>not now avoid many anxious thoughts respecting
		  <lb/>him.</said>
	      </p>
	      <pb n="275"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="23(6)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">275</mw>
	      <p><said>And were you less anxious for him two days
		  <lb/>since, when it stormed so violently?</said> asked <persName>Lois</persName>.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>No, but <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName> was here then, and one
		  <lb/>cannot but be gay where he is; besides, he assured
		  <lb/>me that the vessel was beyond the reach of our
		  <lb/>storms.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>And <persName>Major Atherton</persName> was here too,</said> said <persName>Lois</persName>;
		<lb/><said>did you forget to mention him?</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Miriam</persName> made no reply, but looked steadfastly
		<lb/>upon the leafless branches of the trees, which rust­
		<lb/>led against the casement.</p>
	      <p><said>I did not think, <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> continued <persName>Lois</persName>, <said>that
		  <lb/><persName>Mr. Calvert</persName> would render you so entirely forget­
		  <lb/>ful of <persName>Major Atherton</persName>.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You cannot believe, <persName>Lois</persName>,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, turn­
		<lb/>ing to her with vivacity, <said>that I do, for a moment,
		  <lb/>prefer <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName>, or even place him in compari­
		  <lb/>son with—</said> She stopped abruptly, abashed by a
		<lb/>smile which lurked on the countenance of <persName>Lois</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>No, dear <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> said <persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName>, after a
		<lb/>moment's pause, <said>I only fear that you think <emph>too</emph>
		  <lb/>highly of <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, and <emph>too</emph> frequently.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>And why should you fear that, <persName>Lois</persName>? how often
		  <lb/>have I heard you speak warmly in his praise; and
		  <lb/>surely he has done nothing to forfeit your regard.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Nothing, <persName>Miriam</persName>; I believe him deserving of
		  <lb/>the high opinion which we all entertain of him.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<said>Why then should we withdraw it, <persName>Lois</persName>? I, at
		  <lb/>least, who am indebted to him for my recovered
		  <lb/>life, should be ungrateful to repay his kindness with
		  <lb/>cold indifference.</said>

	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">276</mw>
	      <p>
		<said>I would not have you ungrateful, or indifferent,
		  <lb/><persName>Miriam</persName>; but guard your feelings, lest they betray
		  <lb/>you into warmer sentiments than are consistent
		  <lb/>with your duty and happiness.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Surely, dear <persName>Lois</persName>,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, with alarm,
		<lb/><said>I have betrayed no undue partiality—nothing
		  <lb/>which can be deemed improper or unbecoming!</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>I spoke of the future, not the past, <persName>Miriam</persName>.
		  <lb/>I would awaken your prudence, not alarm your
		  <lb/>delicacy. Your own discretion can alone direct
		  <lb/>you. <persName>Major Atherton</persName> seeks not to disguise his
		  <lb/>affection for you; and he hopes to obtain yours in
		  <lb/>return.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>It cannot, must not be so;</said> replied <persName>Miriam</persName>,
		<lb/>deeply blushing; <said>and believe me, <persName>Lois</persName>, the wishes
		  <lb/>of my father shall not be disregarded.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Let them ever continue sacred to you;</said> return­
		<lb/>ed <persName>Lois</persName>; <said>remember your voluntary promise to
		  <lb/>consult his will, and it may save you many unhap­
		  <lb/>py moments, many painful reflections. And now,
		  <lb/>tell me, <persName>Miriam</persName>, that you forgive my interference?</said></p>
	      <p><said>I thank you for it, dear <persName>Lois</persName>,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>;
		<lb/><said>and I believe you were in this, as in every other
		  <lb/>thing, actuated by kindness <emph>to me</emph>. But I think,</said>
		<lb/>she added, more gaily, <said>you have not exacted im­
		  <lb/>possibilities from me.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName> looked a moment in silence, at her
		<lb/>cousin's varying complexion; and then kissing her
		<lb/>affectionately, left her to the indulgence of her own
		<lb/>reflections.</p>
	      <p><persName>Miriam</persName> stood at the window with her eyes fixed

		<lb/>on the passing clouds, till unconsciously they be­
		<lb/>came filled with tears, which gathered in large
		<lb/>drops, and rolled unheeded down her cheeks. But
		<lb/>she was soon roused from this situation by the ap­
		<lb/>pearance of <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, who hastily flung open
		<lb/>the wicket, and with quick foot-steps approached
		<lb/>the door. <persName>Miriam</persName> finding it impossible to retire
		<lb/>without observation, endeavoured to wipe away the
		<lb/>traces of her emotion, and receive him with her
		<lb/>usual cheerfulness. For the first time, however,
		<lb/>her manner was constrained and embarrassed;
		<lb/>and the animation of <persName>Atherton</persName> vanished, when he
		<lb/>perceived the dejection which her efforts were una­
		<lb/>ble to disguise.</p>
	      <p><said>Dear <persName>Miriam</persName>, why are you so sad?</said> he asked,
		<lb/>in a voice of anxious tenderness, and thrown off his
		<lb/>guard by an appearance of melancholy so unusual
		<lb/>to her.</p>
	      <p><said>I have been watching these watery clouds,</said> she
		<lb/>replied, averting her face from him, <said>till they have
		  <lb/>imparted their gloomy influence to me; the angry
		  <lb/>tossing of the waves too, as they dash against the
		  <lb/>rocks, remind me of the terrors and perils of the sea.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Nay then,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>I must not allow
		  <lb/>you to look on objects which fill your imagination
		  <lb/>with such sombre images.</said> And he gently led her
		<lb/>towards the fire, and seated himself beside her.</p>
	      <p><said>But I can still hear the rushing of the wind,</said><lb/>said <persName>Miriam</persName>, smiling, <said>and the sound is scarcely
		  <lb/>less appalling to me.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Its influence cannot extend beyond the coast,</said><mw type="vol" rend="align(left)case(allcaps)indent(+1)">Vol. I.</mw><mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">24</mw><pb n="278"/><milestone unit="sig" n="24(1)v"/><mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">278</mw><lb/>returned <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>and I trust your father is now
		  <lb/>far distant beneath a clearer sky, and borne on by
		  <lb/>favourable gales.</said></p>
	      <p><said>But where all is uncertain,</said> replied <persName>Miriam</persName>,
		<lb/><said>it is impossible to exclude doubt and anxiety from
		  <lb/>the mind.</said></p>
	      <p><said>How happy should I be,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, fervent­
		<lb/>ly, <said>could I ever hope to be regarded with so much
		  <lb/>interest.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And do you feel so very destitute of friends,</said><lb/>asked <persName>Miriam</persName>, reproachfully, <said>as to believe there
		  <lb/>are none here, who would feel solicitude for your
		  <lb/>welfare and happiness?</said></p>
	      <p><said>I trust there are many, and those whose esteem
		  <lb/>I highly prize;</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>but the favour
		  <lb/>of the whole world were vain and joyless to me,
		  <lb/><persName>Miriam</persName>, unless blessed with the love which I so ar­
		  <lb/>dently aspire to gain.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Miriam</persName> drooped her eyes beneath his impassion­
		<lb/>ed gaze; but determined to conceal the emotions
		<lb/>which really agitated her, she resumed an air of
		<lb/>unconcern, and with apparent gaiety, replied,—</p>
	      <p><said>And like <persName>Haman</persName> of old, every blessing is valu­
		  <lb/>less in your eyes, so long as one desire is withhold­
		  <lb/>en from you! but remember his fate is recorded for
		  <lb/>our learning, on whom the ends of the earth have
		  <lb/>come!</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName> looked at her in surprise and perplexi­
		<lb/>ty, as if seeking an explanation of a levity so sud­
		<lb/>den and ill-timed; but deceived by her transient
		<lb/>self-possession, and deeply wounded by her suppos­

		<lb/>ed indifference, he hastily rose, and in a voice of
		<lb/>touching melancholy, replied,—</p>
	      <p>
		<said rend="pre()">Pardon my presumption, <persName>Miriam</persName>; and when I
		  <lb/>am far from you, think of me at least with kind­
		  <lb/>ness.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Far from me! when, whither are you going?</said><lb/>asked <persName>Miriam</persName>, quickly; and surprised out of her
		<lb/>caution, by his unexpected words and manner.</p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName> had turned from her, but the hurried
		<lb/>and anxious tone in which she spoke, revived his
		<lb/>hopes, and instantly recalled him.</p>
	      <p><said>You alone can decide for me, <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> he said,
		<lb/>eagerly; <said>for I place my destiny at your disposal.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You have chosen a blind guide,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>,
		<lb/>with recovered composure, <said>since I am entirely ig­
		  <lb/>norant of your circumstances and designs.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Why, <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>do you thus
		  <lb/>misunderstand me? need you any further proofs to
		  <lb/>convince you, that without you every place must
		  <lb/>become dreary to me, and every enjoyment a source
		  <lb/>of bitterness?</said></p>
	      <p><said>Suffer me not,</said> replied <persName>Miriam</persName>, with a flushed
		<lb/>cheek, and unsteady voice, <said>to interfere with your
		  <lb/>pursuits, or interrupt the plans of enjoyment which
		  <lb/>have drawn you hither.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Happiness is the object of my pursuit,</said> said <persName>Ath­
		  <lb/>erton</persName>; <said>and I find it centered in you; restless and
		  <lb/>disappointed, I left my native land; but in your
		  <lb/>presence, life has renewed the sunshine and beauty
		  <lb/>which gladdened my early days, and which, re­
		  <lb/>moved from you, would again wither and fade away.

		  <lb/>Dearest <persName>Miriam</persName>, you alone are the inspirer and the
		  <lb/>object of all my hopes; and surely you cannot, will
		  <lb/>not, condemn me to protracted misery and disap­
		  <lb/>pointment.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Nothing in my power to grant,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>,
		<lb/>with emotion, <said>would I willingly deny to you.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And are not your hand and heart at your own
		  <lb/>disposal?</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>, with animation; <said>grant
		  <lb/>me these, dear <persName>Miriam</persName>, for these only can render
		  <lb/>me happy.</said></p>
	      <p><said>They can never, never be yours!</said> replied <persName>Mi­
		  <lb/>riam</persName>; and hastily withdrawing her hand, she co­
		<lb/>vered her eyes, and remained silent.</p>
	      <p><said>Have I been deceived?</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>, steadi­
		<lb/>ly regarding her pale cheek and quivering lip.
		<lb/><said>Oh no, I feel that you love me, <persName>Miriam</persName>, and no
		  <lb/>cruel interdiction shall ever separate us.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Leave me, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, mild­
		<lb/>ly, <said>I have not sought to deceive you; but it is
		  <lb/>enough to know that our fates can never be united.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And would you thus banish me from your pre­

	      <p><said>Would you reject my friendship, because you

		  <lb/>not our intercourse been hitherto more rational,
		  <lb/>more delightful, than it can ever be, when passions
		  <lb/>such as these agitate our interviews?</said></p>
	      <p><said>Hitherto I believed my tenderness returned,</said><lb/>said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>and indulged the hope, that a closer
		  <lb/>union would at length bind us to each other. Let
		  <lb/>me still indulge that hope, <persName>Miriam</persName>, however distant
		  <lb/>the day, allow me still to believe my constancy will
		  <lb/>be crowned with success, and I can patiently en­
		  <lb/>dure the tortures of suspense, and the agony of pro­

	      <p><said>It is impossible,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>deceive not

		  <lb/>a passion which my reason would condemn, and my
		  <lb/>duty could never sanction?</said></p>
	      <p><said>No, dearest <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>I am not
		  <lb/>so very selfish; but tell me why should your reason
		  <lb/>and your duty disapprove it? and what is this
		  <lb/>mighty obstacle to our love? can no sacrifice, no
		  <lb/>exertions of mine, remove it?</said></p>
	      <p><said>No, none which I can expect or desire from you,</said><lb/>said <persName>Miriam</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>Is it my religion alone?</said> pursued <persName>Atherton</persName>;
		<lb/><said>will your father blast all the opening prospects of
		  <lb/>my life, because my faith is different from his own?</said></p>
	      <p><said>Ask me not,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, rising with agita­
		<lb/>tion; <said>why should we prolong a conference so pain­
		  <lb/>ful to us both?</said></p>
	      <p><said>Stay yet a moment longer,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, ear­
		<lb/>nestly; <said>do not reject me, <persName>Miriam</persName>, till your father
		  <lb/>returns, and I can plead my cause to him. Tell
		  <lb/>me only, that if <emph>he</emph> does not reprove my wishes, <emph>you</emph>
		  <lb/>will listen to the pleadings of my love, and I may
		  <lb/>yet look forward to success and happiness.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You ask what I cannot, ought not to grant you,</said><lb/>replied <persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>and why should you increase the
		  <lb/>bitterness of disappointment, by vainly indulging
		  <lb/>hopes which can never be realized?</said></p>
	      <p><said>The cause exists in your own indifference,</said> said
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>, vehemently; <said>why should I seek farther
		  <lb/>for it? Every word you utter, is but a new proof
		  <lb/>that I deceived myself in believing you honoured
		  <lb/>me with your regard.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Is there no medium,</said> asked <persName>Miriam</persName>, with a
		<pb n="283"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="24(4)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">283</mw>
		<lb/>trembling voice, <said>between the extravagance of pas­
		  <lb/>sion, and the coldness of indifference? but I forgive
		  <lb/>your injustice, <persName>Atherton</persName>, in a moment of cooler rea­
		  <lb/>son you will feel that I do not deserve it; that I am
		  <lb/>not so ungrateful as you now believe me.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Miriam</persName> turned from him as she finished speak­
		<lb/>ing, and bent her head to conceal the tears which
		<lb/>filled her eyes; but <persName>Major Atherton</persName> again seized
		<lb/>her hand, and with all the inconsistency of passion,
		<lb/>exclaimed,—</p>
	      <p>
		<said><persName>Miriam</persName>, you cannot love me, or you would not
		  <lb/>yield thus calmly to the cold dictates of rigid duty;
		  <lb/>you would not banish me from your presence with­
		  <lb/>out one word of hope, one smile of encouragement!
		  <lb/>Dearest <persName>Miriam</persName>, I could endure every thing, were
		  <lb/>I only assured that you understood my feelings and
		  <lb/>shared the bitterness of my regret.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>At least, believe,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, mildly, <said>that
		  <lb/>you have excited many anxious thoughts, many
		  <lb/>emotions that I would fain avoid, by a display of
		  <lb/>impetuous and ungoverned feeling, which I had
		  <lb/>not expected from you; and pardon me, <persName>Major
		    <lb/>Atherton</persName>, which I must consider unbecoming your
		  <lb/>principles and character.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I cannot endure your reproaches, <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> re­
		<lb/>plied <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>if you do not love at least pity
		  <lb/>and forgive me. But what avails it?</said> he added, in
		<lb/>a tone of sadness; <said>and why should I still linger
		  <lb/>here? Forget this interview if possible, and think
		  <lb/>of me as you were wont to do, in the early days of
		  <lb/>our acquaintance; and now farewell, beloved <persName>Mi­

		    <lb/>riam</persName>! perhaps forever!</said> And he pressed her un­
		<lb/>resisting hand with fervour to his lips.</p>
	      <p><said>What mean you,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, with quick
		<lb/>alarm, <said>and whither are you going? surely you
		  <lb/>contemplate no rash enterprize?</said></p>
	      <p><said>I go from you,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>and where, it
		  <lb/>matters not; all places are henceforth alike to me.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Say not so,</said> replied <persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>but rather exert
		  <lb/>the firmness of your spirit and subdue a predilection,
		  <lb/>which it is your duty and interest to repress, and
		  <lb/>which must yield at length to the assuasive influ­
		  <lb/>ence of time.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Impossible! it never can,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>do
		  <lb/>not seek to move me from my purpose; do not,
		  <lb/><persName>Miriam</persName>, shake the feeble resolution I have struggled
		  <lb/>to acquire; here, I cannot remain with safety, and
		  <lb/>absence from you may perhaps render my disap­
		  <lb/>pointment less insupportable.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Go then,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, vainly endeavouring to
		<lb/>speak with composure; <said>and may God watch over
		  <lb/>you and protect you.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName> still held her hand with deep but silent
		<lb/>emotion; fearful to trust himself again to speak,
		<lb/>yet reluctant to tear himself from her presence;
		<lb/>when the sudden entrance of <persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName> aroused
		<lb/>him to immediate exertion. Too much agitated
		<lb/>however to enter into an explanation, which her
		<lb/>looks seemed to demand, he rushed hastily past
		<lb/>her, and in a moment was in the open air.</p>
	      <p>The evening was closing in, shrouded with clouds
		<lb/>and gloom; though some faint streaks of light
		<pb n="285"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="24(5)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">285</mw>
		<lb/>which lingered after the setting sun, seemed to give
		<lb/>promise of a brighter morrow. But <persName>Major Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName> felt this darkness far more congenial to his
		<lb/>feelings than the glare of day; and closely envel­
		<lb/>loped in his cloak, with even his face concealed
		<lb/>within its folds, he wandered on he knew not, cared
		<lb/>not whither, till found himself approaching the
		<lb/>sea-shore. <persName>Atherton</persName> threw back the cloak, and
		<lb/>looked earnestly upon the restless ocean: the mono­
		<lb/>tonous moaning of the waves as they broke upon
		<lb/>the pebbly beach, the whistling of the wind, and
		<lb/>the shrill cry of the sea-birds, as they swooped to
		<lb/>dip their wings in the watery element, and eddyed
		<lb/>around his head in returning to their craggy nests,
		<lb/>—dreary as were the sounds, they combined to fill
		<lb/>his mind with a melancholy, but soothing influence.
		<lb/>As he stood thus, his eyes were involuntarily at­
		<lb/>tracted by a small vessel lying at anchor, from
		<lb/>which proceeded the sounds of labour; and in the
		<lb/>imperfect twilight, he perceived several persons
		<lb/>busied at hatchways, while others were re­
		<lb/>pairing the masts, apparently in preparation for
		<lb/>an intended voyage. <persName>Atherton</persName> instantly recognised
		<lb/>the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> bark which had been some time
		<lb/>in the harbour; and prompted by a sudden resolu­
		<lb/>tion, he sprang upon a projecting rock and leaped
		<lb/>from crag to crag, till he came near enough to hail
		<lb/>those on board. He was answered by a respec­
		<lb/>table looking man, who seemed to be the master,
		<lb/>and of him, <persName>Atherton</persName> enquired if <said>they were bound
		  <lb/>to the <placeName>Massachuestts Bay</placeName>?</said> and received a civil
		<lb/>reply in the affirmative.</p>

	      <p><said>And how soon do you intend to sail?</said> pursued
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>.</p>
	      <p>
		<said>To-morrow, if the wind is fair, and it seems to
		  <lb/>be turning about the right way.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Can you take a passenger with you, Master?</said><lb/>asked <persName>Atherton</persName>.</p>
	      <p><said>We have room and to spare,</said> replied the man,
		<lb/><said>if you can put up with our poor fare and accom­
		  <lb/>modations.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I care not for that, friend,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>,
		<lb/><said>and shall hold myself in readiness to depart with
		  <lb/>you.</said></p>
	      <p><said>We will get things in the best order possible;
		  <lb/>and the king can do no better,</said> said the man;
		<lb/><said>and God willing, we hope to clear out of port at
		  <lb/>an early hour.</said></p>
	      <p><said>The sooner the better,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>and I
		  <lb/>owe you thanks, master, for your readiness to
		  <lb/>oblige.</said></p>
	      <p>Considerably relieved by this unexpected arrange­
		<lb/>ment, <persName>Major Atherton</persName> hastened homewards; but
		<lb/>as he re-entered the house he had lately quitted
		<lb/>with such buoyant hopes, the mental change which
		<lb/>a few hours had produced, sensibly affected him;
		<lb/>and yielding to the excitement of his feelings, he
		<lb/>threw himself into a chair and covered his face
		<lb/>with his hands. <persName>Captain Standish</persName>, whom in the
		<lb/>agitation of the moment he had not observed, alone
		<lb/>occupied the apartment, and regarded his unusual
		<lb/>conduct with extreme surprise, not unmixed with
		<lb/>alarm.</p>
	      <p><said>Cousin <persName>Atherton</persName>,</said> he at length said, <said>are you
		  <pb n="287"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="24(6)r"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">287</mw>
		  <lb/>stark mad, or what in the name of wonder ails
		  <lb/>you?</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName> started at the sound of his voice; and
		<lb/>after struggling a moment to regain his firmness,
		<lb/>replied,—</p>
	      <p>
		<said>Excuse me, sir; but I did not see you; I could
		  <lb/>think of nothing but my own selfish regrets and
		  <lb/>disappointment.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>Speak out frankly, like a soldier, <persName>Edward</persName>,</said><lb/>returned the Captain; <said>I am more in the dark than
		  <lb/>ever; but I always thought you would get no good
		  <lb/>by going so often to <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, and taking such
		  <lb/>long walks in the night air.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I have indeed, met only with evil,</said> said <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName>, bitterly; <said>but who could have believed it exist­
		  <lb/>ed under so fair a form?</said></p>
	      <p><said>Ah! I begin to understand you,</said> returned the
		<lb/>Captain; <said>something about my rose-bud, I'll war­
		  <lb/>rant you; a love-quarrel perhaps; but it will soon
		  <lb/>be made up again, if I have any skills in smiles and
		  <lb/>blushes.</said></p>
	      <p><said>No, no,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, quickly; <said>I shall never
		  <lb/>see her more.</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>You will think better of that to-morrow, cousin
		  <lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>; and so bear up with a good heart, and
		  <lb/>remember girls are apt to mean more than they
		  <lb/>say, and sometimes say more than they mean.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>She does not, I know but too well,</said> replied
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>; and after a short pause, he added, <said>I
		  <lb/>wish not to withhold my confidence from you, sir;
		  <lb/>but allow me to be brief. She has slighted my love,
		  <pb n="288"/>
		  <milestone unit="sig" n="24(6)v"/>
		  <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">288</mw>
		  <lb/>rejected my hand, and what remains for me to
		  <lb/>seek or enjoy?</said></p>
	      <p>He walked across the room with hurried steps,
		<lb/>as he concluded; and the Captain, whose counte­
		<lb/>nance expressed a lively sympathy, took his hand
		<lb/>kindly, and said,—</p>
	      <p>
		<said>This must not be, <persName>Edward</persName>; depend upon it,
		  <lb/>there is some mistake, some foolish whim, perhaps;
		  <lb/>for <persName>Miriam</persName> may love to teaze as well as the rest
		  <lb/>of her giddy sex; but suffer me to speak with her,
		  <lb/>I can explain all, and it may yet be well with you.</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>It cannot be,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>she will not
		  <lb/>listen to you, neither can I suffer her to be per­
		  <lb/>suaded, if her heart is not interested to plead my
		  <lb/>cause. No, I would never endure to receive her
		  <lb/><emph>compassion</emph>, as a substitute for her love; and, if
		  <lb/>duty is the obstacle, I ought not, perhaps, to op­
		  <lb/>pose it. I thank you sir, for this,—for all your
		  <lb/>kindness to me; and think me not ungrateful;
		  <lb/>but, to-morrow, I must quit your hospitable roof
		  <lb/>for a season. At present, I should but burthen
		  <lb/>you with my society; and, in absence, I hope to
		  <lb/>subdue a weakness, which I blush to expose. Nay,
		  <lb/>seek not to dissuade me,</said> he added,—seeing the
		<lb/>Captain about to speak,—<said>and I must now beg
		  <lb/>permission to retire.</said></p>
	      <p><persName>Captain Standish</persName> offered no further remon­
		<lb/>strance, aware of its inefficacy, at the moment of
		<lb/>keen excitement; and hoping he would be disposed
		<lb/>to listen more favourably, after a night of repose
		<lb/>had in some degree soothed the irritation of his
		<lb/>feelings.</p>

	      <p><persName rend="case(smallcaps)">Captain Standish</persName>, on the following morning
		<lb/>renewed his arguments and entreaties; but they
		<lb/>proved equally ineffectual, as on the preceding
		<lb/>evening, to change the determination of <persName>Major
		  <lb/>Atherton</persName>, though he had recovered his usual self-
		<lb/>possession, and even a degree of his customary
		<lb/>cheerfulness. Pride, alone, would doubtless have
		<lb/>done much to sustain him under his disappoint­
		<lb/>ment; but in addition to this powerful aid, he in­
		<lb/>dulged a secret persuasion, that <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> was
		<lb/>actuated by duty, rather than inclination, in re­
		<lb/>jecting his suit; and with it the hope that time
		<lb/>would produce a change in her decision, which at
		<lb/>present he could not effect; and situated as she
		<lb/>was, particularly during her father's absence, he,
		<lb/>perhaps, ought not to attempt. A few hours of
		<lb/>cool reflection convinced him of the weakness and
		<lb/>folly of yielding to the impetuosity of his feelings;
		<lb/>and, happily, his mind had been early regulated
		<lb/>by principle and subjected to the government of
		<lb/>reason; while he possessed that elasticity of spirit,
		<lb/>which always rose with renewed energy from the
		<lb/>pressure of misfortune.</p>

	      <p><persName>Captain Standish</persName> was pleased to find that the
		<lb/>subject of his intended visit to the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>
		<lb/>interested the mind of <persName>Atherton</persName>, and readily con­
		<lb/>sulted with him, on the most probable means of
		<lb/>rendering it useful and agreeable; and also pre­
		<lb/>pared several letters, which would introduce him
		<lb/>to persons of distinction there. These brief pre­
		<lb/>liminaries being settled, <persName>Atherton</persName> bade farewell to
		<lb/>his kinsman, with the promise of returning as
		<lb/>soon as circumstances could permit; and making
		<lb/>a hasty call at the Governor's, as he proceeded on
		<lb/>his way, before the hour of noon he was wafted
		<lb/>from the harbour of <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>.</p>
	      <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> sighed as he looked back upon
		<lb/>the friendly shore he was quitting; and the drea­
		<lb/>riness of nature, the leafless trees, the stubble
		<lb/>fields, the hills embrowned by frost, and the val­
		<lb/>leys withered by the approach of winter, present­
		<lb/>ed a striking contrast to the same scene, as he
		<lb/>had first observed it, when in the luxuriance of
		<lb/>autumn, waving with the golden harvest, rich
		<lb/>with variegated foliage, refreshed by verdure, and
		<lb/>animated with flocks and herds. For a moment,
		<lb/>the gloomy analogy seemed applicable to the
		<lb/>change produced in his own feelings. But shaking
		<lb/>off such melancholy reflections, he turned his eyes
		<lb/>towards the <placeName>Blue Hills</placeName> of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, which
		<lb/>appeared to dilate, as they approached near and
		<lb/>nearer; and the clouds that rested on their sum­
		<lb/>mits gradually rolled away, unveiling their ma­
		<lb/>jestic proportions; and again the bewitching spi­
		<lb/>rit of adventure, the all-powerful charm of novelty,
		<pb n="291"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="25(2)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">291</mw>
		<lb/>took possession of his mind. The day, notwith­
		<lb/>standing, passed tediously away; the after part
		<lb/>of it became cloudy, and their course was impeded
		<lb/>by contrary winds; and chilled and weary, he re­
		<lb/>tired early to the birth allotted him.</p>
	      <p>As soon as <persName>Atherton</persName> awoke in the morning, he
		<lb/>hastened on deck, to note the progress they had
		<lb/>made; and with delighted surprise, found the ves­
		<lb/>sel just entering the harbour of <placeName>Boston</placeName>. So novel
		<lb/>and beautiful was the scene presented to his view,
		<lb/>that he could scarcely persuade himself, that he
		<lb/>was not suddenly transported to the regions of fairy-
		<lb/>land.</p>
	      <p>A slight fall of snow, which descended during
		<lb/>the night, had invested the earth with its fleecy
		<lb/>covering, and robed every object with a drapery
		<lb/>of dazzling white, finely contrasted to the brilliant
		<lb/>azure of the cloudless sky, and the deep green of
		<lb/>the ocean waves. The numerous islands, which
		<lb/>gem the waters of the Bay, all wore the same un­
		<lb/>sullied vestment, while each tree was tufted with
		<lb/>the wintry foliage, which wreathed the smallest
		<lb/>spray, and every slender shrub and clustering
		<lb/>vine trembled beneath the feathery burthen.</p>
	      <p>But, even while gazing, the glittering pageant
		<lb/>faded from the eye; the warm beams of the rising
		<lb/>sun spread, like a blush over the stainless surface;
		<lb/>and yielding to their influence, the delicate frost-
		<lb/>work melted from tree, shrub, and vine, and des­
		<lb/>cended in broken masses to the ground. As na­
		<lb/>ture threw off the fantastic dress she had assumed,
		<pb n="292"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="25(2)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">292</mw>
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName> was powerfully struck by the grandeur
		<lb/>of her form, and the endless variety of lineament
		<lb/>which characterises her, in a land where the mag­
		<lb/>nificent and the beautiful are blended, with such
		<lb/>exquisite and unrivalled skill. The vessel was
		<lb/>passing through the narrow channel, which forms
		<lb/>the entrance to the harbour, and then expands into
		<lb/>a deep and capacious basin; on the left, the <placeName>Blue
		  <lb/>Hills</placeName> were still visible, forming a part of the lofty
		<lb/>range, which rises gradually from the shores of
		<lb/>the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, almost encircling the coast,
		<lb/>and broken at intervals into deep ravines and ex­
		<lb/>tensive vallies, then almost in the untutored wild­
		<lb/>ness of nature;—where many a silver stream rol­
		<lb/>led its fertilizing waves, unmarked by any eye,
		<lb/>save that of the <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> hunter, and unimproved,
		<lb/>but by the industrious beaver, who erected his in­
		<lb/>genious habitation on its banks.</p>
	      <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> gazed with unwearied pleasure
		<lb/>on the boundless prospect; lovely and majestic in
		<lb/>its outlines, though the freshness and bloom of
		<lb/>summer were wanting to complete its attractions,
		<lb/>and clothe with verdure the undulating forests
		<lb/>and fruitful plains. Near him were the com­
		<lb/>manding heights of <placeName>Dorchester</placeName>, then unknown to
		<lb/>fame: more distant, the wood-crowned eminence
		<lb/>of <placeName>Noonantum</placeName>, where soon after, commenced the
		<lb/>missionary labours of the American Apostle, the
		<lb/>devoted <persName>Eliot</persName>, who there gathered around him the
		<lb/>red children of the forest, and instructed them in
		<lb/>the duties of religion and the arts of civilization:
		<pb n="293"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="25(3)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">293</mw>
		<lb/>nearer, again, arose the memorable summit of
		<lb/><placeName>Bunker Hill</placeName>, where the first laurels were plucked
		<lb/>to garland the brow of liberty; while far in the
		<lb/>northern horizon, like floating clouds, were visible
		<lb/>the stupendous mountains, which pervade the then
		<lb/>unexplored regions of <placeName>New-Hampshire</placeName>. Traces of
		<lb/>cultivation were apparent within this extensive
		<lb/>range; and that spirit of enterprise, which marked
		<lb/>the early settlers of <placeName>New-England</placeName>, and has never
		<lb/>deserted their descendants, was already observable
		<lb/>in the rapid improvements which their industry
		<lb/>had accomplished. In many places, the axe of
		<lb/>the adventurer had felled the trees of the wilder­
		<lb/>ness; and in their stead, appeared at intervals,
		<lb/>the clustering tenements, the mud-walled church,
		<lb/>and wooden palisade, denoting the foundation of a
		<lb/>town, or village, most of which have since risen
		<lb/>into wealth and importance.</p>
	      <p>But the attention of <persName>Atherton</persName> was confined to a
		<lb/>narrower circle, as they advanced into the harbour,
		<lb/>and swiftly glided on between the beautiful islands,
		<lb/>which it embraces. A few of these were still in a
		<lb/>state of nature; some were barren rocks, others
		<lb/>thinly wooded, and several partially cleared and
		<lb/>improved. One, called the <placeName rend="pre(‘)post(’)">Governor's Garden</placeName>,
		<lb/>and appropriated particularly to his use,—and which
		<lb/>is still in possession of the lineal descendants of
		<lb/>the first Governor of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>,—was ar­
		<lb/>ranged with considerable regularity and taste, and
		<lb/>prettily contrasted with the wildness of those

		<lb/>the mansion house of <persName>Mr. Maverick</persName>, well fortified
		<lb/>against hostile attack; and <placeName>Castle Island</placeName>, with its
		<lb/>fort and battlements, the crimson banner of royal­
		<lb/>ty floating from its walls, and the guards, in mili­
		<lb/>tary costume, pacing their rounds with measured
		<lb/>steps,—gave an air of spirit and vivacity to the
		<lb/>scene.</p>
	      <p><placeName>Boston</placeName>, the now admired and celebrated capital
		<lb/>of <placeName>New-England</placeName>,—then in its infancy, and present­
		<lb/>ing the appearance of an inconsiderable hamlet,—
		<lb/>burst upon the view, with that commanding gran­
		<lb/>deur and beauty of situation, which still distinguish
		<lb/>it; but almost in the rudeness of its native charms,
		<lb/>which have long since been exchanged for the
		<lb/>garniture of wealth, and the confusion of business
		<lb/>and pleasure. <persName>Major Atherton</persName> remarked every
		<lb/>object with interest; and though now accustomed
		<lb/>to the rural simplicity of American towns, the
		<lb/>local advantages and superiority of <placeName>Boston</placeName> over
		<lb/>any that he had yet seen, excited his admiration;
		<lb/>while his approach to it renewed the novel and
		<lb/>delightful sensations, which he felt, on first view­
		<lb/>ing the coast of <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>.</p>
	      <p>It was yet early in the morning, when the little
		<lb/>vessel anchored, not far from a cliff at the eastern
		<lb/>part of the town, which, with two sister hills, form­
		<lb/>ed a picturesque group, observable from a con­
		<lb/>siderable distance, and originally gave the name of
		<lb/><placeName rend="slant(italic)">Trimountain</placeName> to the place. But succeeding gene­
		<lb/>rations have nearly levelled them, and their site
		<lb/>is now covered with broad and paved streets, and
		<pb n="295"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="25(4)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">295</mw>
		<lb/>ornamented with the splendid mansions of the rich
		<lb/>and fashionable, and the costly edifices of public
		<lb/>munificence.</p>
	      <p><persName>Atherton</persName> gladly accepted the civilities of the
		<lb/>master of the boat, who offered to conduct him to
		<lb/>the only inn which <placeName>Boston</placeName> then contained; where
		<lb/>he found decent accommodations, and an apartment
		<lb/>which was at least cleanly, and entirely at his
		<lb/>own disposal. Having taken formal possession of
		<lb/>his new lodgings, <persName>Major Atherton</persName> ordered some
		<lb/>refreshments, of which he invited his guide to par­
		<lb/>take, whose decent manners and obliging conduct,
		<lb/>since they had been thrown together, he deemed
		<lb/>worthy of some attention. The invitation was ac­
		<lb/>cepted, with many apologies, by his humble com­
		<lb/>panion, who however seemed duly sensible of the
		<lb/>honour, and resolved to shew his gratitude, by
		<lb/>doing ample justice to the well-dressed viands set
		<lb/>before them, which to <persName>Atherton</persName> particularly, form­
		<lb/>ed a welcome contrast to the coarse provisions,
		<lb/>served up during their voyage. The table was
		<lb/>prepared in a room, apparently set apart for the
		<lb/>important business of eating and drinking; there
		<lb/>were in it oaken tables of every size, and benches
		<lb/>of divers lengths, suited to the number of guests;
		<lb/>and moreover, an abundance of wooden trenchers
		<lb/>and pewter pots, in readiness, at a moments warn­
		<lb/>ing, with all the apparatus, liable to be put in re­
		<lb/>quisition, by the imperious cravings of hunger or
		<lb/>thirst. But on this occasion, the landlord had
		<lb/>garnished the board with his choice service of shin­
		<pb n="296"/>

		<lb/>ing pewter; having previously received informa­
		<lb/>tion from the master, that <persName>Major Atherton</persName> was a
		<lb/>gentleman, and not sparing of his money; and,
		<lb/>withal, a kinsman of the <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> Captain. Yet
		<lb/>it behoves us to add that the good woman, who
		<lb/>ruled the household and himself, refused to deliver
		<lb/>up the platters, which she had cleaned with her
		<lb/>own hands, until, by peeping through a broad crack
		<lb/>in the partition, she received occular demonstration
		<lb/>that he was a genteel and comely youth:—from
		<lb/>which, we may infer, that even in the golden days
		<lb/>of puritanism, women would sometimes dispute the
		<lb/>commands of that nobler sex, to whom they owe
		<lb/>the most dutiful submission.</p>
	      <p>They were scarcely seated at table, when <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName> observed a man of peculiar appearance, saun­
		<lb/>tering past the half open door, and looking in upon
		<lb/>them, with suspicious curiosity. He was evidently
		<lb/>of the lower order, and his large gaunt figure was
		<lb/>rendered more ungainly by a total disregard to
		<lb/>the outward man, touching the manner of apparel.
		<lb/>His broad, turned up nose, and thick lips, which
		<lb/>seemed formed for vulgar good-nature, were drawn
		<lb/>down to the utmost limits that the longitude of his
		<lb/>face would admit, and contracted into an ascetic
		<lb/>expression, not at all relieved by the ungracious
		<lb/>leer of his greenish eyes, which stood forth like
		<lb/>the orbs of a beetle, and were surmounted by a
		<lb/>square build skull, clipped with the formal pre­
		<lb/>cision of self-complacent sanctity. Having passed
		<lb/>and repassed the door several times, he boldly
		<pb n="297"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="25(5)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">297</mw>
		<lb/>entered, and threw himself on a bench, with the
		<lb/>air of one who is conscious of possessing authori­
		<lb/>ty, which he is, nevertheless, somewhat afraid of
		<lb/>executing; and continued to regard <persName>Atherton</persName> and
		<lb/>his companion with immoveable gravity, noting,
		<lb/>with particular attention, whenever they raised the
		<lb/>cup to their lips.</p>
	      <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName>, for some time disregarded this
		<lb/>scrutiny; but as the stranger discovered no dis­
		<lb/>position to retire, he at length felt vexed with his
		<lb/>impertinent intrusion, and endeavoured to reprove
		<lb/>him, by a look of stern displeasure. For mo­
		<lb/>ment it proved successful; he twisted on the seat,
		<lb/>and with some violence, twirled between his fin­
		<lb/>gers a small baton which he carried; but as
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName> returned to his employment, in the belief,
		<lb/>that he had effected his object, the other also re­
		<lb/>sumed his dull gloomy composure, and again fixed
		<lb/>his eyes on them, in the most annoying manner.
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>, provoked in spite of himself, at the un­
		<lb/>mannerly inquisition, asked, in a tone of severity,</p>
	      <p>
		<said>Is there aught you would desire of me, Master,
		  <lb/>that you thus obtrude into my presence?</said>
	      </p>
	      <p><said>The godly rulers of our land,</said> replied the man,
		<lb/>with a slow, emphatic accent, <said>have raised up me,
		  <lb/>their unworthy servant, to execute their will; and,
		  <lb/>for this purpose have I now come hither.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And have they appointed you,</said> resumed <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName>, <said>to watch the motions of strangers, and thrust
		  <lb/>yourself upon them undesired?</said></p>
	      <p><said>Such is mine honourable employment,</said> returned

		<lb/>the other; <said>even to purge iniquity from the land,
		  <lb/>and preserve our city from pollution.</said></p>
	      <p><said>You have chosen a singular method to effect
		  <lb/>this salutary purpose,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>but I must
		  <lb/>beg you to explain it more at large to me.</said></p>
	      <p>With the manner of one who is about to com­
		<lb/>mence a homily, the stranger stretched out his hand
		<lb/>and replied,—</p>
	      <p>
		<said><quote rend="pre()post()">Who hath wo? who hath sorrow? who hath
		    <lb/>contentions? who hath redness of eyes? they that

	      </p>
	      <p><said>We are not among those <quote>that rise up early</quote>
		  <lb/>to <quote>follow strong drink;</quote></said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>;
		<lb/><said>and the suspicions you seem to entertain of us are
		  <lb/>quite unfounded; we can therefore spare you the
		  <lb/>trouble of further attendance here.</said></p>
	      <p><said>He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for
		  <lb/>it,</said> replied the other; <said>and therefore must mine
		  <lb/>own eyes be faithful witnesses in the things where­
		  <lb/>unto I am called.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Your lips would be the fitter vouchers in this
		  <lb/>instance,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, who began to feel his cu­
		<lb/>riosity excited by the singular character and em­
		<lb/>ployment of his new acquaintance; <said>and you need
		  <lb/>but taste of mine host's home-brewed ale, to be
		  <lb/>convinced he has paid due regard to the rules of
		  <lb/>sobriety in the admixture of its ingredients.</said></p>
	      <p>The stranger slowly waved his hand as if to
		<lb/>repel the temptation, and replied,—</p>

		<said><quote rend="pre()post()">Look not thou upon the wine when it is red,

	      </p>
	      <p><said>And by what authority,</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>are

	      <p><said>By the authority of those who are set as

		  <lb/>tion.</said></p>
	      <p><said>I am not disposed to dispute your office,</said> said

	      <p><said>In which case,</said> replied the constable, <said>the well-

		  <lb/>staff, which, like the rod that was borne by <persName>Aaron</persName>
		  <lb/>of old, is a just symbol of my power.</said></p>
	      <p><said>And in all cases, if I understand you rightly,</said><lb/>said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>you are constituted a judge over
		  <lb/>the heads and consciences of those who come here,

	      <p><said>It is even so,</said> replied the other, <said>touching the

		  <lb/>strangers who enter within our gates, and sit at

		  <lb/>freely, what in my discretion I may opine suffi­

	      <p><said>You must exercise a thankless office,</said> said

	      <p><said>I am commissioned to apprehend such offenders,

	      <p><said>You are witness that we have kept within the

	      <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> left the room as he finished
		<lb/>speaking, intending to walk out and view the

		<lb/>lost much of its placid expression, entered the
		<lb/>apartment still occupied by the constable, and in
		<lb/>no very soothing voice said to him,—</p>
	      <p>
		<said>Master Constable, you will not leave me a guest

	      <p><said>The Lord forbid I should seek to tempt you
		  <lb/>from your duty,</said> returned the landlord, in a con­
		<lb/>ciliatory tone; <said>yet, sure I am, friend, that you
		  <lb/>would not wish to deprive me of my lawful gains,
		  <lb/>not refuse to shew me kindness, which could not
		  <lb/>harm yourself.</said></p>
	      <p><said><quote rend="pre()post()">Ye cannot serve God and <name>mammon</name></quote>,</said> replied

		  <lb/>out lifting up my voice against it.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Now prithee, Master Constable,</said> returned the

		  <lb/>instruct me and you can in the needfulness of
		  <lb/>that?</said></p>
	      <p><said>Expound unto me first, if it please you,</said> said

	      <p><said>Methinks one of yours might suffice as well as

		  <lb/>no man can say that I have not honestly abided
		  <lb/>by the laws, albeit to the loss of my wordly
		  <lb/>profit.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Is not drunkenness lifting up its voice in our
		  <lb/>streets?</said> resumed the constable, striking the point
		<lb/>of his staff emphatically on the floor; <said>and did not
		  <lb/>your own brother, <persName>Richard Cole</persName>, drink at your
		  <lb/>tap till he changed himself into a brute? and was

	      <p><said>What sort of an uproar have we here?</said> ex­

	      <p><said>I wonder what you would do without us,

	      <p><said>Thine husband hath <quote rend="pre()post()">sold himself to do evil,</quote></said><lb/>replied the Constable, <said>therefore did fear come up­
		  <lb/>on him, when I lifted up my rod of justice.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Out upon your false tongue now,</said> returned the

	      <p><said>All who come hither can bear me witness, that

		<lb/><persName>Master Cole</persName>, venturing forward, encouraged by
		<lb/>the boldness of his help-mate, <said>and whosoever af­
		  <lb/>firmeth to the contrary, saith that which is false
		  <lb/>and not true.</said></p>
	      <p><said>Is it from a clear conscience, <persName>Master Cole</persName>, that
		  <lb/>you have held back the cup from the drunkard?</said><lb/>asked the Constable, <said>or from the fear of man, lest
		  <lb/>you should lose your employment, by disobeying
		  <lb/>those, who have appointed me to determine the mea­

	      <p><said>And is it not enough that you do that?</said> retorted

		  <lb/>likely that such an one should be given to strong
		  <lb/>drink?</said></p>
	      <p>
		<said>The high and low, <persName>dame Cole</persName>, are alike in the
		  <lb/>eye of the law and the gospel; neither is the rich

		  <lb/>not be so again while I am Mistress in this house.</said></p>
	      <p>She shook her hand with a menacing gesture as
		<lb/>she concluded; and seizing her spouse by the arm,
		<lb/>led him from the room, and closed the door with
		<lb/>some violence after her.</p>
	      <p><said>Mistress and Master too, I think;</said> muttered
		<lb/>the offended minister of the law, <said>but am not I
		  <lb/><persName>Jeremiah Handcuff</persName>, a Constable of this town of

		<lb/>on his hand, <said>and so I will keep fast to my duty,

	      <p>Thus finishing his soliloquy, the Constable walked
		<lb/>slowly from the house; but in passing through an
		<lb/>adjoining apartment, he again encountered the
		<lb/>landlady, who, with arms a-kimbo, stood directly
		<lb/>in his way, apparently resolved not to yield one
		<lb/>iota of her dignity, or her decorom. <persName>Master Hand­
		  <lb/>cuff</persName>, animated by the same accommodating spirit,
		<lb/>brushed hastily past her, and as he did so, knocked
		<lb/>her round-eared cap completely awry.</p>
	      <p><said>The Lord help us!</said> ejaculated the wrathful
		<lb/>dame, as she adjusted her head gear, <said>when some

	      <p><said>If you had kept out of his way, <persName>Deborah</persName>,</said> said

	      <lb/>settlement of <placeName>New-England</placeName>, more calculated to
	      <lb/>impress strangers with a just idea of the extreme
	      <lb/>strictness of its government and manners, than the
	      <lb/>rigid observance of the <name>sabbath</name> day, which was
	      <lb/>universal throughout every class of citizens. Fines
	      <lb/>and imprisonment awaited those who disregarded it.
	      <lb/>Every species of labour during its consecrated hours
	      <lb/>was considered sacrilegious, and the most distant ap­
	      <lb/>proach to levity,—almost to cheerfulness of conver­
	      <lb/>sation or behaviour,—reprehensible in the highest
	      <lb/>degree. It is even recorded of a worthy minister,
	      <lb/>that being led away by the suggestions of <persName>Satan</persName>, he
	      <lb/>was thereby tempted to kiss his wife while ar­
	      <lb/>ranging his bands in preparation for the pulpit;
	      <lb/>and was forthwith arraigned before a meeting of

	      <lb/>his church, and severely censured for the ungodly
	      <lb/>deed.</p>
	    <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName>, on arriving at <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, had
	      <lb/>been struck with this unusual respect for the insti­
	      <lb/>tutions of religion, so strongly contrasted with the
	      <lb/>practice in his native country; where the princi­
	      <lb/>ples of church government admitted greater licence,
	      <lb/>and were particularly liable to abuse during a
	      <lb/>reign, marked from its commencement by civil
	      <lb/>discord, and almost freed from those moral restraints
	      <lb/>which the unfortunate <persName>Charles</persName> might in happier
	      <lb/>times have suggested and enforced.</p>
	    <p>But in the <placeName>Massachusetts'</placeName> settlements this rigid
	      <lb/>discipline was even more remarkable than in the
	      <lb/>sister colony of <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>; and when <persName>Major Ather­
		<lb/>ton</persName> arose on the morning of the first <name>Sabbath</name> that
	      <lb/>he spent there, he was for some moments unable to
	      <lb/>account for the perfect quiet which reigned in every
	      <lb/>apartment; so different from the bustle and con­
	      <lb/>fusion commonly attendant on a public house. The
	      <lb/>hum of business was suspended, the tapster's room
	      <lb/>deserted by its daily visitants, and in the kitchen—
	      <lb/>the usual scene of bustling importance—the land­
	      <lb/>lord was quietly seated with his folio bible, and
	      <lb/>audibly perusing its sacred contents. He however
	      <lb/>occasioned no interruption to his worthy dame,
	      <lb/>who having ranged her children on a bench and
	      <lb/>commanded silence, proceeded in a still more adui­
	      <lb/>ble voice to catechise them, occasionally stopping
	      <lb/>to give a hearty shake to some luckless urchin who
	      <lb/>betrayed signs of heedlessness or stupidity, in

	      <lb/>order to stir up his mind by way of remembering
	      <lb/>the oft-repeated task. <persName>Atherton</persName> thought that even
	      <lb/>the cat moved round on tiptoe, and that the animals
	      <lb/>in the cow-yard lowed with unusual gravity. The
	      <lb/>same monotonous calm every where prevailed; no
	      <lb/>persons were visible at the windows of their dwell­
	      <lb/>ings or in the streets, until the customary hour of
	      <lb/>public devotion arrived, when the inhabitants of
	      <lb/>every description sallied forth, and proceeded to
	      <lb/>the place of worship.</p>
	    <p><placeName>Boston</placeName> at that time contained but one church,
	      <lb/>which stood not far from the spot now occupied by
	      <lb/>the old state-house, and was built with mud walls
	      <lb/>and covered by a thatched roof. Its interior cor­
	      <lb/>responded with the rude architecture of the outside;
	      <lb/>and the unadorned pulpit, the low benches, placed
	      <lb/>in rows to accommodate the <rs type="properAdjective">Puritan</rs> congregation,
	      <lb/>alone distinguished it as a place of worship. To
	      <lb/>this humble temple, where the Most High was
	      <lb/>adored perhaps with more fervour and sincerity
	      <lb/>than in the gorgeous cathedrals of the old world,
	      <lb/><persName>Atherton</persName> directed his steps, and reached the door
	      <lb/>at the moment the Governor and his retinue were
	      <lb/>entering.</p>
	    <p><persName>Mr.</persName>, afterwards <persName>Sir Henry Vane</persName>, who then held
	      <lb/>the office of chief magistrate, assumed a degree of
	      <lb/>state hitherto unknown in the colony, and which,
	      <lb/>though willingly conceded to his rank by many,
	      <lb/>became to others a subject of offence; and his ad­
	      <lb/>ministration, at first exceedingly popular, began
	      <lb/>shortly to fall into disrepute. The people were

	      <lb/>prejudiced in his favour by an appearance of sanc­
	      <lb/>tity unusual at his age, which did not exceed
	      <lb/>twenty-five; and by his strict conformity to the
	      <lb/>outward forms of the sect, which education and
	      <lb/>habit taught them to prize so highly. He was pre­
	      <lb/>ceded by four serjeants, bearing halberds; and <emph>his</emph>
	      <lb/>solemn deportment, sheared head, and plain attire,
	      <lb/>with <emph>their</emph> grave aspect and ordinary apparel, might
	      <lb/>have suggested the idea of an inquisitorial judge
	      <lb/>and his attendant ministers of justice, preparing to
	      <lb/>conduct the ceremonies of an <foreign xml:lang="es" rend="slant(italic)">auto-de-fe</foreign>. This as­
	      <lb/>sumption of dignity however, appeared to <persName>Ather­
		<lb/>ton</persName> almost ludicrous, considering the infancy of
	      <lb/>the colony, and the simplicity, not to say rudeness,
	      <lb/>of every thing appending to it, as well as incon­
	      <lb/>sistent with the contempt professed by all classes
	      <lb/>for outward show and parade, and which they
	      <lb/>carried to an excess in the ordinary concerns of
	      <lb/>life.</p>
	    <p><persName>Mr. Wilson</persName>, the first minister of <placeName>Boston</placeName>, was
	      <lb/>absent on that day, and the pulpit was supplied by
	      <lb/><persName>Mr. Cotton</persName>, his assistant; a man whose <quote>praise
		<lb/>was in all the churches,</quote> and whose name will
	      <lb/>always hold a distinguished place among the <placeName>New-
		<lb/>England</placeName> divines. Few perhaps, ever possessed so
	      <lb/>great an influence, both in ecclesiastical and civil
	      <lb/>affairs; his discourses often turned the tide of po­
	      <lb/>pular opinion, and soothed the irritation which at
	      <lb/>that time disturbed the tranquillity of church and
	      <lb/>state. His eminent piety, learning, and talents,
	      <lb/>insured him the highest deference of all classes;

	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">7</mw>
	      <lb/>and it was no ordinary mark of respect which induc­
	      <lb/>ed the founders of <placeName>Boston</placeName> to name the capital of their
	      <lb/>young colony after a town in <placeName>Lincolnshire</placeName>, then the
	      <lb/>field of his ministry, in the expectation that he would
	      <lb/>shortly come over and labour amongst them.</p>
	    <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> listened to him with delight; he
	      <lb/>was master of that persuasive eloquence which
	      <lb/>charms both the learned and unlettered; and his
	      <lb/>sermons, though calculated to instruct and edify
	      <lb/>even the meanest capacity, by their strength and
	      <lb/>originality gave pleasure to the most fastidious
	      <lb/>taste; and in spite of the many localities and per­
	      <lb/>sonal allusions which it was the fashion of the day
	      <lb/>to introduce into public discourses, they were so
	      <lb/>skilfully intermingled with the leading arguments
	      <lb/>and fundamental doctrines of <name>christianity</name>, that
	      <lb/>even a stranger could not complain that they were
	      <lb/>wearisome. The form of worship was similar to
	      <lb/>that established at <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, which the people of
	      <lb/><placeName>Boston</placeName> professed to follow; but <persName>Mr. Cotton</persName> had
	      <lb/>introduced some slight variations; and to him also
	      <lb/>they were indebted for a particular discipline and
	      <lb/>government of the churches from that time known
	      <lb/>by the name of <rs type="properAdjective">Congregational</rs>.</p>
	    <p><persName>Atherton</persName>, on returning to his lodgings found
	      <lb/>that among the duties of the <name>Sabbath</name>, fasting was
	      <lb/>not neglected; though his provident landlady had
	      <lb/>taken care to prepare a joint of meat on the pre­
	      <lb/>ceding day for his especial use, which was served
	      <lb/>up cold, and without ceremony; it being, as she
	      <lb/>remarked, <said>a sinful waste of holy time to be busied

		<lb/>about worldly concerns on that day of rest.</said> Her
	      <lb/>children, with each a slice of brown bread in their
	      <lb/>hands, kept peering at him from an inner apart­
	      <lb/>ment, with hungry and longing eyes; for the scru­
	      <lb/>pulous dame allowed none but her guests to eat of
	      <lb/>the fat of the land on the <name>Sabbath</name>, except when she
	      <lb/>saw fit herself to take toll, in returning the frag­
	      <lb/>ments to her cupboard. <persName>Atherton</persName> however, ob­
	      <lb/>serving a little girl with a finger in her mouth,
	      <lb/>and her head on one shoulder, advancing cautiously
	      <lb/>beyond what her brethren would venture, took her
	      <lb/>on his knee, and offered her a share of his envied
	      <lb/>portion. But afraid to disobey her mother, the
	      <lb/>child slid from his arms in silence, though not
	      <lb/>without securing a piece of the meat in her chubby
	      <lb/>hand, which she adroitly concealed under her apron,
	      <lb/>and ran off to devour in safety, behind a wooden
	      <lb/>paling without the door.</p>
	    <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> attended divine service again
	      <lb/>in the afternoon; and though still powerfully in­
	      <lb/>terested by the eloquence of the preacher, he could
	      <lb/>not entirely restrain his thoughts from wandering
	      <lb/>back to scenes which his present situation was
	      <lb/>particularly calculated to revive. It was about
	      <lb/>three months since he had first passed the threshhold
	      <lb/>of a <placeName>New-England</placeName> meeting-house, then, as now, a
	      <lb/>stranger, seeking repose of mind from change and
	      <lb/>variety; and unknown to almost every individual
	      <lb/>it contained. The image of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> natural­
	      <lb/>ly blended with these ideas; and even in memory,
	      <lb/>the tones of her voice as he had then heard them,
	      <pb n="009"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="2(3)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">9</mw>
	      <lb/>as they had since often been repeated, vibrated on
	      <lb/>every chord of his heart. But determined to repel
	      <lb/>these dangerous reminiscences, in which pleasure
	      <lb/>and pain were strangely intermingled, and which
	      <lb/>he felt it weakness to indulge, yet almost hopeless
	      <lb/>to subdue, he at length succeeded in fixing his mind
	      <lb/>on subjects connected with the time and place, and
	      <lb/>joined both heart and voice with the congregation,
	      <lb/>in their concluding <choice><sic>plalm</sic><corr>psalm</corr></choice>.</p>
	    <p>As soon as the assembly was dismissed, he dis­
	      <lb/>engaged himself from the crowd, and striking into
	      <lb/>a narrow bye-path followed its course till it
	      <lb/>brought him to the base of a wooded cliff which
	      <lb/>overhung the eastern bank of the <placeName>river Charles</placeName>.
	      <lb/>Beneath this cliff some of the early settlers of
	      <lb/><placeName>Plymouth</placeName> had moored their shallops, when sent
	      <lb/>thither on a trading and exploring voyage, and
	      <lb/>landed near that spot, amidst a country inhabited
	      <lb/>by savages, and then governed by the Squaw Sa­
	      <lb/>chem of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>. But the seat of <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs>
	      <lb/>empire since that time had undergone a rapid tran­
	      <lb/>sition; and as <persName>Atherton</persName> looked round from the sum­
	      <lb/>mit of the hill, scarcely a vestige of the native in­
	      <lb/>habitants remained throughout the Peninsula:
	      <lb/>Step by step they were still retreating before the
	      <lb/>advance of civilization, and resigning their terri­
	      <lb/>tories to the white people, who regarded them with
	      <lb/>distrust and jealousy; and sometimes it is to be
	      <lb/>feared added oppression and injustice to dislike.</p>
	    <p>On the opposite side of the river stood <placeName>Mishaw­
		<lb/>um</placeName>, called by the <name>English</name> <placeName>Charlestown</placeName>; and re­

	      <lb/>cently occupied by a powerful tribe of <name>Aborigines</name>,
	      <lb/>who had also shrunk back as the wilderness was
	      <lb/>levelled before them, and the houses of the <rs type="properAdjective">Euro­
		<lb/>pean</rs> planters arose on the ashes of their humble
	      <lb/>wigwams. This neck of land stretching between
	      <lb/>the rivers <placeName>Mystic</placeName> and <placeName>Charles</placeName>, was as yet but
	      <lb/>thinly peopled, although one of the oldest settle­

	      <lb/>of policy or convenience, which induced the first
	      <lb/>settlers to separate at an early period, and form
	      <lb/>themselves into different societies, and establish
	      <lb/>numerous towns; though it perhaps more effectu­
	      <lb/>ally spread the arts of cultivation, prevented the
	      <lb/>rapid growth of any particular place; and <placeName>Boston</placeName>
	      <lb/>itself, even then, considered the metropolis, did not
	      <lb/>contain more than twenty dwelling-houses.</p>
	    <p>Still as <persName>Atherton</persName> looked round and remarked
	      <lb/>with wonder the progress which had been made,
	      <lb/>within a few brief years, he could not fail to regard
	      <lb/>it as a presage of future prosperity to the land,
	      <lb/>which nature had so highly blessed, and even in
	      <lb/>infancy stamped with the features of a great and
	      <lb/>powerful nation. In musings of the past and fu­
	      <lb/>ture he forgot the lapse of time, till warned by the
	      <lb/>declining sun, which glanced brightly on the wind­
	      <lb/>ing stream, then nearly encrusted with ice, except
	      <lb/>where the force of the current had broken a passage
	      <lb/>towards its entrance into the ocean. <persName>Atherton</persName> de­
	      <lb/>scended the hill, and pursued his way along the
	      <lb/>bank, ignorant where his steps were leading him,
	      <lb/>and often stopping as his eyes were attracted by
	      <pb n="011"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="2(4)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">11</mw>
	      <lb/>the fantastic figures formed by fragments of ice
	      <lb/>thrown up by the tide, and glittering with a thou­
	      <lb/>sand different hues, from the refracted rays of the sun.
	      <lb/>The river widening as it approached the sea, and
	      <lb/>gradually throwing off its frozen fetters, was dyed
	      <lb/>with a saffron tinge, and imaged on its glassy
	      <lb/>waves a stately range of trees which then fringed
	      <lb/>the western shorn, on the sight now improved as an
	      <lb/>important naval depot, from whence many of our
	      <lb/>gallant ships have ridden proudly forth to gather
	      <lb/>renown on the highway of nations, and returned
	      <lb/>laden with honour and victory.</p>
	    <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> had not proceeded far when he
	      <lb/>perceived the constable who had annoyed him so
	      <lb/>much the preceding day approaching him, with the
	      <lb/>same measured step, and examining him with that
	      <lb/>unmoved countenance and fixed stare which had
	      <lb/>then put his patience so severely to the test. He
	      <lb/>turned into another direction, and quickened his
	      <lb/>steps to avoid a conference; but his pursuer prov­
	      <lb/>ed more nimble-footed than his heavy appearance
	      <lb/>gave reason to expect; and accelerating his speed
	      <lb/>in proportion to <persName>Major Atherton's</persName>, he shortly came
	      <lb/>directly in contact with him. <persName>Atherton</persName> took no
	      <lb/>notice of him, and this silent disregard seemed for
	      <lb/>once to put the impenetrable constable to his <mcr>wits<choice><sic>,</sic><corr>'</corr></choice>
		<lb/>ends</mcr>. He hemmed thrice in the hope it would in­
	      <lb/>spire him with something with which to commence
	      <lb/>the conversation; but he was still unnoticed even
	      <lb/>by a look of recognition. As a dernier resource he
	      <lb/>stepped boldly up to <persName>Atherton</persName>, and taking hold of
	      <pb n="012"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="2(4)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">12</mw>
	      <lb/>his cloak addressed him, though with rather less
	      <lb/>than his ordinary assurance.</p>
	    <p>
	      <said><persName>Master Major Atherton</persName>, which I am informed
		<lb/>is your name and calling, I must make free to tell
		<lb/>you that I, <persName>Jeremiah Handcuff</persName>, am a constable in
		<lb/>this town of <placeName>Boston</placeName>.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>Of that I am already informed,</said> said <persName>Ather­
		<lb/>ton</persName>, withdrawing from his grasp with an air of
	      <lb/>dignity, which compelled the other to retreat some
	      <lb/>paces.</p>
	    <p><said>Very like,</said> he replied, after a moment's delibe­
	      <lb/>ration, <said>seeing that I am well known in mine of­
		<lb/>fice; and though it doth not become me to say it,
		<lb/>of approved fidelity in the performance of my
		<lb/>duty.</said></p>
	    <p>
	      <said>In that your works praise you, Master Consta­
		<lb/>ble; but bear in mind I pray you, that there is a
		<lb/>zeal which is not according to knowledge.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>Which I have also well considered,</said> returned
	      <lb/>the constable, <said>having been early instructed by my
		<lb/>mother in the sacred scriptures, and with her help
		<lb/>enabled to repeat the holy gospels, and divers oth­
		<lb/>er inspired passages of the Old and New Testa­
		<lb/>ment, even before I had attained unto my twentieth
		<lb/>year.</said></p>
	    <p><said>And did that knowledge recommend you to
		<lb/>your present situation?</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>.</p>
	    <p><said>Doubtless it was of weight in the minds of our
		<lb/>pious rulers,</said> he replied, <said>who promote unto honour
		<lb/>such only as obey the commandments of God and
		<lb/>the king; and renouncing the errors of prelacy,
		<pb n="013"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="2(5)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">13</mw>
		<lb/>walk honestly after the rules of the gospel, and
		<lb/>the instructions of our godly ministers.</said></p>
	    <p><persName>Atherton</persName> made no reply, but walked on still
	      <lb/>more rapidly, not a little vexed to observe the con­
	      <lb/>stable following at a brisk pace, until they came to
	      <lb/>a place where the road divided, when <persName>Atherton</persName>
	      <lb/>suddenly stopped, and turning to him said,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>Will you inform me, <persName>Master Handcuff</persName>, which
		<lb/>road you intend to take?</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>Whichsoever may best suit your inclination,</said><lb/>he replied, <said>seeing that it behoves me to follow
		<lb/>you whithersoever your steps may incline.</said></p>
	    <p><said>To what purpose, and by what authority,</said> ask­
	      <lb/>ed <persName>Atherton</persName>, indignantly, <said>do you thus presume to
		<lb/>watch and obtrude upon me?</said></p>
	    <p><said>Master Major,</said> returned the other, in a sooth­
	      <lb/>ing tone, <said>it would ill become me to give offence
		<lb/>unto a gentleman of honourable quality like your­
		<lb/>self; but since our magistrates have established
		<lb/>laws, and set up such persons as in their wisdom
		<lb/>they deem meet to execute them, is it right for me
		<lb/>to fall back like an unfaithful watchman? judge
		<lb/>ye betwixt thee and me?</said></p>
	    <p><said>Of what,</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>do you accuse me?
		<lb/>what law have I been guilty of violating?</said></p>
	    <p><said>It is written, <quote>thou shalt remember the <name>sabbath</name>
		  <lb/>day and keep it holy,</quote></said> returned the constable;
	      <lb/><said>and our rulers, for the furtherance of this divine
		<lb/>command, have been pleased to ordain fines and
		<lb/>punishments on such as are found guilty of a breach
		<lb/>in its observance.</said></p>
	    <pb n="014"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="2(5)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">14</mw>
	    <p><said>I am unconscious of having broken any law,
		<lb/>human or divine,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>and if I have,
		<lb/>you must have regulations for the observance of
		<lb/>this day, unknown to other <rs type="properAdjective">christian</rs> countries.</said></p>
	    <p>
	      <said>Truly our favoured nation hath cast off the <quote rend="pre()post()">un­
		  <lb/>profitable works of darkness</quote> which still cling unto
		<lb/>the worshippers of images, and the lovers of vain
		<lb/>ceremonies; and therefore refraineth from all those
		<lb/>sinful amusements which have proved <quote rend="pre()post()">a stumbling
		  <lb/>block unto many weak brethren.</quote></said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>Surely,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>the innocent recreation
		<lb/>of walking in a grave and orderly manner, is not
		<lb/>included in your list of offences!</said></p>
	    <p><said>It is a trespass on holy time,</said> returned the oth­
	      <lb/>er, <said>to be gadding abroad and seeking divertise­
		<lb/>ment by means which are not appointed on the
		<lb/>Lord's day; and the offender is to be dealt with ac­
		<lb/>cordingly.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I would recommend to your rulers,</said> said <persName>Ather­
		<lb/>ton</persName>, <said>to make their laws more public; for they are
		<lb/>too extraordinary to be remembered and understood
		<lb/>without much painful study.</said></p>
	    <p><said>They are written upon the hearts of this people,</said><lb/>said the constable, <said>and all others who reverence
		<lb/>this day aright, will be withholden from profaning
		<lb/>it.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Our ideas on that subject,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>may
		<lb/>differ essentially, and what you term profanation,
		<lb/>may to me seem perfectly harmless; but be that as
		<lb/>it will, my sojourn here has been so brief, that I do
		<pb n="015"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="2(6)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">15</mw>
		<lb/>not feel accountable for a slight breach of local re­
		<lb/>gulations of which I was entirely ignorant.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Nevertheless, that doth not discharge me from
		<lb/>my duty,</said> replied the pertinacious officer; <said>nor can
		<lb/>I suffer <quote>sin upon my brother,</quote> without incurring
		<lb/>reproach from those who, peradventure, would glad­
		<lb/>ly take occasion to deprive me of mine office, which
		<lb/>I make bold to say, I have maintained with credit
		<lb/>to myself and the town which I have served.</said></p>
	    <p>
	      <said>Doubtless, <persName>Master Handcuff</persName>, you have done to the
		<lb/>utmost of your abilities; but I would learn from you,
		<lb/>what penalty is exacted from those who are found
		<lb/>walking unnecessarily on the <name>Sunday</name>?</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>Say not <name>Sunday</name>,</said> replied the other, with a look
	      <lb/>of solemnity; <said>that being as our minister has in­
		<lb/>structed us, a superstitious and idolatrous word no
		<lb/>longer used by true <name>christians</name>; but the <name>Sabbath</name>, as
		<lb/>it was called by God's ancient people the <name>Jews</name>, and
		<lb/>also by the apostles; or the Lord's day,—so it is
		<lb/>termed by many of his precious servants in these
		<lb/>later times.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Be it so then,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, impatiently; <said>and
		<lb/>now have the goodness to answer my question.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Touching the penalty for profaning the <name>sabbath</name>
		<lb/>day, if I remember rightly,</said> returned the other, <said>it
		<lb/>is for the first offence a fine not exceeding ten shil­
		<lb/>lings; but if the offender persist in his transgres­
		<lb/>sion, he is given over to the stocks or the whipping
		<lb/>post, or house of correction, according to the dis­
		<lb/>cretion of the magistrates, whose <quote rend="pre()post()">eyes are con­
		  <lb/>tinually upon</quote> evil doers.</said></p>

	    <p><said>I thank you for your information,</said> said <persName>Ather­
		<lb/>ton</persName>, <said>which may prove of use to me hereafter; and
		<lb/>so wishing you but few offices of the kind to per­
		<lb/>form, I will bid you good night.</said></p>
	    <p><persName>Atherton</persName> passed on, and the constable stood ir­
	      <lb/>resolute, apparently loth to proceed to extremities;
	      <lb/>yet unwilling to appear slack in discharging his
	      <lb/>duties; but after a moment's hesitation he stepped
	      <lb/>briskly after <persName>Atherton</persName>, and elevating his black staff
	      <lb/>with an awkward attempt at dignity, he said,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>In the king's name, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, I make
		<lb/>bold to command you to stop.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><persName>Atherton</persName> did stop involuntarily; surprised and of­
	      <lb/>fended at the unexpected summons.</p>
	    <p><said>Wherefore is this continued rudeness?</said> he ask­
	      <lb/>ed. <said>I would advise you, Master, to retire in peace,
		<lb/>and suffer me to pursue my way unmolested.</said></p>
	    <p><said>There is no law which will uphold a man in re­
		<lb/>sisting lawful authority,</said> replied the constable, re­
	      <lb/>suming his customary and grave pertinacity of
	      <lb/>countenance and demeanour; <said>and seeing that I
		<lb/>have detected you in violating the laws of our land,
		<lb/>I would commend unto you, <persName>Master Atherton</persName>, to
		<lb/>pay the ordinary fine like an honourable gentleman;
		<lb/>and though it doth not become me to intermeddle
		<lb/>with <quote>filthy lucre</quote> on this holy day; yet I may not
		<lb/>suffer you to depart until I have your word for a
		<lb/>surety, that it shall be forthcoming at my future de­
		<lb/>mand.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I care not for the money,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>. <said>I
		<lb/>would willingly give thrice the sum for any worthy
		<pb n="017"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="3(1)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">17</mw>
		<lb/>purpose; but it shall not be extorted from me against
		<lb/>my will, and for a sin of ignorance.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Just as you please,</said> replied the constable, sul­
	      <lb/>lenly. <said>I know well where to look for help, if so
		<lb/>be I can't get it without; but I hope your honour
		<lb/>will not take offence at my walking behind you.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Not so long as you remain peaceable,</said> said <persName>Ath­
		<lb/>erton</persName>; <said>and for my further instruction, I would ask
		<lb/>you at what time your <placeName>Massachusetts'</placeName> <name>sabbath</name> is
		<lb/>said to begin and end?</said></p>
	    <p><said>Truly,</said> replied the other, <said>we are wont to lay
		<lb/>aside our worldly business at the setting of the sun
		<lb/>on the last day of the week, and we keep the time
		<lb/>holy until the same hour on the first day.</said></p>
	    <p><said>When you may again engage in worldly con­
		<lb/>cerns, if I understand you right,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>.</p>
	    <p><said>In a moderate degree it is deemed allowable,</said><lb/>he replied.</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>I think then, Master Constable, you have less
		<lb/>hold of me than you imagine; for if I am not mis­
		<lb/>taken, the sun was quite down before I had the good
		<lb/>fortune to meet with you.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>Perchance it was so,</said> returned the constable,
	      <lb/>somewhat disconcerted; <said>nevertheless, you have
		<lb/>been wandering over these fields and woods even
		<lb/>from the time of the breaking up of our devout as­
		<lb/>sembly.</said></p>
	    <p>
	      <said>And where were you, <persName>Master Handcuff</persName>, that you
		<lb/>could watch me for so long a time? have a care
		<lb/>that you do not turn culprit as well as informer.</said>
	    </p>

	      <lb/>er, <said>albeit, I am credibly informed of that which I
		<lb/>affirm.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I am little skilled in the law, especially on these
		<lb/>subjects,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>but I think you may as
		<lb/>well withhold your suit, friend, since you are like­
		<lb/>ly to gather nothing but trouble from it.</said></p>
	    <p><said>We shall see,</said> muttered the constable, slacken­
	      <lb/>ing his pace a little; and <persName>Atherton</persName>, resolved to break
	      <lb/>off the conference, redoubled his speed and soon
	      <lb/>reached his lodgings.</p>
	    <p>He had, however, scarcely closed the door of his
	      <lb/>own apartment, when the constable who had lei­
	      <lb/>surely followed him entered the common room, and
	      <lb/>threw himself doggedly on a bench. <persName>Mistress
	      <lb/>Cole</persName>, who was busily preparing the supper-table,
	      <lb/>and in whose memory his late indignity still rank­
	      <lb/>led, said to him in no very courtly tone,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>What brings you here again, <persName>Master Handcuff</persName>?
		<lb/>is it to stir up mischief betwixt my good-man and
		<lb/>his lodger?</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said><persName>Mistress Cole</persName>,</said> returned the constable, <said>my
		<lb/>peaceable disposition is well known; and therefore
		<lb/>I forgive your uncharitable surmise; I have also
		<lb/>other matters upon my mind, the which it will be
		<lb/>better to discuss with thy husband, seeing that
		<lb/>women have little knowledge of public affairs;
		<lb/>neither are they gifted with understanding to com­
		<lb/>prehend them.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Dear, now! Master,</said> said the dame, in a sooth­
	      <lb/>ing voice, <said>I can advise you better than my hus­
		<lb/>band, who always cometh to me for counsel in
		<pb n="019"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="3(2)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">19</mw>
		<lb/>matters of importance; and I think, <persName>Master Hand­
		  <lb/>cuff</persName>, it doth not become you to speak so lightly of
		<lb/>women who are created to be faithful helps unto
		<lb/>mankind.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Truly,</said> said the constable, <said>God hath made
		<lb/>all creatures suitable for their place and station;
		<lb/>and it is well that he hath not endowed women
		<lb/>with wisdom equal unto us; otherwise their subtle
		<lb/>and meddlesome nature would breed continual mis­
		<lb/>chief. But the matter of which I would speak,
		<lb/>concerneth your lodger; of whom I would bid you
		<lb/>take good heed; for I greatly fear he is a pre­
		<lb/>latist, and given to contemn our wholesome laws.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Wheugh man!</said> said the landlady, <said>you are
		<lb/>altogether mistaken; did he not go to our meeting
		<lb/>and hearken to the preachment of the word? and
		<lb/>did not mine own ears hear him sing the psalms,
		<lb/>with the congregation of God's people?</said></p>
	    <p><said>It may be so, dame,</said> returned the other; <said>but
		<lb/>who knows if he went not as a spy upon our actions,
		<lb/>to report unto the bishops and <name>romanists</name> of his own
		<lb/>country?</said></p>
	    <p><said>Fie, on your base supicions, Master constable,</said><lb/>returned the dame, sharply. <said>I will be bound his
		<lb/>handsome face was not given him to cover a black
		<lb/>heart; so I prythee, do not go for to infest my good­
		<lb/>man with any such like foolish notions.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Woman, thou art taken with his fair outside,</said><lb/>replied the constable; <said>has he not been wickedly
		<lb/>walking on this holy day? and has he not thereby
		<lb/>contemned the laws of this land?</said></p>

	      <lb/>to embarking from his native land, he was elected
	      <lb/>Governor of the future colony, by the unanimous
	      <lb/>voice of his associates; many of whom were <choice><sic>gen­<lb/>tleman</sic><corr>gen­<lb/>tlemen</corr></choice>
	       of high birth, and noble alliance as well
	      <lb/>as of distinguished piety and abilities. Ten years
	      <lb/>after the settlement of <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, these adventurers
	      <lb/>landed on the shores of the new world; already
	      <lb/>regarded by many intelligent and pious minds, as
	      <lb/>the favoured region where religion would at length

	      <lb/>find a peaceful asylum, from the storms of party
	      <lb/>spirit and intolerance, which had so long agitated
	      <lb/>the kingdoms of <placeName>Europe</placeName>.</p>
	    <p>Many circumstances render it doubtful whether
	      <lb/>the first company of settlers had actually seceded
	      <lb/>from <orgName>the church of <placeName>England</placeName></orgName> when they left that
	      <lb/>country; but however that may be, it is certain
	      <lb/>they immediately after entirely renounced its autho­
	      <lb/>rity and forms, and erected the platform of a new
	      <lb/>and independent church, essentially different in its
	      <lb/>government and principles. But in their solicitude
	      <lb/>to establish the interests of religion on a solid basis,
	      <lb/>and to promote a spirit of harmony, and create a
	      <lb/>bond of union in their worship, they resolved that
	      <lb/>it should be done in their own way, and according
	      <lb/>to their own ideas of right and wrong; and thus,
	      <lb/>like other fallible and erring mortals, who often
	      <lb/>mistake the means in their zeal to accomplish the
	      <lb/>ends, they exhibited a spirit of persecution, which
	      <lb/>has entailed a lasting reproach upon their memory.
	      <lb/>Scarcely absolved from the odious tenets and op­
	      <lb/>pressive thraldom of the mother church, they in
	      <lb/>turn erected an inquisitorial authority over the
	      <lb/>consciences of those, who presumed to differ from
	      <lb/>them in judgment and opinion;—leaving an exam­
	      <lb/>ple, which has been followed by too many of their
	      <lb/>posterity.</p>
	    <p>Yet we have reason to believe they erred with
	      <lb/>good intentions and upright hearts; and every can­
	      <lb/>did mind will find a ready excuse for their failings,
	      <lb/>in the excitement of the times, and the comparative

	      <lb/>darkness of the age in which they lived;—an ex­
	      <lb/>cuse inapplicable to those who indulge similar pre­
	      <lb/>judices and passions in this more enlightened period
	      <lb/>of the world; while the redeeming virtues so beau­
	      <lb/>tifully exemplified in their lives, must at least com­
	      <lb/>mand the reverence and admiration of all.</p>
	    <p><persName>Governor Winthrop</persName>, justly styled the father of
	      <lb/>the colony, possessed in an eminent degree, that
	      <lb/>rare union of talents and virtues, which fitted him
	      <lb/>for the station he was called to fill, and insured
	      <lb/>him the respect and affection of the people he
	      <lb/>governed. Yet his popularity, the prudence and
	      <lb/>moderation of his character, and the disinterested
	      <lb/>liberality which induced him to draw from his
	      <lb/>private fortune, to relieve the wants of individuals
	      <lb/>and advance the public interest, could not shield
	      <lb/>him from the arts of the jealous, and the cabals of
	      <lb/>the disaffected. Under various pretences, they had
	      <lb/>twice succeeded in procuring a vote against his
	      <lb/>election to the office of first magistrate; an office
	      <lb/>which he had held for several years with equal
	      <lb/>ability and wisdom.</p>
	    <p>At the time of <persName>Major Atherton's</persName> arrival in <placeName>Bos­
		<lb/>ton</placeName>, <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName> filled the station of deputy-
	      <lb/>governor, having yielded his claims a third time,
	      <lb/>and under circumstances particularly painful to a
	      <lb/>noble mind,—not to the wishes of the majority,
	      <lb/>for they were in his favour,—but to the artifice of
	      <lb/>a faction which had risen up against him, and
	      <lb/>effected their designs through that persevering and
	      <lb/>subtle intrigue, by which, in elective governments,

	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">24</mw>
	      <lb/>the minority are sometimes enabled to counteract
	      <lb/>the efforts of a rival party. Strange as it may
	      <lb/>appear, the proximate cause of this revolution was
	      <lb/>supposed to be a female, the noted <persName>Anna Hutchin­
		<lb/>son</persName>, whose religious opinions had acquired great
	      <lb/>influence in the country; and among whose adhe­
	      <lb/>rents were found the supporters of <persName>Mr. Vane</persName>, the
	      <lb/>successful candidate. It is however more probable
	      <lb/>that this ascendancy was produced by <persName>Henry Vane</persName>, 
	      <lb/>himself, assisted perhaps by the arts of <persName>Mrs. Hutch­
		<lb/>inson</persName>; for he had distinguished her by his atten­
	      <lb/>tions and zealously embraced her tenets, which
	      <lb/>were extremely obnoxious to <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>. The
	      <lb/>multitude were gained by the sanctity of his appear­
	      <lb/>ance, his specious manners and address; aided by
	      <lb/>superior abilities, great fluency of expression, and
	      <lb/>the attractions of exalted rank. His father held a
	      <lb/>high station in the court of <persName>Charles</persName>; and there was
	      <lb/>a general belief in <placeName>New-England</placeName>, that the younger
	      <lb/><persName>Vane</persName> was sent over by royal authority. These
	      <lb/>adventitious circumstances he improved to the ut­
	      <lb/>most; and by the exercise of a profound dissimu­
	      <lb/>lation,—a sort of Jesuitical cunning, he deceived
	      <lb/>the minds of many.</p>
	    <p>His election to the government of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>
	      <lb/>has ever been considered a blot on the character of
	      <lb/>the times; and it undoubtedly blew the sparks of
	      <lb/>contention into a flame, which all the prudence of
	      <lb/>his assistants and immediate successors was scarce­
	      <lb/>ly able to extinguish. The <rs type="properAdjective">christian</rs> forbearance
	      <lb/>and magnanimity of <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName> were nobly dis­
	      <pb n="025"/>

	      <lb/>played, in his readiness to accept an inferior office,
	      <lb/>under a man so much younger in years and expe­
	      <lb/>rience, and whom his judgment could not approve.
	      <lb/>Influenced solely by the public good, he laid aside
	      <lb/>all personal feelings and discharged his arduous
	      <lb/>duties with a fidelity and perseverance which in­
	      <lb/>creased his dignity, and recovered the esteem of
	      <lb/>those who had for a time withdrawn from him.
	      <lb/>Upright and conscientious in every relation of life,
	      <lb/>even those who differed from him in sentiments,
	      <lb/>could scarcely find a blemish to censure; and when
	      <lb/>one was summoned by the inveterate <persName>Archbishop
		<lb/>Laud</persName>, to speak against him before the king, his
	      <lb/>accusation proved a panegyric, and his Majesty
	      <lb/>expressed his concern that a person so worthy of
	      <lb/>trust and honour, should be no better accommodated
	      <lb/>than in an <rs type="properAdjective">American</rs> wilderness.</p>
	    <p>Something of this kind passed the mind of <persName>Ather­
		<lb/>ton</persName> as he approached <persName>Mr. Winthrop's</persName> house, which
	      <lb/>though commodious and respectable, seemed scarce­
	      <lb/>ly fitted to the dignified station and ample fortune
	      <lb/>which he enjoyed. But he afterwards learned to
	      <lb/>value this extreme simplicity as an instance of the
	      <lb/>self-denial which <persName>Governor Winthrop</persName> was accus­
	      <lb/>tomed to practise; for he had early discovered the
	      <lb/>necessity of economy and temperance, to the pros­
	      <lb/>perity of a feeble colony, and became an example of
	      <lb/>these virtues in his own person and family, though,
	      <lb/>at the same time the munificence and hospitality of
	      <lb/>his spirit were fully known and appreciated.</p>
	    <p><persName>Atherton</persName> found <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName> seated at a writ­
	      <pb n="026"/>

	      <lb/>ing table, with numerous papers spread before him,
	      <lb/>and still holding a pen, though engaged in earnest
	      <lb/>conversation with a man who stood beside him.
	      <lb/>There was an air of magisterial dignity, and even
	      <lb/>severity on his features, which instantly gave place
	      <lb/>to a smile of urbanity, as he rose to receive <persName>Major
		<lb/>Atherton</persName>, who immediately delivered the introduc­
	      <lb/>tory letter of <persName>Captain Standish</persName>. <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>,
	      <lb/>hastily glanced over the contents, and threw it by
	      <lb/>saying,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>Your arrival has just been made known to me,
		<lb/><persName>Major Atherton</persName>, and by one, who I fear has caus­
		<lb/>ed you some vexation since your entrance into this
		<lb/>land of strangers.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><persName>Atherton</persName>, who had been diligently studying the
	      <lb/>countenance of <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>, now followed the
	      <lb/>direction of his eyes, which were turned towards
	      <lb/>the man whom he had before scarcely noticed; and
	      <lb/>in whose gaunt figure, grim visage, and protube­
	      <lb/>rant eyes, he identified his late acquaintance, the
	      <lb/>persevering Constable. He looked even more
	      <lb/>gloomy than usual, and without moving a mus­
	      <lb/>cle of his face, continued standing as if resolved to
	      <lb/>await the conclusion of the conversation.</p>
	    <p><said>My ignorance of your laws, sir,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>,
	      <lb/><said>may have led me into a seeming contempt for
		<lb/>them; and if so, I am ready to make any conces­
		<lb/>sion which <emph>you</emph> may deem necessary.</said></p>
	    <p><said>We are lenient towards those who err through
		<lb/>ignorance,</said> replied <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>, <said>and in this in­
		<lb/>stance must ask <emph>you</emph> to pardon the indignity which
		<pb n="027"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="3(6)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">27</mw>
		<lb/>has been offered you, through <persName>Master Handcuff</persName>,
		<lb/>who is somewhat apt to carry his zeal to an ex­
		<lb/>treme.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Truly,</said> said the undaunted Constable, <said>it be­
		<lb/>cometh me to be <quote>zealously affected in a good
		  <lb/>cause;</quote> for what saith the scripture? <quote>because
		  <lb/>thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, there­
		  <lb/>fore will—</quote></said></p>
	    <p><said>Master Constable,</said> interrupted the magistrate,
	      <lb/><said>we now give you leave to retire; and in future
		<lb/>bear in mind, that we expect no one under our au­
		<lb/>thority, to transgress the laws himself, in a vain
		<lb/>pursuit after others whom he may chance to deem
		<lb/>worthy of reprehension.</said></p>
	    <p>The Constable looked rather crest-fallen at this
	      <lb/>reproof; but without offering a word in reply or
	      <lb/>defence, depressed his black staff of office, and
	      <lb/>bowing profoundly, left the room.</p>
	    <p><said>I am afraid,</said> said <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>, as the door
	      <lb/>closed after him, <said>you will begin to think, <persName>Major
		  <lb/>Atherton</persName>, that our enemies in <placeName>England</placeName> have some
		<lb/>grounds for the railing accusations they have
		<lb/>brought against us; since you have been so much
		<lb/>troubled from our regard to matters commonly con­
		<lb/>sidered of little moment.</said></p>
	    <p><said>If I had ever placed any reliance on their slan­
		<lb/>ders,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>my residence at <placeName>Ply­
		  <lb/>mouth</placeName> would have long since undeceived me; I
		<lb/>have become a sincere admirer of <placeName>New-England</placeName>
		<lb/>discipline, and truly wish that something equally
		<lb/>effective might be adopted to check the growing
		<lb/>licentiousness of my native land.</said></p>

	    <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">28</mw>
	    <p><said>The change must be radical,</said> said <persName>Mr. Win­
		<lb/>throp</persName>, <said>where the disease is of so long standing;
		<lb/>but the evils which you allude to have suggested a
		<lb/>useful lesson to the rulers of this Colony; and
		<lb/>though we do not wish to be over-scrupulous, yet
		<lb/>the world is so much more inclined to excess on the
		<lb/>side of error than of truth; that we conceive it in­
		<lb/>cumbent on those who are appointed to prepare
		<lb/>laws for the government of a new state, to render
		<lb/>them conformable to the spirit and letter of the
		<lb/>word of God. Yet even those are liable to abuse,
		<lb/>from the imprudence and want of judgment of
		<lb/>some who are appointed to execute them.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Were all men,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>as indefatigable
		<lb/>and undiscerning in their office, as the one who has
		<lb/>just quitted us, we should be less surprised at the
		<lb/>misrepresentations of the malicious and discon­
		<lb/>tented.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Those who choose to speak evil of us,</said> replied
	      <lb/><persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>, <said>do not lack either subjects or op­
		<lb/>portunities; and since the first planting of the
		<lb/>Colony, such as came hither from motives of am­
		<lb/>bition and interest, and were disappointed in their
		<lb/>schemes, or reproved for their evil deeds, have not
		<lb/>failed on their return to <placeName>England</placeName>, to use their en­
		<lb/>deavours to render our government and character
		<lb/>obnoxious.</said></p>
	    <p><said>There, sir, I believe, they have in general met
		<lb/>with deserved contempt,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>except
		<lb/>with those whose prejudices, or self-interest were
		<lb/>gratified by listening to such calumnies.</said></p>

	    <milestone unit="sig" n="4(1)r"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">29</mw>
	    <p><said>And those are not a few;</said> returned <persName>Mr. Win­
		<lb/>throp</persName>; <said>we have had to contend against public
		<lb/>opinion and private interest; against religious dog­
		<lb/>mas, and worldly prepossessions; but I trust, the
		<lb/>integrity of our conduct will at length put to si­
		<lb/>lence the reproaches of our adversaries. Our most
		<lb/>inveterate enemies are those, who have been them­
		<lb/>selves engaged in forming plantations, which from
		<lb/>the dissoluteness of the companies, soon fell to
		<lb/>ruin; and among these one <persName>Morton</persName> <quote>a pettyfog­
		  <lb/>ger of <placeName>Furnival's Inn</placeName>,</quote> who began a settlement,
		<lb/>with some others, at a place which they called
		<lb/><placeName>Mount Wollaston</placeName>, has never ceased to persecute
		<lb/>us.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Do you refer,</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>to the people
		<lb/>whose unprincipled conduct drew upon them the
		<lb/>vengeance of the natives, who demanded the death
		<lb/>of one who had been detected in stealing from
		<lb/>them; but, being a vigorous and useful man, they
		<lb/>were unwilling to lose him, and for a show of jus­
		<lb/>tice, or to satisfy their revenge, cheated even the
		<lb/>wary savages by hanging, in his stead, a bed-rid
		<lb/>and decrepid person?</said></p>
	    <p><said>You allude to a still earlier period of our his­
		<lb/>tory,</said> said <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>, <said>the people who resorted
		<lb/>to that ingenious expedient, which, with other mis­
		<lb/>demeanours, involved them in deserved calamities,
		<lb/>were associated with a <persName>Mr. Weston</persName>, and seated
		<lb/>themselves at <placeName><sic>Wesagusset</sic></placeName>, now called <placeName>Weymouth</placeName>.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I have heard the anecdote related at <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>,</said><mw type="vol" rend="align(left)indent(+1)case(allcaps)">Vol. II.</mw><mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">4</mw><pb n="030"/><milestone unit="sig" n="4(1)v"/><mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">30</mw><lb/>replied <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>and it is probably blended in
		<lb/>my mind with some other transaction of the kind.</said></p>
	    <p><said><persName>Morton's</persName> company was not a whit better,</said> said
	      <lb/><persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>, <said><persName>Captain Wollaston</persName>, their leader,
		<lb/>retired to <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, and the others led on by <persName>Mor­
		  <lb/>ton</persName>, set up for liberty and equality, named the place
		<lb/><placeName>Merry Mount</placeName>, and committed every kind of excess.
		<lb/><persName>Mr. Endicot</persName>, then recently arrived at <placeName>Salem</placeName>, visit­
		<lb/>ed them to reprove their folly, and cut down a May
		<lb/>pole which they had erected; but they soon return­
		<lb/>ed to their former courses, and the various settle­
		<lb/>ments uniting with <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, at that time the
		<lb/>most powerful, your gallant kinsman, <persName>Captain
		  <lb/>Standish</persName>, with a few brave men were sent to them,
		<lb/>and on their refusing to surrender, the Captain
		<lb/>with his usual decision, took them prisoners and
		<lb/>had them all conveyed back to <placeName>England</placeName>.</said></p>
	    <p><said>A mortification, sufficiently severe to silence
		<lb/>them, I should think,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>and ensure
		<lb/>their good behaviour in the future.</said></p>
	    <p><said>They were dealt with very lightly by the
		<lb/>council in <placeName>England</placeName>,</said> replied <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>, <said>and
		<lb/><persName>Morton</persName> has since returned to this country and
		<lb/>now dwells at <placeName>Pascataqua</placeName>, where he sill exer­
		<lb/>cises the mean revenge of disturbing our peace as
		<lb/>much as lies in his power.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Those two plantations are anomalies in the 
		<lb/>history of <placeName>New-England</placeName>,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>the only
		<lb/>ones which have yet cast a blemish on its annals;
		<lb/>and it is easy to imagine the grief and anxiety,
		<lb/>which their settlement and progress must have
		<lb/>caused their more serious neighbours.</said></p>

	    <p><said>It is well for the country that they were so
		<lb/>speedily ended,</said> said <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>; <said>for the con­
		<lb/>tagion of their example was greatly to be dreaded.
		<lb/>But it is a satisfaction to reflect that no other co­
		<lb/>lonies have been founded here, which had merely
		<lb/><choice><sic>wordly</sic><corr>worldly</corr></choice> gain and pleasure for the object. In
		<lb/>every other, we have reason to believe that reli­
		<lb/>gion, if not the moving cause, was at least deeply
		<lb/>considered; and indeed, no other principle seems
		<lb/>sufficiently powerful to enable men, and even deli­
		<lb/>cate and timid women, to struggle with hard­
		<lb/>ships and endure and persevere with such heroic
		<lb/>fortitude.</said></p>
	    <p><said>It is in circumstances of difficulty and distress,</said><lb/>replied <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>that the female character dis­
		<lb/>plays itself with peculiar loveliness; and man,
		<lb/>with all his boasted firmness and superiority, will
		<lb/>often sink beneath the weight of trials, which the
		<lb/>unrepining constancy and unyielding patience of
		<lb/>woman enables her to overcome.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I have seen instances of this,</said> returned <persName>Mr.
		<lb/>Winthrop</persName>, <said>which might silence the sarcasms
		<lb/>of the cynic, and the jests of the profligate, who
		<lb/>have ever shewn their spleen and emptiness, by
		<lb/>ridiculing those whose excellence they are too sel­
		<lb/>fish to imitate and too proud to acknowledge; and
		<lb/>scarcely do I think, that our labours in this wild­
		<lb/>erness would have been so greatly prospered, but
		<lb/>for the encouraging smiles of women, whose cheer­
		<lb/>ful spirits were buoyant, even in the midst of

		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">32</mw>
		<lb/>danger and distress, and whose undaunted minds,
		<lb/>imparted strength and resolution to the weary and
		<lb/>faint in heart.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I doubt it not, sir,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>and
		<lb/>those refined and exalted virtues, which might
		<lb/>have slumbered in the waveless calm of prosperity,
		<lb/>have here unfolded into beauty and perfection.
		<lb/>All that I have seen, every affecting incident which
		<lb/>I have heard, since I reached these shores,
		<lb/>has increased my reverence and admiration for
		<lb/>that gentle sex, to whom we are indebted for so
		<lb/>many bright examples, who are often our guides,
		<lb/>as well as pleasant companions, while travel­
		<lb/>ling together through this pilgrimage of life.</said></p>
	    <p><persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName> smiled at the enthusiasm of his
	      <lb/>countenance and manner.</p>
	    <p><said>I am too sensible,</said> he replied, <said>of the justice
		<lb/>of your encomium to attribute it to the gallantry
		<lb/>of a young man and a soldier; and I believe the
		<lb/>most sceptical would become converts to our opi­

		<lb/>they witness, as I have done, the equanimity and
		<lb/>resolution so often exhibited in the female charac­
		<lb/>ter. Even while quitting forever, the country en­
		<lb/>deared to them by every tie of affection,—to many
		<lb/>the abode of distinguished wealth and enjoyment,—
		<lb/>and about to encounter the dangers of the ocean,
		<lb/>and seek a place of residence in an uncivilized,
		<lb/>almost unknown world,—their constancy remained
		<lb/>unshaken, they had <quote>counted the cost,</quote> and were
		<lb/>resolved to meet every event without repining.</said></p>

		<lb/>wants and submitted to the privations which they
		<lb/>were destined to encounter in this distant land;—
		<lb/>adding lustre to their rank by the cheerful resig­
		<lb/>nation with which they suffered adversity, and the
		<lb/>graceful sweetness and condescension of their car­
		<lb/>riage towards those, whom Providence had placed
		<lb/>in an inferior station, but whom a common cause
		<lb/>had united with them in the bands of christian
		<lb/>fellowship.</said></p>
	    <p><said>The circumstance of their quitting <placeName>England</placeName>,</said><lb/>said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>was familiar to me at the time;
		<lb/>and I well remember it, as an occurrence, which
		<lb/>was generally considered imprudent and hazardous
		<lb/>in the extreme.</said></p>
	    <p><said>With those who are accustomed to connect
		<lb/>passing events with the things of this world only,</said><lb/>said <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>, <said>that opinion must still pre­
		<lb/>vail; and the result has, in some degree, justified
		<lb/>their prediction. The <persName>Lady Arabella</persName>, who was
		<lb/>united to <persName>Mr. Johnson</persName> one of our assistants, a
		<lb/>man of piety and worth, fell an early victim to
		<lb/>the hardships of her situation, and was shortly
		<lb/>followed to the grave by her afflicted partner.
		<lb/>Her sister the <persName>Lady Susan</persName>, who with her husband
		<lb/>and children arrived at a later period, is now re­
		<lb/>siding at <placeName>Saugus</placeName>: she enjoys a vigorous constitu­
		<lb/>tion and is happily supported under the fatigues
		<lb/>and difficulties, which proved fatal to so many of
		<lb/>the early colonists. But you must pardon me,
		<lb/><persName>Major Atherton</persName>, if I have trespassed on your pa­
		<lb/>tience; every circumstance relating to the cha­
		<pb n="035"/>

		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">35</mw>
		<lb/>racters I have loved and revered, and every inci­
		<lb/>dent that has transpired in this country, which I
		<lb/>have seen dawning and rising into light, and
		<lb/>where my affections are now wholly fixed, are so
		<lb/>interesting to my feelings, that I am sometimes
		<lb/>apt to dwell too long upon them, and forget that
		<lb/>to strangers they may be totally indifferent.</said></p>
	    <p><said>They are not so to me,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>I can
		<lb/>never listen but with pleasure to aught that relates
		<lb/>to this country, where I have been received with
		<lb/>a degree of kindness and hospitality entirely unex­
		<lb/>pected, but which I shall ever remember with sa­
		<lb/>tisfaction, and number the months I have past here
		<lb/>among the happiest of my life.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I had scarcely expected,</said> said <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>,
	      <lb/><said>that the strictness of our customs and manners
		<lb/>would be regarded with so much liberality by a
		<lb/>stranger, and one too, who has been accustomed to
		<lb/>the freedom of a camp. I must begin to think we
		<lb/>are less gloomy than our opposers are willing to
		<lb/>allow, or perhaps I should attribute it to the can­
		<lb/>dour of your mind, which is inclined to colour our
		<lb/><placeName>New-England</placeName> scenes as agreeably as possible.</said></p>
	    <p><said>My early prejudices are enlisted in your favour,</said><lb/>returned <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>and I am here continually re­
		<lb/>minded of scenes dear to my recollection, by the
		<lb/>simplicity of manners and rectitude of principle of
		<lb/>those around me, so congenial to the sentiments
		<lb/>which my mother cherished, and endeavoured to in­
		<lb/>stil into my youthful mind; though I must acknow­
		<lb/>ledge I have been almost estranged from them since
		<pb n="036"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="4(4)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">36</mw>
		<lb/>I first quitted my paternal roof, and engaged in the
		<lb/>active duties of my profession.</said></p>
	    <p><said>As you have retained this predeliction,</said> said
	      <lb/><persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>, <said>even amidst the bustle and gaiety
		<lb/>of a military life, we may hope it will be strength­
		<lb/>ened by a more familiar acquaintance with our opi­
		<lb/>nions and pursuits, which, although they may pre­
		<lb/>sent little to dazzle the fancy, I trust will leave
		<lb/>much food for solid reflection, and that heartfelt sa­
		<lb/>tisfaction which can never be derived from the vain
		<lb/>and gaudy pleasures of the world.</said></p>
	    <p><said>My sentiments have been from childhood divid­
		<lb/>ed on these subjects,</said> replied <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>and the
		<lb/>habitual respect and reverence which I have ever
		<lb/>felt for my mother's creed, has often weighed hea­
		<lb/>vily against the force of education and the strength
		<lb/>of hereditary opinion, which attached me to my fa­
		<lb/>ther's principles. But I ought to apologize to you,
		<lb/>sir, for so long intruding on your time; I was
		<lb/>not aware that the moments flew so swiftly.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I have passed them too agreeably to mark their
		<lb/>flight,</said> returned <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>; <said>and I would urge
		<lb/>you to tarry longer, did not some necessary busi­
		<lb/>ness require my attention. I use no ceremony with
		<lb/>you, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, but it would give me real
		<lb/>pleasure if you would consent to make my house
		<lb/>your home during your residence in this place.</said></p>
	    <p><persName>Atherton</persName> declined his hospitality, being unwil­
	      <lb/>ling to intrude, and wishing to have his time en­
	      <lb/>tirely at his own disposal; and with suitable ac­
	      <lb/>knowledgements of his polite attention, he took leave

	      <lb/>of <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>, after promising to dine with him
	      <lb/>on the following day.</p>
	    <p>Passing slowly onward, and irresolute whether
	      <lb/>to proceed to <persName>Governor Vane's</persName>, or wait another op­
	      <lb/>portunity, <persName>Major Atherton's</persName> curiosity was attract­
	      <lb/>ed by a small enclosure, which seemed a repository
	      <lb/>for the dead; and with the conversation of <persName>Mr.
		<lb/>Winthrop</persName> still vivid in his memory, he passed the
	      <lb/>slight paling which surrounded it, in the expectation
	      <lb/>of finding some memento of the ill-fated <persName>lady Arabel­
		<lb/>la</persName>. Numerous swelling mounds, some marked by
	      <lb/>a rude stone bearing a name and date, or inscrip­
	      <lb/>tive line engraved by the hand of affection, gave
	      <lb/>evidence that numbers had been called from their
	      <lb/>earthly labours within the brief space of time
	      <lb/>which had succeeded the settlement of the colony.
	      <lb/>But he looked in vain for the object which chiefly
	      <lb/>interested him. The remains of the noble daugh­
	      <lb/>ter of the <persName>Earl of <placeName>Lincoln</placeName></persName> had been interred at <placeName>Sa­
		<lb/>lem</placeName>, where she expired soon after her arrival, in 
	      <lb/>the midst of usefulness and the bloom of youth, be­
	      <lb/>fore the accomplishment of those plans which had
	      <lb/>cost so dear a sacrifice, and while yet destitute al­
	      <lb/>most of a shelter, and but scantily supplied with the
	      <lb/>comforts and necessaries which her situation ren­
	      <lb/>dered indispensable. Her husband removed to <placeName>Bos­
		<lb/>ton</placeName>; but worn out by fatigue and sorrow for her
	      <lb/>loss, he survived her a few weeks only, and was
	      <lb/>buried in a portion of his own grounds,—now bor­
	      <lb/>dered by <placeName>Tremont-street</placeName>, and contiguous to the
	      <lb/><placeName>Stone Chapel</placeName>. Such was the veneration in which
	      <pb n="038"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="4(5)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">38</mw>
	      <lb/>his character was held, that others desired to be laid
	      <lb/>beside him; and the spot thus consecrated by the
	      <lb/>ashes of the <name>christian</name> and the patriot, is to this day
	      <lb/>preserved as a receptacle for the dead; and while
	      <lb/>succeeding generations are gathering around him,
	      <lb/>the remembrance of his name and virtues are also
	      <lb/>fading from the records of time.</p>
	    <p><persName>Atherton</persName> turned from the place filled with me­
	      <lb/>lancholy reflections, and was still indulging a mo­
	      <lb/>ralizing mood, when he reached the residence of
	      <lb/><persName>Mr. Vane</persName>. The house of the chief magistrate was
	      <lb/>of small dimensions, and rather suited to the strict­
	      <lb/>ness of his principles and his rigid conformity to
	      <lb/>the prevailing manners of a sect, than to the digni­
	      <lb/>ty of his rank and office. It was situated in a beau­
	      <lb/>tifully secluded spot, then commanding a fine view
	      <lb/>of the harbour and islands, and sheltered by a hill
	      <lb/>which has since been levelled to promote the ob­
	      <lb/>jects of public utility, ornament and convenience.
	      <lb/>It was afterwards enlarged and occupied by the ce­
	      <lb/>lebrated <persName>Mr. Cotton</persName>, to whom <persName>Mr. Vane</persName> presented
	      <lb/>it on returning to <placeName>England</placeName>.</p>
	    <p>The Governor received <persName>Major Atherton</persName> with
	      <lb/>marked politeness; indeed there was an appear­
	      <lb/>ance of frankness and affability in his manners,
	      <lb/>which invited confidence and regard, and which
	      <lb/>united to a gravity of countenance and deportment,
	      <lb/>particularly agreeable to a people jealous of their
	      <lb/>peculiar forms, had gained for him an extent of
	      <lb/>popularity which he evidently prized, though anxi­
	      <lb/>ous to appear utterly indifferent to it. To <persName>Ather­
		<pb n="039"/>

		<lb/>ton</persName>, this rare union of qualities so seldom attained,
	      <lb/>even at a maturer age, appeared almost unnatural
	      <lb/>in one so young, and whose station and connexions
	      <lb/>had early brought him within the sphere of a dissi­
	      <lb/>pated court. Though compelled to admire the ver­
	      <lb/>satility of his talents, the intelligence and acuteness
	      <lb/>of his remarks, <persName>Atherton</persName> could not but admit the
	      <lb/>belief, that latent ambition and worldly policy had
	      <lb/>induced him to assume a character foreign to his
	      <lb/>real disposition and feelings. But <persName>Mr. Vane</persName> pos­
	      <lb/>sessed, in an eminent degree, the art of adapting
	      <lb/>his conversation to the taste and circumstances of
	      <lb/>those with whom he associated; and on this occa­
	      <lb/>sion he thought proper to divest his discourse of
	      <lb/>that peculiar phraseology and sectarian cant which
	      <lb/>he had always at command, and often used to ad­
	      <lb/>vantage. In discussing the political events of <placeName>En­
		<lb/>gland</placeName>, and alluding to scenes and persons familiar
	      <lb/>both to himself and <persName>Atherton</persName>, the latter became in­
	      <lb/>sensibly weaned from the prejudice he had uncon­
	      <lb/>sciously imbibed, and engaged with spirit in a con­
	      <lb/>versation which seemed once more to place him on
	      <lb/>the stage of active life. He had never till now,
	      <lb/>since his residence in <placeName>America</placeName>, met with any one
	      <lb/>whose recent and personal observation interested
	      <lb/>him in the passing occurrences and leading charac­
	      <lb/>ters of his native land; and the subject became so
	      <lb/>pleasing to him,—awakened so many dormant feel­
	      <lb/>ings, and so powerfully renewed the schemes of
	      <lb/>usefulness and enjoyment, which had of late been
	      <lb/>interrupted by a more absorbing passion,—that he
	      <pb n="040"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="4(6)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">40</mw>
	      <lb/>retired with reluctance when politeness compelled
	      <lb/>him to conclude his interview with the Governor.</p>
	    <p>The day terminated in a snow-storm, the most
	      <lb/>severe that <persName>Major Atherton</persName> had ever witnessed;
	      <lb/>and, during its continuance, he had ample leisure
	      <lb/>to indulge the feelings which had been called into
	      <lb/>exercise by the events of the morning, and to form
	      <lb/>many resolutions, the execution of which, was how­
	      <lb/>ever left to the mercy of circumstances. His first
	      <lb/>determination was to return to <placeName>England</placeName> early in
	      <lb/>the ensuing summer,—there to engage in some pur­
	      <lb/>suits which might obliterate the mortifying disap­
	      <lb/>pointment which still rankled in his mind, and
	      <lb/>again attach him to the ordinary pleasures and
	      <lb/>cares of the world. <said>I shall weary of this unset­
		<lb/>tled state,</said> he <choice><sic>though</sic><corr>thought</corr></choice>, <said>when my curiosity is sa­
		<lb/>tiated with the wonders of the new world, and
		<lb/>gladly retire to the peaceful shades of my child­
		<lb/>hood.</said> But he failed not to add the saving clause,
	      <lb/><said>if the return of <persName>Mr. Grey</persName> produces no change in
		<lb/>the decision of <persName>Miriam</persName>.</said> A hope which still lin­
	      <lb/>gered in the recess of his heart, and coloured with
	      <lb/>its rainbow tints, every vision of futurity.</p>

	    <p><persName rend="case(smallcaps)">Mr. Winthrop</persName> assembled at his house on the fol­
	      <lb/>lowing day, some of the most distinguished wor­
	      <lb/>thies of <placeName>New-England</placeName>; men whose characters and
	      <lb/>example were then the theme of praise, and whose
	      <lb/>memories still claim our highest respect and vene­
	      <lb/>ration.</p>
	    <p>There were the learned and patriarchal <persName>Cotton</persName>,
	      <lb/>the pious and benevolent <persName>Wilson</persName>, and the apostolic
	      <lb/><persName>Eliot</persName>, with others equally renowned in the early
	      <lb/>history of the colony; and the feelings of <persName>Major
		<lb/>Atherton</persName> were highly gratified on finding himself,
	      <lb/>by the easy politeness of his host, and the courtesy
	      <lb/>of the guests, at once familiarized in a circle which
	      <lb/>included so many of the wise and eminent of
	      <lb/>the age and country. Most of them were well-
	      <lb/>educated, experienced in the ways of the world
	      <lb/>and accustomed to the usages of polite life; and
	      <lb/>though liberality of religious feeling was not the
	      <lb/>crying sin of the times, <persName>Atherton</persName> had no reason to
	      <lb/>complain that the errors of prelacy, with which
	      <lb/>he was chargeable, exposed him to coldness or
	      <lb/>neglect. On the contrary, the company in gene­

	      <lb/>mand, <quote>be courteous</quote> which was enforced by the
	      <lb/>example of <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>, whose benevolence and
	      <lb/>urbanity, were never subjected to the invidious dis­
	      <lb/>tinctions of party-spirit. Nor were they so aus­
	      <lb/>tere and formal, so gloomy and misanthropic as
	      <lb/>the revilers of that day, and the light and vain
	      <lb/>talkers of the present, have generally supposed. It
	      <lb/>was an age of superstition and fanaticism, and no
	      <lb/>sect of <name>christians</name> was exempted from their influ­
	      <lb/>ence. But the acts of intolerance which stain their
	      <lb/>public records, did not necessarily poison the stream
	      <lb/>of private happiness, or blight the tender charities
	      <lb/>of life; and while dissipation was suppressed, pro­
	      <lb/>fligacy abhorred, and vice made ashamed to shew
	      <lb/>its distorted visage, the gentler virtues were
	      <lb/>brought into exercise; and we have reason to be­
	      <lb/>lieve that our fathers were as exemplary in their
	      <lb/>domestic relations, as cheerful in social life, as
	      <lb/>light of heart, if not of head, as their more liberal-
	      <lb/>minded posterity.</p>
	    <p>The pleasures of society were not then, at least
	      <lb/>in <placeName>New-England</placeName>, encumbered with the thousand
	      <lb/>nameless fripperies of fashion, which destroy every
	      <lb/>rational enjoyment, and render a modern party, a
	      <lb/>scene of expense and fatigue, a noisy mirth and
	      <lb/><placeName>Babel</placeName>-like confusion. In the intellectual circle
	      <lb/>which <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName> drew around him, <persName>Major Ath­
		<lb/>erton</persName> was reminded of the refined hospitality of
	      <lb/>his father's house, where he had been accustomed
	      <lb/>to meet with characters distinguished for their me­
	      <lb/>rit and talents. If a certain air of grave preci­

	      <lb/>sion marked the manners of the <name>Puritans</name>, and
	      <lb/>formed a partition-wall between them and their
	      <lb/>brethren of other denominations, this gradually
	      <lb/>wore away, or was disregarded in the freedom of
	      <lb/>familiar intercourse, the interest of animated dis­
	      <lb/>cussion, and the warmth of contending argument
	      <lb/>and opinion.</p>
	    <p><persName>Mrs. Winthrop</persName> whom <persName>Atherton</persName> had not before
	      <lb/>seen, was a sensible, well-bred woman, and presi­
	      <lb/>ded with dignity and grace at her table, which was
	      <lb/>furnished with a variety of substantial fare, served
	      <lb/>up with a degree of neatness and order, sufficient
	      <lb/>to prove, that the watchful eye of the mistress
	      <lb/><quote>looked well to the ways of her household;</quote>—a task,
	      <lb/>which, in those days of primitive simplicity, before
	      <lb/>a love of show and dissipation, or the ambition of
	      <lb/>wearing the <soCalled>blue stocking</soCalled>, had infected all ranks
	      <lb/>and ages, was not disdained by the highest dames
	      <lb/>of the land. The conclusion of a long blessing,
	      <lb/>by <persName>Mr. Wilson</persName>, in which the reverent gentleman
	      <lb/>seemed to forget that dinner was cooling,—became
	      <lb/>the signal for a general attack upon the well-dress­
	      <lb/>ed viands, in which both divines and statesmen
	      <lb/>signalized themselves by their vigour and abilities.</p>
	    <p><said>I should inform you, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>,</said> said <persName>Mr.
		<lb/>Winthrop</persName>, observing that he was about to pledge
	      <lb/>him in a goblet of wine <said>that we have restrained
		<lb/>the useless custom of drinking to each other's health,
		<lb/>which in our opinion tends to excess, by leading one
		<lb/>another to taste, through courtesy, when it is nei­
		<lb/>ther needful nor desired. The fashion is now
		<pb n="044"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="5(2)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">44</mw>
		<lb/>scarcely followed by any of our sober citizens, and
		<lb/>we trust will soon be abolished altogether.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I am happy to relinquish a custom,</said> said <persName>Ather­
		<lb/>ton</persName>, <said>which has often subjected me to inconvenience,
		<lb/>though I have never felt at liberty to oppose it, nor
		<lb/>was I before aware, that any efforts had been made
		<lb/>to discountenance a fashion so prevelant and so
		<lb/>long established.</said></p>
	    <p><said>It is not easy,</said> returned <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>, <said>to
		<lb/>break through the modes of society, which habit
		<lb/>has rendered familiar and agreeable; but the sym­
		<lb/>pathy of feeling, which united our feeble band in
		<lb/>the early days of our settlement rendered the at­
		<lb/>tempt practicable, and ensured its success; and we
		<lb/>conceive it important, that no custom be allowed
		<lb/>in the beginning of a colony, which may hereafter
		<lb/>serve as a precedent leading to immorality or ex­
		<lb/>cess of any kind.</said></p>
	    <p><said>It is doubtless prudent,</said> said <persName>Mr. Cotton</persName>, <said>to
		<lb/>use wise precautions, and establish just and salu­
		<lb/>tary regulations; but as the state increaseth, errors
		<lb/>and abuses will creep in, which the arm of the law
		<lb/>cannot reach, and which the rich and powerful are
		<lb/>alone able to suppress; the influence of their ex­
		<lb/>ample extends through every grade of society, and
		<lb/>whatever they refuse to sanction, becomes unfash­
		<lb/>ionable, and is of course, rejected.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Such has been the influence of the higher classes
		<lb/>in <placeName>England</placeName>,</said> said <persName>Mr. Vane</persName>, <said>and still is, to the
		<lb/>destruction of principle and good order; but we
		<lb/>may hope better of this favoured people, even that
		<pb n="045"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="5(3)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">45</mw>
		<lb/>the example of our great men will be for those
		<lb/>things which tend to <quote>peace and rightousness.</quote></said></p>
	    <p><said>On that, we may rely with some confidence,</said><lb/>said <persName>Mr. Eliot</persName>; <said>but I could wish the influence of
		<lb/><persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName> had been exerted not only to abolish
		<lb/>the foolish custom of drinking healths, but also the
		<lb/>superfluous use of the liquor itself, which is often a
		<lb/>snare, even to the sober and temperate.</said></p>
	    <p><said>A moderate use of it is not forbidden us,</said> repli­
	      <lb/>ed <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>; <said>even the apostle commends it
		<lb/>for the <quote>stomach's sake,</quote> and our infirmities some­
		<lb/>times render it needful and salutary.</said></p>
	    <p><said>No one can object to it, as a medicine,</said> return­
	      <lb/>ed <persName>Mr. Eliot</persName>; <said>but when it is not needful for the
		<lb/>health, we may be allowed to scruple concerning a
		<lb/>practice, which causeth the waste of many preci­
		<lb/>ous moments, and is apt to introduce vain and un­
		<lb/>profitable discourse.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I am not quite reconciled to your opinion, as
		<lb/>yet,</said> said <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>; <said>but we will not insist
		<lb/>upon your practising what your conscience does
		<lb/>not approve, and, therefore, allow you to pass the
		<lb/>disputed beverage to <persName>Mr. Cotton</persName>, who I perceive is
		<lb/>of my way of thinking.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I have no fear of excess, in this honourable com­
		<lb/>pany,</said> said <persName>Mr. Eliot</persName>, smiling; <said>but for myself, I
		<lb/>prefer the wholesome draught of which our first
		<lb/>parents partook in the <placeName>garden of Eden</placeName>, and which
		<lb/>the Lord caused to flow from the rock of <placeName>Horeb</placeName> to
		<lb/>revive the fainting tribes of <name>Israel</name>.</said></p>

		<lb/>denial of our brother <persName>Eliot</persName>; or perhaps he is from
		<lb/>early habit, indifferent to that which from the
		<lb/>same principle is in a manner necessary to others.</said></p>
	    <p><said>You are probably right, sir;</said> returned <persName>Mr. Eliot</persName>
	      <lb/><said>But speaking of habits I know of none which at
		<lb/>present infests our land more inveterate and per­
		<lb/>nicious in its consequences than the immoderate
		<lb/>use of tobacco, that unwholesome weed cultivated
		<lb/>and spread abroad by the idle planters of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I am surprised,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>that a practice
		<lb/>so inimical to cleanliness should ever have receiv­
		<lb/>ed the sanction of any civilized people.</said></p>
	    <p><said>The exhilarating qualities of the plant,</said> replied
	      <lb/><persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>, <said>produce a charm upon the spirits,
		<lb/>irresistible to those who have once indulged it;
		<lb/>and it is besides a soothing amusement when in­
		<lb/>clined to indolence and solitude.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Our late sovereign</said> returned <persName>Mr. Eliot</persName>, <said>never
		<lb/>employed his time and talents to more advantage,
		<lb/>than in writing against this obnoxious weed; and
		<lb/>I wish his royal advice had been treated with as
		<lb/>much deference in this particular, as in others
		<lb/>which have proved less advantageous to his sub­
		<lb/>jects.</said></p>
	    <p><said>It is after all,</said> said <persName>Governor Vane</persName>, <said>but a
		<lb/>heathenish practice, and fit to be followed only by
		<lb/>the wandering tribes who roam the wilderness in a
		<lb/>state but little exalted above the savage beasts.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Wretched, almost inhuman, as these poor out­
		<lb/>casts now appear,</said> said <persName>Mr. Eliot</persName>, <said>I trust the day
		<lb/>is not far distant, when the light of <name>christianity</name>
		<pb n="047"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="5(4)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">47</mw>
		<lb/>shall dawn upon them; when they shall be brought
		<lb/>into the fold of the church, and taught the arts of
		<lb/>civilization, and the blessings of social life.</said></p>
	    <p><persName>Mr. Eliot</persName> spoke with energy, and his benevolent
	      <lb/>countenance was animated with enthusiasm as he
	      <lb/>touched upon a theme which excited his ardent
	      <lb/>hopes, employed his time and exercised his talents;
	      <lb/>and to which the labours of a long and eminently
	      <lb/>useful life were devoted. As yet his plans were
	      <lb/>immature and he was but preparing for those ex­
	      <lb/>tensive exertions which afterwards led him to sac­
	      <lb/>rifice every personal consideration and carried him
	      <lb/>to the inhospitable abodes of savage man,—expos­
	      <lb/>ed to the wintry tempest and summer's heat,—and
	      <lb/>often wet with the dews of night,—that he might
	      <lb/>instruct the ignorant and superstitious natives, and
	      <lb/>lead them to the pure worship of the true God.</p>
	    <p><said>There is a subject,</said> said <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>, <said>which
		<lb/>has long excited the serious interest of the humane
		<lb/>and pious both in <placeName>England</placeName> and <placeName>America</placeName>; but as
		<lb/>yet small progress has been made in the work
		<lb/>which is suffered to languish from lack of labour­
		<lb/>ers to enter into the vineyard.</said></p>
	    <p><said>It presents almost insuperable difficulties, even
		<lb/>to the most sanguine mind,</said> replied <persName>Mr. Wilson</persName>,
	      <lb/>and a spirit of courage and perseverance similar
	      <lb/>to that which actuated the holy apostles, can alone
	      <lb/>enable any one to prosper in the undertaking.</p>
	    <p><said>To me it appears less formidable,</said> said <persName>Mr.
		<lb/>Eliot</persName>; <said>the cordial concurrence of our public as­
		<lb/>semblies, the prayers and alms of good and enlight­
		<pb n="048"/>

		<lb/>ened individuals, have already sanctioned the under­
		<lb/>taking, and with the armour of faith and in humble
		<lb/>dependence on the assistance of Heaven, I would
		<lb/>freely devote my poor abilities to forward so glori­
		<lb/>ous a cause.</said></p>
	    <p><said>We hope much from the zealous concern you
		<lb/>have manifested, <persName>Mr. Eliot</persName>, for these poor benight­
		<lb/>ed heathens,</said> said the Governor; <said>and your suc­
		<lb/>cess in mastering the difficulties of their language,
		<lb/>we are ready to believe an earnest of more exten­
		<lb/>sive usefulnesss, and still higher attainments.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Should Providence open a path for me in the
		<lb/>wilderness,</said> returned <persName>Mr. Eliot</persName>, <said>I shall count no
		<lb/>pains or difficulties too severe which will enable
		<lb/>me to prove my fidelity in my master's service, and
		<lb/>render me useful to those unfortunate beings, who,
		<lb/>though created in the image of God, have sunk into
		<lb/>the depths of barbarism and depravity.</said></p>
	    <p><said>No one has yet devoted himself to this work,</said><lb/>said <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>; <said>but our brethren at <placeName>New-
		  <lb/>Plymouth</placeName> have, by repeated acts of kindness and
		<lb/>integrity in their dealings, engaged the friendship
		<lb/>of the natives in those parts, which is the first step
		<lb/>towards reclaiming them; and in many instances
		<lb/>they have listened with docility to religious instruc­
		<lb/>tion, and on their death-beds expressed a wish that
		<lb/>they might go to the <name>Englishman's</name> God.</said></p>
	    <p><said>The conduct of <persName>Governor Winslow</persName>,</said> said <persName>Ather­
		<lb/>ton</persName>, <said>towards the <persName>sachem Massasoit</persName>, appears to me
		<lb/>equally politic and humane. Being dangerously
		<lb/>ill he nursed him for many succeeding days and
		<pb n="049"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="5(5)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">49</mw>
		<lb/>nights with the utmost tenderness, showing by his
		<lb/>assiduous attention a real anxiety for his safety;
		<lb/>and the gratitude of the <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> prince and his sub­
		<lb/>jects, which has remained permanent to this day,
		<lb/>and been repeatedly manifested by friendly deeds
		<lb/>towards the colony, proves them to be accessible
		<lb/>to the kind and gentle feelings of humanity.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Example is always more powerful than pre­
		<lb/>cept,</said> said <persName>Mr. Cotton</persName>, <said>and this <rs type="properAdjective">christian</rs> conduct
		<lb/>if pursued, may in time produce the desired effect.
		<lb/>But it must be long before we are able to overcome
		<lb/>the prejudices of these savages, who were exas­
		<lb/>perated against the white people, years before the
		<lb/>settlement of <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, by the atrocious conduct
		<lb/>of the fishermen and others who came on <mcr>trucking</mcr>
		<lb/>voyages to these shores; introduced the vice of
		<lb/>drunkenness among them; and in more than one
		<lb/>instance, stole away their people for slaves.</said></p>
	    <p><said>There seems to be a diversity of disposition in
		<lb/>the different tribes,</said> said <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>, <said>probably
		<lb/>the result of peculiar circumstances in their govern­
		<lb/>ment and situation; and the degrees of intercourse
		<lb/>which they have maintained with other nations.
		<lb/>Those who inhabit the sea-coast were at first chief­
		<lb/>ly affected by the irregular habits of the traders;
		<lb/>but as their commerce with the natives increased,
		<lb/>others from the interior were allured thither by
		<lb/>their admiration of the tinselled gew-gaws for
		<lb/>which they exchanged the rich furs and other va­
		<lb/>luable commodities of the country; and the white
		<lb/>people—to their shame be it spoken—too often
		<pb n="050"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="5(5)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">50</mw>
		<lb/>gratified their propensity for strong drink, and
		<lb/>then took advantage of their situation to practice
		<lb/>on them the grossest impositions.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I have seen some of these miserable beings,</said><lb/>said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>who have acquired the sordid vices
		<lb/>of our countrymen without any of the virtues which
		<lb/>spring from civilized and <rs type="properAdjective">christian</rs> life; they pre­
		<lb/>sent a most melancholy and degrading view of
		<lb/>human nature, and strongly contrast with the no­
		<lb/>ble independence and native generosity of the un­
		<lb/>sophisticated savage.</said></p>
	    <p><said>The growth of our plantations,</said> said <persName>Mr. Eliot</persName>,
	      <lb/><said>and our persevering endeavours to promote a bet­
		<lb/>ter spirit, will, I hope, with the blessing of God, in
		<lb/>due time bring them to feel their wretchedness, and
		<lb/>lead them to seek their true interest and glory,
		<lb/>where only they can be found. It would argue an
		<lb/>unpardonable neglect in us to be more remiss in
		<lb/>such a cause than the superstitious papists of <placeName>France</placeName>,
		<lb/>who have sent their priests to convert the tribes
		<lb/>which border on their dominions of <placeName>Canada</placeName> and
		<lb/><placeName>Acadia</placeName>.</said></p>
	    <p><said>They are <quote>blind leaders of the blind,</quote></said> said
	      <lb/><persName>Mr. Wilson</persName>; <said>and as well might these poor delud­
		<lb/>ed heathen trust in the devilish arts of their own
		<lb/>Powaws, as to seek for the light of truth amidst
		<lb/>the errors and idolatry of those image-worshipping
		<lb/><name>Jesuits</name>.</said></p>
	    <p><said>It is the constant endeavour of the Sachems and
		<lb/><term>Powaws</term> or priests,</said> said <persName>Mr. Cotton</persName>, <said>to prevent
		<lb/>the <name>English</name> from gaining any ascendancy over the
		<pb n="051"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="5(6)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">51</mw>
		<lb/>minds of their people, either in civil or religious af­
		<lb/>fairs; they have been accustomed to receive the
		<lb/>most implicit obedience from them, and their inte­
		<lb/>rest as well as pride is engaged in opposing the
		<lb/>influence of our nation.</said></p>
	    <p><said>It is not a light thing to undertake the conver­
		<lb/>sion and civilization of such prejudiced and obdu­
		<lb/>rate beings,</said> said <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>; <said>and the success
		<lb/>will not probably equal our hopes till another ge­
		<lb/>neration shall rise up to water the seed which we
		<lb/>may plant.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Pardon me, sir, for differing from you in opi­
		<lb/>nion on this subject,</said> replied <persName>Mr. Eliot</persName>; <said>but I
		<lb/>feel more sanguine in regard to the result of our
		<lb/>labours, and hope better things from the natural
		<lb/>disposition of these <name>Indians</name> than most of my coun­
		<lb/>trymen. This general belief in their irreclaimable
		<lb/>depravity, I find, is disheartening to many, who
		<lb/>would otherwise feel inclined to help forward the
		<lb/>good work.</said></p>
	    <p><said>The experience of <persName>Mr. Roger Williams</persName>, who
		<lb/>has now a long time sojourned amongst them;</said> re­
	      <lb/>turned <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>, <said>has been unfavourable to
		<lb/>their character; and though he has not received
		<lb/>any personal violence from their hands; but on
		<lb/>the contrary many important services, he con­
		<lb/>siders them as stupid and depraved in the ex­
		<lb/>treme.</said></p>
	    <p><said>The testimony of a man who has himself intro­
		<lb/>duced false doctrines and dissensions which have
		<lb/>banished him from our churches,</said> said <persName>Mr. Vane</persName>,
	      <pb n="052"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="5(6)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">52</mw>
	      <lb/>can scarcely be admitted as impartial and con­
	      <lb/>clusive evidence.</p>
	    <p><said>Whatever may be the doctrinal errors of <persName>Mr.
		  <lb/>Williams</persName>,</said> replied <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>, <said>he has uniform­
		<lb/>ly displayed a solid judgment, and most disinter­
		<lb/>ested and benevolent disposition in his intercourse
		<lb/>with society; and his influence over the <name>Indians</name>
		<lb/>has been constantly exerted for our advantage.</said></p>
	    <p><said>He has certainly shewn a truly christian spirit
		<lb/>of forgiveness,</said> said <persName>Mr. Cotton</persName>; <said>and believing
		<lb/>as he does, that he has been injured by the minis­
		<lb/>ters and magistrates of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, his continu­
		<lb/>ed endeavours to serve them argues a nobleness
		<lb/>of mind as praise-worthy as it is uncommon.</said></p>
	    <p><said>The Lord turneth the heart of man, even as
		<lb/>the rivers of water are turned,</said> said <persName>Mr. Dudley</persName>,
	      <lb/>one of the most inflexible of the early colonists,
	      <lb/><said>and he can cause the <quote>counsel of <persName>Ahitophel</persName></quote> to
		<lb/>subserve his own purposes and advance the inte­
		<lb/>rests of his chosen people.</said></p>
	    <p><said>If we suffer ourselves to view the conduct of
		<lb/>others through the medium of prejudice,</said> said <persName>Mr.
		<lb/>Winthrop</persName>, <said>every action must appear distorted;
		<lb/>but in the judgment of charity, the demeanour of
		<lb/><persName>Mr. Williams</persName> since his establishment of <placeName rend="slant(italic)">Mooshaw­
		  <lb/>sick</placeName>, entitles him to respect, rather than reproach
		<lb/>and suspicion.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Errors of opinion,</said> said <persName>Mr. Eliot</persName>, <said>do not al­
		<lb/>ways imply hardness of heart; and since he is no
		<lb/>longer a disturber, but a promoter of our peace, we
		<pb n="053"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="6(1)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">53</mw>
		<lb/>are bound to esteem him for his works' sake, and
		<lb/>suffer his objectionable tenets to fade into oblivion.</said></p>
	    <p><said>His cunningly devised fables,</said> said <persName>Mr. Dud­
		<lb/>ley</persName>, <said>will not speedily be forgotten by the church
		<lb/>of <placeName>Salem</placeName>; and he is still bent on spreading them
		<lb/>amongst the deluded band who have followed him
		<lb/>to the <placeName>Providence plantations</placeName>.</said></p>
	    <p><said>That is beyond our jurisdiction,</said> said <persName>Mr. Win­
		<lb/>throp</persName>; <said>and we are no longer authorized to restrain
		<lb/>or punish him; and though we have heretofore as
		<lb/>magistrates been compelled to admonish him for the
		<lb/>errors of his creed, we felt sincere esteem for his
		<lb/>private virtues, and our confidence in him induces
		<lb/>us, at the present time, to employ him as our agent
		<lb/>with the <name>Indians</name>, among whom he is located.</said></p>
	    <p><said>His knowledge of their character and language,</said><lb/>replied <persName>Mr. Dudley</persName>, <said>may qualify him for the of­
		<lb/>fice, though to me it would seem less objectionable
		<lb/>to select a person who is not given up to <quote>strong
		  <lb/>delusions.</quote></said></p>
	    <p><said>Our choice must necessarily be limited,</said> return­
	      <lb/>ed <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>; <said>nor would we willingly give
		<lb/>him or any one else reason to believe us actuated by
		<lb/>revenge or personal dislike, as might be the case if
		<lb/>we chose another, and perhaps less suitable agent.</said></p>
	    <p><said>The charge would be groundless, and unworthy
		<lb/>of our regard,</said> said <persName>Mr. Dudley</persName>, <said>except so far as
		<lb/>we may be justly influenced by an abhorrence of
		<lb/>spiritual errors.</said></p>
	    <p><said>He has suffered severely for those, already,</said> re­
	      <lb/>plied <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>; <said>enough, I doubt not, to con­

		<lb/>firm him in his favourite tenet, that <quote>punishment
		  <lb/>for matters of conscience is persecution.</quote></said></p>
	    <p><said>I trust you are not inclining to his opinion in
		<lb/>that respect,</said> returned <persName>Mr. Dudley</persName>; <said>but you seem
		<lb/>particularly disposed to treat him with lenity, and
		<lb/>even consideration.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Now Heaven forbid,</said> said <persName>Governor Vane</persName>, <said>that
		<lb/>any individual present should encourage a tolera­
		<lb/>tion so destructive of that harmony which unites
		<lb/>our churches, and which once admitted, would open
		<lb/>the door for dissensions and sap the foundations of
		<lb/>that pure worship and those dear bought privileges
		<lb/>which our great reformers have laboured to estab­
		<lb/>lish.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I think,</said> said <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>, <said>I should sooner
		<lb/>become a convert to that opinion, than certain oth­
		<lb/>ers he has advanced of a totally opposite nature;
		<lb/>and which strikingly display the inconsistency of
		<lb/>the human character, particularly when given up to
		<lb/>the illusions of error.</said></p>
	    <p><said>It would seem his wife had most reason to com­
		<lb/>plain of his eccentricity,</said> said <persName>Mr. Cotton</persName>, <said>since
		<lb/>he would not even give thanks at his meals when
		<lb/>she was present, because she persisted in going to
		<lb/>the meeting at <placeName>Salem</placeName> from which he had withdrawn,
		<lb/>on their refusing to separate from the other chur­
		<lb/>ches in <placeName>New-England</placeName>.</said></p>
	    <p><said>He thought it necessary, perhaps,</said> said <persName>Mr. Wil­
		<lb/>son</persName>, <said>to reduce her to obedience; as we all know
		<lb/>either by experience or observation, that when the
		<lb/>gentler sex are inclined to prove refractory, it is
		<lb/>sometimes expedient to use coercive measures.</said></p>

		<lb/>fles,</said> said <persName>Mrs. Winthrop</persName>, <said>and it is not surprising
		<lb/>that it should occasionally produce opposition in
		<lb/>those who are subjected to it.</said></p>
	    <p><said>It certainly cannot excite surprise in this age of

	    <p><said>It would indeed be an unreasonable expectation,</said><lb/>said <persName>Mr. Wilson</persName>; <said>but I think we are in no imme­
		<lb/>diate danger of having it realized.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I hope,</said> returned <persName>Mrs. Winthrop</persName>, <said>our clergy
		<lb/>will not adopt the sentiments of <persName>Mr. Williams</persName> in
		<lb/>regard to family discipline, to produce the submission
		<lb/>which you seem to consider desirable.</said></p>
	    <p><said>That must depend upon the families we have to

	    <p><said><persName>Mrs. Williams</persName> acted from principle,</said> replied
	      <lb/><persName>Mrs. Winthrop</persName>, <said>and she was certainly bound to
		<lb/>consult her own conscience, even before the will of
		<lb/>her husband, who violated his own maxim in deny­
		<lb/>ing her that freedom of opinion which every rea­

		<lb/>ed on the subject of female independence,</said> said <persName>Mr.
		<lb/>Wilson</persName>, <said>when she listened to the tempter, and gra­
		<lb/>tified her caprice and inclination in tasting the
		<lb/><quote>fruit of the tree of good and evil;</quote> and in the
		<lb/>same source doubtless originate the enormous errors
		<lb/>of <persName>Mrs. Hutchinson</persName>, which are <quote>leading captive
		  <lb/>silly women,</quote> and bringing contention into our
		<lb/>land.</said></p>
	    <p><said>We will suffer that unhappy woman to rest for
		<lb/>the present,</said> replied <persName>Mrs. Winthrop</persName>, who feared the
	      <lb/>diversity of sentiment entertained by her guests on
	      <lb/>that subject might lead to unpleasant debate. <said>But
		<lb/>I doubt if any opinions set forth by my sex, have
		<lb/>produced more heart burnings than that which in­
		<lb/>duced <persName>Mr. Endicot</persName> in his zeal to deface the king's
		<lb/>colours.</said></p>
	    <p><said>That may be very suitable in a grave magis­
		<lb/>trate and experienced man,</said> said <persName>Mr. Dudley</persName>,
	      <lb/><said>which would be totally unbecoming of a woman,
		<lb/>whom the apostle exhorts to <quote>shame-facedness and
		  <lb/>sobriety,</quote> and commands not to <quote>teach or usurp
		  <lb/>authority over the man.</quote></said></p>
	    <p><said>Your appeal is decisive, sir,</said> replied <persName>Mrs. Win­
		<lb/>throp</persName>, <said>and I will retire from the discussion be­
		<lb/>fore I become yet further involved in <quote>questions
		  <lb/>of doubtful disputation.</quote></said></p>
	    <p><said>Allow me to become your champion, madam,</said><lb/>said <persName>Mr. Cotton</persName>, <said>although my arguments may not

		<lb/>ten win their cause against the strength of mascu­

	    <p><said>The scruple of <persName>Mr. Endicot</persName>,</said> said <persName>Governor
		<lb/>Vane</persName>, <said>was one which might naturally arise in a
		<lb/>devout and reflecting mind; and we may well be
		<lb/>allowed to question the lawfulness of displaying
		<lb/>on our banners, the cross; that relic of superstition,
		<lb/>which was given by the Pope to a <rs type="properAdjective">Romish</rs> King
		<lb/>of <placeName>England</placeName>, as a symbol of victory.</said></p>
	    <p><said>However we may abhor what savours of those
		<lb/>popish customs,</said> said <persName>Mr. Cotton</persName>, <said>this hath been so
		<lb/>long used as a national standard, that the people had
		<lb/>acquired an attachment, and even veneration for it,
		<lb/>from which it would have been more politic to wean
		<lb/>them by degrees, than to wrest it from them at once
		<lb/>and by force.</said></p>
	    <p><said>We may be satisfied with the result, without
		<lb/>reverting to the means,</said> returned <persName>Mr. Vane</persName>, <said>since
		<lb/>the piety and good sense of the people have at
		<lb/>length convinced them of its unlawfulness, and con­
		<lb/>tented them to purge this idolatry from this land.</said></p>

		<lb/>his rashness gave occasion to many to speak re­
		<lb/>proachfully of us, and also endangered the public
		<lb/>peace, by inciting a tumult amongst the soldiers,
		<lb/>who, at first refused to train with the defaced
		<lb/>colours.</said></p>
	    <p><said>In the belief that he was actuated by tender­
		<lb/>ness of conscience,</said> said <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>; <said>we are

		<lb/>been long associated with the military glory of
		<lb/><placeName>England</placeName>, and of course cherished with feelings of
		<lb/>pride by those who love her prosperity and admire
		<lb/>her greatness.</said></p>
	    <p><said>If I mistake not,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>I observed
		<lb/>our national banner floating from the fort as <placeName>Cas­

	    <p><said>It was taken down for a time,</said> returned <persName>Mr.
		<lb/>Winthrop</persName>, <said>but our loyalty being called in ques­

	    <p><persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName> soon after this conversation led

		  <p>I have been long intending to answer your
		    <lb/>friendly letter, but various circumstances have of
		    <lb/>late prevented me, though not as you seem to inti­
		    <lb/>mate, forgetfulness of my <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> friends, with
		    <lb/>whom my thoughts are daily conversant. I know
		    <lb/>not how it is, but my time is continually occupied,
		    <lb/>and I sometimes vainly wish for a solitary evening,
		    <lb/>to reflect on past events, and look forward to my
		    <lb/>future prospects. The inhabitants of this place
		    <lb/>are hospitable, and socially inclined, beyond my

		    <lb/>expectations, and have successfully exerted them­
		    <lb/>selves to render my situation agreeable. To the
		    <lb/>polite attentions of <persName>Governor Vane</persName>, and <persName>Mr. Win­
		      <lb/>throp</persName>, I am particularly indebted; and at their
		    <lb/>houses, and those of several other gentlemen of
		    <lb/>note here, I am at all times welcomed and en­
		    <lb/>couraged to visit with the utmost familiarity. In­
		    <lb/>deed, I have been repeatedly urged to take up my
		    <lb/>abode with them altogether during my residence
		    <lb/>here; but I feel more independent in my present
		    <lb/>lodgings, humble as they are, and am very comfor­
		    <lb/>tably accommodated in the same apartment as
		    <lb/><persName>Master Cole</persName> informs me, that you occupied when
		    <lb/>here in the autumn;—and which, he says, is kept
		    <lb/>for respectable people only; such I suppose he
		    <lb/>means, as are willing to pay something above the
		    <lb/>ordinary price. These separatists, in casting off
		    <lb/>the works of prelacy, I find have not quite divested
		    <lb/>themselves of the love of <name>Mammon</name>, which will
		    <lb/>probably be the last bond of union that is dis­
		    <lb/>solved.</p>
		  <p>I have accompanied my friends in several ex­
		    <lb/>cursions to the neighbouring towns, and I assure
		    <lb/>you have become a most indefatigable traveller
		    <lb/>over the deepest snows, through trackless forests,
		    <lb/>and across frozen streams. I went a short time
		    <lb/>since to <placeName>Newtown</placeName>—which by the way, is to be
		    <lb/>called <placeName>Cambridge</placeName> in future—with a son of <persName>Mr.
		      <lb/>Winthrop</persName>, who you may tell our friend <persName>Peregrine</persName>,
		    <lb/>has almost as much lively humour as himself, but
		    <lb/>seasoned with rather more discretion. I was much

		    <lb/>pleased with the situation of that place, it was ear­
		    <lb/>ly intended for a fortified town; and though that
		    <lb/>plan is now relinquished, it is handsomely laid out,
		    <lb/>the streets crossing each other at right angles, and
		    <lb/>a square reserved for a market-place. It lies on
		    <lb/>the <placeName>river Charles</placeName>, and will probably become an
		    <lb/>important place in the course of time; it is now
		    <lb/>indeed one of the most thriving villages in the Bay,
		    <lb/>and I understand a College is to be founded there
		    <lb/>in the ensuing year. I have also been on the ice
		    <lb/>to <placeName>Noddle's Island</placeName>, and was hospitably entertained
		    <lb/>in the family of <persName>Mr. Maverick</persName>, who established
		    <lb/>himself there before the arrival of <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>
		    <lb/>and company. He presides in his sea-girt isle like
		    <lb/>one of the rural princes whom <persName>Homer</persName> celebrates,
		    <lb/>though—his household excepted—with only the
		    <lb/>brute creation for his subjects. Or perhaps his
		    <lb/>military state—for he has built a fort and mounted
		    <lb/>cannon on it, for defence against the natives—may
		    <lb/>more resemble the renowned hero of a fairy tale,
		    <lb/>who, in his solitary dominions, performs those
		    <lb/>feats of valour and enchantment, which are the won­
		    <lb/>der of our boyhood; and several negroes whom
		    <lb/>he has domesticated in his family, with their black
		    <lb/>glossy skins, yellow eyes and ivory teeth, might
		    <lb/>well represent those imps, which administer to the
		    <lb/>spells of the magician. My last expedition, ex­
		    <lb/>tended to <placeName>Saugus</placeName>, where we were detained several
		    <lb/>days by a severe snow storm; but the time passed
		    <lb/>very pleasantly in the society of <persName>Mr. Humfrey</persName> and
		    <lb/>his noble consort, who seem to be well accommo­

		    <lb/>dated and quite happy, though I confess it is the
		    <lb/>most dreary part of the country I have yet seen;
		    <lb/>and I could not but feel surprised that they should
		    <lb/>fix their abode here. <persName>Mr. Humfrey</persName> is an Assistant,
		    <lb/>and of course, much engaged in public affairs;
		    <lb/>though still as deeply interested in agricultural
		    <lb/>pursuits, as the most laborious farmer in <placeName>England</placeName>.
		    <lb/>I witnessed with admiration, the cheerfulness with
		    <lb/>which his lady submitted to a situation so different
		    <lb/>from that to which she had been accustomed, in the
		    <lb/>ease and luxury of her father's house. From thence
		    <lb/>I proceeded to <placeName>Salem</placeName>, which is worthy of attention,
		    <lb/>as one of the earliest settlements in the <placeName>Massachu­
		      <lb/>setts</placeName>; and where the people, it is said, are far more
		    <lb/>rigid than in the other plantations. I was absent
		    <lb/>about a week and gladly returned to <placeName>Boston</placeName>, where
		    <lb/>I feel more at home than in any other place which
		    <lb/>I have visited since I left your friendly roof.</p>
		  <p>Thus my dear sir, I have given you a sketch of
		    <lb/>my various excursions,—at the risk of wearying
		    <lb/>your patience,—as a sort of apology for my long
		    <lb/>silence, and to convince you that I am not chilled
		    <lb/>by your <placeName>New-England</placeName> frosts, nor become inactive,
		    <lb/>and indifferent to the pleasures which are offered to
		    <lb/>me. On the whole I am delighted with this part
		    <lb/>of the country, so far as I can judge at this unfa­
		    <lb/>vourable season, and were I to become a settler on
		    <lb/>these shores, should give it a decided preference
		    <lb/>over any that I have yet seen. I know your natural
		    <lb/>partiality for the old colony of <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, and
		    <lb/>therefore offer this opinion with some diffidence,
		    <pb n="063"/>
		    <milestone unit="sig" n="6(6)r"/>
		    <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">63</mw>
		    <lb/>begging at the same time that you will not think
		    <lb/>me a heretic in all my sentiments, as well as in
		    <lb/>matters of religion. The rich variety of scenery,
		    <lb/>beautiful even in wintry dreariness, the abundance
		    <lb/>of streams and rivers, the extensive valleys inter­
		    <lb/>woven with lofty and finely wooded hills,—all be­
		    <lb/>speak a land of fruitfulness and abundance, which
		    <lb/>has been blessed by its great Creator, and needs
		    <lb/>only the hand of industry to fill the store-houses
		    <lb/>and granaries, even to overflowing. I am pleased
		    <lb/>too, with the manners of the people, and have ex­
		    <lb/>perienced the highest satisfaction in their conver­
		    <lb/>sation and society. There are many men here of
		    <lb/>extensive learning and eminent talents, who have
		    <lb/>been distinguished in the first society in <placeName>England</placeName>,
		    <lb/>and whose influence softens the rude and jarring
		    <lb/>elements of an infant colony, and ameliorates the
		    <lb/>rigid tenets of the religion they have adopted.
		    <lb/>Many also have figured in the gayer circles of life,
		    <lb/>—are descended from ancient families,—and allied
		    <lb/>to houses of nobility and distinction; their man­
		    <lb/>ners and conversation, retain a degree of polish
		    <lb/>and refinement, happily blended with the primitive
		    <lb/>simplicity which characterize the inhabitants of
		    <lb/><placeName>Plymouth</placeName>.</p>
		  <p>I must crave your patience, while I advance
		    <lb/>another heterodox opinion, which you will not per­
		    <lb/>haps, readily admit; but they appear to me less
		    <lb/>bigotted than the good people of your colony, who
		    <lb/>are always sure to find the cloven foot beneath
		    <lb/>a surplice, and the devils spirit, in every printed

		    <lb/>prayer-book. Perhaps my semi-<rs type="properAdjective">puritan</rs> descent,
		    <lb/>leads them to overlook my prelatical errors, or to
		    <lb/>pass lighly over them, in the hope of converting
		    <lb/>me by fair words; but, however this may be, they
		    <lb/>have certainly more charity towards the mother
		    <lb/>church, than many of their <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> brethren;
		    <lb/>though in minor points I must confess they quite
		    <lb/>equal,—in some perhaps surpass you. My conflict
		    <lb/>with <persName>Master Handcuff</persName> the constable, which I men­
		    <lb/>tioned to you in my last letter, was certainly an un­
		    <lb/>rivalled exploit, quite beyond the genius of your
		    <lb/>laws; and to avoid a repetition of it, I find I must
		    <lb/>refrain from all observance of the approaching
		    <lb/><name>Christmas</name>, which is expressly forbidden by law.—
		    <lb/>When will rulers learn to let every man judge for
		    <lb/>himself in matters of conscience and religion?</p>
		  <p>As for the news of the place, concerning which
		    <lb/>you make enquiries—the old story of <persName>Mrs. Hutchin­
		      <lb/>son</persName> is still a fruitful subject for discussion, and the
		    <lb/>difference of opinion respecting her doctrines and
		    <lb/>conduct is a source of much bitter invective. The
		    <lb/>Governor, continues her firm partizan, and it is
		    <lb/>generally thought that <persName>Mr. Cotton</persName> is tinged with
		    <lb/>her errors; though his calm temperament is less
		    <lb/>easily excited than her enthusiastic imagination.
		    <lb/>She is undoubtedly an uncommon woman; full of
		    <lb/>spirit and independence, with great strength of mind,
		    <lb/>and versatility of talents,—an artful address, and
		    <lb/>a surprising command of language, which is par­
		    <lb/>ticularly displayed in the subtlety of her contro­
		    <lb/>versial arguments. The countenance of <persName>Mr. Vane</persName>,
		    <pb n="065"/>
		    <milestone unit="sig" n="7(1)r"/>
		    <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">65</mw>
		    <lb/>and others has greatly emboldened her; she has
		    <lb/>withdrawn from public worship, and holds lectures
		    <lb/>at her own house, where she instructs the <mcr>sisters</mcr>,
		    <lb/>who resort to her in great numbers. The most re­
		    <lb/>spectable are drawn to listen to her, and none of
		    <lb/>either sex are excluded who feel inclined to profit
		    <lb/>by her edifying discourses. Had the magistrates
		    <lb/>and clergy disregarded her at first, she would pro­
		    <lb/>bably have sunk into forgetfulness; but their im­
		    <lb/>politic interference produced a degree of party ex­
		    <lb/>citement, and the violence of their opposition con­
		    <lb/>stantly increased her disciples, till her influence
		    <lb/>extends to the most important affairs, both of church
		    <lb/>and state.</p>
		  <p>The continued aggressions of the <name>Pequod tribe</name>,
		    <lb/>are also a theme of complaint and conjecture; and
		    <lb/>it is feared that hostilities will commence with fa­
		    <lb/>tal rigour on both sides, in the approaching spring.</p>
		  <p>Added to these copious topics the conduct of <persName>Go­
		      <lb/>vernor Vane</persName> has of late given much offence to
		    <lb/>some, and much anxiety and regret to others. His
		    <lb/>popularity is on the decline; and, sensible of it
		    <lb/>himself, he has requested leave to resign the go­
		    <lb/>vernment, urging as a plea, certain letters received
		    <lb/>from <placeName>London</placeName>, and containing orders for his return.
		    <lb/>His departure was acceded to by the court, but the
		    <lb/>church refused their assent, and he was without
		    <lb/>much difficulty persuaded to remain. I am not
		    <lb/>sufficiently conversant in public affairs, to give an
		    <lb/>impartial opinion on the subject; but I confess
		    <lb/>there is an appearance of dissimulation in his con­

		    <lb/>duct, from which I could wish him free; he cer­
		    <lb/>tainly used considerable address, in exciting the
		    <lb/>feelings of the parties, and moulding them to his
		    <lb/>purpose.</p>
		  <p>But I will not detain you longer with these mi­
		    <lb/>nute details, though I wish it were in my power to
		    <lb/>interest you in the transactions of the times, as far
		    <lb/>as to induce you to come hither and be an eye and
		    <lb/>ear witness, as soon as the season will permit. I
		    <lb/>hope you will remember that you <emph>almost</emph> promised
		    <lb/>to join me here in the spring, if not sooner. After
		    <lb/>all that I have said in this long epistle, I trust
		    <lb/>you will not think my inclination so much turned
		    <lb/>towards these <said>meddlesome <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> people,</said>
		    <lb/>as you call them, as to render me forgetful of
		    <lb/>the kind friends whom I have left at <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>.
		    <lb/>My heart turns to them with grateful remembrance,

	    <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> prepared this letter to send by
	      <lb/>the master of a pinnace which was hourly ex­
	      <lb/>pecting to sail for <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>; and at the com­
	      <lb/>mencement of a cold and serene evening, he sallied
	      <lb/>forth to deliver it himself into his hand. There
	      <lb/>was a great quantity of ice in the harbour, ex­
	      <lb/>tending to, and connecting several of the nearest
	      <lb/>islands; but the channel remained clear and open
	      <lb/>for navigation; and as <persName>Atherton</persName>, remarked its
	      <lb/>dark and swelling waves, contrasted with the glit­
	      <lb/>tering wall, which hemmed it in on either side, his
	      <lb/>attention was attracted by a vessel rapidly ap­
	      <lb/>proaching the shore, and its white sails fluttering
	      <lb/>in the clear moon-light. It proved a small bark
	      <lb/>scarcely larger than a fishing smack; but <persName>Ather­
		<lb/>ton</persName>, remained till it came to anchor, hoping it was
	      <lb/>from <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, and would bring him intelligence
	      <lb/>from his friends. Several persons, attracted by
	      <lb/>the same object, were collected on the shore, and
	      <lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>, apart from them, continued to pace the
	      <lb/>beach till he discovered it was only a trading pin­
	      <lb/>nace from <placeName>Cape Cod</placeName>; and feeling no further in­
	      <lb/>terest he returned disappointed to the inn.</p>
	    <p>He had, however, scarcely taken possession of
	      <lb/>his solitary apartment when an unusual bustle be­
	      <lb/>low announced the arrival of new guests; and

	      <lb/>presently the voice of <persName>Dame Cole</persName> was heard as­
	      <lb/>cending the stairs, in conversation with some per­
	      <lb/>sons whom she seemed conducting to their rooms.
	      <lb/><persName>Atherton's</persName> door stood ajar and as the bustling
	      <lb/>landlady passed by with the stranger, he was ra­
	      <lb/>ther surprised to observe two females; but they
	      <lb/>were so closely enveloped in their cloaks and
	      <lb/>hoods, that neither their faces nor figures were
	      <lb/>discernible.</p>
	    <p><said>I am afraid, Mistress, that our poor rooms will
		<lb/>not be to your liking,</said> said <persName>Dame Cole</persName>, in her
	      <lb/>softest tone and most complaisant manner, <said>seeing
		<lb/>that my best chamber is already taken up by a
		<lb/>hopeful young gentleman who has been our lodger,
		<lb/>it is now almost five weeks, and I may well say,
		<lb/>as orderly and generous a youth, as one could meet
		<lb/>with—though they do tell me he is a prelatist,—
		<lb/>the more's the pity, poor young man.</said></p>
	    <p><persName>Atherton</persName> had retreated from the door, and did
	      <lb/>not hear the reply to this eulogium; to which the
	      <lb/>dame again answered,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>It doth not become me to boast, although I
		<lb/>may say, I endeavour to do all things <quote>decently
		  <lb/>and in order,</quote> as is commanded; nevertheless,
		<lb/>this apartment lacks many conveniences which ap­
		<lb/>pertain unto that of <persName>Major Atherton</persName>.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said><persName>Major Atherton</persName>!</said> repeated one of the females
	      <lb/>in a tone of surprise, and with a tremulous voice
	      <lb/>which thrilled to the heart of <persName>Atherton</persName>, and which
	      <lb/>he believed it impossible to mistake.</p>
	    <p><said>Can it be?</said> he mentally exclaimed,—<said>is <persName>Mi­

		  <lb/>riam Grey</persName> in reality so near me? surely no
		<lb/>other voice has that sweetness, that indescribable
		<lb/>charm!</said></p>

	    <p>In the first impulse of delight and astonishment,
	      <lb/>he was on the point of rushing from the room to
	      <lb/>satisfy his doubts; but the recollection of their last
	      <lb/>interview checked his eagerness, and a moment of
	      <lb/>reflection convinced him that a mistake was pos­
	      <lb/>sible; indeed her arrival in <placeName>Boston</placeName> was so unex­
	      <lb/>pected, so improbable, that he concluded with a
	      <lb/>sigh, he had been deceived by his hopes, and that
	      <lb/>there might be another voice in <placeName>New-England</placeName>,
	      <lb/>which possessed the exquisite melody of hers. Still
	      <lb/>he continued to traverse his apartment for some
	      <lb/>time in a state of strong excitement, often stopping
	      <lb/>to listen, with almost agitated interest to the low
	      <lb/>murmur of voices which proceeded from the ad­
	      <lb/>joining apartment. At length, ashamed of his
	      <lb/>emotion, and resolved to shake it off, he hastily
	      <lb/>descended to the public rooms to seek further in­
	      <lb/>formation respecting the vessel, and particularly
	      <lb/>the passengers it had brought. In a small room,
	      <lb/>where his meals were usually served up, he ob­
	      <lb/>served a table neatly prepared for supper; and, in
	      <lb/>the act of warming himself by the fire, a young
	      <lb/>man of respectable appearance, whose figure was
	      <lb/>familiar to him. <persName>Atherton</persName> paused a moment to
	      <lb/>catch a glimpse of his features, which were then
	      <lb/>turned from him. The first view satisfied all his
	      <lb/>doubts, and the well remembered countenance of

	      <lb/><persName>Henry Weldon</persName> convinced him that he had not been
	      <lb/>mistaken in his former conjectures.</p>
	    <p><said><persName>Mr. Weldon</persName>,</said> exclaimed <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>is it possi­
		<lb/>ble that I see you in this place?</said></p>
	    <p><said>You may well be surprised, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>,</said><lb/>said <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName>, cordially receiving his offered
	      <lb/>hand; <said>when we last parted I had little thought of
		<lb/>following you so soon, from our comfortable abode
		<lb/>at <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>.</said></p>
	    <p><said>You are not alone I think,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>;
	      <lb/><said>I could not be mistaken, when I just now saw
		<lb/><persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName> and her cousin, though I then al­
		<lb/>most persuaded myself that my senses were de­
		<lb/>ceived.</said></p>
	    <p><said>They insisted on accompanying me,</said> replied
	      <lb/><persName>Mr. Weldon</persName> <said>and though most happy to be thus
		<lb/>attended, I would fain, for their sakes have gone
		<lb/>forth alone, and spared them the hardships we
		<lb/>may encounter, at this inclement season.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Whither are you going?</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>and
		<lb/>what could induce you,—what could tempt your
		<lb/>more delicate companions, to forsake the comforts
		<lb/>of home, in the midst of a severe and frozen
		<lb/>winter?</said></p>
	    <p><said>My home,</said> replied <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName>, <said>is far from
		<lb/>hence, and Providence has called me to forsake
		<lb/>my plans of ease, and attend to my worldly estate.
		<lb/><persName>Mrs. Weldon's</persName> affectionate solicitude will not per­
		<lb/>mit her to remain behind, and <persName>Miriam</persName> has gene­
		<lb/>rously resolved to share our fortunes, at least till
		<lb/>her father returns to claim her.</said></p>

	    <p><said>And does <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> go with you to that
		<lb/>savage wilderness?</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, with strong
	      <lb/>emotion. But fearful of betraying his feelings, he
	      <lb/>suddenly stopped and leaning his head upon his
	      <lb/>hand, remained silent.</p>
	    <p><said>Such is her intention,</said> replied <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName>, with­
	      <lb/>out appearing to notice his emotion; <said>but it would
		<lb/>take long to relate the causes by which we are ac­
		<lb/>tuated, and you will excuse me for the present, as
		<lb/>supper is now ready, and we are fatigued and hu­
		<lb/>gry voyagers—and here come my wife and cousin
		<lb/>to seek for refreshments.</said></p>
	    <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> raised his head, and beheld <persName>Mrs.
		<lb/>Weldon</persName> with <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> leaning on her arm, at
	      <lb/>that moment entering the apartment.</p>

	    <p>As soon as <persName>Major Atherton</persName> left the house of <persName>Mr.
		<lb/>Grey</persName>, on the evening previous to his departure from
	      <lb/><placeName>Plymouth</placeName>,—<persName>Miriam</persName>, who had exerted a surprising
	      <lb/>command over her feelings during their interview,
	      <lb/>found herself unable longer to sustain her firmness,
	      <lb/>and as the door closed after him, and she felt that
	      <lb/>he was leaving her probably for the last time, she
	      <lb/>yielded to her emotions, and leaning her head on
	      <lb/><persName>Mrs. Weldon's</persName> shoulder, wept for a few moments
	      <lb/>without restraint. <persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName> forbore to inter­
	      <lb/>rupt or question her; she could not mistake the
	      <lb/>cause of her unusual excitement, and the appearance
	      <lb/>and conduct of <persName>Atherton</persName> convinced her, that their
	      <lb/>recent conference had not terminated favourably to
	      <lb/>his wishes. <persName>Miriam</persName> first broke the silence, and
	      <lb/>raising her blushing face, she said in an earnest but
	      <lb/>unsteady voice,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>Forgive my folly, dearest <persName>Lois</persName>, and believe that
		<lb/>I have not intentionally deceived you.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>I am most ready to believe it,</said> returned <persName>Mrs.
		<lb/>Weldon</persName>, <said>and you will now allow, <persName>Miriam</persName>, that I
		<lb/>was better acquainted with your heart, than you
		<lb/>were yourself.</said></p>

	    <p><said>I was indeed loth to think it so very weak,</said> re­
	      <lb/>plied <persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>but this painful interview has open­
		<lb/>ed my eyes, and I thank God, that I have had
		<lb/>strength to sacrifice my inclination to principle and
		<lb/>duty.</said></p>
	    <p>
	      <said>You have done well, my dear <persName>Miriam</persName>, and the
		<lb/>peace of your own conscience and your father's ap­
		<lb/>probation, will amply compensate for your present
		<lb/>unhappiness, and soon, I trust, restore your wonted
		<lb/>serenity.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>I could endure every thing with cheerfulness,
		<lb/>were <emph>he</emph> less miserable,</said> replied <persName>Miriam</persName>,—and the
	      <lb/>tears again filled her eyes,—<said>but I can never cease
		<lb/>to reproach myself for encouraging hopes, however
		<lb/>inadvertently, which I have in an instant crushed,
		<lb/>and without daring to offer one soothing word, or
		<lb/>even leaving him the consolation of knowing that
		<lb/>the pain was mutual.</said></p>
	    <p>
	      <said>Do not dwell on these gloomy images, my dear
		<lb/><persName>Miriam</persName>; sincerly as <persName>Major Atherton</persName> loves you,
		<lb/>believe me his affection is not unconquerable; men
		<lb/>are less tenacious in their attachments than our sex,
		<lb/>and their intercourse with the world, their more
		<lb/>active sources of amusement, soon wean their
		<lb/>thoughts from one object, and leave them no leisure
		<lb/>to indulge in melancholy regrets.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><persName>Miriam</persName> remained silent, probably unconvinced
	      <lb/>or unwilling to admit the justice of her cousin's as­
	      <lb/>sertion; which as it regarded <persName>Atherton</persName>, would per­
	      <lb/>haps have occasioned inquietude rather thn conso­
	      <lb/>lation; for few women wish to regain their tran­
	      <pb n="074"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="7(5)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">74</mw>
	      <lb/>quillity at the expense of losing the affection of the
	      <lb/>man they love, even if convinced their attachment
	      <lb/>can never lead to a more permanent union. Ap­
	      <lb/>proaching footsteps were at that moment heard, and
	      <lb/><persName>Miriam</persName> hastily rising, said,—</p>
	    <p><said>Do not betray my weakness, even to your hus­
		<lb/>band, dear <persName>Lois</persName>,</said> and hurried to her own apart­
	      <lb/>ment.</p>
	    <p><persName>Major Atherton's</persName> unexpected departure from <placeName>Ply­
		<lb/>mouth</placeName> on the following morning, occasioned much
	      <lb/>surprise and conjecture among the inhabitants, and
	      <lb/>subjected <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> to many embarrassing en­
	      <lb/>quirires. <persName>Mistress Rebecca Spindle</persName>, who possessed
	      <lb/>a large share of the curiosity natural to her sex and
	      <lb/>condition, proved particularly annoying; she found
	      <lb/>it convenient to pay an early visit to <persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName>,
	      <lb/>and through the confusion of <persName>Miriam</persName>, when <persName>Ather­
		<lb/>ton</persName> and the cause of his absence were alluded to,
	      <lb/>she detected enough of the truth combined with her
	      <lb/>own conjectures, to satisfy the inquisitive disposi­
	      <lb/>tion of all the gossips in the village.</p>
	    <p><persName>Mr. Calvert</persName>, who had long considered <persName>Atherton</persName>
	      <lb/>as a formidable rival, was delighted by his abrupt
	      <lb/>departure, which he doubted not was occasioned by
	      <lb/>the refusal of <persName>Miriam</persName>; and from that supposition,
	      <lb/>he drew the most favourable inferences in regard to
	      <lb/>his own prospects. He found her as cheerful, and
	      <lb/>apparently happy as usual; for in society at least,
	      <lb/>she successfully rallied her spirits, and appeared
	      <lb/>with her accustomed gaiety. Her manner towards
	      <lb/>him, was frank and unreserved, as it had ever been;
	      <pb n="075"/><milestone unit="sig" n="7(6)r"/><mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">75</mw><lb/>and encouraged by his hopes, he ventured to disclose
	      <lb/>the passion with which she had inspired him, and to
	      <lb/>solicit a return. <persName>Miriam</persName> listened to him with surprise,
	      <lb/>but without any flattering emotion; she had always
	      <lb/>found him an agreeable companion, and believed
	      <lb/>him worthy of her esteem; but even had her heart
	      <lb/>been entirely free, he could never have been the man
	      <lb/>whom she would have selected for her husband.
	      <lb/>Feeling no partiality for him, she had scarcely sus­
	      <lb/>pected that his regard for her exceeded the limits
	      <lb/>of friendly interest; and indeed he had considered
	      <lb/>it politic to conceal its extent, particularly while
	      <lb/>under her father's eye, believing his handsome per­
	      <lb/>son and insinuating address would make a due im­
	      <lb/>pression on her, whenever he thought proper to re­
	      <lb/>veal his sentiments. The gentle but decided refusal
	      <lb/>of <persName>Miriam</persName>, perplexed him, and he endeavoured to
	      <lb/>win a more favourable answer, by exerting all the
	      <lb/>persuasive eloquence he could command. Finding
	      <lb/>her inflexible, he tried the force of argument; her
	      <lb/>objections to his religion, his country, her father's
	      <lb/>disapprobation, her own indifference, he at first
	      <lb/>considered merely as the capricious whims of a
	      <lb/>pretty woman, who wished to be flattered into com­
	      <lb/>pliance; but he at length became irritated by her
	      <lb/>continued firmness, and gave way to the bitterness
	      <lb/>of his disappointment in the most violent reproach­
	      <lb/>es. The feelings of <persName>Miriam</persName> were deeply wounded
	      <lb/>by his language, which was equally unmerited and
	      <lb/>unexpected, and betrayed by an absence of principle
	      <lb/>and delicacy that shocked and surprised her. With­
	      <pb n="076"/>

	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">76</mw>
	      <lb/>out deigning to repel his accusations, or to enter
	      <lb/>into controversy with him, she retired from his pre­
	      <lb/>sence with an air of dignity, which for a moment
	      <lb/>awed him, and prevented his endevouring to re­
	      <lb/>tain her. Yet his pride, as much perhaps as his af­
	      <lb/>fection, was piqued, and he made repeated attempts
	      <lb/>to be admitted to another interview. But <persName>Miriam</persName>
	      <lb/>steadily refused his request, and he resorted to the
	      <lb/>expedient of interesting <persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName> in his behalf.
	      <lb/>She, however, declined all interference, believing
	      <lb/><persName>Miriam</persName> possessed of prudence sufficient to direct
	      <lb/>herself, and in reality not at all inclined to favour
	      <lb/>the addresses of a man, whose religious principles
	      <lb/>were alone an insurmountable objection. As a
	      <lb/>dernier resource, <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName> addressed a letter
	      <lb/>to <persName>Miriam</persName>, filled with humble acknowledgements
	      <lb/>and passionate professions, entreating her to receive
	      <lb/>him at least on probation, and allow him to hope
	      <lb/>that he might even at a distant period, regain her
	      <lb/>good opinion, if he could not obtain her affections.</p>
	    <p><persName>Miriam</persName> returned him the letter briefly express­
	      <lb/>ing on the envelope her continued wishes for his
	      <lb/>prosperity and happiness, but declining any further
	      <lb/>intercourse with him. <persName>Calvert's</persName> mortification was
	      <lb/>excessive and he would have quitted <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>,
	      <lb/>without delay, but his vessel was yet unprepared
	      <lb/>for the voyage; and in the mean while he availed
	      <lb/>himself of an oft-repeated invitation from <persName>Captain
		<lb/>Standish</persName> to pass some time at his house, happy to
	      <lb/>remove from the immediate scene of his disappoint­
	      <lb/>ment.</p>

	    <p>Soon after these events, <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName> received in­
	      <lb/>telligence from the new colony of <placeName>Hartford</placeName>, which
	      <lb/>excited the utmost alarm and anxiety. He had in­
	      <lb/>vested his whole property in a plantation at that
	      <lb/>place, and with the laborious care attendant on
	      <lb/>the first attempts at cultivating a wilderness, had
	      <lb/>prepared a suitable place for a garden, and cleared
	      <lb/>several acres of land ready to receive the seed,
	      <lb/>early in the ensuing spring. He had also built a
	      <lb/>comfortable dwelling-house, which, with his cattle
	      <lb/>and implements of husbandry he left with a trusty
	      <lb/>agent, intending to pass the winter at <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>
	      <lb/>from whence he felt reluctant to remove his wife
	      <lb/>at that inauspicious season.</p>
	    <p>But the <name>Pequod Indians</name>, a fierce and warlike
	      <lb/>tribe, inhabiting the country near the mouth of
	      <lb/><placeName>Connecticut river</placeName>, began to spread terror among
	      <lb/>the scattered settlements in their vicinity; and
	      <lb/>every man was obliged to use the utmost vigilance
	      <lb/>to secure himself, his family and property from
	      <lb/>their depredations. They often penetrated to the
	      <lb/>abodes of the white people, lay in ambush for the
	      <lb/>solitary and unsuspicious, and if opportunity offer­
	      <lb/>ed, burned houses and destroyed every thing within
	      <lb/>their reach. Their enmity to the <name>English</name> was in­
	      <lb/>veterate and unceasing; they inhumanly murdered
	      <lb/>in cold blood, even innocent children and defence­
	      <lb/>less women; and their unfortunate captives were
	      <lb/>subjected to the most cruel tortures. At that time
	      <lb/>three towns only were settled within the limits of
	      <lb/><placeName>Connecticut</placeName>; the whole of which did not contain

	      <lb/>more than two hundred and fifty men capable of
	      <lb/>bearing arms, and surrounded as they were by
	      <lb/>savage enemies, their situation became perilous in
	      <lb/>the extreme.</p>
	    <p><persName>Mr. Weldon</persName> received a detail of these particu­
	      <lb/>lars in a letter from <placeName>Hartford</placeName>, and he was sensible
	      <lb/>that his absence at such a time would place his
	      <lb/>worldly concerns in hazard, and that it might sub­
	      <lb/>ject him to the reproach of cowardice to remain in
	      <lb/>security, and at a distance, when every man was
	      <lb/>girding on his armour to repel a barbarous enemy.
	      <lb/>He had assisted in establishing the church and
	      <lb/>colony at that place, and deeply interested in their
	      <lb/>existence and prosperity, he resolved at whatever
	      <lb/>cost, to return and share the perils of his fellow
	      <lb/>citizens. <persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName> at once determined to fol­
	      <lb/>low her husband, wherever his duty called him, nor
	      <lb/>were any entreaties, or the prospect of any dangers,
	      <lb/>able to shake her resolution. Indeed she suffered
	      <lb/>far less anxiety for herself than he had experienced
	      <lb/>on her account; she was naturally of a cheerful
	      <lb/>disposition, and had acquired an habitual self-com­
	      <lb/>mand, which enabled her to meet every exigence
	      <lb/>with firmness, every misfortune with resignation.
	      <lb/>With a constant reliance on divine protection, and
	      <lb/>the most devoted affection for her husband, she was
	      <lb/>ready to undertake any enterprise which circum­
	      <lb/>stances rendered expedient.</p>
	    <p>But the situation of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> occasioned
	      <lb/><persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName> much perplexity and deliberation.
	      <lb/>She was unwilling to leave her during her father's
	      <pb n="079"/>

	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">79</mw>
	      <lb/>absence, and particularly while the gaiety of her
	      <lb/>spirits were clouded by recent disappointment,
	      <lb/>which all her endeavours could not conceal from
	      <lb/>the solicitous affection of her cousin. <persName>Major Ather­
		<lb/>ton's</persName> name had not passed the lips of either since
	      <lb/>the evening he had quitted them. <persName>Miriam</persName> engag­
	      <lb/>ed in her daily employments with as much appa­
	      <lb/>rent interest as usual; but her sportive smile was
	      <lb/>often checked by a sigh and a casual allusion or
	      <lb/>sudden remembrance, sometimes filled her eyes with
	      <lb/>tears, even in the moment of mirth; while imper­
	      <lb/>ceptible to any but the watchful eye of <persName>Lois</persName>, her
	      <lb/>countenance seemed gradually losing the brilliant
	      <lb/>bloom of health and happiness.</p>
	    <p><persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName> was too delicate to mention her
	      <lb/>fears even to her husband; and therefore left en­
	      <lb/>tirely to the counsel of her own judgment, she de­
	      <lb/>termined to be guided in a great measure by the
	      <lb/>wishes of <persName>Miriam</persName>. The Governor and <persName>Mrs. Wins­
		<lb/>low</persName> earnestly desired <persName>Miriam</persName> to remain with them
	      <lb/>until her father's return; but though gratified by
	      <lb/>their kindness and attention, she declined their re­
	      <lb/>quest, and solicited permission to accompany <persName>Lois</persName>,
	      <lb/>to share her fortunes, and still enjoy the solace of
	      <lb/>her society and friendship. Nothing could have
	      <lb/>been more grateful to <persName>Mrs. Weldon's</persName> feelings than
	      <lb/>such a proposal; but fearful that it would not meet
	      <lb/>the approbation of <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, and might endanger
	      <lb/><persName>Miriam's</persName> safety, she generously endeavoured to dis­
	      <lb/>suade her from her purpose by representing all the
	      <lb/>evils to which she would be exposed, and her fa­
	      <pb n="080"/>

	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">80</mw>
	      <lb/>ther's unhappiness, should any misfortune befal her.
	      <lb/>But <persName>Miriam</persName> opposed arguments and entreaties to
	      <lb/>her cousin's objections, and was so decided in the
	      <lb/>belief that her father would approve of her conduct,
	      <lb/>and that she acted consistently with duty, as well
	      <lb/>as inclination, that <persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName> considered further
	      <lb/>discussion useless, and with mingled pleasure and
	      <lb/>apprehension, consented to admit her as the com­
	      <lb/>panion of her hazardous enterprise.</p>
	    <p><persName>Miriam Grey</persName> commenced the preparations for her
	      <lb/>expected departure with an alacrity which surpris­
	      <lb/>ed her friends, who considered an expedition to
	      <lb/>that <emph>distant</emph> part of the country, at any time, and
	      <lb/>especially in a season of public alarm, as too dan­
	      <lb/>gerous to be undertaken, except in cases of urgent
	      <lb/>necessity. For be it remembered, the conveniences
	      <lb/>of steam-boats and stage-coaches, which now tra­
	      <lb/>verse our country from the lakes of <placeName>Canada</placeName> to the
	      <lb/>shores of <placeName>Mexico</placeName>, were then unknown; and a re­
	      <lb/>moval to the savage borders of the great <placeName>Connecti­
		<lb/>cut</placeName>, was an undertaking more formidable than a
	      <lb/>voyage of discovery to the <placeName>North Pole</placeName>, or an ex­
	      <lb/>ploring mission to the interior of <placeName>Africa</placeName> in these
	      <lb/>days of improvement, when a love of scientific re­
	      <lb/>search, or rage for novelty; a desire to instruct the
	      <lb/>world or to amuse themselves, is daily leading men
	      <lb/>to the remotest regions of the earth, and has even
	      <lb/>suggested the ingenious theory of penetrating
	      <lb/>through its centre, as a ready way of facilitating in­
	      <lb/>tercourse between the antipodes. Nay, when the
	      <lb/>earth itself has become too grovelling a sphere of
	      <pb n="081"/>

	      <lb/>action, and the dominions of the air are threatened
	      <lb/>with invasion by a recent petition to Congress,
	      <lb/>praying that honourable body for a patent to con­
	      <lb/>fine the profitable sale of wings to the sole benefit of
	      <lb/>the aspiring inventor.</p>
	    <p>But <persName>Miriam</persName> did not allow herself to indulge
	      <lb/>imaginary fears, or even to dwell on such as wore
	      <lb/>an appearance of reality; once resolved, she was
	      <lb/>unwavering, and those most interested in her hap­
	      <lb/>piness, while they regretted, ceased to oppose her
	      <lb/>design. <persName>Captain Standish</persName> was the most persever­
	      <lb/>ing of her opponents; but, like all the others, he was
	      <lb/>finally obliged to yield to her fixed determination,
	      <lb/>though so highly irritated at his defeat, that it is
	      <lb/>said he gave vent to an almost forgotten <rs type="properAdjective">Dutch</rs>
	      <lb/>oath, which had served him when fighting for <persName>queen
		<lb/>Elizabeth</persName> in the <placeName>Low-Countries</placeName>,—and which, if
	      <lb/>whispered among his <rs type="properAdjective">puritan</rs> brethren, was pro­
	      <lb/>bably overlooked on account of his important ser­
	      <lb/>vices.</p>
	    <p><said>These confounded women,</said> he said to <persName>Calvert</persName>,
	      <lb/>still a guest at his house, <said>are as wrong-headed
		<lb/>and obstinate as mules; but who could have thought
		<lb/>my little rose-bud, with all her sweetness and
		<lb/>smiles, would set up for a will of her own.</said></p>
	    <p><said>The fairest and best of them have a bit of the
		<lb/>old serpent in their hearts;</said> answered <persName>Calvert</persName>, with
	      <lb/>a bitter smile.</p>
	    <p><said>No, no, you are wrong, <persName>Calvert</persName>,</said> replied the
	      <lb/>Captain, <said>their hearts would be well enough, and
		<lb/>it were not for their light heads and fickle minds

		<lb/>which are always leading them into error, and
		<lb/>turning them aside in search of novelty. But I do
		<lb/>believe,</said> he added to himself, rather than to his
	      <lb/>companion, <said>my poor <persName>Miriam</persName> has lost her senses,
		<lb/>gone mad outright,—to turn off my cousin <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName>, as handsome and gallant a young fellow as
		<lb/>ever sued for maiden's favour, or drew sword against
		<lb/>the king's enemies,—and now to leave friends and
		<lb/>home, and throw herself into the very jaws of these
		<lb/>ravenous, heathenish savages.</said></p>
	    <p>As <persName>Captain Standish</persName> paced the room with hur­
	      <lb/>ried steps, and thus yielded to his anger and regret;
	      <lb/>he quite forgot in the excitement of his feelings,
	      <lb/>the caution he had hitherto used in regard to the
	      <lb/>disappointment of <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, which the art
	      <lb/>of <persName>Calvert</persName> had not been able to extort from him;
	      <lb/>but to which he now listened with extreme pleasure,
	      <lb/>feeling his own mortification diminished by the
	      <lb/>conviction that it was shared by his rival.</p>
	    <p><persName>Mr. Weldon</persName> in the mean time, resolved to take
	      <lb/>passage in a small vessel which had put into <placeName>Ply­
		<lb/>mouth</placeName> on its way from <placeName>Cape-Cod</placeName> to <placeName>Boston</placeName>; being
	      <lb/>informed that a vessel was then lading with provi­
	      <lb/>sions at the latter place for the ill-supplied colo­
	      <lb/>nists at <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, in which they would embark
	      <lb/>for the place of their destination.</p>
	    <p>But as the time of their departure drew near,
	      <lb/><persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName> who had certainly said less, and
	      <lb/>probably thought more on the subject than any
	      <lb/>other person, became tormented by his apprehen­
	      <lb/>sions, and excited by a thousand wild hopes and
	      <pb n="083"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="8(4)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">83</mw>
	      <lb/>inconsistent plans. The coldness of <persName>Miriam</persName>, her
	      <lb/>occasional raillery and suspected preference for
	      <lb/>another, had not diminished his affection for her,
	      <lb/>and if he sometimes doubted of success, hope was
	      <lb/>never entirely banished from his breast. His dis­
	      <lb/>position was rather reserved than phlegmatic; he
	      <lb/>had loved her from childhood, his attachment had
	      <lb/>increased with his years, and was decidedly encou­
	      <lb/>raged by the friends of both. The world, which
	      <lb/>always takes the liberty of interfering in such
	      <lb/>affairs, had early declared in consonance with the
	      <lb/>young man's wishes, that it would be a match; and
	      <lb/>more than once had <persName>Master Ashly</persName> been on the
	      <lb/>point of ascertaining from the lips of the damsel,
	      <lb/>if the said world prophesied truly. But at the fated
	      <lb/>moment of disclosure, a feeling of unconquerable
	      <lb/>timidity, or an arch smile lurking on the counte­
	      <lb/>nance of the fair one, invariably called forth his
	      <lb/>awkward bashfulness and completely overawed him.
	      <lb/>Thus years passed on in a state of uncertainty, till
	      <lb/>at length the assiduities of <persName>Major Atherton</persName> and
	      <lb/><persName>Mr. Calvert</persName> aroused his most anxious fears, and
	      <lb/>caused him bitterly to repent the irresolution which
	      <lb/>had so long held him in ignorance of his fate.
	      <lb/>The sudden removal of these formidable rivals,
	      <lb/>however, with the inference naturally drawn from
	      <lb/>it, relieved his mind of an oppressive weight; and
	      <lb/>again finding the field his own, like many other
	      <lb/>indolent and undecided persons, he concluded to
	      <lb/>enjoy his leisure and wait a favourable opportunity
	      <lb/>to decide the combat. His mother in vain entreated
	      <pb n="084"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="8(4)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">84</mw>
	      <lb/>him to secure the prize, while there was no oppo­
	      <lb/>nent to dispute it with him; for she earnestly desired
	      <lb/>the marriage might take place, though sometimes
	      <lb/>piqued to observe the gaiety of <persName>Miriam</persName> rather in­
	      <lb/>creased by the presence of her son; and incline
	      <lb/>to think her strangely deficient in judgment to with­
	      <lb/>hold her regard from so worthy an object. But a
	      <lb/>strong belief which she entertained, in common with
	      <lb/>many other superficial observers, that young wo­
	      <lb/>men are not apt to be sincere in affairs of the heart,
	      <lb/>and that they generally possess the art of veiling
	      <lb/>their real sentiments, or affecting false ones, to
	      <lb/>suit their caprice or designs,—still led her to hope
	      <lb/>for the best; and after all, she could not think that
	      <lb/><persName>Miriam Grey</persName>,—giddy as the young thing sometimes
	      <lb/>seemed,—would really be so foolish as to refuse
	      <lb/>her son, who was born to a good inheritance, and
	      <lb/>withal esteemed comely and well-favoured.</p>
	    <p>When <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName> however found that <persName>Mi­
		<lb/>riam</persName> was actually on the point of leaving <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>,
	      <lb/>he became emboldened by fears for her safety, and
	      <lb/>the dread of losing her; and resolved, if possible,
	      <lb/>to dissuade her from prosecuting her hazardous
	      <lb/>voyage. Yet his resolution was more than once
	      <lb/>frustrated by some trifling interruption, or his
	      <lb/>habitual timidity, when fortune at last presented
	      <lb/>him with an opportunity too favourable to be neg­
	      <lb/>lected. He one day entered the setting-parlour at
	      <lb/><persName>Mr. Grey's</persName>, where <persName>Miriam</persName> chanced to be entirely
	      <lb/>alone, and busily engaged with her needle. She
	      <lb/>received him with her usual courtesy, and after a
	      <pb n="085"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="8(5)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">85</mw>
	      <lb/>few trifling questions, resumed her occupation and
	      <lb/>with it the train of reflections which his entrance
	      <lb/>had interrupted. <persName>Ashly</persName> improved the silence in
	      <lb/>framing a suitable prologue to his intended decla­
	      <lb/>ration; and to prepare the way, he began with
	      <lb/>three distinct hems, which startled <persName>Miriam</persName>, who
	      <lb/>had almost forgotten his presence, and looking up
	      <lb/>to repair her error, she first observed the ominous
	      <lb/>length of his countenance, and the unnatural flush
	      <lb/>which agitated it. His eyes were fixed on her with
	      <lb/>an expression of anxiety, not to say alarm, min­
	      <lb/>gled with tenderness, but which as she did not
	      <lb/>perfectly comprehend their meaning, struck her as
	      <lb/>rather ludicrous, and an involuntary smile over­
	      <lb/>spread her features. <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName> somewhat
	      <lb/>abashed, cast his eyes upon the floor—the ceiling—
	      <lb/>and finally they rested on a looking-glass; and as
	      <lb/><persName>Miriam</persName> had diligently renewed her employment,
	      <lb/>he improved the moment to arrange the knot of
	      <lb/>his neck-kerchief, and smooth his short brown hair,
	      <lb/>—for the best of people love to look well, particu­
	      <lb/>larly at such critical times, when a lady's favour
	      <lb/>is often decided by trifles. <persName>Miriam</persName> was revolving
	      <lb/>in her mind on what subject to address him,—for
	      <lb/>as if it was a matter of the utmost importance, she
	      <lb/>could not at the moment, think of any thing to
	      <lb/>say,—when <persName>Ashly</persName> prevented her any farther trou­
	      <lb/>ble by crossing the room with the utmost gravity,
	      <lb/>and seating himself close beside her. After a brief
	      <lb/>pause he said to her,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>You are about to leave us, <persName>Miriam</persName>, and to so­
		<lb/>journ amidst the perils of a wilderness.</said>
	    </p>
	    <pb n="086"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="8(5)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">86</mw>
	    <p><said>You should not speak to me of perils,</said> said <persName>Mi­
		<lb/>riam</persName>, smiling, <said>rather be so benevolent as to en­
		<lb/>courage me with the hope of better things.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I would fain,</said> said <persName>Ashly</persName>, <said>by exciting your
		<lb/>alarm, prevail on you to alter a determination,
		<lb/>which has caused so much grief and anxiety to
		<lb/>your friends.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Your purpose is vain,</said> replied <persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>I have
		<lb/>already <quote>counted the cost,</quote> and am resolved to
		<lb/>abide by the consequences.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Dear <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> returned <persName>Ashly</persName>, gaining courage
	      <lb/>as he proceeded, <said>will nothing prevail with you?
		<lb/>will you indeed leave all the comforts and delights
		<lb/>of life, to dwell in a far country, even among the
		<lb/>tents of the wandering savages, whose hands are
		<lb/>against every man?</said></p>
	    <p><said>I have no fears for my safety,</said> returned <persName>Miri­
		<lb/>am</persName>; and if I had, it would be my duty to conquer
	      <lb/>them, for the sake of my cousin <persName>Lois</persName>, whose un­
	      <lb/>varying kindness to me from infancy, deserves this
	      <lb/>slight return of grateful attention.</p>
	    <p><said>Before you decide,</said> replied <persName>Ashly</persName>, <said>consider, I
		<lb/>entreat you,—</said></p>
	    <p><said>I am already decided,</said> interrupted <persName>Miriam</persName>, a
	      <lb/>little impatient at his persecution; <said>so I pray you,
		<lb/><persName>Master Ashly</persName>, give up the subject, and suffer me
		<lb/>to follow my inclination in peace.</said></p>
	    <p><said>May the Lord be with you, and prosper you;</said><lb/>said <persName>Ashly</persName>, emphatically; but after a moment's
	      <lb/>pause, he ventured to add, <said><persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, your
		<lb/>father hath sometimes encouraged me to open my
		<pb n="087"/><milestone unit="sig" n="8(6)r"/><mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">87</mw><lb/>heart unto you, and I would now urge a request
		<lb/>which nearly concerns my happiness.</said></p>
	    <p>
	      <said>Be brief then, if it please you; for time is pres­
		<lb/>sing, and I have many engagements, replied <persName>Miri­
		  <lb/>am</persName>, hoping by an air of indifference again to avert
		<lb/>an avowal which she dreaded.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p>But <persName>Mr. Ashly</persName> had apparently nerved himself
	      <lb/>for the undertaking; and though trembling like an
	      <lb/>aspen leaf, he replied,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said><persName>Miriam</persName>, I have long loved you, <quote rend="pre()post()">with a love
		  <lb/>passing that of women</quote>; and even as the patriarch
		<lb/><persName>Jacob</persName> served seven years for the daughter of <persName>La­
		  <lb/>ban</persName>, so have I waited patiently to obtain your
		<lb/>favour, and it hath seemed unto me but a few days.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>This is some new plan, to divert me from my
		<lb/>purpose,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, in confusion; <said>but it is as
		<lb/>vain as every other. I have <quote rend="pre()post()">put my hand to the
		  <lb/>plough, and I cannot look back</quote>.</said>
	      <lb/><said>You do not understand me, <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> replied
	      <lb/><persName>Ashly</persName>. <said>I would no longer seek to detain you
		<lb/>here; but I pray you, if I have found favour in
		<lb/>your eyes, suffer me to go with you; as your hus­
		<lb/>band, I would cheerfully toil for you, nay, I would

	    <p><said>Say not so,</said> replied <persName>Miriam</persName>, affected by the
	      <lb/>earnestness of his appeal; and after a moment of
	      <lb/>painful hesitation, she added, <said>I should be unwor­
		<lb/>thy of your regard were I capable of misleading
		<lb/>you by any false expectations. I have never sought
		<lb/>to deceive you, <persName>Benjamin</persName>, but on the contrary,
		<lb/>have always discouraged the preference which you
		<lb/>early professed for me, and which has long been
		<lb/>sanctioned by our friends; circumstances have
		<lb/>brought us much together, and this familiar inter­
		<lb/>course has discovered to me the integrity of your
		<lb/>character, and interested me in your happiness;
		<lb/>but forgive my frankness, <persName>Ashly</persName>; I must add, our
		<lb/>destinies can never be united; believe me still your
		<lb/>friend, and may the affection of a deserving object
		<lb/>soon lead your thoughts from one who can only
		<lb/>regard you with esteem and gratitude.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Never, never, <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>,</said> exclaimed <persName>Ashly</persName>,

		<lb/>existence.</said></p>
	    <p>He rose from his seat with a flushed countenance,
	      <lb/>and crossed the room with rapid strides, as he
	      <lb/>finished speaking; while <persName>Miriam</persName> remained silent
	      <lb/>and embarrassed, surprised by a display of feeling
	      <lb/>so foreign to his character, and which was pro­
	      <lb/>bably more violent from having been long repress­
	      <lb/>ed. <persName>Ashly</persName> continued standing for several moments,
	      <pb n="089"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="9(1)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">89</mw>
	      <lb/>apparently striving to regain his usual firmness,
	      <lb/>which his habitual self-control soon enabled him to
	      <lb/>effect; and when <persName>Miriam</persName> again raised her eyes,
	      <lb/>every trace of emotion was gone, and his features
	      <lb/>had resumed their customary expression of calm
	      <lb/>and rather gloomy immobility. Nothing could
	      <lb/>have been less becoming or more unfavourable to
	      <lb/>his suit, than this sudden return of composure; it
	      <lb/>instantly relieved the mind of <persName>Miriam</persName>, and con­
	      <lb/>vinced her that he would not long suffer under the
	      <lb/>sting of disappointed hope. She was wondering
	      <lb/>that he remained so long standing and silent, and
	      <lb/>endeavouring to frame some excuse for quitting the
	      <lb/>room, when the voice of <persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName>, singing in a
	      <lb/>low tone, was heard approaching them. <persName>Benjamin
		<lb/>Ashly</persName> started as if electrified, threw a hurried
	      <lb/>glance at the door, and not daring to trust his
	      <lb/>voice in bidding <persName>Miriam</persName> farewell, he took her hand
	      <lb/>and held it for an instant in his own, which trem­
	      <lb/>bled violently, while his features were again strong­
	      <lb/>ly agitated, and without speaking, he precipitately
	      <lb/>left the room.</p>
	    <p><persName>Miriam</persName>, deeply regretting the pain she had un­
	      <lb/>willingly inflicted, concealed the object of his visit
	      <lb/>even from her cousin, who had, however, her own sus­
	      <lb/>picions on the subject, which were increased by the
	      <lb/>absence of <persName>Ashly</persName>, who prudently refrained from see­
	      <lb/>ing <persName>Miriam</persName> again. But three days after, at a dis­
	      <lb/>tance and unobserved, he indulged in a parting
	      <lb/>glimpse, at the moment she was embarking on her
	      <lb/>voyage, surrounded by friends, amongst whom an

	      <lb/>embarrassing consciousness and dread of exposing
	      <lb/>his feelings, restrained him from mingling.</p>
	    <p>The emotions of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> were almost
	      <lb/>overpowering, when she found herself actually
	      <lb/>quitting the home and friends, who had long been
	      <lb/>dear and familiar to her; and, for a time, she was
	      <lb/>tempted to consider her project rash, and to fear
	      <lb/>she had been governed by feelings, rather than pru­
	      <lb/>dence. But as the village of <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> became
	      <lb/>indistinct, and newer prospects opened around her,
	      <lb/>her thoughts were insensibly diverted to other sub­
	      <lb/>jects, and her <choice>
		<sic>spirit</sic> 
		<corr>spirits</corr></choice> gradually recovered their usu­
	      <lb/>al buoyancy, and much of their accustomed gaiety.
	      <lb/>A brisk wind carried them forward, and in less
	      <lb/>than the ordinary time, they were within the spa­
	      <lb/>cious <placeName>Bay of Massachusetts</placeName>. As they entered the
	      <lb/>harbour of <placeName>Boston</placeName>, <persName>Miriam</persName> became again silent and
	      <lb/>abstracted; she observed with restless curiosity
	      <lb/>the different persons who were collected on the
	      <lb/>shore; and <persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName> was at no loss to conjec­
	      <lb/>ture that <persName>Major Atherton</persName> was present to her
	      <lb/>thoughts; but in the imperfect light he was not
	      <lb/>recognized by either of them,—and immediately on
	      <lb/>landing they proceeded to the public inn.</p>

	    <p><persName rend="case(smallcaps)">Miriam Grey</persName> was in the act of speaking, as
	      <lb/>she entered the room, where the landlady of the
	      <lb/>inn had prepared their evening repast; but the
	      <lb/>words died on her lips the instant she recognized
	      <lb/>the features of <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, whose eyes were
	      <lb/>fixed on her with an expression of extreme plea­
	      <lb/>sure, which for the moment absorbed every other
	      <lb/>sensation. <persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName>, who did not at first ob­
	      <lb/>serve him was surprised at the sudden pause, and
	      <lb/>feeling her cousin lean heavily on her arm, she
	      <lb/>looked round to ascertain the cause, and beheld her
	      <lb/>pale as death, and apparently on the verge of faint­
	      <lb/>ing. But the emotion of <persName>Miriam</persName> was as transient,
	      <lb/>as involuntary; and when <persName>Atherton</persName> sprang for­
	      <lb/>ward to support her, she recovered her presence of
	      <lb/>mind, and gently extricating herself from the grasp
	      <lb/>of <persName>Lois</persName>, stood erect with an air of maidenly pride,
	      <lb/>and a countenance glowing with blushes. <persName>Ather­

		<lb/>ton</persName> respected the delicacy of her feelings, while his
	      <lb/>heart thrilled with the delightful consciousness,
	      <lb/>that he possessed an influence over them; and
	      <lb/>without appearing to notice her embarassment, he
	      <lb/>merely bowed, and turning to <persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName>, said,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>I scarcely hoped for the pleasure of seeing my
		<lb/><placeName>Plymouth</placeName> friends so soon; and even now my plea­
		<lb/>sure is mingled with apprehension.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>We have become travellers from necessity,
		<lb/>more than inclination,</said> returned <persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName>;
	      <lb/><said>but, if our voyage continues as prosperous as it
		<lb/>has been hitherto, we shall have cause to <quote>sing of
		  <lb/>mercy,</quote> rather than of <quote>judgment.</quote></said></p>
	    <p><said>You must have suffered from cold and sickness
		<lb/>and fatigue,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName> addressing <persName>Miriam</persName>,
	      <lb/><said>at this inclement season, when even the weather-
		<lb/>beaten fishermen, gladly retreat to the shelter of
		<lb/>their cabins.</said></p>
	    <p><said>We have not suffered from any cause,</said> replied
	      <lb/><persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>and indeed, our short voyage has been
		<lb/>in every respect more comfortable and pleasant
		<lb/>than we had any reason to expect.</said></p>
	    <p><said>But you do look ill;</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, regarding
	      <lb/>her with anxiety, and she was really much thinner
	      <lb/>than when he saw her last, <said>you cannot, ought not
		<lb/>to pursue this voyage <persName>Miriam</persName>, if, as <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName>
		<lb/>has intimated, you have formed the rash design of
		<lb/>going to the savage regions of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>.</said></p>
	    <p><said>And why,</said> asked <persName>Miriam</persName> with simplicity, <said>is it
		<lb/>more rash in me than in my cousin <persName>Lois</persName>, who has
		<lb/>never hesitated for a moment on its propriety or
		<lb/>necessity?</said></p>

	    <p><said>Probably,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, a little embarrassed
	      <lb/>by the question, <said rend="pre()"><persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName> considers herself
		<lb/>bound to follow her husband, wherever his circum­
		<lb/>stances lead him; and I should scarcely venture to
		<lb/>obtrude my opinion, when she has one so much
		<lb/>more capable of advising her.</said></p>
	    <p><said>And I,</said> returned <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>have had many sage
		<lb/>advisers, but as you see, have turned a deaf ear to
		<lb/>them all; <persName>Captain Standish</persName> will tell you, <persName>Major
		  <lb/>Atherton</persName>, that I am a self-willed girl, because I
		<lb/>would not take heed to his counsels, for which,
		<lb/>however, I am grateful, though he professes not to
		<lb/>believe it.</said></p>
	    <p><said>You would warn me not to adventure where so
		<lb/>many have failed,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, smiling; <said>but if
		<lb/>I submit, it will be from necessity, not conviction,
		<lb/>that my advice is incorrect.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Here is our hostess bringing in supper, and it is
		<lb/>truly welcome;</said> said <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName>. <said>You will sit
		<lb/>down with us I hope, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, though your
		<lb/>appetite is not like ours, sharpened by sea-breezes.</said></p>
	    <p><persName>Atherton</persName> did not wait for the invitation to be re­
	      <lb/>peated; he seated himself opposite to <persName>Miriam</persName>, and
	      <lb/>the cheerful meal was passed in animated and ge­
	      <lb/>neral conversation. <persName>Miriam</persName> was again all gaiety
	      <lb/>and smiles, and both to her and <persName>Atherton</persName>, the past
	      <lb/>and future were unthought of, the present a scene
	      <lb/>of exquisite enjoyment; and when <persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName> re­
	      <lb/>minded her cousin that it was time to retire, they
	      <lb/>separated with a sigh of regret, as if awakened
	      <lb/>from a dream of enchantment. <persName>Atherton</persName> remained

	      <lb/>in a musing posture for some moments after they
	      <lb/>left the room, till <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName> rose, and bidding
	      <lb/>him good night, was about to follow them, when
	      <lb/><persName>Atherton</persName> started from his seat, and in an earnest
	      <lb/>voice said to him,—</p>
	    <p><said>Is it too late, sir, to dissuade <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>
		<lb/>from her mad resolution? cannot we yet prevail
		<lb/>on her to renounce it and remain here in safety?</said></p>
	    <p><said>Remain with whom?</said> asked <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName>, rath­
	      <lb/>er sarcastically; but he instantly continued in a
	      <lb/>graver tone, <said>not I believe if there is stability
		<lb/>in woman, and few even of maturer years possess
		<lb/>more than <persName>Miriam</persName>; she has resisted the entreaties
		<lb/>of all her friends, and it is not probable will now
		<lb/>be induced to abandon her enterprize.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Is there no one who has influence enough to de­
		<lb/>tain her?</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>. <said>Surely is is the duty
		<lb/>of all who are interested in her happiness to lift
		<lb/>up their voices against an undertaking so replete
		<lb/>with dangers.</said></p>
	    <p><said>She has listened to the opinion of her friends
		<lb/>touching this matter,</said> returned <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName>; <said>but
		<lb/>her father was wont to entrust much to her discre­
		<lb/>tion, and no person in his absence has authority to
		<lb/>controul her. For my own part I frankly confess
		<lb/>my responsibility and anxiety for her almost over­
		<lb/>balance the pleasure which her society gives us.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Then,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName> eagerly, <said>you will con­
		<lb/>sent to leave her, if any arguments can succeed in
		<lb/>gaining her acquiescence.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Her decision has been voluntary,</said> said Mr.

	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">95</mw>
	      <lb/><persName>Weldon</persName>, <said>and I have reason to believe it unaltera­
		<lb/>ble; at all events, I am sure she would sooner lay
		<lb/>down her life than deviate in the least from the
		<lb/>straight line of duty and principle.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Far be it from me,</said> replied <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>to offer
		<lb/>any inducements inconsistent with the purity and
		<lb/>rectitude of her mind and character; I may appear
		<lb/>officious to you, sir, and perhaps to her; but I can­
		<lb/>not—I have no wish to conceal the deep interest
		<lb/>which I feel in her welfare and happiness.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I am convinced,</said> said <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName> after a mo­
	      <lb/>ment's pause, <said>that nothing but the known wishes
		<lb/>of her father would now prevail with <persName>Miriam</persName> to
		<lb/>relinquish her design; and indeed all circumstan­
		<lb/>ces considered, I am far from wishing her to do so.
		<lb/>To-morrow, if the wind is favourable we shall
		<lb/>proceed on our voyage; for we are now anxious to
		<lb/>reach the place of our destination.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I will not detain you longer from your needful
		<lb/>repose,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>; and with the usual compli­
	      <lb/>ments they separated for the night.</p>
	    <p><persName>Atherton</persName> retired to a small ill-furnished apart­
	      <lb/>ment,—for he resigned his own to the travellers—
	      <lb/>but with a mind too fully occupied by painful
	      <lb/>thoughts and anticipations, to regard its deficien­
	      <lb/>cies or incongruities. He thought the tedious
	      <lb/>night would never pass away, and often through
	      <lb/>its heavy watches he looked anxiously from the
	      <lb/>window, noted every twinkling star, and followed
	      <lb/>with his eye the light clouds which flitted over the
	      <lb/>heavens, hoping they would collect and retard the
	      <lb/>departure of <persName>Miriam</persName> for at least another day.</p>
	    <pb n="096"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="9(4)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">96</mw>
	    <p>The sun, however, rose with unwonted brillian­
	      <lb/>cy on the following morning; but <persName>Atherton's</persName> im­
	      <lb/>mediate apprehensions were quieted, on learning
	      <lb/>that the wind was still unfavourable for a voyage
	      <lb/>to the <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>. Delighted with this reprieve,
	      <lb/>and not doubting that he should find an opportuni­
	      <lb/>ty of conversing alone with <persName>Miriam</persName> in the course
	      <lb/>of the day, he again yielded to the illusions of
	      <lb/>hope; and joined <persName>Mrs. Weldon's</persName> breakfast table,
	      <lb/>with a countenance from which every trace of sad­
	      <lb/>ness was banished. But <persName>Miriam</persName>, though cheerful
	      <lb/>was less gay than on the preceding evening; and
	      <lb/>as soon as the repast was finished, she retired with
	      <lb/><persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName> to their own apartments. <persName>Atherton</persName>
	      <lb/>scarcely saw her again during the day, except at
	      <lb/>dinner, and though more than once on the point of
	      <lb/>requesting a moment's conversation with her, the
	      <lb/>dread of refusal restrained him, and he deferred it,
	      <lb/>still hoping that accident would favour him with
	      <lb/>the desired interview. He fancied too that <persName>Miriam</persName>
	      <lb/>intentionally avoided him; and piqued by conduct
	      <lb/>so different from her usual frankness, he was again
	      <lb/>inclined to accuse her of caprice and fickleness.
	      <lb/>When they met at supper <persName>Atherton</persName> was silent and
	      <lb/>abstracted; and the moment they rose from table
	      <lb/>he pleaded an engagement at the Governor's, and
	      <lb/>with a slight apology left them for the evening.
	      <lb/>As he looked back on closing the door he caught
	      <lb/>the eye of <persName>Miriam</persName> following him, with an expres­
	      <lb/>sion so soft and almost tearful, that for an instant
	      <lb/>his resolution wavered;—but she turned from him
	      <pb n="097"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="9(5)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">97</mw>
	      <lb/>with a deep blush, ashamed of his weakness he
	      <lb/>instantly retired. Yet the parting look of <persName>Miriam</persName>
	      <lb/>still pursued him. <said>I am too hasty, I have judged
		<lb/>her unkindly,</said> he thought;—and instead of going
	      <lb/>to the Governor's, after walking and musing for
	      <lb/>about an half hour he returned to the inn in the
	      <lb/>hope of seeing her.</p>
	    <p><persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName> were gone out, and <persName>Mi­
		<lb/>riam</persName> had excused herself from accompanying them
	      <lb/>by saying she had some arrangements to make for
	      <lb/>her voyage, and wished to retire early to bed. She
	      <lb/>was alone in a parlour appropriated particularly
	      <lb/>to their use, and looking attentively from a win­
	      <lb/>dow which commanded a view of the town and har­
	      <lb/>bour, when <persName>Atherton</persName> returned and entered the
	      <lb/>room ignorant by whom it was occupied. It was
	      <lb/>yet early in the evening, and the bright blaze of a
	      <lb/>wood fire threw a glare around the apartment, and
	      <lb/>quite eclipsed the feeble light of a candle which
	      <lb/>flickered in its socket, and whose long black wick
	      <lb/>showed that the thoughts of <persName>Miriam</persName> were wander­
	      <lb/>ing to other subjects. As <persName>Atherton</persName> opened the
	      <lb/>door she looked hastily round to see who was en­
	      <lb/>tering, and her recognition was evinced by her
	      <lb/>heightened complexion as she again turned to­
	      <lb/>wards the window and continued to gaze on the
	      <lb/>scene without. <persName>Atherton's</persName> resentment, his suspi­
	      <lb/>cions—all were forgotten; and in an instant he
	      <lb/>was by her side.</p>
	    <p><said>Are you admiring this winter scenery, <persName>Mi­
		  <lb/>riam</persName>?</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>. <said>I should think it too

	    <p><said>The most familiar scenes,</said> replied <persName>Miriam</persName> with
	      <lb/>still averted face, <said>are generally those which give
		<lb/>us the greatest pleasure; they are associated in
		<lb/>our minds with all that the heart most prizes and
		<lb/>best enjoys.</said></p>
	    <p><said>But here,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>there is nothing to
		<lb/>awaken such associations; you are in a strange
		<lb/>land, where there are no objects to remind you of
		<lb/>home and its enjoyments.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Indeed there are many, very many,</said> replied <persName>Mi­
		<lb/>riam</persName>; <said>these dazzling snows, and that boundless
		<lb/>ocean, have been familiar to me from infancy; and
		<lb/>the <quote>moon walking in her brightness through the
		  <lb/>heavens,</quote> is even now shining on the forsaken home
		<lb/>of my childhood; and think you I can look upon it
		<lb/>without emotions of melancholy pleasure?</said></p>
	    <p><said>Impossible!</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, earnestly, <said>and ne­
		<lb/>ver, <persName>Miriam</persName>, have I gazed upon its calm beauty,
		<lb/>since banished from your presence, without thril­
		<lb/>ling recollections of those happy moments, when
		<lb/>with you I was wont to see it slowly rising above
		<lb/>the shores of <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, and throwing its silver light
		<lb/>through the vine-covered casement where I was
		<lb/>permitted to see and converse with you;—where,
		<lb/>dearest <persName>Miriam</persName>, I dared to indulge those dreams of
		<lb/>happiness which you have so cruelly disappointed.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Speak not of the past,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, hastily,
	      <lb/>and with a trembling voice; <said>it is like a vision of
		<lb/>delight which has faded away, and ought to be for­
		<lb/>gotten—when this moon now shining in glory, be­
		<lb/>gins to wane in her course, I shall behold its part­
		<pb n="099"/>

		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">99</mw>
		<lb/>ing rays reflected on the waves of the broad <placeName>Con­
		  <lb/>necticut</placeName>.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Be it so,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, with impassioned ener­
	      <lb/>gy, <said>and there also will I be beside you. It is in
		<lb/>vain, <persName>Miriam</persName>, that you fly from me, that you re­
		<lb/>nounce me, that you seek to separate my fate from
		<lb/>yours; wherever your path may lead you, across
		<lb/>the deep waters, or through the trackless desert;
		<lb/>in the sunshine of prosperity, or beneath the dark
		<lb/>sky of adversity,—there will I be with you, and
		<lb/>nought but death shall have power to disunite us.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Why,</said> asked <persName>Miriam</persName>, reproachfully, <said>will you
		<lb/>force me to regret that I have ever known you?
		<lb/>why, <persName>Atherton</persName>, do you persecute me with a love
		<lb/>which I can never recompense?</said></p>
	    <p>
	      <said>Say that you despise me, <persName>Miriam</persName>, that I am an
		<lb/>object of aversion to you, that, were there no other
		<lb/>obstacle to our union, your indifference would di­
		<lb/>vide us—say all this, but do not look at me with an
		<lb/>eye of pity—do not cheat me with that voice of ten­
		<lb/>derness, which creates a thousand hopes at the mo­
		<lb/>ment it seeks to annihilate them.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>I do pity you from my heart,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, al­
	      <lb/>most subdued by emotion; <said>but what avails it? we
		<lb/><emph>must</emph> separate, <persName>Atherton</persName>, and let not these parting
		<lb/>moments be embittered by unavailing regrets.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Pity me!</said> repeated <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>say that you love
		<lb/>me, <persName>Miriam</persName>, that you will love me, and me alone,
		<lb/>through weal and woe, and on that sweet assurance
		<lb/>I will rest my hopes of brighter and happier days.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Why,</said> replied <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>should you wish to ex­
		<pb n="100"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="9(6)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">100</mw>
		<lb/>tort from me a confession which ought not to pass
		<lb/>my lips! No, <persName>Atherton</persName>, we must henceforth learn
		<lb/>to think of each other as voyagers, who, for a few
		<lb/>brief and smiling days have floated together along
		<lb/>the current of time, till our frail barks were driven
		<lb/>asunder, never perhaps to meet again, until launch­
		<lb/>ed into the ocean of eternity.</said></p>
	    <p>
	      <said>And are you, <persName>Miriam</persName>, thus indifferent? thus
		<lb/>reckless of the past, and careless for the future?
		<lb/>does the memory of joys that are gone, awaken no
		<lb/>throb of tenderness? and can you look through the
		<lb/>long vista of coming years—darkened by disap­
		<lb/>pointed hope,—without one sigh of regret? then,
		<lb/>indeed have I deeply, fatally deceived myself.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>The wicked only can be long and truly wretch­
		<lb/>ed,</said> answered <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>and God I trust will give
		<lb/>us grace to bear whatever his Providence ordains.
		<lb/>If you truly love me, <persName>Atherton</persName>, do not render more
		<lb/>keen the misery of this parting hour.—I have left
		<lb/>the friends of my childhood and youth, and forsak­
		<lb/>en the home of my father—I have looked with an
		<lb/>undaunted eye on the perils which may encompass
		<lb/>me whither I am going, and till now I have endur­
		<lb/>ed with fortitude—alas! if I had not again seen
		<lb/>you, I should have been spared the trial of this mo­
		<lb/>ment—the anguish of another, a final separation!</said></p>
	    <p><persName>Miriam</persName> turned from him agitated and confused,
	      <lb/>and fearful that she had expressed too much in the
	      <lb/>warmth of her feelings; but <persName>Atherton</persName>, regarding
	      <lb/>her varying countenance with renovated hope, ex­
	      <lb/>claimed,—</p>

	    <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">101</mw>
	    <p>
	      <said>And why should we part, dearest <persName>Miriam</persName>? I
		<lb/>know, I feel that you love me, and surely the hearts
		<lb/>which God has united, it were impious in man to
		<lb/>tear asunder!</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>If you would retain my esteem,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>,
	      <lb/><said>if you value my love, which I have perhaps too
		<lb/>lightly given, do not tempt me to forget my duty;
		<lb/>believe me, <persName>Atherton</persName>, it is dearer to me than any
		<lb/>selfish gratification, even than your affection, much
		<lb/>as I have learned to prize it.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Dear <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> replied <persName>Atherton</persName>, with tender­
	      <lb/>ness, and taking her passive hands between his own,
	      <lb/><said>this is indeed a recompense for all I suffered, and
		<lb/>for all that fate may yet have in store for me! But
		<lb/>I would again ask, why should we part? have you
		<lb/>not confidence enough in my honour and principles,
		<lb/>to entrust your happiness in my keeping? say,
		<lb/>dearest <persName>Miriam</persName>, that you will be mine, and let us
		<lb/>not delay to be united by the most holy ties!</said></p>
	    <p><said>I entreat you to forbear, <persName>Atherton</persName>,</said> replied <persName>Mi­
		<lb/>riam</persName>; <said>you are led away by passion, and forget the
		<lb/>delicacy becoming my sex, and the respect due to
		<lb/>your own character. Would not the world justly
		<lb/>name me with reproach, should I forsake the friends
		<lb/>to whom my father entrusted me, and abandon an
		<lb/>enterprise in which I am engaged by every feeling of
		<lb/>gratitude and affection—to become the wife of a stran­
		<lb/>ger—one, whose attachment my father disapproves,
		<lb/>and whose religion is regarded with aversion?
		<lb/>Nay, hear me patiently—would your esteem and

		<lb/>confidence in me remain undiminished, were my con­
		<lb/>duct such as to lessen me in the public estimation?</said></p>
	    <p>
	      <said>Yes, dear <persName>Miriam</persName>, I should love you the more,
		<lb/>for rising superior to such illiberal prejudices.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>Is the opinion of the wise and virtuous to be
		<lb/>regarded as an illiberal prejudice?</said> asked <persName>Miriam</persName>;
	      <lb/><said>no, <persName>Atherton</persName>, my own heart would be the first to
		<lb/>condemn me, and for worlds I would not tempt its
		<lb/>upbraidings.</said></p>
	    <p><said><persName>Miriam</persName>, you are too scrupulous,</said> replied <persName>Ather­
		<lb/>ton</persName>; <said>what is it you dread, what law are you trans­
		<lb/>gressing, by entering into an alliance with me? do
		<lb/>we not worship the same God, and what matters it
		<lb/>that we differ in outward ceremonies? You know
		<lb/>that I have ever manifested the most sincere respect
		<lb/>for the religious faith which is so dear to you, which
		<lb/>my mother taught me to love; and I should be far
		<lb/>from wishing you to renounce it for that which I
		<lb/>profess; and surely under such circumstances it
		<lb/>would be bigotry in the extreme, to condemn our
		<lb/>union—your father cannot refuse his sanction—he
		<lb/>will not withhold his forgiveness, even if you wait
		<lb/>not for his consent—dearest <persName>Miriam</persName>, give me one
		<lb/>smile of encouragement, or rather say that you will
		<lb/>receive me for your happy, your devoted husband.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I have encouraged you too much already by
		<lb/>my rash avowal;</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, after a moment's
	      <lb/>pause, <said>I have exposed to you the weakness of my
		<lb/>heart, and you take advantage of it to urge a re­
		<lb/>quest in which, however, I can never acquiesce. I
		<lb/>fear your love is selfish, <persName>Atherton</persName>, or you would not
		<pb n="103"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="10(2)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">103</mw>
		<lb/>wish me to gratify it, at the expense of any ho­
		<lb/>nourable feeling.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Forgive me, <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>, with
	      <lb/>emotion, <said>if I have said aught, which can justify
		<lb/>that conclusion. Heaven is my witness, that your 
		<lb/>happiness is dearer to me than any earthly object,
		<lb/>than life itself; and if I have urged you beyond
		<lb/>the bounds of prudence or delicacy, attribute it to
		<lb/>the extent of my affection, and the dread of los­
		<lb/>ing you; and believe me, I will in future en­
		<lb/>deavour to submit more cheerfully to your de­
		<lb/>cisions.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I am but too ready to believe all that you wish
		<lb/>to;</said> replied <persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>and it is only when duty in­
		<lb/>terposes her authority, that I can prove inexora­
		<lb/>ble to your entreaties.</said></p>
	    <p><said>May her rigid interdiction be soon removed,</said><lb/>said <persName>Atherton</persName>, earnestly. <said>And yet dear <persName>Miriam</persName>,
		<lb/>I cannot without trembling apprehension, think of
		<lb/>your father's prejudices,—his stern notions of pro­
		<lb/>priety, which may in an instant crush all my
		<lb/>fondly raised expectations, and again consign me
		<lb/>to misery.</said></p>
	    <p><said>We will not borrow trouble from the future,</said><lb/>answered <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said><quote>sufficient for the day is the
		  <lb/>evil thereof.</quote> Still, <persName>Atherton</persName>, let us not be too
		<lb/>sanguine of success;—the result is uncertain, and
		<lb/>it is wise to prepare our minds for disappoint­
		<lb/>ment.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Do not speak of it, <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>,
	      <lb/>impatiently; <said>suffer me at least to enjoy the fu­
		<pb n="104"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="10(2)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">104</mw>
		<lb/>ture, since present happiness is denied me. To
		<lb/>part with you, were alone enough of misery; but
		<lb/>to see you go forth to danger and suffering—tell
		<lb/>me, <persName>Miriam</persName>, what duty impels you to such scenes?
		<lb/>why should you not even now abandon your rash
		<lb/>design, and return to the friends who you are
		<lb/>assured, will receive you with smiles of affection­
		<lb/>ate welcome?</said></p>
	    <p><said>Do not speak of it, it is impossible,</said> said <persName>Mi­
		<lb/>riam</persName> with emotion; <said>suffer me to depart, <persName>Ather­
		  <lb/>ton</persName>; our conference has already been too long.</said></p>
	    <p>She endeavoured to withdraw her hand from him,
	      <lb/>as she spoke; but he held it firmly, and said in an
	      <lb/>anxious voice,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>Stay yet a moment, <persName>Miriam</persName>, and tell me, if you
		<lb/>have well considered the perils of your undertak­
		<lb/>ing? the hardships you may be called to encount­
		<lb/>er, from want and its attendant evils, and above
		<lb/>all, from the fury of those barbarous savages,
		<lb/>who are even now spreading terror throughout
		<lb/>the scattered colonies? Oh, <persName>Miriam</persName>, my heart
		<lb/>bleeds at the bare possibility that you may be
		<lb/>left to suffer, in a land of strangers and bar­
		<lb/>barians!</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>I have thought of all, of every thing,</said> said <persName>Mi­
		<lb/>riam</persName>; <said>but I am in the protection of One, who
		<lb/>will keep me <quote>under the shadow of his wings in
		  <lb/>safety,</quote> and who is alike present in every place.
		<lb/>Do not seek to persuade me, <persName>Atherton</persName>, you may
		<lb/>agitate me by your fears, but you cannot alter my
		<lb/>determination.</said></p>

	    <p><said>I well know your perseverance, in what you
		<lb/>regard a duty,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>but is it a
		<lb/>duty, <persName>Miriam</persName>, to rush into certain danger? think,
		<lb/>if evil should befal you, it will <quote>bring down your
		  <lb/>father's gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</quote></said></p>
	    <p><said>And should I shrink from a dangerous duty?</said><lb/>asked <persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>would not that father blush for
		<lb/>the weakness of a daughter so unworthy of pa­
		<lb/>rents, who dared and suffered without fear, in the
		<lb/>cause of liberty and religion? No, <persName>Atherton</persName>, you
		<lb/>entreat me in vain—it shall not be said that I
		<lb/>yielded to the language of passion, when I was deaf
		<lb/>to the voice of reason and friendship—or that like
		<lb/>a weak girl, I turned back to enjoy the society of
		<lb/>one for whom with capricious fondness, I forsook
		<lb/>the friend who cherished me in infancy, and neg­
		<lb/>lected the commands of an absent father.</said></p>
	    <p>
	      <said>That shall not be said, dear <persName>Miriam</persName>; only go
		<lb/>to the safe shelter of the home you have abandoned,
		<lb/>and the most fastidious shall not have cause to
		<lb/>reproach you. I will remove far from you,—again
		<lb/>become a wanderer of the earth, and however
		<lb/>painful the self-denial, refrain from seeing you,
		<lb/>until your father shall return and decide my des­
		<lb/>tiny.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>Do not urge me on this, on any subject;</said> said
	      <lb/><persName>Miriam</persName>, affected by his earnestness; <said>you will
		<lb/>make me hate myself, as the cause of your unhap­
		<lb/>piness and anxiety—let me leave you, <persName>Atherton</persName>; I
		<lb/>cannot, must not grant your request.</said></p>

		<lb/>leave you to contend with dangers, which my arm
		<lb/>might avert from you.</said></p>
	    <p><said>My trust is not in an arm of flesh,</said> said <persName>Mi­

		<lb/>a sparrow falls to the ground. Dear <persName>Atherton</persName>,</said>
	      <lb/>she added with a glowing cheek, and faltering
	      <lb/>voice, <said>we <emph>must</emph> separate; but let us remember
		<lb/>each other daily in our prayers, and cherish the
		<lb/>hope, that God, in his own good time, will grant us
		<lb/>a happier meeting: but should we not be permit­
		<lb/>ted to meet again in this vale of tears, there are
		<lb/>brighter mansions above, where the pain of parting
		<lb/>is never felt, and the distinctions of faith and wor­
		<lb/>ship are unknown.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Dearest <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>there is not
		<lb/>a moment of my existence, in which you are ab­
		<lb/>sent from my mind; your image is blended with
		<lb/>every thought, it is the spring of every hope, the
		<lb/>inspirer of every pleasure,—and can you blame
		<lb/>me, that I reluctantly resign the delight and trea­
		<lb/>sure of my soul? Oh <persName>Miriam</persName>, the thought that
		<lb/>your heart may grow cold and change, is to me
		<lb/>more bitter than death<sic>?</sic></said></p> 
	    <p><said>Fear it not!</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, raising her tearful
	      <lb/>eyes to his; <said><persName>Atherton</persName>, you have wrung from me
		<lb/>the secret of my love, and now why should I blush
		<lb/>to assure you, that neither time, nor suffering, nor
		<lb/>reproach, can ever eradicate it from my heart.</said></p>

	      <lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>it shall be like a precious talisman, to

	      <lb/>less, with a strong westerly wind; and soon after
	      <lb/>sun-rise, <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName> and his fair companions, re­
	      <lb/>commenced their wintry voyage towards the wild­
	      <lb/>erness of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>. <persName>Major Atherton</persName> stood on
	      <lb/>the sea-shore, straining his eyes to catch a last
	      <lb/>glimpse of the vessel, as it rapidly disappeared;
	      <lb/>and feeling as if every wave which bore it on­
	      <lb/>ward, opposed an impassable barrier, between him­
	      <lb/>self and the object of his affections. When it was
	      <lb/>no longer visible, and even the white sails had
	      <lb/>fluttered for the last time in his view, and sunk
	      <lb/>below the horizon, he continued to stand and gaze
	      <lb/>till finding himself regarded with curiosity, he re­
	      <lb/>luctantly retired from the spot.</p>
	    <p>Week after week passed away, and <persName>Atherton</persName>
	      <lb/>mingled as usual in society, though often with an
	      <lb/>abstracted mind, and a heart filled with anxiety
	      <lb/>respecting the fate of <persName>Miriam</persName>. The return of the
	      <lb/>vessel however, at length brought him a few lines
	      <lb/>from <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName>, informing him that they had
	      <lb/>reached <placeName>Hartford</placeName> in safety, after a prosperous
	      <lb/>voyage, and were then comfortably situated and

	      <lb/>provided with all the necessaries of life. The let­
	      <lb/>ter contained few particulars, but it greatly re­
	      <lb/>lieved <persName>Atherton's</persName> apprehensions, and by degrees
	      <lb/>the situation and prospects of <persName>Miriam</persName> became a
	      <lb/>subject of less painful solicitude to his thoughts.
	      <lb/>Still with all his exertions and all his resolutions,
	      <lb/>he passed many moments of extreme dejection; and
	      <lb/>the long and gloomy months of winter seemed al­
	      <lb/>most interminable.</p>
	    <p>The political and religious dissensions, which
	      <lb/>disturbed the infancy of <placeName>Boston</placeName>, were about that
	      <lb/>time carried to their height; and in every place,
	      <lb/>they became subjects of discussion, often of ran­
	      <lb/>cour and personal animosity. The administration
	      <lb/>of <persName>Governor Vane</persName>,—which, even at this day ap­
	      <lb/>pears equivocal,—was defended with zeal or ar­
	      <lb/>raigned with acrimony, according to the different
	      <lb/>views and feelings of the individuals who judged
	      <lb/>him, with a degree of freedom which is still con­
	      <lb/>sidered lawful in the subjects of a free govern­
	      <lb/>ment, who, whether competent or not, regard it as
	      <lb/>their birth-right to speak unreservedly of the con­
	      <lb/>duct and character of their rulers.</p>
	    <p>But the golden apple of discord, was the ill-
	      <lb/>fated <persName>Mrs. Hutchinson</persName>,—then according to the
	      <lb/>opinion of her friends, in the zenith of glory,—
	      <lb/>and of her opponents, in the depths of humiliation.
	      <lb/>The boldness of her spirit defied all opposition, and
	      <lb/>far from yielding to the anathema's fulminated
	      <lb/>against her, she took up the gauntlet and waged a
	      <lb/>zealous war with both magistrates and clergy.

	      <lb/>Her enthusiasm, and apparent sincerity of devo­
	      <lb/>tion, with a winning address and most persuasive
	      <lb/>eloquence, both in her private conversation and
	      <lb/>public exhortations, which were always seasoned
	      <lb/>with the <quote>odour of sanctity,</quote> gained her numerous
	      <lb/>converts, particularly among her own sex. En­
	      <lb/>couraged by success, perhaps inclined to shew her
	      <lb/>contempt for all authority, she set up a weekly
	      <lb/>lecture at her own house, to instruct and edify the
	      <lb/>sisters, where it was her custom to repeat the sub­
	      <lb/>stances of the discourses, which had been delivered
	      <lb/>on the preceding <name>sabbath</name>, and to add her own re­
	      <lb/>marks and expositions by way of improvement.
	      <lb/>A very few of the clergy who adopted her senti­
	      <lb/>ments, or at least palliated them, she declared to
	      <lb/>be under a <term>covenant of grace</term>; while those, who
	      <lb/>stigmatised her errors, and ceased not in public
	      <lb/>and private, to denounce her as a leader of Anti­
	      <lb/>nomianism,—one who taught from the very dregs
	      <lb/>of Familism,—she pronounced to be under a <term>co­
		<lb/>venant of works;</term> and into these two parties, the
	      <lb/>whole colony was at length divided.</p>
	    <p>It is not surprising that this universal excite­
	      <lb/>ment alarmed the friends of peace and good order;
	      <lb/>but unfortunately personal dislike and animosity,
	      <lb/>warped even the coolest judgments, and rankled in
	      <lb/>the most benevolent hearts; with unchristian viru­
	      <lb/>lence they resorted to threats and persecution, and
	      <lb/>like <persName>Saul of <placeName>Tarsus</placeName></persName>, believed they were <quote>doing
		<lb/>God service.</quote> Even the calm and lenient <persName>Win­
		<lb/>throp</persName>, and the heavenly-minded <persName>Eliot</persName>, laid aside

	      <lb/>the spirit of charity and forgiveness which usually
	      <lb/>influenced them, and took part in the controversy,
	      <lb/>and assisted to condemn that unhappy woman.
	      <lb/>The ministers from the neighbouring, and even
	      <lb/>distant towns, resorted to <placeName>Boston</placeName>, to learn the truth
	      <lb/>of the reports which were rapidly circulated; and
	      <lb/>if needful to lend their aid to suppress the disor­
	      <lb/>der; but the contagion had spread too far, and
	      <lb/><persName>Mrs. Hutchinson</persName> daily increased the evil, by ad­
	      <lb/>vancing some new and absurd doctrine of theology,
	      <lb/>which she maintained with a subtlety of argument,
	      <lb/>and a versatility of talent, perplexing the sound­
	      <lb/>est minds, and giving to error the appearance of
	      <lb/>consistency and truth. She was evidently favour­
	      <lb/>ed by <persName>Governor Vane</persName>; and it was probably owing
	      <lb/>to his influence that her trial and consequent ba­
	      <lb/>nishment, were deferred until another season.</p>
	    <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> prudently preserved a strict
	      <lb/>neutrality on these subjects of contention; as he
	      <lb/>had been kindly admonished to do by <persName>Mr. Win­
		<lb/>throp</persName>, when in the warmth of his feelings, he once
	      <lb/>ventured to defend the character of <persName>Mrs. Hutchin­
		<lb/>son</persName>, whom he really believed far less culpable
	      <lb/>than her adversaries were willing to allow.
	      <lb/>Though led away by an extreme of fanaticism,
	      <lb/>which had blighted her character, and perverted
	      <lb/>her stong and highly gifted mind,—a mind ca­
	      <lb/>pable under other circumstances, of ranking her
	      <lb/>with the most distinguished of her sex,—he thought
	      <lb/>she might, and doubtless did believe herself actua­
	      <lb/>ted by a sense of duty, and a desire of being ex­

	      <lb/>tensively useful. <persName>Atherton</persName>, however, soon became
	      <lb/>weary of topics which were often introduced and
	      <lb/>discussed with acrimony, even in the domestic and
	      <lb/>social circle; for from the Governor to the mean­
	      <lb/>est dependent on his bounty, every individual es­
	      <lb/>poused the cause of one or other of the rival par­
	      <lb/>ties, and argued on the different points of doctrine
	      <lb/>as inclination or interest or conviction dictated;
	      <lb/>and with a zeal, which blazed without light, and
	      <lb/>a faith which had little regard to the law of cha­
	      <lb/>rity. <persName>Atherton</persName> vainly hoped to indulge again in
	      <lb/>the interchange of rational and friendly senti­
	      <lb/>ments, which he had so much enjoyed, before the
	      <lb/>influence of passion and prejudice banished the
	      <lb/>kindlier feelings from the heart, and substituted
	      <lb/>crude systems of divinity, and polemic disquisition
	      <lb/>for those subjects of general interest, which at
	      <lb/>once exercised the mind and affections, and gave
	      <lb/>indulgence to the flow of harmless wit, and chas­
	      <lb/>tened gaiety. He often resolved to return to <placeName>Ply­
		<lb/>mouth</placeName>; but still delayed from day to day, in the
	      <lb/>hope that by remaining in <placeName>Boston</placeName>, he should soon­
	      <lb/>er receive intelligence from <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>,—whither
	      <lb/>he would most gladly have gone, had he not felt
	      <lb/>restrained by respect for the wishes of <persName>Miriam
		<lb/>Grey</persName>; indeed, he had promised her at the moment
	      <lb/>of parting, that none but the most urgent motives
	      <lb/>should induce him to follow her.</p>
	    <p>Towards the close of winter these local dissen­
	      <lb/>sions yielded, in a great measure, to subjects of
	      <lb/>more general interest. The aggressions of the

	      <lb/><name>Pequod Indians</name>, the most cruel and warlike tribe
	      <lb/>of <placeName>North America</placeName>, became daily more alarming,
	      <lb/>and spread terror and dismay throughout the colo­
	      <lb/>nies, particularly of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, which was mark­
	      <lb/>ed out for the first object of their vengeance.
	      <lb/><persName>Sassacus</persName>, their sachem, a fierce and daring prince,
	      <lb/>whose very name was a terror to his enemies, con­
	      <lb/>vened his depending warriors, who readily ac­
	      <lb/>ceded to his wishes, and sought an alliance with
	      <lb/>the <name>Mohegan</name> and <name>Narraganset</name> tribes. But Pro­
	      <lb/>vidence mercifully overruled his design, which, if
	      <lb/>successful, must have produced the most fatal
	      <lb/>consequences, if indeed it had not annihilated the
	      <lb/>colonies of <placeName>New-England</placeName>. <persName>Uncas</persName>, sachem of the
	      <lb/><name>Mohegans</name>, though sprung from the royal blood of
	      <lb/>the <name>Pequods</name>, and connected with them by marriage,
	      <lb/>refused to negociate with <persName>Sassacus</persName>.  Having early
	      <lb/>entertained a friendship for the <name>English</name>, he re­
	      <lb/>mained faithful to their interests, and proved of
	      <lb/>essential service to them in the perilous struggle
	      <lb/>which at last closed the warfare.</p>
	    <p><persName>Sassacus</persName> was at first more successful with the
	      <lb/><name>Narragansets</name>, a powerful nation bordering the
	      <lb/>Bay of that name, and stretching inland through
	      <lb/>the now thriving State of <placeName>Rhode-Island</placeName>;—but <persName>Mi­
		<lb/>antonimo</persName>, their sachem, though usually politic and
	      <lb/>wary, in this instance suffered himself to be govern­
	      <lb/>ed by feelings of revenge, to the prejudice of his
	      <lb/>future interests. The <name>Narragansets</name> had general­
	      <lb/>ly maintained a friendly intercourse with the <name>Eng­
		<lb/>lish</name>, though occasional acts of treachery, so natural

	      <lb/>to the <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> character, proved that their friend­
	      <lb/>ship was the result of fear, rather than affection.
	      <lb/>The <name>Pequods</name> they regarded with the jealous hatred
	      <lb/>of hereditary rivalship. Though scarcely equal to
	      <lb/>themselves in population and territory, their supe­
	      <lb/>rior power and influence was a subject of envy and
	      <lb/>mortification; and the warlike spirit of <persName>Sassacus</persName>,
	      <lb/>which had conquered all the petty tribes that sur­
	      <lb/>rounded him, and held them as vassals to his will,
	      <lb/>gave him a pre-eminence which the haughty <persName>Mi­
		<lb/>antonimo</persName> was almost unwilling to acknowledge.</p>
	    <p><persName>Sassacus</persName>, in his treaty with the <name>Narragansets</name>,
	      <lb/>represented the white people as intruders, and re­
	      <lb/>capitulated the various grievances they had re­
	      <lb/>ceived from them, in a manner calculated to stir
	      <lb/>up the savage spirit of hatred and revenge. With
	      <lb/>consummate art he urged the necessity of union
	      <lb/>against the common enemy, and detailed the means
	      <lb/>by which it would be practicable, by a predatory
	      <lb/>warfare, to exterminate them, without the hazard
	      <lb/>of resorting to open arms. He concluded by pre­
	      <lb/>dicting that if the <name>Narragansets</name> leagued with the
	      <lb/><name>English</name> against the <name>Pequods</name>, they would eventual­
	      <lb/>ly involve themselves in certain destruction.</p>
	    <p>These arguments had well nigh proved success­
	      <lb/>ful; but the government of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, learning
	      <lb/>the intrigues of the <name>Pequods</name>, determined if possible,
	      <lb/>to counteract their designs; and while the <name>Narra­
		<lb/>gansets</name> were yet hesitating what course to pursue,
	      <lb/>they dispatched to them an embassage of peace and
	      <lb/>amity. <persName>Canonicus</persName>, the head sachem, had regarded
	      <pb n="115"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="11(2)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">115</mw>
	      <lb/>the first settlers of <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> as intruders; and
	      <lb/>stimulated by his jealous fears, he early sent them
	      <lb/>a challenge of defiance, contained in the emblem­
	      <lb/>atic present of a bundle of arrows, bound with a
	      <lb/>serpent's skin. <persName>Governor Bradford</persName> ordered the
	      <lb/>skin to be filled with powder and bullets, and re­
	      <lb/>turned, with a spirited message to the savage mo­
	      <lb/>narch; and the expedient so intimidated him, that
	      <lb/>he was not only afraid to touch them, but even
	      <lb/>refused them a place in his dominions; and he ever
	      <lb/>after discovered a more peaceable and friendly
	      <lb/>disposition. He was now grown very old, and had
	      <lb/>resigned the government to his nephew, <persName>Miantoni­
		<lb/>mo</persName>, a young prince of great stature, and stern and
	      <lb/>cruel disposition. He however entertained the am­
	      <lb/>bassadors from the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> with royal hospi­
	      <lb/>tality; and in the presence of his aged relative and
	      <lb/>a great number of attendants who <quote>trembled at his
		<lb/>speech,</quote> he prepared to receive their message.
	      <lb/>They were assembled under the shelter of a circu­
	      <lb/>lar building, formed by long poles driven into the
	      <lb/>ground and covered over with mats; and during
	      <lb/>the speech of the interpreters, <persName>Miantonimo</persName> lay
	      <lb/>extended on a mat, encircled by his counsellors
	      <lb/>and nobles, who listened to them with the most
	      <lb/>grave attention. The hope of subduing the hitherto
	      <lb/>invincible <persName>Sassacus</persName>, of whom they were accustomed
	      <lb/>to say, <said>he is all one god, no man can kill him,</said>
	      <lb/>and of exterminating his brave warriors, prevailed
	      <lb/>in the sachem's mind over every suggestion of pru­
	      <lb/>dence and interest, and he signified his readiness
	      <pb n="116"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="11(2)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">116</mw>
	      <lb/>to remain at peace with the <name>English</name>, and consented
	      <lb/>to repair to <placeName>Boston</placeName>, to sign the articles of a treaty.</p>
	    <p>A few days after the return of the messengers, it
	      <lb/>was accordingly rumoured that the young king of
	      <lb/>the <name>Narragansets</name>, with twenty of his principal at­
	      <lb/>tendants, were approaching the town; and as a
	      <lb/>mark of peculiar respect, twenty musketeers were
	      <lb/>sent to meet them at <placeName>Roxbury</placeName>, and escort them
	      <lb/>the remainder of the way. The windows of all
	      <lb/>the houses were filled with women and children,
	      <lb/>impatient to behold the procession; for though the
	      <lb/>red children of the forest were at that period no
	      <lb/>novelty in <placeName>New-England</placeName>, a train of sable war­
	      <lb/>riors, decked out in savage splendour, was an
	      <lb/>imposing spectacle;—and when were not women
	      <lb/>and children eager to see what is rare or
	      <lb/>wonderful? The public officers of <placeName>Boston</placeName> assem­
	      <lb/>bled in dignified state; and the boys, let loose from
	      <lb/>school, ran shouting through the streets, to the
	      <lb/>great annoyance of <persName>Master Handcuff</persName>, who, it is
	      <lb/>recorded, had a world of trouble to depress their
	      <lb/>merry hallooing to the puritanic key.</p>
	    <p><persName>Miantonimo</persName>, guarded on each side by an inferior
	      <lb/>sachem, and immediately followed by the two sons
	      <lb/>of <persName>Canonicus</persName>, led forward the procession; his
	      <lb/>figure was graceful and majestic, his features stern,
	      <lb/>but noble, and his elastic step and lofty bearing
	      <lb/>expressed the pride and independence of an untam­
	      <lb/>ed and courageous spirit. His dress was composed
	      <lb/>of deer skins, falling below the knees, and pro­
	      <lb/>fusely decorated with gaudy colours, interwoven
	      <pb n="117"/>

	      <lb/>with tinsel beads and wrought with the quills of
	      <lb/>the porcupine; his moccasins were of the same ma­
	      <lb/>terials, and adorned in a similar manner; from his
	      <lb/>shoulders depended a sort of cloak, composed of
	      <lb/>the richest furs, and a large plume of feathers
	      <lb/>ornamented his head. His face was painted with
	      <lb/>various colours, representing the most uncouth
	      <lb/>figures; he carried a bow, and a quiver well filled
	      <lb/>with arrows hung at his back. His followers,
	      <lb/>attired much in the same manner, though less rich­
	      <lb/>ly, walked after him with a grave and solemn
	      <lb/>pace, and the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> guards, in their military
	      <lb/>dress, brought up the rear, marching to the sound
	      <lb/>of martial music, which seemed highly enjoyed by
	      <lb/>their savage visitors. The Governor, clergy, and
	      <lb/>magistrates received them at the entrance of the
	      <lb/>town with becoming ceremony;—for no people are
	      <lb/>more jealous of etiquette, so far as their knowledge
	      <lb/>extends:—and having bid them welcome, they
	      <lb/>were conducted to a place prepared, where a con­
	      <lb/>ference was holden respecting the proposed treaty.</p>
	    <p><persName>Miantonimo</persName> consented on behalf of himself and
	      <lb/>people to engage in a war against the <name>Pequods</name>, on
	      <lb/>condition that no peace should be made with them,
	      <lb/>but that they should be utterly destroyed. The
	      <lb/>Governor and his council took until the next morn­
	      <lb/>ing to consider his proposals, when certain arti­
	      <lb/>cles, embracing a system of warfare, offensive and
	      <lb/>defensive, were agreed upon, and signed by the
	      <lb/>different parties. The prince and his people were
	      <lb/>hospitably entertained at the Governor's own table

	      <lb/>and apparently much pleased with their reception;
	      <lb/>and on the following day they left the abodes of
	      <lb/>civilization, and returned to the freedom of their
	      <lb/>humble wigwams—probably more dear to them
	      <lb/>than the splendid restraints of a palace.</p>
	    <p>The coalition between their mortal enemies en­
	      <lb/>raged the <name>Pequods</name> beyond measure.  Far from
	      <lb/>being appalled by the threatening danger, they
	      <lb/>renewed their warfare with redoubled eagerness,
	      <lb/>and a degree of malicious cunning, which a savage
	      <lb/>only could display. They justly relied on their
	      <lb/>address and duplicity, which had hitherto proved
	      <lb/>far more effectual than the exercise of their barba­
	      <lb/>rous courage, when contending with men inured to
	      <lb/>discipline, and possessing powerful machines of
	      <lb/>destruction, unknown to them. It was, therefore,
	      <lb/>their constant and too often successful aim, to draw
	      <lb/>the <name>English</name> from their places of defence, when,
	      <lb/>concealed in their own retreats, they discharged
	      <lb/>their posoned arrows with fatal aim, or led their
	      <lb/>unhappy victims to a more slow and dreadful death.
	      <lb/>They were also continually lying in ambush for
	      <lb/>the incautious labourer, or unguarded traveller,
	      <lb/>who were often entrapped by their artifice, and
	      <lb/>inhumanly sacrificed to their revenge.</p>
	    <p>Fortunately for the early planters of <placeName>Connecti­
		<lb/>cut</placeName>, the <name>Indians</name> of that region,—with the exception
	      <lb/>of the <name>Pequods</name> and their few allies,—were almost
	      <lb/>universally favourable to their settlement, and in
	      <lb/>every possible way, rendered them assistance and
	      <lb/>protection. They instructed them how to plant

	      <lb/>their corn, carried them on their backs through
	      <lb/>rivers and morasses, restored the children who had
	      <lb/>strayed from their parents, and often supplied them
	      <lb/>with food in their impoverished state. They hoped
	      <lb/>with the assistance of the white people to resist
	      <lb/>the despotic will of the more powerful tribes, and
	      <lb/>in time, to shake off a yoke which had long afflicted
	      <lb/>them. In this expectation, and in their deeds of
	      <lb/>kindness, they were supported by the <name>Indians</name> on
	      <lb/>the western side of the river, who had been subju­
	      <lb/>gated by the <name>Mohawks</name>, a ferocious people, who
	      <lb/>like the <name>Goths</name> and <name>Vandals</name> of ancient <placeName>Europe</placeName>,
	      <lb/>poured from their eternal forests on the banks of 
	      <lb/>the <placeName>Hudson</placeName> and <placeName>Mohawk</placeName>, and spread destruction
	      <lb/>in their course. They had conquered the inferior
	      <lb/>tribes, even to the borders of <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, and annu­
	      <lb/>ally dispatched their emissaries to exact tribute
	      <lb/>from their subjects, who if they dared to refuse
	      <lb/>were punished with the most relentless fury.</p>
	    <p>The colonists, thus partially protected by the
	      <lb/>friendly <name>Indians</name>, and using the utmost vigilance to
	      <lb/>insure their safety, suffered less than might have
	      <lb/>been expected, considering their defenceless state,
	      <lb/>and the power and rancour of the enemy. Still they
	      <lb/>were in continual apprehension; every man was
	      <lb/>obliged to be constantly armed, and they dared not
	      <lb/>meet even for public worship, without a sufficient
	      <lb/>guard to protect them from assault. But the malice
	      <lb/>of the enemy was at that time principally directed
	      <lb/>against the fort of <placeName>Saybrook</placeName>, at the mouth of <placeName>Con­
		<lb/>necticut river</placeName>, and not more than twenty miles from

	      <lb/>the royal fortress of <persName>Sassacus</persName>, which occupied the
	      <lb/>site of the now flourishing town of <placeName>New-London</placeName>.
	      <lb/>This fort was built under the direction of <persName>Mr. Win­
		<lb/>throp</persName>, a son of the Governor of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>,
	      <lb/>who in the preceding year, was sent from <placeName>England</placeName>
	      <lb/>with a commission from certain nobles and gentle­
	      <lb/>men interested in the patent of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, to
	      <lb/>govern their projected colonies. They also sup­
	      <lb/>plied him with money, ammunition, and every ne­
	      <lb/>cessary for the erection of the fort, to which, in
	      <lb/>honour of his noble patrons, the <persName>Viscount Say and
		<lb/>Seal</persName>, and <persName>Lord Brook</persName>, he gave the name which is
	      <lb/>still retained by the village where it was situated.
	      <lb/>The military command was given to <persName>Lieutenant
		<lb/>Gardner</persName>, a skilful engineer, who had assisted in
	      <lb/>planning the fortifications; and a settlement was
	      <lb/>commenced, and houses erected for the garrison.
	      <lb/>The <name>Dutch</name>, who had long desired to occupy the
	      <lb/>fruitful regions of the <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, and had already
	      <lb/>made some ineffectual attempts to settle in different
	      <lb/>parts, were then on the point of sailing to take pos­
	      <lb/>session of that important place. But the activity
	      <lb/>of <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName> defeated their design; and before
	      <lb/>the vessel from the <placeName>New-Netherlands</placeName> appeared at
	      <lb/>the mouth of the river, he had mounted cannon
	      <lb/>sufficient to oppose their entrance, and compel them
	      <lb/>to retire.</p>
	    <p>During the winter, the garrison at <placeName>Saybrook</placeName>
	      <lb/>were so hard pressed by the enemy, that it was
	      <lb/>almost dangerous to venture beyond the intrench­
	      <lb/>ments; but <persName>Lieutenant Gardner</persName> with only twenty

	      <lb/>men, maintained a brave resistance, and not only
	      <lb/>kept the enemy at bay, but spared several soldiers
	      <lb/>from his small band to defend a house at the dis­
	      <lb/>tance of two miles, which was exposed to their
	      <lb/>attacks. The <name>Indians</name> also watched the river so
	      <lb/>closely, that it was perilous to pass as usual in
	      <lb/>boats, even with a strong guard; and as there was
	      <lb/>no other means of communication with the sister
	      <lb/>colonies at that inclement season, the inhabitants
	      <lb/>of the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> heard only casual reports of
	      <lb/>the situation of their brethren at <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>. These
	      <lb/>were however sufficient to excite extreme appre­
	      <lb/>hension in the mind of <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, who re­
	      <lb/>solved to embrace the earliest opportunity of repair­
	      <lb/>ing to the scene of danger, and relieving his solici­

	      <lb/>continued their hostilities, which were marked by

	      <lb/>feelings of humanity; and their constant watchful­

	      <lb/>ed the venerable <name>pilgrims</name> of <placeName>New-England</placeName>, could
	      <lb/>have enabled them to endure such complicated tri­

	      <lb/>mean time was dispatched with twenty men,—though
	      <lb/>ill-spared from the defence of their homes,—to sup­
	      <lb/>port the garrison at <placeName>Saybrook</placeName>, which had been con­
	      <lb/>siderably weakened by skirmishes with the enemy,
	      <lb/>in which several of the soldiers were killed or taken
	      <lb/>prisoners. But the <name>Pequods</name>, probably alarmed by
	      <lb/>this reinforcement, almost immediately withdrew
	      <lb/>from the neighbourhood of the fort, as it was sup­
	      <lb/>posed, to attack some less defensible position.</p>
	    <p>The people of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> and <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> dis­
	      <lb/>played an active sympathy for the sufferings of the
	      <lb/>sister colony, and promptly agreed to raise a suffi­
	      <lb/>cient force, and march to their relief, as soon as it
	      <lb/>was possible to make the necessary arrangements.
	      <lb/><persName>Major Atherton</persName> solicited, and received permission
	      <lb/>to join the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> troops as a volunteer;
	      <lb/>happy again to share the dangers of a profession,
	      <lb/>which had early inspired him with a romantic fond­
	      <lb/>ness for scenes of daring adventure; while the im­
	      <lb/>age of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, and the delightful thought
	      <lb/>that he should soon be near to protect her, continu­
	      <lb/>ally floated in his imagination.</p>
	    <p>But the organization of even a diminutive army
	      <lb/>of two hundred men, was attended with many de­
	      <lb/>lays at that early period of the settlement, when
	      <lb/>men became soldiers only from necessity; and at
	      <lb/>an immense sacrifice of personal interest, left the
	      <lb/>duties of their station to combat with a powerful
	      <lb/>and inhuman enemy. These and other circumstan­

	      <lb/>fore the commencement of <name>May</name>; but <persName>Captain Un­
		<lb/>derhill</persName>, with twenty men, was required to put him­
	      <lb/>self in immediate readiness to go forward and re­
	      <lb/>lieve the garrison at <placeName>Saybrook</placeName>. It was then near
	      <lb/>the close of <name>March</name>; and before these arrangements
	      <lb/>were completed, a small vessel from the <rs type="properAdjective">Dutch</rs> set­
	      <lb/>tlement of the <placeName>New Netherlands</placeName>, arrived on a trad­
	      <lb/>ing voyage in the harbour of <placeName>Boston</placeName>. It brought
	      <lb/>many fearful reports of the continued atrocities of
	      <lb/>the <name>Pequods</name>, the ravages they had made, and the
	      <lb/>terror which they every where inspired; and this ad­
	      <lb/>ditional intelligence completely roused the spirited
	      <lb/>exertions of the people, who again unitedly resolved
	      <lb/>to resist the daring injuries, which threatened to
	      <lb/>bring destruction upon the whole country. These
	      <lb/>accounts also renewed the fears of <persName>Atherton</persName> respect­
	      <lb/>ing the situation of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, who he imagin­
	      <lb/>ed surrounded by a thousand dangers, which haunt­
	      <lb/>ed his mind without cessation; and impatient of
	      <lb/>delay, he resolved at once to end the misery of sus­
	      <lb/>pense. He therefore obtained leave to repair im­
	      <lb/>mediately to <placeName>Saybrook</placeName> fort, without waiting for
	      <lb/><persName>Captain Underhill</persName>; and the master of the <rs type="properAdjective">Dutch</rs>
	      <lb/>vessel, for a handsome compensation, agreed to fur­
	      <lb/>nish him with a passage to the desired port.</p>
	    <p>On the morning of his departure, <persName>Major Ather­
		<lb/>ton</persName> wrote a few lines to <persName>Captain Standish</persName>, hastily
	      <lb/>sketching his plans, though without alluding to the
	      <lb/>hopes, which almost unknown to himself, were a
	      <lb/>powerful incentive to action, and had obtained an
	      <lb/>unbounded influence over his mind. It was there­

	      <lb/>fore with feelings of pleasurable expectation rather
	      <lb/>than regret—for which he was half inclined to re­
	      <lb/>proach himself as ungrateful—that he took leave of
	      <lb/>his hospitable friends at <placeName>Boston</placeName>; and furnished
	      <lb/>with suitable credentials to <persName>Lieutenant Gardner</persName>,
	      <lb/>again committed himself to the winds and waves,
	      <lb/>under the guidance of a people, of whose very lan­
	      <lb/>guage he was ignorant. But <persName>Captain Van Schiller</persName>,
	      <lb/>a native of <placeName>Holland</placeName>, proved civil and obliging in
	      <lb/>his way—that is, he sat quietly on deck smoking
	      <lb/>his pipe, his square head leaning against the main-
	      <lb/>mast, and his short thick legs resting on a keg of
	      <lb/>spirits, perfectly contented that they were moving,
	      <lb/>however slowly; and good-naturedly resolved to let
	      <lb/>every one do as he pleased, and manage affairs in
	      <lb/>his own way, so long as it did not interfere with
	      <lb/>his interest or comfort. Besides, he would speak
	      <lb/>but little <name>English</name>, except so far as was necessary
	      <lb/>to drive a good bargain with that crafty nation, in
	      <lb/>which, to do him justice, he seldom lost any thing
	      <lb/>through ignorance;—and <persName>Atherton</persName> finding him in­
	      <lb/>clined to drowsiness, and the men unable to com­
	      <lb/>prehend any thing but their own guttural and most
	      <lb/>unharmonious mother-tongue—sat down alone and
	      <lb/>undisturbed on the deck, his eyes long lingering on
	      <lb/>the pleasant shores of the bay, as yet scarcely di­
	      <lb/>vested of their wintry covering, though here and
	      <lb/>there a sheltered glade or sunny hill was faintly
	      <lb/>tinged with verdure, the first promise of approach­
	      <lb/>ing spring.</p>
	    <p>In the mean time, the <rs type="properAdjective">Dutch</rs> vessel, sunk almost

	      <lb/>to the water's edge, moved slowly along, encumber­
	      <lb/>ed by a weight of planks and useless tackle, almost
	      <lb/>sufficient to equip a man of war in these econoni­
	      <lb/>cal times; but most inconveniently misplaced in the
	      <lb/>small but clumsy vessel, that ploughed heavily
	      <lb/>through the waves, which at every instant extorted
	      <lb/>a groan from it, as if in the act of forcing its ribs
	      <lb/>asunder. The crew, probably used to its distress,
	      <lb/>seemed totally to disregard it, and pursued their
	      <lb/>navigation with admirable gravity, seldom sus­
	      <lb/>pending their labour to exercise their colloquial
	      <lb/>powers, or indulge in those bursts of merriment to
	      <lb/>which the seamen of other nations are so prone.
	      <lb/>Perhaps this was from deference to their Captain,
	      <lb/>whose meditations were long and deep; but whether
	      <lb/>he was holding high converse with his own thoughts,
	      <lb/>or admiring the thick waisted beauties gallantly
	      <lb/>pictured on his vessel,—he might, for aught of life
	      <lb/>or motion, as well have represented the figure of
	      <lb/><persName>St. Nicholas</persName> which decorated the stern, save for the
	      <lb/>volumes of smoke which curled from his capacious
	      <lb/>mouth,—a luxury probably unknown to the worthy
	      <lb/>saint. Once also, an unlucky wight, who hovered
	      <lb/>high in air on the main-mast-top, let fall a coil of
	      <lb/>rope, which lighting on the centre of his pericrani­
	      <lb/>um, sent forth from the interior a hollow reverbe­
	      <lb/>ration like unto the sound of a kettle drum, and
	      <lb/>beat out a tremendous <name>high Dutch</name> oath, that we
	      <lb/>care not to repeat. But this transient excitement
	      <lb/>past, the usual monotony again prevailed; until in
	      <lb/>passing the <placeName>Nantasket road</placeName>, a vessel hove in sight,

	      <lb/>and as soon as they were near enough, <persName>Captain Van
		<lb/>Schiller</persName> hauled in his sails and prepared to speak
	      <lb/>with her. She was from <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, bound to <placeName>Bos­

	      <lb/>ceive a packet of letters from his friends, which he
	      <lb/>hastened to peruse, when the vessel was again un­

		  <p>I have been trying for these four months past, that
		    <lb/>is, ever since you left <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, to write a letter
		    <lb/>to you; but I know not how it is, I am not very

		      <lb/>riam Grey</persName> when she was in <placeName>Boston</placeName>? I need not
		    <lb/>ask though, for I will be bound you found her out
		    <lb/>before she had been there an hour. I hope the
		    <lb/>pretty damsel was more kind to you than before
		    <lb/>you left <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>; for though we could get noth­
		    <lb/>ing out of her or <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName> about the matter, it
		    <lb/>was easy to guess the reason of your flying off so,
		    <lb/>almost without saying good bye to your best
		    <lb/>friends. Now, Major, you always laugh at me

		    <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">128</mw>
		    <lb/>for thinking I have a deal of penetration; but I
		    <lb/>saw plainly how matters stood with you long ago;
		    <lb/>and I well know it is all owing to that grim father
		    <lb/>of hers that you and <persName>Miriam</persName> are separated,—for she
		    <lb/>too, poor thing, looked as wan and drooping as a
		    <lb/>pond lily, after you went away. I wonder where­
		    <lb/>in was the use of people's coming over to this sa­
		    <lb/>vage wilderness, for the sake of liberty of con­
		    <lb/>science, as they call it, if they will not allow any
		    <lb/>one to think differently from themselves, now they
		    <lb/>are here, nor to marry whom they choose, and be
		    <lb/>happy if they can. But only think of <persName>Miriam's</persName>
		    <lb/>being in <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> at this dreadful time,—fool­
		    <lb/>ish girl that she is! I expect every day to hear
		    <lb/>you have gone to look after her, and that you have
		    <lb/>killed as many savages as <persName>Samson</persName> did <name>Philistines</name>
		    <lb/>—though I think you must have something sharper
		    <lb/>than the jaw-bone of an ass to make way with such
		    <lb/>hardened wretches. Well, perhaps I shall see you
		    <lb/>there, for our court have agreed to send forward
		    <lb/>fifty men to help the <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> people; and after
		    <lb/>much persuasion, my father has consented to let
		    <lb/>me go with them; my dear mother distressed her­
		    <lb/>self bitterly about it for a time, but is now more
		    <lb/>reconciled. What do you think <persName>Captain Standish</persName>
		    <lb/>says about me? why that I shall not have courage
		    <lb/>to stand fire unless I am cased up to the eyes in
		    <lb/>steel—so I asked him to lend me his coat of mail
		    <lb/>which has kept him in life so long—though in
		    <lb/>truth, I think it would hardly cover my legs. Our
		    <lb/>friend <persName>Benjamin Ashly</persName> is going too, if you can be­

		    <lb/>lieve it—I wish I might be as chaplain, or I fear
		    <lb/>he will have more arrows in his back than he can
		    <lb/>well stop to pick out. I wish you had seen him
		    <lb/>the other day when I met him with a long face,
		    <lb/>and asked him if he had heard that <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>
		    <lb/>was scalped by a horrible <name>Indian</name>! He stood, for
		    <lb/>all the world, like <persName>Lot's</persName> pillar of salt, and half
		    <lb/>afraid he was really changing, I made haste to com­
		    <lb/>fort him by saying, <said>Pluck up courage, friend; it
		      <lb/>has not happened yet, and I will warrant you <persName>Ma­
			<lb/>jor Atherton</persName> takes good care that not a hair of
		      <lb/>her head is harmed.</said> So he turned away from me
		    <lb/>too angry to say a word.</p>
		  <p>But now I must tell you what I intended at the
		    <lb/>first; but some how or other I have an unfortu­
		    <lb/>nate way of saying whatever happens to come up­
		    <lb/>permost, which often leads me astray from my
		    <lb/>subject. Did <persName>Miriam</persName> tell you—though it is not
		    <lb/>likely she did—that <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName> left <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>
		    <lb/>soon after you went away, and every body says
		    <lb/>because she would not marry him and go to <placeName>Virgi­
		      <lb/>nia</placeName>. Well, as his vessel was not quite ready to
		    <lb/>sail, he went to pass a week or two with <persName>Captain
		      <lb/>Standish</persName>, who it seems took a great liking to him.
		    <lb/>It so happened that while he was there the Captain

		    <lb/>ing fine speeches, such as win pretty women; and
		    <lb/>so in imitation of ancient <persName>Isaac</persName> he resolved to send
		    <lb/>forward a herald to speak the word for him. I
		    <lb/>have ever since thought he would have done well
		    <lb/>if he had chosen me, who would doubtless have
		    <lb/>proved a trusty agent; but instead thereof he se­
		    <lb/>lected <persName>Calvert</persName>, who was at his house, and well able
		    <lb/>to argue fluently on any side of the question, right
		    <lb/>or wrong. So he repaired to the damsel, full arm­
		    <lb/>ed with instructions; but alas! who can foresee
		    <lb/>the caprices of love? When he had finished plead­
		    <lb/>ing the Captain's cause, the maiden turned her
		    <lb/>bewitching eyes upon him, and said with sweet
		    <lb/>simplicity.</p>
		  <p>
		    <said>Prithee why do you not speak for yourself?</said>
		  </p>
		  <p><said>Would you,</said> answered <persName>Calvert</persName>, <said>prefer me, an
		      <lb/>unknown stranger, to the brave Captain whose
		      <lb/>name is renowned all over the world for his deeds
		      <lb/>of courage?</said></p>
		  <p><said>Ten to one,</said> replied the damsel, with a smile
		    <lb/>and a blush.</p>
		  <p>Now the rest of the conference is unknown,
		    <lb/>and this has leaked out at unawares; but it was
		    <lb/>doubtless settled to the satisfaction of both, for
		    <lb/><persName>Calvert</persName> returned to <persName>Captain Standish</persName> to confess
		    <lb/>the strange result of the business, and arrange his
		    <lb/>affairs; and it is whispered that your valiant kins­
		    <lb/>man flew into a most violent passion, and that
		    <lb/>very night turned him out of doors. I will not
		    <lb/>vouch for the truth of all this, being very cautious

		    <lb/>about spreading reports,—but be that as it may,
		    <lb/>before noon on the following day, <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName>
		    <lb/>put his bride and other commodities on board
		    <lb/>the vessel, and sailed from <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, probably
		    <lb/>forever.</p>
		  <p>Now is'nt this a very droll affair, Major? I have
		    <lb/>laughed incessantly about it, and the other night
		    <lb/>actually waked up in a roar, to the great alarm of
		    <lb/>my mother, who came running into the chamber to
		    <lb/>see if I had lost my wits. I could only cry out,
		    <lb/><said>The Captain, mother—that was a sly trick of the
		      <lb/>girl's,</said>—and half provoked she said—<said>Foolish boy,
		      <lb/>go to sleep</said>—and left me, almost as much amused
		    <lb/>as myself. The best of all is, no one dares to
		    <lb/>speak openly of the matter, lest the Captain should
		    <lb/>serve him as he did the <persName>Sachem Wittuwamet</persName>; and
		    <lb/>indeed he holds up his head so boldly, that people
		    <lb/>are half-inclined to believe it was all a trick of
		    <lb/><persName>Calvert's</persName> to amuse and astonish the world. I ven­
		    <lb/>tured one day to allude to it before the Captain;
		    <lb/>but his eyes flashed fire, and he touched his sword
		    <lb/>with such a menacing gesture, that in good truth I
		    <lb/>was glad to retreat as well as I could.</p>
		  <p>Now, dear Major, I think it is time to draw this
		    <lb/>letter to a conclusion, and I dare say you are of the
		    <lb/>same opinion; it is certainly the longest I ever
		    <lb/>wrote, for my credit's sake I will not say the best.
		    <lb/>As for the rest of the good people of <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, I
		    <lb/>believe they go on pretty much as when you were
		    <lb/>here. Your old acquaintance mistress <persName>Gilbert</persName> has
		    <lb/>been very busy in talking about the Captain's af­
		    <lb/>fair; and I wish in my heart he could hear of it,

		    <lb/>and give her one sound dressing that should frighten
		    <lb/>her out of her gossiping, for a time at least. Her
		    <lb/>good friend and your admirer, <persName>Mistress Rebecca
		      <lb/>Spindle</persName>, is as interesting as ever; she enquired after
		    <lb/>you the other day with a sweet simper which would
		    <lb/>certainly have won your heart, had you been an
		    <lb/>eye-witness to it, though by the way, I believe she
		    <lb/>is laying siege to <persName>Master Ashly's</persName> heart, since he
		    <lb/>has been forced to give up his pretensions to <persName>Mi­
		      <lb/>riam</persName>. I hear she tells him that giddy young girls
		    <lb/>are always fond of flirting, and there can be no re­
		    <lb/>liance placed on them till they arrive at years of
		    <lb/>discretion, at her age for instance; and more than
		    <lb/>once, if report speaks the truth, she has enticed him to
		    <lb/>walk home with her from a prayer-meeting. <said>Here
		      <lb/>is gossip,</said> you will say, <said>equal to <persName>Mistress Gil­
			<lb/>bert's</persName>!</said> Never mind Major; it is a glorious privi­
		    <lb/>lege of our sex to detail news and scandal, and
		    <lb/>remark on people and things as we think proper,
		    <lb/>without the reproach of <mentioned rend="slant(italic)">gossiping</mentioned>, which is a term
		    <lb/>exclusively feminine, and long may it continue so!</p>
		  <p>No news have been heard lately from <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>;
		    <lb/>but he is expected to return in the course of a
		    <lb/>month or two. I beg you, to destroy this foolish
		    <lb/>letter for more reasons than one. My mother de­
		    <lb/>sires to be remembered to you and so would my
		    <lb/>father did he not intend to write himself. I hope

	    <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> folded the letter with a smile
	      <lb/>when he had finished reading it, much amused by
	      <lb/>the contents so characteristic of his gay young
	      <lb/>friend; but not a little perplexed with that part of
	      <lb/>it which related to his kinsman. We shall not
	      <lb/>stake our credit as historians by insisting on the
	      <lb/>truth of that report; though tradition has handed
	      <lb/>it down to us with an accuracy which in our minds
	      <lb/>admits no doubt of its authenticity.</p>
	    <p>It would be tedious in the extreme to follow the
	      <lb/>slow progress of <persName>Captain Van Schiller's</persName> vessel,
	      <lb/>which in open defiance of <rs type="properAdjective">Dutch</rs> canvass, continu­
	      <lb/>ed to drift along with the tide, rather than obey the
	      <lb/>impulse of the winds,—which to speak truth were
	      <lb/>sometimes in a wrong direction, and it was there­
	      <lb/>fore not until the fourth day from leaving <placeName>Boston</placeName>,
	      <lb/>that they entered the inland sea now called <placeName>Long
		<lb/>Island Sound</placeName>, and without one perilous adventure to
	      <lb/>give a zest to their irksome voyage. <persName>Major Ather­
		<lb/>ton's</persName> patience was spun out to a mere cobweb; he
	      <lb/>wondered that the sun could smile so cheeringly,
	      <lb/>and the south send forth her softest breezes to dally
	      <lb/>with their useless sails; and the moon shine with
	      <lb/>such unwonted brilliance on the waveless ocean,
	      <lb/>and the fairy isles, which ever and anon spotted its
	      <lb/>surface and seemed putting on a deeper green, and
	      <lb/>budding into beauty as they approached nearer the
	      <lb/>regions of the sun. Yet at times he yielded to the
	      <lb/>serene and balmy influence of nature, then in the
	      <lb/>youth and loveliness of that genial season, which
	      <lb/>has so long awaked the poet's song and inspired

	      <lb/>the lover's dream; and often in the freshness of
	      <lb/>morning and the stillness of the night-watches, with
	      <lb/>the flageolet, his only companion, he <quote>discoursed
		<lb/>most excellent music,</quote> mingling its sweet tones
	      <lb/>with the ripple of the waters, and creating strains
	      <lb/>which in the golden age might have called the sea-
	      <lb/>nymphs from their caves to listen.</p>
	    <p>It was however with very pleasant emotions that
	      <lb/>he at length understood they were approaching
	      <lb/>the mouth of <placeName>Connecticut river</placeName>; though he observ­
	      <lb/>ed they still bore off towards the coast of <placeName>Manhat­
		<lb/>tan</placeName>, which lay in full, though distant prospect, in­
	      <lb/>stead of the opposite shore to which they were des­
	      <lb/>tined. The Captain complained of the wind as
	      <lb/>the grand mover of this crooked navigation; but
	      <lb/><persName>Atherton</persName> remarked that there was scarcely enough
	      <lb/>to swell the sails and insisted that he would no
	      <lb/>longer be subjected to such provoking delays. <persName>Cap­
		<lb/>tain Van Schiller</persName> listened to him without either
	      <lb/>surprise or anger; and when he had done speak­
	      <lb/>ing, leisurely knocked the ashes from his pipe, and
	      <lb/>carefully replacing it in his huge waistcoat pocket,
	      <lb/>replied,—</p>
	    <p><said>Very well mynheer, we will see what can be
		<lb/>done;</said> and, on this benevolent errand, he stubbed
	      <lb/>away to hold a conference with the helmsman.
	      <lb/>Nearly half the day, however, was consumed in
	      <lb/>total inaction, notwithstanding the continued re­
	      <lb/>monstrances of <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, but the appearance
	      <lb/>of a small vessel approaching from the <placeName>Connecti­
		<lb/>cut</placeName> shore, at length, inspired even <name>Dutchmen</name> with
	      <pb n="135"/>

	      <lb/>momentary animation. When within speaking dis­
	      <lb/>tance, they hailed her, and were answered in their
	      <lb/>own language; which was so delectable a sound to
	      <lb/>their sensitive countrymen, that they set up a shout
	      <lb/>of exultation, which might have been heard on the
	      <lb/>ramparts of <placeName>Fort Orange</placeName>. The two Captains then
	      <lb/>entered into a long parley, and from their earnest
	      <lb/>gesticulation, <persName>Atherton</persName> judged they were discussing
	      <lb/>a subject of some importance. As soon as their
	      <lb/>conference was ended the small vessel again hoisted
	      <lb/>her sails and with enviable speed pursued her des­
	      <lb/>tined course. <persName>Captain Van Schiller</persName> then called
	      <lb/>his men together, and remained for some time,
	      <lb/>engaged in conversation with them, which <persName>Ather­
		<lb/>ton</persName> in vain endeavoured to comprehend; but the
	      <lb/>result, whatever it was, seemed decisive; the men
	      <lb/>engaged with unusual activity in their labours,
	      <lb/>and <persName>Atherton</persName>, for the first time, suspected they
	      <lb/>were deceiving him, and demanded of the Captain,
	      <lb/>an explanation of his conduct.</p>
	    <p>That worthy son of <persName>Neptune</persName>, apparently ex­
	      <lb/>hausted by his late exertions, was drowsily reclin­
	      <lb/>ing in his usual place of repose, with a countenance
	      <lb/>as stagnant as one of his own canals; but which
	      <lb/>began faintly to glimmer into life, as <persName>Atherton</persName>,
	      <lb/>with rather less than his usual courtesy, made the
	      <lb/>needful inquiries. <persName>Captain Van Schiller</persName> was lost in
	      <lb/>meditation for a moment, while a dense column of
	      <lb/>smoke rolled from his mouth, which <persName>Atherton</persName>
	      <lb/>stepped back to avoid, and then gravely answered,
	      <lb/>that the master of the vessel they had just spoken
	      <pb n="136"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="12(6)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">136</mw>
	      <lb/>with, whom he knew to be a man of veracity, had
	      <lb/>given him such accounts of the numbers and feroci­
	      <lb/>ty of the <name>Pequod Indians</name>, that he considered it
	      <lb/>hazardous to venture near their coast: that they
	      <lb/>were continually out in their canoes watching for
	      <lb/>the <name>English</name>, and other boats; that his vessel sailed
	      <lb/>but slowly at the best; and being only defended
	      <lb/>by one swivel which, moreover, was out of order,
	      <lb/>neither he, nor his people thought it prudent to run
	      <lb/>the risk of being scalped, or roasted alive, and,
	      <lb/>perhaps devoured, like fat oxen, for those barbarians
	      <lb/>actually eat their prisoners, as greedily as a
	      <lb/>mouse would swallow a bit of toasted cheese: and
	      <lb/>he finally concluded by declaring that, though he
	      <lb/>had as much courage as most people, and perhaps,
	      <lb/>might be induced to adventure his own life, yet his
	      <lb/>crew, one and all, had resolved not to go in the
	      <lb/>way of such heathenish dogs, but to return with all
	      <lb/>convenient speed to <placeName>Fort Amsterdam</placeName>.</p>
	    <p>Nothing could exceed the indignant surprise of
	      <lb/><persName>Major Atherton</persName>, at this unexpected declaration;
	      <lb/>and in the resentment of the moment, he asserted
	      <lb/>that the most unpardonable cowardice and perfidy
	      <lb/>could alone have instigated such an unwarrantable
	      <lb/>infraction of their treaty. <persName>Captain Van Schiller</persName>
	      <lb/>listened to his reproaches with a kind of blank as­
	      <lb/>tonishment; for he had not dreamed that any one
	      <lb/>could be so unreasonable as to object against the
	      <lb/>prudence of his measures; and even when he had
	      <lb/>finished speaking, continued to regard him with
	      <lb/>that perplexed and stupid wonder with which a
	      <pb n="137"/>

	      <lb/>clown is wont to admire the marvellous feats of
	      <lb/>legerdemain. But with the utmost calmness, he
	      <lb/>presently resumed his pipe, and <persName>Atherton</persName>, provoked
	      <lb/>that he could excite neither remorse nor anger in
	      <lb/>his phlegmatic companion, had recourse alternately
	      <lb/>to threats and entreaties, to induce compliance with
	      <lb/>his agreement. All, however, proved ineffectual;
	      <lb/><persName>Captain Van Schiller</persName> possessed the virtue of self-
	      <lb/>command to an astonishing degree, and nothing
	      <lb/>could move his passions, nor would any thing shake
	      <lb/>the determined obstinacy of his disposition, which
	      <lb/>once resolved, whether right or wrong, was as im­
	      <lb/>moveable as the foundations of the earth.</p>
	    <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> had no doubt that the sailors
	      <lb/>were influenced by their Captain on this subject;
	      <lb/>but his ignorance of their language rendered it im­
	      <lb/>possible to argue with them, or even to discover
	      <lb/>their real feelings; and sensible that he had no
	      <lb/>hope of redress, with sensations of bitter disap­
	      <lb/>pointment he resigned himself to his perverse des­
	      <lb/>tiny, and during the remainder of the voyage con­
	      <lb/>tinued in a state of gloomy abstraction.</p>

	    <p>The ancient island of <placeName>Manhattan</placeName>, broken into
	      <lb/>hills and vallies, exhibited the variety and luxu­
	      <lb/>riance of primeval nature, and its silent shores
	      <lb/>where now the sounds of business and of pleasure
	      <lb/>are ever heard, were fringed with lofty forests, then
	      <lb/>unfolding their tender buds, and mingling a thou­
	      <lb/>sand hues from the pale tints of the trembling as­
	      <lb/>pen, to the dark foliage of the mournful cypress.
	      <lb/>Full in view the expansive waters of the Bay were
	      <lb/>slumbering in a glorious sun-set, studded with in­
	      <lb/>numerable isles, and bounded by scenes of wild and

	      <lb/>esque and novel appearance. At that early period

	      <lb/>the condition of the Colony, which the Captain
	      <lb/>willingly answered to the best of his abilities,
	      <lb/>though he proved far less clear in his ideas on that
	      <lb/>subject, or at least, less fluent in his speech, than
	      <lb/>when discanting on the points of architectural
	      <lb/>beauty displayed in the church of his patron saint,
	      <lb/>and the impenetrable strength of their redoubtable
	      <lb/>mud fortress. At length, to the satisfaction of all
	      <lb/>on board, the vessel anchored at a little distance
	      <lb/>from the fort, and amidst a crowd of men, women,
	      <lb/>children, and dogs, <persName>Major Atherton</persName> landed in the
	      <lb/>western dominions of their <rs type="properAdjective">high dutch</rs> mighti­
	      <lb/>nesses.</p>
	    <p><persName>Captain Van Schiller</persName> soon discovered, in this
	      <lb/>motley group, his own <foreign xml:lang="nl">Goede Vrouw</foreign>, or good wo­
	      <lb/>man, who with her daughter, a pretty plump lass
	      <lb/>of sixteen, was hastening to meet and welcome his
	      <lb/>return. On seeing her long absent lord, the wor­
	      <lb/>thy dame sprang forward, with an alacrity quite
	      <lb/>astonishing, considering her dimensions; and, with
	      <lb/>becoming gratitude for this active proof of her af­
	      <lb/>fection, the spouse rewarded her with a hearty kiss,
	      <lb/>which exploded like a signal gun from the battery
	      <lb/>of <placeName>Fort Amsterdam</placeName>. <persName>Atherton</persName> was rather start­
	      <lb/>led by this public display of conjugal felicity,
	      <lb/>which was however conducted with extreme gravi­
	      <pb n="141"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="13(3)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">141</mw>
	      <lb/>ty; but as he was in the act of retiring from the
	      <lb/>crowd, the Captain grasped him firmly by a button
	      <lb/>of his coat with one hand, while with the other he
	      <lb/>dragged forward his blushing daughter, who, on
	      <lb/>seeing a stranger with her father, had hung back
	      <lb/>behind the ample folds of her mother's petticoat.</p>
	    <p><said>Come hither, <persName>Gertrude</persName>,</said> he said, taking her in
	      <lb/>his arms, and saluting both cheeks, <said>dunder and
		<lb/>blixum, girl, you are not afraid of a young soldier
		<lb/>are you?</said> and with a sort of chuckle he swung her
	      <lb/>round, and then set her down on her feet again.
	      <lb/>For an instant, however, she appeared so dizzy,
	      <lb/>that <persName>Atherton</persName> felt obliged to offer her the support
	      <lb/>of his arm; but she tacitly declined it, and only
	      <lb/>expressed her thanks by a low courtesy, without
	      <lb/>even looking in his face; though, a moment after,
	      <lb/>when unobserved, she ventured to steal a glance at
	      <lb/>him, from the corners of her large dark eyes. But
	      <lb/>the mother had examined him more attentively,
	      <lb/>and whispered <persName>Gertrude</persName> to <said>hold up her head like
		<lb/>a woman, and not feel ashamed to be seen;</said> while,
	      <lb/>by dint of twitching her good man's sleeve, and
	      <lb/>the aid of an <emph>audible</emph> whisper, accompanied with
	      <lb/>expressive gestures, she at length made him com­
	      <lb/>prehend her wish to have <persName>Atherton</persName> invited home
	      <lb/>with them. The invitation was accordingly given
	      <lb/>in due form, by the obedient husband; but <persName>Ather­
		<lb/>ton</persName> thought proper to decline their hospitality, and
	      <lb/>soon after took leave of them, and repaired to a
	      <lb/>public house, where he fortunately found neat and
	      <lb/>convenient accommodations.</p>

	    <p>A week passed away, and still <persName>Major Atherton</persName>
	      <lb/>saw no prospect of speedily accomplishing his de­
	      <lb/>signs. The <name>Dutch</name> of <placeName>New-Amsterdam</placeName> were a
	      <lb/>cautious people, and cared not to adventure life,
	      <lb/>limb, or property, without a certain hope of advan­
	      <lb/>tage; therefore, their trading vessels, which used
	      <lb/>to make frequent voyages to <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, were
	      <lb/>sent to other ports or lay at anchor in the Bay,
	      <lb/>waiting for more certain information respecting
	      <lb/>the hostile <name>Indians</name>. They had still a large range
	      <lb/>of navigable country open to their vessels, from
	      <lb/><placeName>fort Orange</placeName>, on the <placeName>Hudson</placeName>, the ancient <placeName>Aurania</placeName>,
	      <lb/>and present city of <placeName>Albany</placeName>, to <placeName>fort Nassau</placeName>, on the
	      <lb/><placeName>Delaware</placeName>, which they held in the name of the
	      <lb/>States-General, and carried on a lucrative traffic
	      <lb/>with the natives. Their perseverance and indus­
	      <lb/>try had brought the colony into considerable re­
	      <lb/>pute; and the <name>English</name>, who always regarded them
	      <lb/>as mere intruders, had already made several efforts
	      <lb/>to alienate their possessions from the <rs type="properAdjective">Dutch</rs> go­
	      <lb/>vernment, and attach them to the dominions of
	      <lb/>their own king, who they insisted was the rightful
	      <lb/>proprietor. But the <name>Dutch</name> perversely maintained
	      <lb/>a contrary opinion, and in despite of occasional
	      <lb/>menaces from their neighbours,—who however
	      <lb/>found it enough to take care of themselves,—they
	      <lb/>continued to enjoy for many years, their own lan­
	      <lb/>guage, customs and laws, in their native purity
	      <lb/>and perfection. It is true, they had been sorely
	      <lb/>aggrieved by certain of the <placeName>Massachusetts'</placeName> folk,
	      <lb/>who seized the goodly lands of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, which
	      <pb n="143"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="13(4)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">143</mw>
	      <lb/>they intended to improve for their own advantage;
	      <lb/>and when they had already erected a fort, which they
	      <lb/>called the <placeName>Huise</placeName> or <placeName>fort of Good Hope</placeName>, and plant­
	      <lb/>ed two pieces of artillery on what is the present
	      <lb/>site of <placeName>Hartford</placeName>. But they had the mortification
	      <lb/>of seeing their flag insulted, first, by the people of
	      <lb/><placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, who refused to strike their colours to it,
	      <lb/>and disdaining their threats, sailed boldly past, and
	      <lb/>set up a trading house, well defended from all hos­
	      <lb/>tile attacks; and last, though not least, a roving
	      <lb/>congregation from the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>, sat quietly
	      <lb/>down, under the very muzzles of their guns, and
	      <lb/>built around them an orderly and fair village, which
	      <lb/>crowded them out of their strong hold; and, by
	      <lb/>persuasion and a show of strength, they were final­
	      <lb/>ly induced to give up all their claims to the coun­
	      <lb/>try;—very prudently considering, that they could
	      <lb/>not substantiate, and were too weak to contend for
	      <lb/>them. Whether the remembrance of these alleged
	      <lb/>wrongs continued to rankle in their breasts, it is
	      <lb/>impossible to determine; they however carried on
	      <lb/>a friendly commerce with the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> colonies, but
	      <lb/>showed no disposition to interfere in their quarrels,
	      <lb/>—even in the decisive struggle with the <name>Pequods</name>.
	      <lb/><persName>Kieft</persName>, then Governor of the <placeName>New-Netherlands</placeName>,
	      <lb/>preserved a strict neutrality. The people in gene­
	      <lb/>ral, imitated the peaceable disposition of their ru­
	      <lb/>ler; feeling it more safe to smoke thier pipes at
	      <lb/>home, than to seek for uncertain laurels in a land
	      <lb/>of savages,—with no prospect of advantage, but,
	      <lb/>on the contrary, at the risk of involving themselves
	      <pb n="144"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="13(4)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">144</mw>
	      <lb/>in difficulties, and perhaps provoking the ven­
	      <lb/>geance of the natives.</p>
	    <p>Thus circumstanced, <persName>Major Atherton</persName> met with
	      <lb/>little sympathy, and it was in vain that he occupied
	      <lb/>his mind in forming plans to prosecute his enter­
	      <lb/>prise, which he constantly found it impossible to
	      <lb/>execute. The inhabitants of <placeName>New-Amsterdam</placeName>,
	      <lb/>however, seemed to regard him with favour, and
	      <lb/>exerted themselves, with wonderful alacrity, to
	      <lb/>render his residence in their city agreeable. The
	      <lb/>houses of the most respectable citizens were cour­
	      <lb/>teously opened to him, and he was at all times,
	      <lb/>welcome to attach himself to the family circle,—
	      <lb/>look at the good man, while with the most contem­
	      <lb/>plative air imaginable, he regaled himself with his
	      <lb/>huge pipe of tobacco, and with apparent delight
	      <lb/>puffed the smoke from his mouth, like vapour from
	      <lb/>a steam vessel;—and listen to the conversation of
	      <lb/>his more loquacious dame, who good-humouredly
	      <lb/>amused him with family details, not omitting occa­
	      <lb/>sional remarks on the affairs of the neighbourhood,
	      <lb/>which in her zeal for the public good, were gene­
	      <lb/>rally regarded with extreme interest. The daugh­
	      <lb/>ters, with commendable industry, usually sat apart,
	      <lb/>as demure as the household cats, exercising their
	      <lb/>genius in garnishing and repairing the family gar­
	      <lb/>ments; being taught by their prudent mothers to
	      <lb/>win hearts and husbands,—not by an unfeminine
	      <lb/>propensity to talking,—but by the dexterous use of
	      <lb/>their fingers, in which consists the true excellence
	      <lb/>of woman.</p>
	    <pb n="145"/>

	    <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">145</mw>
	    <p><persName>Atherton</persName> soon found it was worse than useless
	      <lb/>to complain; if, by chance, an impatient wish es­
	      <lb/>caped him, the people looked at him, and at each
	      <lb/>other, as if struck with doubts of his sanity; for
	      <lb/>they really believed none but a madman, or one
	      <lb/>perversely discontented, could reject the charming
	      <lb/>tranquillity of <placeName>New-Amsterdam</placeName>, when there was
	      <lb/>every thing that heart could wish—that is, enough
	      <lb/>to eat and drink,—not forgetting the grand inspi­
	      <lb/>rer of felicity,—tobacco,—and time to smoke and
	      <lb/>sleep, and an abundance of raiment to put on:—in
	      <lb/>fine, nothing but a few straight ditches were want­
	      <lb/>ing to render it a complete Dutch paradise. The
	      <lb/>people too, were sober and inudstrious, well pleas­
	      <lb/>ed to tread in the steps of their forefathers, and
	      <lb/>never prying into things that did not concern them,
	      <lb/>nor dabbling in vain experiments, and seeking out
	      <lb/>new inventions, which bring trouble and ruin on so
	      <lb/>many young provinces, and old ones too. It was,
	      <lb/>therefore, beyond their comprehension, that any
	      <lb/>man should think of leaving such a place, to em­
	      <lb/>broil himself with the horrible <name>Indians</name>, who scalp­
	      <lb/>ed and murdered every thing they could lay their
	      <lb/>dingy hands upon—and all to aid the restive <placeName>Mas­
		<lb/>sachusetts'</placeName> people, who, the Governor had been
	      <lb/>heard to say, were not much better than savages
	      <lb/>themselves; for had they not driven away the
	      <lb/>peace-loving <name>Dutch</name>, and planted fields, and built
	      <lb/>villages, where they had intended to plant and build,
	      <lb/>if time had been given them? Indeed, it was more
	      <lb/>than once suggested in a secret council of thrifty
	      <pb n="146"/>

	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">146</mw>
	      <lb/>burghers, that those encroaching colonists might,
	      <lb/>on some luckless day invade their fair capital, if
	      <lb/>the cautious rulers of the land, did not avert their
	      <lb/>designs, by building dykes, and cutting canals to
	      <lb/>defend it, after the most approved fashion of their
	      <lb/>ancestors. Unfortunately however, the inequali­
	      <lb/>ties of this new country, uselessly heaped into hills,
	      <lb/>and scooped out into vallies, opposed obstacles to
	      <lb/>their plan, which had never puzzled the brains of
	      <lb/>their countrymen on the other side of the <placeName>Atlantic</placeName>,
	      <lb/>where the beautiful swamps were perfectly free
	      <lb/>from such incumbrances, and seemed moulded by
	      <lb/>nature to suit their peculiar genius.</p>
	    <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName>, therefore, very philosophically
	      <lb/>resolved to endure with patience what could not be
	      <lb/>avoided, and to confine his useless regrets to his
	      <lb/>own bosom,—and many a solitary hour was given
	      <lb/>to their indulgence. But in public he was ever
	      <lb/>gay and courteous, and by his affability, the cheer­
	      <lb/>fulness with which he entered into the feelings of
	      <lb/>the old, and the amusements of the young,—he
	      <lb/>soon became a prodigious favourite, particularly
	      <lb/>with the ancient ladies, to whose lengthened dis­
	      <lb/>course, with the deference due to their sex, and the
	      <lb/>gallantry of a young soldier, he would listen with
	      <lb/>the utmost politeness, though it is true their lan­
	      <lb/>guage was not always quite intelligible, and his
	      <lb/>thoughts were generally afar off. But the plump
	      <lb/>little divinities of the city were so enamoured with
	      <lb/>his attentions that their round-headed admirers
	      <lb/>began to find themselves slighted by their fair mis­

	      <lb/>tresses, and in the height of their alarm, might
	      <lb/>perhaps have been induced to convey the intruder
	      <lb/>from their shores, if circumstances had not occur­
	      <lb/>red to render it useless;—though they must uncha­
	      <lb/>ritably persisted in ascribing his success, not to
	      <lb/>any superiority on his part, but to that perverse
	      <lb/>ove of novelty, which it is said clings to woman
	      <lb/>through all the changes of her capricious life.</p>
	    <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> was a frequent guest at the
	      <lb/>house of <persName>Captain Van Schiller</persName>, and the idle world,
	      <lb/>which cares not whether it speaks truth or false­
	      <lb/>hood, presumed to say he was allured thither by
	      <lb/>the charms of <persName>Gertrude</persName>, his youngest daughter;—
	      <lb/>for had not the Captain gone up the <placeName>Hudson</placeName> to
	      <lb/><placeName>Fort Orange</placeName>, and what else could he be seeking?
	      <lb/>But <persName>Atherton</persName> remained ignorant of these sugges­
	      <lb/>tions, and the subject of them was scarcely a mo­
	      <lb/>ment in his thoughts; but <persName>Gertrude</persName> at that time
	      <lb/>chanced to be a reigning belle, and there was
	      <lb/>more than one gentle youth, who regarded his sup­
	      <lb/>posed pretensions with a jealous eye. He often
	      <lb/>met there a young man distantly connected with
	      <lb/>the family, whose frank and engaging manners
	      <lb/>soon gained his entire confidence and esteem.
	      <lb/><persName>Hans Van Haarman</persName>,—such was his name,—was a
	      <lb/>native of <placeName>Holland</placeName>; but he had resided several
	      <lb/>years in the <placeName>New-Netherlands</placeName>; and having fol­
	      <lb/>lowed the profession of arms almost from child­
	      <lb/>hood, he was soon after his arrival invested with
	      <lb/>the command of <placeName>Fort Amsterdam</placeName>, the highest mili­
	      <lb/>tary rank which it was then in the power of the
	      <pb n="148"/>

	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">148</mw>
	      <lb/>Colony to confer. His father had served in the
	      <lb/><rs type="properAdjective">Dutch</rs> wars with <persName>Colonel Atherton</persName>, with whom he
	      <lb/>was in habits of intimacy; and this circumstance
	      <lb/>first interested the young men in each other; a
	      <lb/>similarity of situation heightened this interest,
	      <lb/>which was daily strengthened by a congeniality of
	      <lb/>sentiments and characters. <persName>Van Haarman</persName> inhe­
	      <lb/>rited from his mother, a <rs type="properAdjective">French</rs> <name>protestant</name>, the
	      <lb/>spirit and vivacity of her country, which entirely
	      <lb/>preponderated over the <rs type="properAdjective">Dutch</rs> prudence and
	      <lb/>phlegm, otherwise to have been expected from his
	      <lb/>father; and always yielding to first impressions
	      <lb/>he became at once the friend and intimate compa­
	      <lb/>nion of <persName>Major Atherton</persName>. He opened his whole
	      <lb/>heart to him without reserve, and <persName>Atherton</persName> soon
	      <lb/>learned from his own lips that he was also a lover,
	      <lb/>and with the consent to her friends affianced to
	      <lb/><persName>Maria Van Schiller</persName> the eldest sister of <persName>Gertrude</persName>,
	      <lb/>though want of fortune, that cruel foe to tender
	      <lb/>hearts, had hitherto delayed the day of happiness;
	      <lb/>and it was still put off to a distant period to the
	      <lb/>great alarm of <persName>Van Haarman</persName>, who feared the
	      <lb/>worldly prudence and ambition of her father
	      <lb/>might tempt him to prefer a more wealthy suitor
	      <lb/>for his daughter,—in despite of the entreaties of
	      <lb/><persName>Dan Cupid</persName>, who represented that lovers could live
	      <lb/>on little or nothing—a matter rather problemati­
	      <lb/>cal even in those simple days.</p>
	    <p><persName>Atherton</persName> in return, disclosed his own hopes, fears
	      <lb/>and perplexities without reserve, to <persName>Van Haar­
		<lb/>man</persName>; and felt much relieved by consulting on his
	      <pb n="149"/>

	      <lb/>future plans with one who was interested in his
	      <lb/>behalf, and able to advise, and perhaps assist him.
	      <lb/><persName>Van Haarman</persName>, indeed, from the moment he learn­
	      <lb/>ed his unpleasant situation, used every exertion to
	      <lb/>procure him a conveyance to <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>; he
	      <lb/>even endeavoured to engage the Governor in his
	      <lb/>cause, and freely offered his own services in the un­
	      <lb/>dertaking. Things however went on but slowly;
	      <lb/><persName>Atherton</persName> had been a fortnight in <placeName>New-Amsterdam</placeName>,
	      <lb/>and <persName>Governor Kieft</persName> who held his case in consi­
	      <lb/>deration for a week, was still undecided,—when a
	      <lb/>vessel arrived in the harbour from a long voyage,
	      <lb/>and brought intelligence which produced a general
	      <lb/>excitement. The Captain, a bold and adventurous
	      <lb/>man, had penetrated through the very ports of the
	      <lb/>enemy to traffic with the friendly <name>Indians</name>; and
	      <lb/>having bartered his commodities on advantageous
	      <lb/>terms, was returning home, when near the mouth of
	      <lb/>the <placeName>Pequod river</placeName> he was surrounded by <name>Indians</name>
	      <lb/>in their canoes, and attacked with such fury, that
	      <lb/>for a time escape seemed almost impossible. But
	      <lb/>fortunately the <rs type="properAdjective">Dutch</rs> captain was supported by a
	      <lb/>brave crew, who fought with desperate courage,
	      <lb/>convinced that their only alternative was captivi­
	      <lb/>ty and a death of torture; and after a severe con­
	      <lb/>flict they completely routed the <name>Pequods</name>, who re­
	      <lb/>treated with all expedition, though not without
	      <lb/>considerable loss both in killed and prisoners.
	      <lb/>The <name>Dutch</name> were not materially injured; for their
	      <lb/>vessel was well-armed, and the men trained to ac­
	      <lb/>tion, which gave them a decided advantage over

	      <lb/>the undisciplined fierceness of the enemy. The
	      <lb/>Captain also brought information from unquestion­
	      <lb/>able authority, that the <name>Pequods</name>, driven from <placeName>Say­
	      <lb/>brook</placeName> by the reinforcement of <persName>Captain Mason</persName> and
	      <lb/>his party, had retired to the fort of <persName>Sassacus</persName>, from
	      <lb/>whence they issued forth to ravage the country;
	      <lb/>that a body of them had lately surprised the people
	      <lb/>of <placeName>Weathersfield</placeName>, while labouring in their fields,
	      <lb/>and inhumanly murdered several of both sexes,
	      <lb/>destroyed numbers of their cattle, and carried two
	      <lb/>young women into captivity.</p>
	    <p>These details excited the utmost indignation in
	      <lb/>every breast; and <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, in whose mind
	      <lb/>the image of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, was now continually
	      <lb/>associated with scenes of danger, determined at
	      <lb/>every hazard, to repair immediately to <placeName>Saybrook</placeName>
	      <lb/>fort. The idea that she might already be among
	      <lb/>the slain or captives, at times gave him insup­
	      <lb/>portable pain; but he consoled himself by reflect­
	      <lb/>ing that she could not have been near that scene
	      <lb/>of outrage, which was several miles from the
	      <lb/>abode of <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName>.  Still his anxiety was un­
	      <lb/>remitting; and independent of his personal feel­
	      <lb/>ings, he cherished an increased desire to assist his
	      <lb/>countrymen in freeing themselves from a scourge,
	      <lb/>which continually threatened their safety. He
	      <lb/>therefore, entreated <persName>Van Haarman</persName> to use his in­
	      <lb/>fluence with the Captain, who had lately returned
	      <lb/>to convey him to the <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> shore; and em­
	      <lb/>powered him to offer any reward, which might en­
	      <lb/>sure his services. But these private arrangements

	      <lb/>were unexpectedly precluded by the spirited con­
	      <lb/>duct of <persName>Governor Kieft</persName>, who, urged by many con­
	      <lb/>siderations political and personal, publicly an­
	      <lb/>nounced his resolution to aid the <name>English</name>, on this
	      <lb/>important occasion. Orders were issued to the
	      <lb/>proper authorities, to prepare a vessel well armed
	      <lb/>and manned, to sail immediately to the <placeName type="properAdjective">Pequod
		<lb/>harbour</placeName>, to ransom the captive maids at any cost,
	      <lb/>and deliver them in safety to the <name>English</name> at <placeName>Fort
		<lb/>Saybrook</placeName>. <persName>Van Haarman</persName> at his own desire, was
	      <lb/>appointed to command the expedition, and the re­
	      <lb/>sentment of the people, was so generally roused
	      <lb/>against the inhuman conduct of the <name>Indians</name>, that
	      <lb/>there were more volunteers than could be disposed
	      <lb/>of in the service.</p>
	    <p>On the evening previous to their departure,
	      <lb/><persName>Major Atherton</persName> was honoured by an invitation at
	      <lb/>the Governor's, where all the high mightinesses
	      <lb/>of the city were assembled in solemn state; and
	      <lb/>his Lady on the important and long remembered
	      <lb/>occasion, threw open the doors of her <term>best parlour</term>,
	      <lb/>—a term analogous to the drawing-room of the
	      <lb/>present day, into which her guests were seldom
	      <lb/>admitted, except on visits of great ceremony. All
	      <lb/>the bright-eyed damsels of <placeName>New-Amsterdam</placeName> were
	      <lb/>ranged in a circle round it, like puppets in a show­
	      <lb/>box, each one industriously engaged in accomplish­
	      <lb/>ing some formidable piece of workmanship, from
	      <lb/>which her attention was seldom withdrawn, except
	      <lb/>occasionally to answer a formal question, with a
	      <lb/>still more formal monosyllable. A huge round

	      <lb/>was at length set forth in tempting array, and
	      <lb/>happily afforded an opportunity for the young men
	      <lb/>to display their gallantry, while it enlivened the
	      <lb/>intellects of the elders, and suggested many inter­
	      <lb/>esting topics of discussion, to fill up the remainder
	      <lb/>of the evening, which closed at a seasonable hour,
	      <lb/>in a cloud of smoke from the numberless delft
	      <lb/>pipes which projected into the room, and almost
	      <lb/>met in the centre. Each gallant then selected the
	      <lb/>fair one, whom he most admired—if she smiled
	      <lb/>consent,—and without one murmur at the trouble
	      <lb/>and distance, escorted her to the door of her dwell­
	      <lb/>ing, and took leave of her with a cordial salute;—
	      <lb/>an agreeable <rs type="properAdjective">Dutch</rs> custom, which <persName>Atherton</persName> could
	      <lb/>by no means excuse himself from following, when
	      <lb/>he parted with the pretty <persName>Gertrude</persName>, whom he was
	      <lb/>allowed the privilege of attending home, notwith­
	      <lb/>standing the manœvres of certain of her ci-devant

	      <lb/>for more obliging, if less comely fair ones.</p>

	      <lb/><name>April</name>, an armed sloop weighed anchor in the har­
	      <lb/>bour of <placeName>New-Amsterdam</placeName>, and under a salute of all
	      <lb/>the guns in the fort, which were fit for use, answered
	      <lb/>by cheers from the men on board, and a mighty
	      <lb/>shout of the multitude on shore, mingled with the
	      <lb/>barking of curs, and the grunting of pigs,—it set sail
	      <lb/>on the destined voyage of amity to the <rs type="properAdjective">Pequod</rs> shores.
	      <lb/>The worthies of the land regarded the stately bark
	      <lb/>with prodigious satisfaction, as it boldly ploughed
	      <lb/>the waves, which sparkled and foamed around
	      <lb/>it with the sails swelled by a stiff breeze, and the
	      <lb/><rs type="properAdjective">Dutch</rs> colours gaily streaming from the tall mast­
	      <lb/>head. <persName>Van Haarman</persName> reclined on the stern, in a
	      <lb/>very lover-like attitude, unwilling to withdraw his
	      <lb/>eyes a moment from the spot, where his love and

	      <lb/>deck, with the quick, elastic step of one who has
	      <lb/>escaped a prison-house, and exults again in the

	      <lb/>seemed floating in the waters, like a region of
	      <lb/>enchantment, decked out with verdure and bloom,
	      <lb/>and sporting a thousand hues in the brilliant sun­
	      <lb/>shine and chequered shade;—though still oftener
	      <lb/>his eye roved impatiently across the Sound, and
	      <lb/>lingered on the clear horizon, watching to obtain
	      <lb/>a glimpse of the yet distant hills of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>.</p>
	    <p>A number of the <name>Pequod Indians</name>, who had
	      <lb/>been lately captured were put on board the vessel,
	      <lb/>in the expectation that it would be necessary to
	      <lb/>offer them in exchange for the young women; and
	      <lb/>though they submitted, in sullen silence to their
	      <lb/>destiny, it was considered prudent to secure them
	      <lb/>below the deck, to prevent the possibility of any
	      <lb/>violent attempt at escape. One of their number,
	      <lb/>however, a young man of noble countenance and
	      <lb/>demeanour, was exempted from this general con­
	      <lb/>finement. He received a severe wound in his right
	      <lb/>arm, during the action with the <name>Dutch</name>, and his
	      <lb/>subsequent imprisonment, with the pain he endured,
	      <lb/>and the mortification and chagrin attendant on his
	      <lb/>situation, had reduced him to extreme weakness.
	      <lb/><persName>Atherton</persName> was particularly interested in the ap­
	      <lb/>pearance of the young <name>Indian</name>, as he entered the
	      <lb/>sloop with his companions,—their hands bound
	      <lb/>and attended by a strong guard; he saw him stag­
	      <lb/>ger as if too feeble to support himself; and yield­
	      <lb/>ing to the impulse of humanity, sprang forward,
	      <lb/>and offered him the assistance of his arm.</p>
	    <p><said><persName>Cushminaw</persName> needs no help;</said> said the <name>Indian</name>, in
	      <lb/>tolerable <name>English</name>, <said>the white man is his foe, and

	    <p>He raised his fettered hands energetically as he
	      <lb/>spoke; but in an instant they fell nerveless by his
	      <lb/>side, and at the same time, a gush of blood flowed
	      <lb/>profusely from his wound. The savage looked at
	      <lb/>it with an unmoved countenance; but <persName>Atherton</persName>,
	      <lb/>who now first comprehended the cause of his weak­
	      <lb/>ness, hastily removed a cloak of furs which was
	      <lb/>thrown over his arm, and <persName>Van Haarman</persName> ordered
	      <lb/>his fetters to be immediately taken off. <persName>Cushminaw</persName>
	      <lb/>had, for several days, endured excessive pain with
	      <lb/>a fortitude peculiar to his <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> character, and
	      <lb/>too proud to complain or ask assistance, he con­
	      <lb/>cealed his wound from every eye, and would rather
	      <lb/>have suffered death than permitted a groan to
	      <lb/>escape him. It was however neither deep nor dan­
	      <lb/>gerous; and had he been at liberty to exercise upon
	      <lb/>it the skill which his race always acquire in the
	      <lb/>use of simples, it would scarcely have troubled him;
	      <lb/>but total neglect and the excitement of his passions
	      <lb/>had greatly inflamed it; and exhausted by the loss
	      <lb/>of blood, he was obliged to submit quietly to the
	      <lb/>will of those around him. The other <name>Indians</name> were
	      <lb/>removed from deck; and a young man who had
	      <lb/>some knowledge of surgery, examined the wound,
	      <lb/>and after applying a lenitive, tightly bandaged it,
	      <lb/>and placed the arm in a sling. <persName>Cushminaw</persName> had
	      <lb/>hitherto yielded quietly to the operation; but with
	      <lb/>a smile of ineffable scorn, he tore the sling from
	      <lb/>his neck, and throwing it from him, exclaimed,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>Shall a warrior of the <name>Pequod tribe</name> be tied like
		<lb/>a child to its mother's breast?</said>

	    <p>He rose indignantly as he spoke, and walked
	      <lb/>slowly around the deck; he sometimes stopped, and
	      <lb/>for many moments, watched the waves rising and
	      <lb/>dashing against the sides of the vessel; he would
	      <lb/>then look earnestly towards his native shores, and
	      <lb/>again resume his walk, with an air of melancholy
	      <lb/>thoughtfulness. There was a stately dignity in
	      <lb/>the mien and gestures of the young <name>Indian</name>, and an
	      <lb/>occasional fierceness in the expression of his pierc­
	      <lb/>ing eye, which struck the seamen with awe, and
	      <lb/>they constantly retreated before his steps, as if
	      <lb/>fearful he would commit some act of violence on
	      <lb/>them. <persName>Cushminaw</persName> seemed to understand their feel­
	      <lb/>ings; but he regarded them with contempt more
	      <lb/>than anger, and never deigned to speak unless pre­
	      <lb/>viously addressed. It was the opinion of almost
	      <lb/>every one that he ought to be confined; but <persName>Van
		<lb/>Haarman</persName> was convinced he could do no injury;
	      <lb/>and hoping he might prove of service, if kindly
	      <lb/>used, in the expected negociation, insisted on leav­
	      <lb/>ing him at liberty to follow his inclinations with­
	      <lb/>out restraint.</p>
	    <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> endeavoured to draw him into
	      <lb/>conversation, on subjects which appeared to interest
	      <lb/>him, till by degrees he won upon his confidence,
	      <lb/>and the young savage, touched by his kindness,
	      <lb/>began to feel pleasure in his society, and the stern­
	      <lb/>ness of his countenance gave place to a grateful
	      <lb/>smile, whenever he approached him. <persName>Cushminaw</persName>
	      <lb/>was in the spring of life, and could not long indulge
	      <lb/>a gloom and distrust which belonged not to his age
	      <pb n="157"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="14(5)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">157</mw>
	      <lb/>or character; and while he again breathed the
	      <lb/>pure air, and saw the light of heaven, and felt his
	      <lb/>pain assuaged by sympathy, and was indulged the
	      <lb/>hope of a speedy return to the freedom for which
	      <lb/>he sighed, the native generosity of his disposition
	      <lb/>prevailed over every hostile feeling, and he soon
	      <lb/>regarded <persName>Atherton</persName> with that strong interest and
	      <lb/>gratitude which is almost peculiar to the savage
	      <lb/>heart.</p>
	    <p><persName>Atherton</persName> learned from him that he was the only
	      <lb/>son of a <placeName>Narraganset</placeName> Sachem, who early taught
	      <lb/>him to excel in the athletic sports and exercises of
	      <lb/>the <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> youth; and even in childhood trained
	      <lb/>him in the arts of war, and made him his compa­
	      <lb/>nion in every hostile encounter with the neighbour­
	      <lb/>ing tribes. Thus accomplished and inured to fa­
	      <lb/>tigue, at the age of fifteen, he went with the warriors
	      <lb/>of his nation to avenge an alleged injury commit­
	      <lb/>ted by the <name>Pequods</name>, with whom they were almost
	      <lb/>continually at strife. But the event proved disas­
	      <lb/>trous to his people, who were utterly defeated;
	      <lb/>his father was slain in battle, and he fell into the
	      <lb/>hands of <persName>Mononotto</persName>, a powerful sachem of the
	      <lb/><name>Pequods</name>. <persName>Mononotto</persName> was but a few years older
	      <lb/>than himself; he admired his bravery, and touched
	      <lb/>with compassion for his youth and misfortunes,
	      <lb/>adopted him for his own son, agreeably to an
	      <lb/><rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> custom, and ever treated him with the most
	      <lb/>tender affection. He had a short time before given
	      <lb/>him his young sister in marriage; and with the
	      <lb/>gratitude of a noble spirit, <persName>Cushminaw</persName> declared that
	      <pb n="158"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="14(5)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">158</mw>
	      <lb/>he would cheerfully lay down his life to serve his
	      <lb/>adopted father and people. In his childhood he
	      <lb/>was once detained many months as an hostage, by
	      <lb/>the <name>English</name> at <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, and instructed by them
	      <lb/>in their language and religion; the latter he had
	      <lb/>quite forgotten, but the former was kept in remem­
	      <lb/>brance by a frequent intercourse with the colonists,
	      <lb/>till he was received into the <name>Pequod tribe</name>; and
	      <lb/>subsequent to that period, he had been often em­
	      <lb/>ployed as an interpreter in negociating with them.
	      <lb/>He dwelt with pleasure on his early connection
	      <lb/>with the white people, and acknowledgd that he
	      <lb/>felt no enmity towards them, except as they had
	      <lb/>injured his father and brethren, whose quarrels it
	      <lb/>was his duty to avenge.</p>
	    <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> listened with interest to the sim­
	      <lb/>ple narrative of the young <name>Indian</name>; and in return,
	      <lb/>he gratified him with a short history of his own
	      <lb/>life, his passage across the great waters, and his
	      <lb/>various journeyings in the western world. <persName>Cush­
		<lb/>minaw</persName> lost not a word that he uttered; but when
	      <lb/>he had finished speaking, he laid his hand on <persName>Ather­
		<lb/>ton's</persName> arm, and said emphatically,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>Brother, hast thou no wife to be the charm of
		<lb/>thy youth, and the comfort of thine old age? to
		<lb/>weep for thine absence, and cheer thee with smiles
		<lb/>when thou returnest from the field of battle?</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><persName>Atherton</persName> answered in the negative.</p>
	    <p><said>Listen to me, brother,</said> returned <persName>Cushminaw</persName>,
	      <lb/><said>the captive maids whom you seek, are in the hands
		<lb/>of my father, <persName>Mononotto</persName>, and it is in his power to
		<pb n="159"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="14(6)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">159</mw>
		<lb/>save them alive; he loves me, and will hearken to
		<lb/>my words; and if thou wouldst take for thy wife,
		<lb/>her who is fairest of the daughters of thy land, I
		<lb/>will speak to him, and pray him to give her thee
		<lb/>for the ransom of his son.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Who is she?</said> asked Atherton; <said>by what name
		<lb/>is she known? where are her kindred, and who is
		<lb/>her companion?</said></p>
	    <p><said>I know not her name,</said> replied the <name>Indian</name>; <said>my
		<lb/>mother calls her daughter, and cherisheth her as her
		<lb/>own flesh, she is delicate as the wild rose of sum­
		<lb/>mer; but her bloom is fading, and her fair head
		<lb/>droops with untimely sorrow, her friends are afar
		<lb/>off, and her father wanders in a strange land; her
		<lb/>companion is a timid child, ignorant of the dan­
		<lb/>gers which surround her.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Good heavens!</said> exclaimed <persName>Atherton</persName>, with emo­
	      <lb/>tion; <said>of whom do you speak? tell me, I entreat
		<lb/>you, of all the relates to her?</said></p>
	    <p><said>Brother,</said> returned <persName>Cushminaw</persName>, <said>I have little
		<lb/>more to say; her eyes are dim with weeping, and
		<lb/>food and rest are strangers to her; often when my
		<lb/>mother's song has ceased, and she has laid down to
		<lb/>rest with her little ones, and only the stars are
		<lb/>awake to listen, have I heard her sing, in a low
		<lb/>voice, a sweet song of her native country, inter­
		<lb/>rupted by her sighs and tears; and my heart was
		<lb/>moved with pity for her grief. One day I return­
		<lb/>ed from the chase, just as the shadows began to
		<lb/>lengthen on the plain, and found her sitting at the
		<lb/>door of the wigwam, with her arms entwined
		<pb n="160"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="14(6)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">160</mw>
		<lb/>around the neck of her young companion on whose
		<lb/>bosom she wept bitterly. I drew near to her and
		<lb/>said, <said>Daughter of the white man, why has sorrow
		  <lb/>entered into thine heart?</said> She started on hearing
		<lb/>the language of her people, and turned on me her
		<lb/>eyes, soft as twin violets, wet with the dews of
		<lb/>morning; but alarmed at my presence, she cover­
		<lb/>ed her face, and remained silent. <said>Fear me not,
		  <lb/>young maiden,</said> I continued, <said>thou art beloved by
		  <lb/>my mother, and the arm of <persName>Cushminaw</persName> is powerful,
		  <lb/>and his tongue persuasive in the council of his
		  <lb/>brethren.</said> She started quickly from the ground,
		<lb/>and clasping her hands, exclaimed, <said>Son of the
		  <lb/>warrior, save me from a lingering captivity and
		  <lb/>cruel death, give me back to the arms of my father,
		  <lb/>who mourns his only child; and the God of the
		  <lb/>white people shall bless and reward you.</said> Moved
		<lb/>by her distress, I was about to give an answer of
		<lb/>peace, when my father approached us; he was re­
		<lb/>turning from the <placeName>fort of <persName>Sassacus</persName></placeName>, his eye was ter­
		<lb/>rible and his countenance darkened with frowns.
		<lb/>At sight of him, the young maids fled, pale and af­
		<lb/>frighted from our presence, and I saw them no
		<lb/>more; before the sitting of another sun, the barks
		<lb/>of the stranger visited our shores, and our young
		<lb/>warriors were carried into captivity.</said></p>
	    <p><persName>Cushminaw's</persName> countenance fell, and his eye flash­
	      <lb/>ed with resentment, as he alluded to their defeat;
	      <lb/>and turning from <persName>Atherton</persName>, with a lofty stride, he
	      <lb/>walked to a distant part of the vessel. <persName>Atherton</persName>
	      <lb/>was affected by the <name>Indian</name>'s words; the possibility

	      <lb/>that the vindictive chiefs would not accept a ran­
	      <lb/>som for their unfortunate captives, or that they
	      <lb/>might have already fallen victims to their cruelty,
	      <lb/>gave him extreme uneasiness; and he looked for­
	      <lb/>ward with painful solicitude to the approaching
	      <lb/>negociation.</p>
	    <p>On the following morning, the sloop entered the
	      <lb/><placeName>Pequod harbour</placeName>; and the savages alarmed by its
	      <lb/>appearance, assembled great numbers on the
	      <lb/>shore, armed and prepared to resist any hostile at­
	      <lb/>tack. The vessel was anchored in full view of the
	      <lb/>multitude, who watched it with extreme curiosity;
	      <lb/>and <persName>Van Haarman</persName> proposed sending a boat imme­
	      <lb/>diately with a few trusty men, to open the propos­
	      <lb/>ed treaty with the chiefs.</p>
	    <p><persName>Atherton</persName> readily undertook the risk and respon­
	      <lb/>sibility; and with an interpreter and four stout
	      <lb/>seamen, advanced boldly towards the land, pro­
	      <lb/>tected by the guns of the sloop, which the natives
	      <lb/>regarded with awe and wonder. The <name>Indians</name> drew
	      <lb/>their arrows to the head, ready to shoot at an in­
	      <lb/>stant's warning; but observing that <persName>Atherton</persName> and
	      <lb/>his companions did not raise their weapons, and
	      <lb/>made various gestures to signify they came in ami­
	      <lb/>ty, they gradually released their bows; and when
	      <lb/>near enough to be heard, the interpreter announced
	      <lb/>his commander's wish to speak with the grand
	      <lb/>Sachem.</p>
	    <p><persName>Sassacus</persName> stood in the midst of his warriors, dis­
	      <lb/>tinguished above them all, by the gigantic propor­
	      <lb/>tions of his figure, and the superior richness of his
	      <mw type="vol" rend="align(left)indent(+1)case(allcaps)">Vol. II.</mw>
	      <mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">15</mw>

	      <milestone unit="sig" n="15(1)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">162</mw>
	      <lb/>savage attire. His countenance was fierce and
	      <lb/>vindictive, hideously disfigured with paint, and his
	      <lb/>naked breast and arms were marked with deep in­
	      <lb/>cisions, stained with vegetable colours, bearing a
	      <lb/>rude resemblance to various wild animals and birds.
	      <lb/>A string of shells and polished stones, twisted with
	      <lb/>an enormous serpent's skin, hung round his neck;
	      <lb/>his ears were weighed down by large pendants of
	      <lb/>bone, carved into frightful figures, and his hair cut
	      <lb/>in a fantastic manner, was ornamented with tufts
	      <lb/>of eagle feathers.</p>
	    <p>On receiving <persName>Major Atherton's</persName> message, <persName>Sassa­
		<lb/>cus</persName> advanced a few paces from his attendants, with
	      <lb/>an air of command and majesty, which at once pro­
	      <lb/>claimed him sovereign of the rude people who sur­
	      <lb/>rounded him; and wrapping a cloak of panthers'
	      <lb/>skins closely around his right arm, he stood in an
	      <lb/>attitude of proud defiance, with one bare and sinewy
	      <lb/>leg extended, his bow half raised, and his eye fixed
	      <lb/>keenly on the countenance of the speaker.</p>
	    <p><persName>Atherton</persName> hastened to enquire, through his inter­
	      <lb/>preter, respecting the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> maidens, whom the
	      <lb/><rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> monarch held in captivity;—informed him,
	      <lb/>that the <name>Dutch</name> were desirous of ransoming them;—
	      <lb/>and mentioned the terms which their governor had
	      <lb/>proposed. He avoided any allusion to the <rs type="properAdjective">Pequod</rs>
	      <lb/>prisoners, as <persName>Van Haarman</persName> was instructed not to
	      <lb/>give them up, unless every other means of negocia­
	      <lb/>tion failed.</p>
	    <p><persName>Sassacus</persName> heard him with profound attention;
	      <lb/>but as soon as he had ceased speaking, he declared
	      <pb n="163"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="15(2)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">163</mw>
	      <lb/>in an imperative tone, that his captives should not
	      <lb/>be liberated; that they were bravely taken from
	      <lb/>the <name>English</name>, who provoked his wrath by intruding
	      <lb/>into his dominions, protecting the <name>Indians</name> who were
	      <lb/>tributary to him, and committing other acts of ag­
	      <lb/>gression which had caused him to lift the toma­
	      <lb/>hawk against them; and that it should not be
	      <lb/>buried so long as a white man remained to plant
	      <lb/>in the land. He asked where were his people, who
	      <lb/>had been lately taken from him? and said he would
	      <lb/>enter into no treaty until they were safely re­
	      <lb/>turned.</p>
	    <p><persName>Atherton</persName> was not empowered to enter upon this
	      <lb/>subject; he, however, assured <persName>Sassacus</persName> that the
	      <lb/><name>Pequods</name> had been taken when committing violence
	      <lb/>upon the <name>Dutch</name>, who never injured them, but on
	      <lb/>the contrary, had always traded with them in a
	      <lb/>friendly manner; and that it was their Governor,
	      <lb/>and not the <name>English</name>, who wished to purchase the
	      <lb/>captive maids; offering the highest terms in his
	      <lb/>power for their redemption.</p>
	    <p>The haughty chief rejected his offer with dis­
	      <lb/>dain; assured him, that revenge was dearer to
	      <lb/>him than all the treasures of the white people, and
	      <lb/>that he would never be prevailed with to forego it.
	      <lb/>The prisoners would have been sacrificed long ago,
	      <lb/>he added, had not <persName>Mononotto</persName> acted the woman
	      <lb/>rather than the warrior, and been moved to pity by
	      <lb/>their tears.</p>
	    <p>The stern resolve of the sachem's words and man­
	      <lb/>ner, convinced <persName>Atherton</persName> that he had entered upon a
	      <pb n="164"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="15(2)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">164</mw>
	      <lb/>difficult if not hopeless task; but veiling his uneasi­
	      <lb/>ness under an air of indifference, he answered that
	      <lb/>he had delivered his message; and if <persName>Sassacus</persName> had
	      <lb/>any thing more to say on the subject, he must speak
	      <lb/>with the Governor's deputy in the vessel, who would
	      <lb/>wait a few hours for him to consider what had been
	      <lb/>said.</p>
	    <p>But while he was ordering the men to put off
	      <lb/>from the shore, an aged warrior stepped hastily
	      <lb/>forward, and motioning them to stay awhile, ap­
	      <lb/>proached <persName>Sassacus</persName> respectfully, and remained se­
	      <lb/>veral moments in earnest conversation with him.
	      <lb/>He then left him, and informed <persName>Atherton</persName> that his
	      <lb/>tribe were anxious for the safety of their captive
	      <lb/>brethren; and if he was willing to remain with
	      <lb/>them as a hostage, they would send a chief to hold
	      <lb/>a <mcr>talk</mcr> with the people in the vessel. <persName>Atherton</persName> con­
	      <lb/>sented to the proposal, provided they would select
	      <lb/>a person of sufficient rank and importance to ren­
	      <lb/>der his own life secure; and he hoped by this means
	      <lb/>to obtain more certain intelligence respecting the
	      <lb/>captives, and perhaps find an opportunity of speak­
	      <lb/>ing with them. <persName>Sassacus</persName>, on receiving his assent,
	      <lb/>turned to his subjects and addressed them with ma­
	      <lb/>ny emphatic gestures; the most profound silence
	      <lb/>was maintained during his discourse; and when he
	      <lb/>ceased, a low murmur arose, and every countenance
	      <lb/>was agitated by some strong emotion. <persName>Atherton</persName>
	      <lb/>learned from the interpreter, that the sachem was
	      <lb/>desirous of holding a conference himself with the
	      <lb/>white men; but the attachment of his subjects led
	      <pb n="165"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="15(3)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">165</mw>
	      <lb/>them to oppose his design, believing the person of
	      <lb/><persName>Major Atherton</persName> would be no security for that of so
	      <lb/>potent and dreaded a chief. But <persName>Sassacus</persName> was in­
	      <lb/>accessible to fear, and like most arbitrary sove­
	      <lb/>reigns, determined at all events to exercise his own
	      <lb/>will, and exact obedience; with a terrible voice he
	      <lb/>accordingly commanded silence, and in a tone
	      <lb/>which could not be disputed, declared it his inten­
	      <lb/>tion to place himself in the power of the enemy.
	      <lb/>The poor <name>Indians</name> dared not utter a word, even of
	      <lb/>entreaty; but with sorrowful looks continued to
	      <lb/>regard him, while he bade them farewell; and with
	      <lb/>an air of determined courage, advanced towards the
	      <lb/>boat. His warriors crowded to the water's edge,
	      <lb/>as if to protect him to the last moment; and <persName>Ath­
		<lb/>erton</persName> sprang on shore in the midst of them, at the
	      <lb/>moment that <persName>Sassacus</persName> entered the bark, and was
	      <lb/>safe in the hands of his own men. The boat glided
	      <lb/>swiftly away; <persName>Sassacus</persName> stood in the midst of it,
	      <lb/>with his hands folded, and an expression of gloomy
	      <lb/>satisfaction on his features, like one who is about
	      <lb/>to encounter danger for the glory of overcoming it.
	      <lb/><persName>Van Haarman</persName> from his vessel witnessed all that
	      <lb/>passed, and with his principal officers waited on the
	      <lb/>deck to receive the sachem with becoming courte­
	      <lb/>sy. The savages, apparently satisfied with his ci­
	      <lb/>vility, then began to arrange themselves for a
	      <lb/>march; and by gestures informed <persName>Atherton</persName> that
	      <lb/>he must accompany them to the fort. <persName>Atherton</persName>
	      <lb/>cheerfully submitted to their wishes; and his con­
	      <lb/>fidence in them evidently gained their good-will.

	      <lb/>Though closely guarded, they seemed anxious to
	      <lb/>render his situation comfortable, and repeatedly
	      <lb/>pressed him to partake of their humble food. He
	      <lb/>could scarcely realize that he was in the midst of
	      <lb/>a people, who regarded his nation with deadly ha­
	      <lb/>tred, and probably viewed him with personal aver­
	      <lb/>sion at the same moment that they treated him with
	      <lb/>the most attentive hospitality. A forbearance
	      <lb/>which these singular beings are taught to consider
	      <lb/>a duty; and the stranger who seeks the shelter of
	      <lb/>their roof, whatever his country or crimes, even
	      <lb/>their mortal enemy, is welcome to share their food
	      <lb/>and lodging; and his voluntary confidence is al­
	      <lb/>ways sufficient to protect him.</p>
	    <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName>, however, found no one who
	      <lb/>could or would speak to him in his own language;
	      <lb/>and being totally unacquainted with the <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> dia­
	      <lb/>lect, their conversation was confined entirely to
	      <lb/>signs. But all his efforts to gain any intelligence
	      <lb/>respecting the captives, proved unavailing; natu­
	      <lb/>rally shrewd, they readily comprehended his wish­
	      <lb/>es in every other respect; but with their usual cun­
	      <lb/>ning and caution, they were perversely stupid when­
	      <lb/>ever he attempted to draw information from them
	      <lb/>on the subject which so deeply interested him. Still
	      <lb/>he continued to hope, that some lucky accident
	      <lb/>would at length gratify his wishes; and in the
	      <lb/>mean time, the novelty of his situation, and the
	      <lb/>strange manners of the savage people around him,
	      <lb/>kept his curiosity and interest constantly excited. He
	      <lb/>was particularly amused by the <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> women, who
	      <pb n="167"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="15(4)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">167</mw>
	      <lb/>were continually surrounding him; many of them
	      <lb/>had never before seen a white man, and they exa­
	      <lb/>mined him with great satisfaction, often laughing
	      <lb/>and clapping their hands when he smiled or per­
	      <lb/>sonally noticed them. To one or two, who seemed
	      <lb/>of superior rank, he offered some trifling presents,
	      <lb/>which were highly pleasing to the swarthy <mcr>fair</mcr> ones,
	      <lb/>and attracted many others to him, in the expecta­
	      <lb/>tion of sharing similar favours. He however made
	      <lb/>them understand that he had nothing more to give,
	      <lb/>and signified a wish to go with them to their wig­
	      <lb/>wams, which were clustered together at a short dis­
	      <lb/>tance from the fort. But the wary chiefs, who per­
	      <lb/>fectly comprehended his motives, interdicted him
	      <lb/>from following them, and with menacing gestures
	      <lb/>dispersed the obedient squaws to their places of
	      <lb/>abode. Yet it was not long before they returned,
	      <lb/>at first timidly, then with increasing boldness and
	      <lb/>numbers; though <persName>Atherton</persName> was so closely watched
	      <lb/>by the savage warriors, that they could not approach
	      <lb/>so near him as before. But they were as well skill­
	      <lb/>ed in the arts of persuasion as many of their sex
	      <lb/>who boast of clearer skins; and by degrees, <persName>Ather­
		<lb/>ton</persName> found himself again encompassed by his female
	      <lb/>admirers, who mingled freely with their sooty lords,
	      <lb/>and seemed never weary of looking him,—often
	      <lb/>feeling of his dress, and apparently expressing great
	      <lb/>wonder at his beard: they had never seen the like
	      <lb/>on the face of an <name>Indian</name>. They also admired the
	      <lb/>hilt of his sword, which was much ornament­
	      <lb/>ed; and <persName>Atherton</persName>, to surprise them, drew the blade
	      <pb n="168"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="15(4)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">168</mw>
	      <lb/>partly from its scabbard; but the sharp edge and
	      <lb/>glittering appearance so much alarmed them, that
	      <lb/>they fled with a discordant yell, leaving the men
	      <lb/>highly amused by their terror.</p>
	    <p>There was one young squaw peculiarly modest
	      <lb/>and interesting in her appearance, who remained
	      <lb/>totally unmoved by the fears of her companions.
	      <lb/>She stood leaning against a tree, singing in a low
	      <lb/>voice; and as <persName>Atherton</persName> listened attentively, he
	      <lb/>caught a few words of <name>English</name> mingled with the
	      <lb/><rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> dialect. Her eyes were fixed stedfastly on
	      <lb/>his face, and as he looked earnestly at her, he fan­
	      <lb/>cied she nodded significantly; though her chaunt
	      <lb/>was unbroken. Determined to ascertain her mean­
	      <lb/>ing, if she had any, he advanced nearer, and offer­
	      <lb/>ed her a small knife of considerable value. She
	      <lb/>received it with a smile; and while examining it
	      <lb/>attentively, <persName>Atherton</persName> ventured to say to her, <said>Speak
		<lb/>to me quickly, if you can tell me aught of the <rs type="properAdjective">En­
		  <lb/>glish</rs> maidens.</said> The woman made no reply, but
	      <lb/>looked first at him, then fearfully towards the war­
	      <lb/>riors who stood around them; and at the moment
	      <lb/>a stern sachem, who kept a vigilant eye on <persName>Ath­
		<lb/>erton</persName>, addressed her in a harsh and angry tone.
	      <lb/>Her soft features instantly assumed a haughty ex­
	      <lb/>pression, and answering him with an air of dis­
	      <lb/>dain, she turned proudly away, and walked slowly
	      <lb/>from the spot. <persName>Atherton</persName> was strongly inclined to
	      <lb/>follow her, but a conviction of the folly and impru­
	      <lb/>dence of such a course restrained him; though he
	      <lb/>felt fully persuaded that she was acquainted with
	      <lb/>the situation of the captives, and had no doubt that it
	      <pb n="169"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="15(5)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">169</mw>
	      <lb/>was her intention to speak with him concerning them.
	      <lb/>He therefore continually watched for her re-ap­
	      <lb/>pearance, but the day passed away in disappoint­
	      <lb/>ment, and towards its close the <rs type="properAdjective">Dutch</rs> boat was
	      <lb/>again seen approaching the shore. <persName>Atherton</persName> was
	      <lb/>immediately re-conducted to the beach, whither the
	      <lb/>whole multitude hastened with joyful acclamations
	      <lb/>to receive their monarch. At that moment he ob­
	      <lb/>served the young <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> woman among the crowd,
	      <lb/>her eyes fixed on him as before, with a significant
	      <lb/>expression. He cautiously retreated a step or two
	      <lb/>from his guard, and by a look of entreaty besought
	      <lb/>her to explain herself. She waved her hand with
	      <lb/>a warning gesture, and darted from his sight with
	      <lb/>the speed of lightning. Vexed with her conduct,
	      <lb/>and half inclined to believe she was sporting with
	      <lb/>his curiosity, he remained musing on the strange
	      <lb/>adventure till roused by feeling some one brush
	      <lb/>lightly past him, and at the same time something
	      <lb/>was thrust hastily in his hand. He instinctively
	      <lb/>grasped it closely, but had scarcely time to remark
	      <lb/>the figure of the squaw flying from him, before the
	      <lb/>boat touched the strand, and <persName>Atherton</persName> heard his
	      <lb/>name called loudly by <persName>Van Haarman</persName>. He sprang
	      <lb/>forward to greet his friend, and exchanging has­
	      <lb/>ty adieus with his savage entertainers, entered
	      <lb/>the boat just as <persName>Sassacus</persName> again set foot on his own
	      <lb/>dominions.</p>
	    <p>Scarcely heeding the numerous inquiries of <persName>Van
		<lb/>Haarman</persName>, <persName>Major Atherton</persName> hastened to examine the
	      <lb/><name>Indian</name>'s gift; it was a strip of smooth bark, and
	      <pb n="170"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="15(5)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">170</mw>
	      <lb/>on it written with some pointed instrument, and
	      <lb/>evidently by a trembling hand the following
	      <lb/>words.—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>The sachem <persName>Mononotto</persName> protects us; we are
		<lb/>safe; leave this inhospitable land I entreat you,
		<lb/>and do not risk your safety to effect our liberation.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><persName>Atherton</persName> read this scrawl repeatedly, and with
	      <lb/>strong emotion; there was no signature, and the
	      <lb/>writing was unknown to him; could it have been
	      <lb/>sent by any one who had recognized him by the
	      <lb/><name>Indian</name>'s description? He thought it impossible;
	      <lb/>he was not known to any females in the <placeName>Connecti­
		<lb/>cut</placeName> colony, except <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> and her cousin,
	      <lb/>and the idea that they were in a situation of so
	      <lb/>much peril, though it had often painfully crossed
	      <lb/>his mind, was too dreadful to be indulged. Again
	      <lb/>he examined the characters attentively; he was un­
	      <lb/>acquainted with <persName>Miriam's</persName> writing, and therefore
	      <lb/>could not compare them, but the evident anxiety
	      <lb/>for his safety which had dictated the scrawl, the
	      <lb/>generous wish to relieve his solicitude, and deter
	      <lb/>him from rushing upon danger, rather than to se­
	      <lb/>cure her own safety—who but <persName>Miriam</persName> at such a
	      <lb/>moment would be so considerate, so disinterested?
	      <lb/>Full of doubt and inquietude he shewed the writing
	      <lb/>to <persName>Van Haarman</persName>, who was perplexed, and rather
	      <lb/>impatient at his long silence, and related to him all
	      <lb/>the events of the day.</p>
	    <p><persName>Van Haarman</persName> however, after a careful examina­
	      <lb/>tion and attentive hearing, laughed at his fears,
	      <lb/>and assured him that it was impossible any one

	      <lb/>could identify him under such circumstances; that
	      <lb/>even were it in reality <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, she could
	      <lb/>not for an instant suppose he had become an envoy
	      <lb/>from the <placeName>New-Netherlands</placeName>, of which place he had
	      <lb/>not even dreamed when he last saw her. <persName>Atherton</persName>
	      <lb/>thought his reasoning plausible, if not conclusive; and
	      <lb/>considerably relieved of his apprehensions, he lis­
	      <lb/>tened with interest to an account of <persName>Van Haarman's</persName>
	      <lb/>interview with <persName>Sassacus</persName>. The savage prince had
	      <lb/>discovered great obstinacy in the negociation, and
	      <lb/>a most inveterate malignity towards the <name>English</name>;
	      <lb/>he had insisted that the prisoners ought to be sa­
	      <lb/>crificed, though he acknowledged that it depended
	      <lb/>on the will of <persName>Mononotto</persName>, into whose hands they had
	      <lb/>fallen. The sachem was at that time absent, but
	      <lb/>would certainly return before evening, when it was
	      <lb/>his intention to hold a grand council with his war­
	      <lb/>riors; and on the morrow the result should be
	      <lb/>made known to the <name>Dutch</name>. <persName>Van Haarman</persName> on his
	      <lb/>part had declared his resolution to put to death
	      <lb/>all the <name>Pequods</name> who were in his power, if the mai­
	      <lb/>dens were not safely delivered up to him,—but he
	      <lb/>offered six of the highest rank for their ransom,
	      <lb/>including the adopted son of <persName>Mononotto</persName>.</p>
	    <p>Thus the lives of so many individuals hung upon
	      <lb/>a thread; and <persName>Van Haarman</persName>, to prevent a surprise
	      <lb/>from the enemy, ordered a double watch to be set
	      <lb/>for the night, and every precaution to be used to
	      <lb/>secure their safety, which the most vigilant pru­
	      <lb/>dence could suggest.</p>

	      <lb/>the unfortunate maidens, though <persName>Van Haarman</persName>
	      <lb/>endeavoured to encourage <persName>Atherton</persName>, whose ex­
	      <lb/>treme dejection surprised him, and he imparted to
	      <lb/>him several advantageous offers which he intended
	      <lb/>to make the savage monarch, on the coming day.
	      <lb/>But <persName>Atherton</persName> was persuaded they would prove un­
	      <lb/>availing; and from the moment he received the
	      <lb/>scrawl from the <name>Indian</name>, the bare possibility that
	      <lb/>it was written by the hand of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, with
	      <lb/>the dreadful idea, that she, whom he so fondly
	      <lb/>loved, was condemned in her youth and loveliness,
	      <lb/>to a lingering captivity or cruel death, had con­
	      <lb/>stantly employed his thoughts, and left him a prey
	      <lb/>to the most painful apprehensions. Even when
	      <lb/>the arguments of <persName>Van Haarman</persName>, and his own rea­
	      <lb/>son, for a time, persuaded him that his fears were
	      <lb/>groundless, the unfortunate situation of the cap­
	      <lb/>tives, whoever they might be, excited the deepest
	      <lb/>commiseration, and he felt that his duty, as a man
	      <lb/>and a soldier, compelled him to attempt their res­
	      <lb/>cue, however hazardous the undertaking. He fore­
	      <lb/>bore communicating his thoughts to <persName>Van Haarman</persName>,
	      <lb/>aware that he could not, without exceeding his
	      <lb/>commission, enter into his plans; and indeed the
	      <lb/>force of his whole crew, opposed to a tribe of power­
	      <lb/>ful and incensed <name>Indians</name>, would only draw upon
	      <lb/>them certain destruction:—whatever he did, must
	      <lb/>be by stratagem, and alone. He passed the day,
	      <lb/>almost in silence, pacing the deck and forming a
	      <lb/>thousand plans, none of which was satisfactory to
	      <lb/>his mind. Evening approached, and he was still

	      <lb/>undecided, when he observed <persName>Cushminaw</persName> standing
	      <lb/>apart from every one, his hands folded on his
	      <lb/>breast, and his eyes fixed thoughtfully on his na­
	      <lb/>tive shore. Struck by the melancholy expression
	      <lb/>on his countenance, <persName>Atherton</persName> approached him and
	      <lb/>said,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said><persName>Cushminaw</persName>, you are weary; pain and captivity
		<lb/>have brought low your strength, and dimmed the
		<lb/>lustre of your eyes.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>Pain!</said> exclaimed <persName>Cushminaw</persName>, scornfully tossing
	      <lb/>his wounded arm; <said>the warriors of our tribe dis­
		<lb/>dain it, and even our women endure affliction with­
		<lb/>out a murmur. Leave me, brother, to watch alone;
		<lb/>perhaps I shall never again behold the sun setting
		<lb/>in his glory, or the stars rejoicing in the heavens.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I will watch beside you,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>I
		<lb/>have many questions to ask you concerning your
		<lb/>father's captives, and I would learn why he refuses
		<lb/>to release them, and procure your life and liberty.</said></p>
	    <p><said>My father loves me,</said> returned the <name>Indian</name>; <said>but
		<lb/>he detests your nation, and would sacrifice much
		<lb/>to avenge the injuries he has received from it.
		<lb/>Dost thou see yonder light flashing across the
		<lb/>waves,</said> he added, pointing to the fort of <persName>Sassacus</persName>,
	      <lb/>which was brightly illumined by a fire within it.
	      <lb/><said>The chiefs of our nation are assembled there in
		<lb/>council, and this night will decide the fate of their
		<lb/>prisoners. <persName>Sassacus</persName> thirsts for their blood, and
		<lb/>there is no sachem but <persName>Mononotto</persName>, who dares op­
		<lb/>pose his will. They are his lawful prize, and he
		<lb/>is powerful enough to protect them; but I feel as­
		<pb n="175"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="16(2)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">175</mw>
		<lb/>sured he will give them up to the will of his
		<lb/>brethren.</said></p>
	    <p><said>And their fate,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, shuddering, <said>must
		<lb/>be inevitable death?</said></p>
	    <p><persName>Cushminaw</persName> bowed his head in token of assent,
	      <lb/>while with a glance of pity, not unmingled with con­
	      <lb/>tempt, he regarded the countenance of <persName>Atherton</persName>,
	      <lb/>which strongly expressed the feelings of horror
	      <lb/>and compassion which the idea excited.</p>
	    <p><said>Are you aware,</said> resumed <persName>Atherton</persName>, after a
	      <lb/>moment's pause, <said>that their death will be imme­
		<lb/>diately requitted on yourself and fellow-prisoners?
		<lb/><persName>Cushminaw</persName>, I would do much to save you; but my
		<lb/>wish will be powerless; the blood of the innocent
		<lb/>calls for vengeance, and the call must be answer­
		<lb/>ed.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I fear not death,</said> returned the Indian proudly;
	      <lb/><said>I have sported with it, from the day that I was
		<lb/>weaned from my mother's breast; and shall I, who
		<lb/>have so often rejoiced at the tortures of the prison­
		<lb/>er, shrink in the hour of trial! no, <persName>Cushminaw</persName>
		<lb/>fears not death; yet would he first avenge it on his
		<lb/>enemies, and fall as becomes a valliant warrior,
		<lb/>with the arrow bounding from his hand, and the
		<lb/>scalps of the vanquished at his feet!</said></p>
	    <p><said>Were it in your power,</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>would
		<lb/>you make no effort to prolong your days? has life
		<lb/>become bitter to you, already, that you would thus
		<lb/>part from it without regret!</said></p>
	    <p><said>Three and twenty suns have rolled over my
		<lb/>head,</said> returned the <name>Indian</name>, <said>and they have seen me
		<pb n="176"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="16(2)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">176</mw>
		<lb/>contented and happy; yet though I am cut off in
		<lb/>the greenness of youth, the deeds of my arm shall
		<lb/>be long remembered; the aged will mourn for me,
		<lb/>and the young water my grave with tears.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Have you forgotten the wife whom you love?</said><lb/>resumed <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>who watches in vain for your
		<lb/>return, and numbers with her tears the lingering
		<lb/>days of your absence?</said></p>
	    <p><persName>Cushminaw</persName> looked reproachfully at <persName>Atherton</persName>,
	      <lb/>and for a moment buried his face in his hands; he
	      <lb/>then said, in a softened voice,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said rend="post()">Young <name>Englishman</name>, speak not of her; I shall
		<lb/>never again embrace her, never listen to her voice,
		<lb/>nor return from the chase to seek her, in the green
		<lb/>bowers of our youthful love. Speak not of her, for
		<lb/>no womanish weakness shall bring reproach on the
		<lb/>name of <persName>Cushminaw</persName>.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said><persName>Cushminaw</persName>,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName> eagerly, <said>could you
		<lb/>purchase your life, by releasing your father's cap­
		<lb/>tives, would you consent to do it?</said></p>
	    <p><said>I would first know the terms,</said> replied the chief,
	      <lb/><said>sooner would I die ten thousand deaths, than betray
		<lb/>my father's kindred and people.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I ask nothing dishonourable of you,</said> said <persName>Ather­
		<lb/>ton</persName>; <said>my own safety only is involved, and that I
		<lb/>most readily adventure to save these unfortunate
		<lb/>maidens;—promise to aid me, <persName>Cushminaw</persName>, and
		<lb/>your freedom shall be the reward of my success.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I would it were in my power to save them,</said> re­
	      <lb/>plied the <name>Indian</name>; <said>they are too weak, and too in­
		<lb/>nocent to injure us; my heart is moved by their
		<pb n="177"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="16(3)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">177</mw>
		<lb/>distress, and my mother would bless me for their
		<lb/>deliverance; but I am in bonds, and were I freed,
		<lb/>how could my single arm avail to rescue them?</said></p>
	    <p><said>I ask nothing but your counsel,</said> returned <persName>Ather­
		<lb/>ton</persName>; <said>listen to me, <persName>Cushminaw</persName>; you have told me,
		<lb/>the maidens inhabit the wigwam of your mother,
		<lb/>retired from the fort and village; at this time the
		<lb/>warriors of your nation are assembled in council,
		<lb/>and the women only are left to guard them; direct
		<lb/>me to their abode, and I feel confident that I can
		<lb/>bring them in safety from their enemies.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Impossible!</said> exclaimed the <name>Indian</name>, surprised at
	      <lb/>the boldness of his design; <said>our warriors are keen­
		<lb/>eyed as the eagle, fierce as the bear robbed of her
		<lb/>whelps, and wily as the serpent of the grass; no­
		<lb/>thing can escape their vigilance, and even should
		<lb/>you find a path through the mazes of the forest,
		<lb/>destruction is at length inevitable.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I fear it not,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>I am swift of
		<lb/>foot, and well skilled in the use of weapons; but if
		<lb/>I die, it is in a good cause, and may heaven hear
		<lb/>the cry of the innocent, and save them and you
		<lb/>from an untimely fate! Young warrior, be sincere
		<lb/>with me, for deceit will be fatal to you.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I have never betrayed even the foe, who trust­
		<lb/>ed to me,</said> returned <persName>Cushminaw</persName>; <said>you have shewn
		<lb/>me much kindness, brother, and I would befriend
		<lb/>you rather than direct your steps to danger, and
		<lb/>perhaps to death.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Speak not of it,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, impatiently;
	      <lb/><said>my mind is resolved, and I will not give slumber

		<lb/>to my eyelids till I have attempted my purpose;
		<lb/>if you refuse to instruct me I will trust to my own
		<lb/>guidance wherever it may lead me. Consider
		<lb/><persName>Cushminaw</persName>, that your life may be cheaply purchas­
		<lb/>ed; but if the captives are sacrificed, all my efforts
		<lb/>will be unavailing to preserve it.</said></p>
	    <p><persName>Cushminaw</persName> remained silent and perplexed for
	      <lb/>several moments; but a natural love of life, and
	      <lb/>gratitude for the kindness which <persName>Atherton</persName> had
	      <lb/>shewn him, finally prevailed over his scruples, and
	      <lb/>he proceeded to give him clear and minute direc­
	      <lb/>tions what course to pursue; described the path
	      <lb/>through the forest, and his mother's wigwam, which
	      <lb/>was retired from every other. He bade him cau­
	      <lb/>tiously approach, and carefully examine it, and as­
	      <lb/>sured him that if it was guarded only by the squaws
	      <lb/>he might boldly enter, and bear away the captives.
	      <lb/>He then tore a string of wampum from his belt,
	      <lb/>and bade him give it to his wife should he find her
	      <lb/>in his mother's wigwam, and she would shew him
	      <lb/>kindness for his sake, and suffer him to depart in
	      <lb/>peace. <said rend="pre()">Brother,</said> he concluded, <said>the stars are
		<lb/>thick in the heavens; our fathers are yet gathered
		<lb/>around their council fires; be swift as the wild
		<lb/>deer, crafty as the beast of prey, and may success
		<lb/>and safety go with you.</said></p>
	    <p><persName>Atherton</persName> fixed his eyes keenly on the counte­
	      <lb/>nance of <persName>Cushminaw</persName> while he spoke, and convinced
	      <lb/>by its frank expression that he was sincere, he
	      <lb/>grasped his hand fervently, and replied,—</p>

		<lb/>and now, for a time farewell.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>You are too brave to deceive me,</said> replied the
	      <lb/><name>Indian</name>, <said>and I fear not to trust your words; go,
		<lb/>my brother, speed on your way, and may the trees
		<lb/>hide you in their shade from the red man of the

		<lb/>in peace to the trembling maidens.</said></p>
	    <p>Aware of the importance of using the utmost dis­
	      <lb/>patch, <persName>Major Atherton</persName> immediately sought out <persName>Van
		<lb/>Haarman</persName>, and imparted to him his plans, with the
	      <lb/>intelligence of <persName>Cushminaw</persName>. <persName>Van Haarman</persName> had
	      <lb/>scarcely patience to hear him through; astonished
	      <lb/>at his temerity, he was tempted to believe him un­
	      <lb/>der the influence of some strange delusion, or ac­
	      <lb/>tually deprived of his reason. He declared it im­
	      <lb/>possible to elude discovery, represented the extreme
	      <lb/>duplicity of the savage character, that their trea­
	      <lb/>chery was proverbial, and even if <persName>Cushminaw</persName>
	      <lb/>should by a miracle prove sincere; that the cap­
	      <lb/>tives were undoubtedly well guarded; that their
	      <lb/>flight would be impracticable, and that his life
	      <lb/>must unavoidably be sacrificed. <persName>Atherton</persName> listened
	      <lb/>to him without interruption; but he still believed
	      <lb/>his plan practicable, and assured <persName>Van Haarman</persName>,
	      <lb/>that he was resolved at every risk to attempt its
	      <lb/>execution. <persName>Van Haarman</persName> convinced he could not
	      <lb/>prevail with <persName>Atherton</persName> to alter his determination,
	      <lb/>proposed to accompany him with a few of his
	      <lb/>bravest men, and share the danger of his adven­
	      <lb/>ture; but <persName>Atherton</persName> would not hearken to the pro­
	      <pb n="180"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="16(4)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">180</mw>
	      <lb/>posal. He thought <persName>Van Haarman</persName> was not author­
	      <lb/>ized to hazard the lives of himself and men, in a
	      <lb/>private and romantic enterprize, while charged
	      <lb/>with an important commission from his country;
	      <lb/>and he was persuaded that numbers would only
	      <lb/>increase the danger of discovery, and that all they
	      <lb/>could command would be inadequate for defence.
	      <lb/><persName>Atherton</persName> requested nothing of <persName>Van Haarman</persName> but
	      <lb/>a promise to release <persName>Cushminaw</persName> as soon as he
	      <lb/>returned; and if the event proved fatal to him, he
	      <lb/>begged him to renew his efforts for the ransom of
	      <lb/>the captives. He also desired the use of a boat,
	      <lb/>and the assistance of one stout seaman. These
	      <lb/>were all readily granted by <persName>Van Haarman</persName>; but
	      <lb/>the men shrunk from <persName>Atherton's</persName> proposal, believing
	      <lb/>it would be rushing to certain death; and with
	      <lb/>much difficulty, he at length prevailed on one to

	      <lb/>assurance that he should not be obliged to accom­
	      <lb/>pany him to the wigwam.</p>
	    <p>In a few moments a boat was lowered to the wa­
	      <lb/>ter, and <persName>Atherton</persName> sprang into it followed with less
	      <lb/>agility by his <rs type="properAdjective">Dutch</rs> mercenary. The night was
	      <lb/>perfectly serene; not a breeze ruffled the waves,
	      <lb/>nor a cloud flitted across the heavens. The oars
	      <lb/>were muffled to prevent the slightest noise, not a
	      <lb/>word was spoken even in whisper; and as the boat
	      <lb/>glided swiftly along the current in silence and
	      <lb/>darkness, it resembled a visionary bark, piloted by
	      <lb/>the shadowy beings of another world. <persName>Atherton</persName>
	      <lb/>looked back upon the sloop;—the anxious counte­
	      <pb n="181"/>

	      <lb/>nance of <persName>Van Haarman</persName>, the tall figure of the <name>In­
		<lb/>dian</name> was no longer visible; the fire in the <placeName>fort of
	      <lb/><persName>Sassacus</persName></placeName> dwindled in his sight; and he seemed
	      <lb/>borne on the mighty stream from the haunts, even
	      <lb/>of savage man, and plunged into the midst of inter­
	      <lb/>minable forests. It was not long before they
	      <lb/>reached a small island near the shore, designated
	      <lb/>by the <name>Indian</name>; and just beyond it, they <choice><sic>run</sic><corr>ran</corr></choice> the
	      <lb/>boat into a natural cove, where he had directed
	      <lb/>them to land. A few bark canoes were drawn up
	      <lb/>on the bank; many of the trees were cleared away
	      <lb/>and the grass much trampled, which confirmed
	      <lb/><persName>Cushminaw's</persName> assertion, that it was a place of gene­
	      <lb/>ral resort for fishing. <persName>Atherton</persName> whispered his com­
	      <lb/>panion to be watchful, and remain quiet till he re­
	      <lb/>turned; and then bounded quickly upon the solita­
	      <lb/>ry shore. He could not be insensible to the dan­
	      <lb/>gers he was about to encounter; but his feelings
	      <lb/>were too much excited to admit of fear, and his
	      <lb/>disposition was too sanguine to doubt the proba­
	      <lb/>bility of success. It is impossible to ascertain how
	      <lb/>far the mere spirit of chivalry, or the dictates of
	      <lb/>humanity would have influenced him, in the same
	      <lb/>circumstances; but the apprehension that <persName>Miriam
		<lb/>Grey</persName> might be one of the captives, certainly stimu­
	      <lb/>lated his exertions, and contributed to lead him on,
	      <lb/>in contempt of difficulties and obstacles, to execute
	      <lb/>his perilous design.</p>
	    <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> soon discovered a narrow foot­
	      <lb/>path, and without hesitation, followed its windings,
	      <lb/>which led him back along the margin of the river,
	      <pb n="182"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="16(5)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">182</mw>
	      <lb/>as nearly as he could judge, for the distance of a
	      <lb/>quarter of a mile. It then suddenly turned, and
	      <lb/>ran through the skirts of a forest; and in a few
	      <lb/>moments the fires of the fort were again visible.
	      <lb/>He retired a few paces from the beaten track, to
	      <lb/>conceal himself under the shelter of the trees; and
	      <lb/>with a light and fearless step pressed forward, his
	      <lb/>hand grasping the hilt of his sword, his eyes intent
	      <lb/>on every object, and eagerly listening to catch the
	      <lb/>faintest sound. But he encountered no living be­
	      <lb/>ing, and the very breath of nature seemed suspend­
	      <lb/>ed, so intense was the stillness of the night. The
	      <lb/>soft murmuring of the river alone stole upon his
	      <lb/>ear, and even the sweet music of its waters was at
	      <lb/>length lost in the distance. <persName>Atherton</persName> began to feel
	      <lb/>impatient, and a faint suspicion that <persName>Cushminaw</persName>
	      <lb/>had deceived him, more than once crossed his mind;
	      <lb/>but he instantly rejected the idea, believing he
	      <lb/>would be restrained by selfish motives, if no other,
	      <lb/>from an act of treachery which must inevitably
	      <lb/>recoil on his own head. The path several times
	      <lb/>branched off towards the <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> fort; the country
	      <lb/>between was partially cleared and cultivated, af­
	      <lb/>fording little security to his person in case of dis­
	      <lb/>covery; and according to the <name>Indian</name>'s directions, he
	      <lb/>kept straight forward, and always screened by the
	      <lb/>intervening trees. He had proceeded about a mile,
	      <lb/>when the path diverged from the forest, and led
	      <lb/>into an open plain, which bore the marks of recent
	      <lb/>labour, and where <persName>Atherton</persName> several times encoun­
	      <lb/>tered the rude implements of agriculture used by
	      <pb n="183"/>

	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">183</mw>
	      <lb/>those savage tribes in the cultivation of their fields.
	      <lb/>The air was tainted with the odour of decaying
	      <lb/>fish, with which they prepared their ground for
	      <lb/>planting; and in haste to escape the fetid atmo­
	      <lb/>sphere, he accidentally overturned a basket of
	      <lb/>seed corn, which fell back into a capacious hole in
	      <lb/>the ground, lined with the bark of trees, from
	      <lb/>which it had been lately taken. The accident pro­
	      <lb/>bably saved <persName>Atherton</persName> from a similar fate, as he
	      <lb/>would not otherwise have noticed the chasm to
	      <lb/>which he was verging; but fearful the noise might
	      <lb/>attract attention from some wanderer of the night,
	      <lb/>he concealed himself a few moments within a group
	      <lb/>of trees. Nothing however was seen or heard,
	      <lb/>and he emerged from his retreat, and ascended a
	      <lb/>considerable eminence which lay before him. On
	      <lb/>reaching the summit and looking down on the
	      <lb/>other side he was surprised to perceive several
	      <lb/>wigwams just below him, the outskirts of the In­
	      <lb/>dian village, though scattered and apart from the
	      <lb/>principal settlement, which was only a short dis­
	      <lb/>tance from the fort.</p>
	    <p>Convinced that one of these wigwams must be
	      <lb/>the abode of <persName>Mononotto's</persName> wife and captives, <persName>Ather­
		<lb/>ton</persName> cautiously descended the hill, and gliding
	      <lb/>through a grove of fir trees, remained a moment
	      <lb/>under their branches, deliberating what course to
	      <lb/>pursue. The inhabitants had evidently gone to re­
	      <lb/>pose; not a light appeared through the apertures of
	      <lb/>the rustic tenements, and no sound was heard but
	      <lb/>the gurgle of a brook which watered the narrow val­
	      <pb n="184"/>

	      <lb/>ley, and glittered at intervals in the pensive star­
	      <lb/>light. <persName>Atherton</persName>, delighted to find every thing so
	      <lb/>favourable to his wishes, was in the act of sallying
	      <lb/>from his covert, when he perceived a light glancing
	      <lb/>among the trees, at some distance; and looking
	      <lb/>attentively, he found it proceeded from a wigwam
	      <lb/>which he had not yet noticed. It was indeed a
	      <lb/>sylvan dwelling, scarcely distinguished from the
	      <lb/>surrounding foliage; and <persName>Atherton</persName> at once identi­
	      <lb/>fied it with the description <persName>Cushminaw</persName> had given
	      <lb/>him of his mother's dwelling; with a beating
	      <lb/>heart he ventured to draw a little nearer, if possi­
	      <lb/>ble, to obtain a glimpse of the interior. It was
	      <lb/>formed of tall young trees, bent down so that their
	      <lb/>tops were fastened in the ground, forming a circu­
	      <lb/>lar arbour of considerable dimensions, with the
	      <lb/>branches closely interlaced, to exclude the sun and
	      <lb/>air. The trees were putting forth their leafy ho­
	      <lb/>nours, regardless of the distorted form in which
	      <lb/>they had been placed, merely for the purpose of a
	      <lb/>summer shelter; for those free and roving inhabi­
	      <lb/>tants of the forest, ignorant of the artificial wants
	      <lb/>of society, removed at will, and took up their
	      <lb/>humble abodes wherever necessity or caprice might
	      <lb/>lead them. The cooling draught of spring, the
	      <lb/>fruits and vegetables of the earth, and the game
	      <lb/>which their arrows and fishing hooks procured
	      <lb/>them, were sufficient for their simple wants; if
	      <lb/>pressed for food in one place, they wandered to
	      <lb/>another, without any local attachments to disturb
	      <lb/>their happiness, or any superfluous wealth to fill
	      <lb/>their minds with care and anxiety.</p>

	    <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> was still looking earnestly on
	      <lb/>the wigwam, when a mat which served for a door
	      <lb/>was drawn aside, and an <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> youth, armed
	      <lb/>with a bow and arrows, and much ornamented, as
	      <lb/>was the manner with those of a higher rank, came
	      <lb/>out, and approached the spot where he stood.
	      <lb/><persName>Atherton</persName> could not move without rustling the un­
	      <lb/>derwood and causing certain discovery; and to
	      <lb/>encounter the lad, would at once alarm the whole
	      <lb/>tribe. He had no alternative but to remain almost
	      <lb/>breathless behind the trunk of a large tree, where
	      <lb/>he was standing; and, almost beyond his hopes, he
	      <lb/>had the satisfaction of seeing the young <name>Indian</name>
	      <lb/>pass but a few paces from him, without a suspicion
	      <lb/>of his proximity. <persName>Atherton</persName> was watching his re­
	      <lb/>treat with feelings of gratitude for his own preser­
	      <lb/>vation, when he was suddenly startled by a strain
	      <lb/>of sweet music, which roused him from his position,
	      <lb/>and made him almost forget the necessity of still
	      <lb/>further caution. It was a female voice, and he
	      <lb/>was too distant to distinguish even the language;
	      <lb/>but it sounded familiar to his ear, and thrilled his
	      <lb/>heart with indefinable emotion. Presently is ceas­
	      <lb/>ed; he looked around, but no person was visible;
	      <lb/>and at that moment the door of the wigwam was
	      <lb/>again opened, and an <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> girl came to the en­
	      <lb/>trance, holding a torch of bark in her hand. The
	      <lb/>flame streamed bright and far, glancing on a copse
	      <lb/>of trees, from whence the voice had seemed to
	      <lb/>issue; and as <persName>Atherton</persName> gazed intently, he saw the
	      <lb/>branches slightly agitated, and a tall female <name>Indian</name>

	      <lb/>emerge from their recesses. She walked with a
	      <lb/>slow and dignified step towards the hut; and
	      <lb/>speaking with her young companion, they entered
	      <lb/>it together, and closed the aperture with a mat.
	      <lb/>A few straggling rays of light broke through the
	      <lb/>crevices, but all beside was darkness and silence.
	      <lb/>With feelings which he did not attempt to analyze,
	      <lb/><persName>Atherton</persName> left his retreat, and instinctively, rather
	      <lb/>than with any settled design, bent his way towards
	      <lb/>the grove. He had scarcely reached it, when the
	      <lb/>same entrancing melody again burst upon his ear,
	      <lb/>and a voice to which he had often listened with
	      <lb/>delight, distinctly sung the words which had been
	      <lb/>taught by the lips of love. <persName>Atherton</persName> stood trans­
	      <lb/>fixed, and with superstitious awe almost believed
	      <lb/>some spirit of the air was hovering near, and cheat­
	      <lb/>ing him with sounds which filled him with transport,
	      <lb/>even in the midst of peril. Half afraid of destroy­
	      <lb/>ing the sweet illusion, he remained motionless, and
	      <lb/>vainly striving to catch a glimpse of the invisible
	      <lb/>songstress. The first stanza had ceased, and with
	      <lb/>more tremulous tones she was commencing an­
	      <lb/>other, when <persName>Atherton</persName>, convinced it was no delu­
	      <lb/>sion, darted through the yielding branches, and,
	      <lb/>seated in a natural alcove of vines and inter­
	      <lb/>woven trees in the centre of the copse, he <choice><sic>heheld</sic><corr>beheld</corr></choice> a
	      <lb/>figure, which even in the imperfect star-light,
	      <lb/>could not be mistaken by a lover's eye. So sudden
	      <lb/>was his approach, that she scarcely had time to
	      <lb/>spring from her grassy couch, before she felt her­
	      <lb/>self pressed with emotion to his heart.</p>

	    <p><said>My own beloved <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>is it
		<lb/>here I find you, encircled by dangers, and devoted
		<lb/>to death?</said></p>
	    <p><persName>Miriam's</persName> head drooped faintly on his shoulder,
	      <lb/>and relieved by his voice from the terror and sur­
	      <lb/>prise which at first overpowered her, she attempted
	      <lb/>to speak; but her words were inarticulate, and she
	      <lb/>burst into a flood of tears. He felt her cling more
	      <lb/>closely to his arm, as if afraid he would escape
	      <lb/>from her, and deeply touched by her distress and
	      <lb/>confiding tenderness, he was unable for some mo­
	      <lb/>ments to offer a word of consolation or hope.</p>
	    <p><said>Dearest <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> he said, at length, <said>speak to
		<lb/>me again; let me once more hear your voice, that
		<lb/>I may be assured this is no illusion.</said></p>
	    <p><said><persName>Atherton</persName>,</said> returned <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>why are you here?
		<lb/>why am I so weak, so selfish as to detain you?
		<lb/>Fly,</said> she passionately added, <said>and preserve a life
		<lb/>dearer to me than my own existence!</said></p>
	    <p><said>I go,</said> he replied, <said>and you, dear <persName>Miriam</persName>, shall
		<lb/>be the companion of my flight; let us hasten; time
		<lb/>is precious, and a moment's delay may prove fatal.</said></p>
	    <p>He gently urged her forward as he spoke; but

	      <lb/>nest entreaty,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>Dearest <persName>Atherton</persName>, as you love me, hasten from
		<lb/>this dreadful spot; you cannot remain here undis­

		<lb/>flee with you, and leave the innocent partner of my

		<lb/>guided me to you, and do you refuse the life thus
		<lb/>mercifully reprieved? But I will not be selfish in
		<lb/>my anxiety for you; a boat waits to receive us, let
		<lb/>me place you in it in safety, and I will return for
		<lb/>your companion.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Life is but too sweet to me,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>and
		<lb/>for your sake, <persName>Atherton</persName>, as well as my own, I would
		<lb/>do much to prolong it; but it is impossible, on the
		<lb/>terms you offer; the night is already far spent, and
		<lb/>the council fires burn faintly: before you can re­
		<lb/>turn, my flight must be discovered, and I well know
		<lb/>my poor companion would be instantly sacrificed
		<lb/>to the sachem's fury,—and you, how could you es­
		<lb/>cape his vengeance? dear <persName>Atherton</persName>, can you wish
		<lb/>me to purchase a few brief years at a price which
		<lb/>must load them with insupportable misery?</said></p>
	    <p><said>Dear <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, earnestly, <said>this
		<lb/>is no time to indulge fastidious scruples; let me but
		<lb/>see you in a place of safety, and I will soon rejoin
		<lb/>you, with the object of your kind solicitude.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Never,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>can I yield to so wild,
		<lb/>so dangerous a proposal; leave me, I conjure you,
		<lb/>while it is yet in your power, and if you love me,
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>, seek not to withdraw my weak heart from
		<lb/>its duty.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Are you aware, <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>, with

		<lb/>ed all our offers, all our entreaties to ransom you,
		<lb/>and that they persist in devoting you to a long
		<lb/>captivity, if not to death?</said></p>
	    <p><said>I know all,</said> replied <persName>Miriam</persName>, with an involunta­
	      <lb/>ry shudder; <said>yet even in this hour of extremity, I
		<lb/>would not forfeit the approbation of Heaven, and of
		<lb/>my own conscience, for aught which the world can
		<lb/>offer me; no, <persName>Atherton</persName>, rather would I endeavour
		<lb/>to submit my fate with perfect confidence to Him,
		<lb/>who can even yet work out my deliverance, or give
		<lb/>me strength to suffer his will with christian forti­
		<lb/>tude and resignation.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Tell me, at least, dear <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>,
	      <lb/>with extreme agitation, <said>where is your fellow-pri­
		<lb/>soner? I will seek her out,—will bring her to you,
		<lb/>—and in the darkness of night, we may yet escape
		<lb/>in safety.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Think not of it,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, with clasped
	      <lb/>hands, and a voice of entreaty; <said>she is in the wig­
		<lb/>wam of <persName>Mononotto</persName>, the women watch over her, and
		<lb/>your appearance would instantly raise a note of
		<lb/>alarm, and surround you with enemies. Dearest
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>, by all the kindness you have shewn me,
		<lb/>by all the love you profess for me, I beseech you to
		<lb/>depart and leave me!</said></p>
	    <p><said>Never, my beloved <persName>Miriam</persName>!</said> exclaimed <persName>Ather­

	      <lb/>lips, and before she was aware of his intention,
	      <lb/>rushed precipitately from the grove.</p>
	    <p>With flying footsteps <persName>Atherton</persName> approached the
	      <lb/>wigwam which had recently attracted his curiosi­
	      <lb/>ty, rightly judging it to be the abode of <persName>Mononotto</persName>.
	      <lb/>The mat was removed from the entrance, display­
	      <lb/>ing the interior of the dwelling lighted by several
	      <lb/>torches; and the first object which he saw, was a
	      <lb/>young <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> woman, whom he instantly recogniz­
	      <lb/>ed as the same who had conveyed to him the scrawl
	      <lb/>of <persName>Miriam</persName>, and who, he felt assured was the wife
	      <lb/>of <persName>Cushminaw</persName>. She was sitting on the ground,
	      <lb/>singing in a low voice, and plaiting a basket of
	      <lb/>reeds; beside her stood an <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> girl of about
	      <lb/>ten years old, looking at her fingers as she twisted
	      <lb/>the slender twigs; and two or three children re­
	      <lb/>clining on mats which were spread around the
	      <lb/>room, apparently too frolicsome to sleep, were rais­
	      <lb/>ing their laughing dark faces, and chattering in
	      <lb/>their uncouth language. <persName>Atherton</persName> thought the mo­
	      <lb/>ment propitious, and without hesitation sprang into
	      <lb/>the midst of the group. The squaw darted from
	      <lb/>the ground, and uttering a cry of alarm, was on
	      <lb/>the point of rushing through the aperture, when
	      <lb/><persName>Atherton</persName> grasped her arm, exclaiming,—</p>
	    <p><said>Fly not from me; it is <persName>Cushminaw</persName>, who has
		<lb/>sent me to thee, and here is the token of his re­
		<lb/>membrance.</said>—And he took the wampum from his
	      <lb/>bosom, and presented her as he spoke.</p>
	    <p><said>It is my husband's, he lives!</said> said the woman,
	      <lb/>almost with a scream of joy; and she pressed it
	      <pb n="191"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="17(4)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">191</mw>
	      <lb/>to her lips, with the utmost tenderness, though
	      <lb/>trembling with terror and surprise.</p>
	    <p><said>He does;</said> replied <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>suffer me to bear
		<lb/>away this child, and by the dawn of another day,
		<lb/>he shall be with you in safety.</said></p>
	    <p>The squaw drew the amazed girl towards her,
	      <lb/>and seemed hesitating between fear and inclination,
	      <lb/>when a mat at the other end of the apartment was
	      <lb/>drawn aside, and the tall <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> woman entered
	      <lb/>whom <persName>Atherton</persName> had before seen; probably attract­
	      <lb/>ed by the cries of her children, who had not ceased
	      <lb/>to scream since his alarming appearance. <persName>Ather­
		<lb/>ton</persName> felt that nothing but instant speed would avail
	      <lb/>him, and raising the captive girl in his arms, he
	      <lb/>bore her rapidly onward, to the grove where he had
	      <lb/>parted from <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>.</p>
	    <p><persName>Miriam</persName> had remained almost stupified by his
	      <lb/>sudden departure, and so brief was his absence,
	      <lb/>that she had scarcely rallied her spirits, and fol­
	      <lb/>lowed him to the entrance of the wood, when she
	      <lb/>met him returning with his welcome burthen.</p>
	    <p><said>Lean on me, dear <persName>Miriam</persName>;</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>,
	      <lb/>drawing her arm through his; <said>let us move with
		<lb/>speed and caution, and I trust we shall yet be in
		<lb/>safety, before they can overtake us.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Where are we going?</said> asked the child, hardly
	      <lb/>recovered from her astonishment.</p>
	    <p><said>Home,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, softly, <said>if it is the will of
		<lb/>Heaven; but be silent, <persName>Rachel</persName>, or they will hear
		<lb/>our voices and pursue us.</said></p>
	    <p>For a few moments they kept on their way, si­
	      <pb n="192"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="17(4)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">192</mw>
	      <lb/>lently and swiftly, when <persName>Miriam</persName> suddenly grasped
	      <lb/>the hand of <persName>Atherton</persName>, convulsively, and murmured
	      <lb/>in a suppressed voice,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>Hark,<choice><sic>’</sic><corr/></choice> I hear their footsteps approaching; oh
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>, they are surely near us!</said>
	    </p>
	    <p>She had scarcely finished speaking, when the
	      <lb/>dreadful yell of the <name>Indians</name>, reverberated through
	      <lb/>the forest; <persName>Atherton</persName> threw his arm around <persName>Miriam</persName>
	      <lb/>to protect and assist her, and they pressed forward
	      <lb/>with a speed and strength, which despair only
	      <lb/>could give them. <persName>Atherton</persName> alternately carried the
	      <lb/>child, and led her by the hand, always careful to
	      <lb/>keep the beaten path in view, and so great was the
	      <lb/>fatigue of each one of them, that at times, it seem­
	      <lb/>ed impossible to proceed. When the voices of their
	      <lb/>pursuers sounded more distant, they would stop for
	      <lb/>a instant's repose, and then proceed with renewed
	      <lb/>strength; till at length, with inexpressible delight,
	      <lb/>and almost contrary to their hopes, they heard the
	      <lb/>murmuring of the river, and in a moment its wa­
	      <lb/>ters burst upon their sight! With a transport of
	      <lb/>gratitude, <persName>Atherton</persName> beheld the little cove and the
	      <lb/>boat waiting his return; when, suddenly the shouts
	      <lb/>of the savages were redoubled, and they rushed fu­
	      <lb/>riously from the covert of the forest. At sight of
	      <lb/>the dreadful <name>Indians</name>, the cowardly <name>Dutchman</name>, in­
	      <lb/>sensible to every thing but his personal safety,
	      <lb/>pushed rapidly from the shore, and in an instant,
	      <lb/>gained the middle of the stream. <persName>Atherton's</persName> feet
	      <lb/>already pressed the strand; but in vain he called
	      <lb/>to the boatman, in a voice of agony; he was utter­
	      <pb n="193"/>

	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">193</mw>
	      <lb/>ly disregarded; and in the impulse of the moment,
	      <lb/>he was about to plunge into the waves with his un­
	      <lb/>fortunate companions, whom he still firmly grasp­
	      <lb/>ed, and endeavour to reach the boat, or perish in
	      <lb/>the attempt. But they were immediately sur­
	      <lb/>rounded by the <name>Indians</name> and overpowered by num­
	      <lb/>bers, <persName>Atherton</persName> was obliged to submit to their will,
	      <lb/>though he long resisted their attempts to separate
	      <lb/>him from <persName>Miriam</persName>. She was rudely torn from his
	      <lb/>arms, and with <persName>Rachel</persName>, hurried from his sight.
	      <lb/>With a yell of savage triumph, they led him, ex­
	      <lb/>hausted, to the <placeName>fort of <persName>Sassacus</persName></placeName>.</p>
	    <p>But it is necessary to leave him, for a time, and
	      <lb/>revert to the period of <persName>Miriam Grey's</persName> departure
	      <lb/>from <placeName>Boston</placeName>; which will form the subject of the

	      <lb/>when she found herself again launched on the
	      <lb/>mighty deep, and through her last flowing tears,
	      <lb/>beheld <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, lingering on the receding
	      <lb/>shore, and watching her, as she well knew, with a
	      <lb/>heart full of sorrow and anxiety. The bright vi­
	      <lb/>sions of her youthful fancy were fading away, the
	      <lb/>hitherto gay and peaceful stream of her existence
	      <lb/>was suddenly darkened by storms, and its future
	      <lb/>course appeared cheerless and dreary as the wil­
	      <lb/>derness they were approaching. But in the midst
	      <lb/>of these early trials, <persName>Miriam</persName> felt the consciousness
	      <lb/>of performing her duty an unfailing support and
	      <lb/>consolation; and fearful of paining her cousin by
	      <lb/>the least appearance of unhappiness, she success­
	      <lb/>fully exerted her cheerfulness and resolution, and
	      <lb/>soon again, became the animated companion, the
	      <lb/>affectionate and devoted friend. <persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName> per­
	      <lb/>fectly understood her feelings, and fully appreciat­
	      <lb/>ed the sacrifice she had made; and, with judicious
	      <lb/>tenderness, she sought out objects to amuse, and

	      <lb/>pursuits to interest her. <said>She has left country and
		<lb/>home, to share my humble fortunes,</said> was her fre­
	      <lb/>quent reflection; and, with the confidence of a
	      <lb/>heart which had loved without disappointment, she
	      <lb/>believed that the generous sacrifice of <persName>Miriam</persName>
	      <lb/>would be rewarded, and that a temporary absence
	      <lb/>would wean her from an object whom she could
	      <lb/>not love without involving herself in still deeper
	      <lb/>misery.</p>
	    <p>Their voyage was prosperous and short, and
	      <lb/>notwithstanding the advanced season, they suffered
	      <lb/>little either from cold or sickness. The military
	      <lb/>settlement of <placeName>Saybrook</placeName>, at the mouth of <placeName>Connecti­
		<lb/>cut river</placeName>, was the first inhabited spot they ap­
	      <lb/>proached; the vessel put in there to give and re­
	      <lb/>ceive information; and with considerable alarm,
	      <lb/>they discovered the critical state of the garrison,
	      <lb/>which was then hard pressed by the enemy, who had
	      <lb/>destroyed the out-buildings, and every thing with­
	      <lb/>out the impalement, or beyond the guns of the fort.
	      <lb/><persName>Mr. Weldon</persName> re-embarked, with all expedition, for
	      <lb/>the remainder of their voyage; and it was not until
	      <lb/>they ascended the noble stream, that <persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName>
	      <lb/>and <persName>Miriam</persName> could realize how extremely savage
	      <lb/>and uncultivated was the country, which would
	      <lb/>soon become their abode. The imagination of each
	      <lb/>had formed a picture of its own, and <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName>
	      <lb/>sometimes smiled at their remarks, which shewed
	      <lb/>how widely they differed from reality. On
	      <lb/>each side of them were lofty and impenetrable fo­

	      <lb/>hunter had felled a few trees to kindle his watch-
	      <lb/>fires, or form his slight canoe, and occasionally, a
	      <lb/>deserted wigwam appeared hanging on some aerial
	      <lb/>height, or half hid by the leafless trees of the val­
	      <lb/>ley,—all remained in the magnificent wildness and
	      <lb/>solitude of nature. On those rich and variegated
	      <lb/>shores, where cities now present their glittering
	      <lb/>spires, and villages peep forth amidst their sunny
	      <lb/>glades and cultivated hills, the footsteps of man had
	      <lb/>seldom wakened the slumbering echoes of the fo­
	      <lb/>rest; and the dashing of the waters, the moaning
	      <lb/>of the winds, and the screams of the feathered
	      <lb/>tribes which fled, on startled wing at sight of
	      <lb/>the solitary bark, alone reverberated through their
	      <lb/>deep recesses. Herds of wild deer and other ani­
	      <lb/>mals which were browzing on the wintry stubble,
	      <lb/>or drinking the transparent waves, stopped to gaze
	      <lb/>at them, a moment, as they passed, and then bound­
	      <lb/>ed swiftly back, to the thick covert of their native
	      <lb/>woods.</p>
	    <p>After proceeding up the river about fifty miles,
	      <lb/>they arrived in safety at <placeName>Hartford</placeName>, the place of
	      <lb/>their destination. The late season had been one of
	      <lb/>peculiar trials to the colonists of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, and
	      <lb/>the unusual scarcity which had prevailed, reduced
	      <lb/>many to want and dependence. They also sus­
	      <lb/>tained great losses in their cattle and other pos­
	      <lb/>sessions, were deficient in the necessary implements
	      <lb/>of agriculture, and amidst the perplexing cares,
	      <lb/>and multiplicity of business attendant on their set­
	      <lb/>tlement, winter had surprised them, unprepared to
	      <pb n="197"/>

	      <lb/>contend with its severity. Many of the first plan­
	      <lb/>ters, particularly of <placeName>Hartford</placeName>, were persons of for­
	      <lb/>tune and consideration in their native country, and
	      <lb/>therefore less able to endure the hardships which
	      <lb/>succeeded their painful and hazardous journey
	      <lb/>through the wilderness, than others who had been
	      <lb/>less delicately nurtured, and unaccustomed to the
	      <lb/>refinements of life. Under such depressing circum­
	      <lb/>stances, their very existence seemed uncertain, and
	      <lb/>could only have been preserved by the most reso­
	      <lb/>lute and persevering exertions.</p>
	    <p><persName>Mr. Weldon</persName> was more prosperous than most of
	      <lb/>those around him; and though he shared many of
	      <lb/>their misfortunes, <persName>Lois</persName> who remembered the com­
	      <lb/>plicated calamities of the <placeName>Plymouth</placeName> settlers on
	      <lb/>their first arrival, often thought her present priva­
	      <lb/>tions in comparison, light and trivial. <persName>Miriam</persName>
	      <lb/>never for an instant regretted accompanying <persName>Mrs.
		<lb/>Weldon</persName>; and though she had still many anxious
	      <lb/>thoughts and fond regrets, they were carefully con­
	      <lb/>fined to her own breast, and she looked forward
	      <lb/>with hope to the approaching spring, when her
	      <lb/>father would return to claim her. Satisfied that
	      <lb/>her cousin was happy, she anticipated with delight,
	      <lb/>a return to the scenes of her earliest pleasures;
	      <lb/>and almost unconsciously, many romantic visions
	      <lb/>mingled with her future prospects.</p>
	    <p>The winter passed away unmarked by any im­
	      <lb/>portant events; an alarm was occasionally excited
	      <lb/>by the <name>Indians</name>, but they confined their depredations
	      <lb/>principally to the vicinity of <placeName>Saybrook</placeName>, and it was

	      <lb/>hoped the return of Spring would produce a cessa­
	      <lb/>tion of hostilities, and leave the inhabitants at
	      <lb/>liberty to engage in the peaceful pursuits of agri­
	      <lb/>culture, which their exhausted resources rendered
	      <lb/>indispensable. But these expectations were disap­
	      <lb/>pointed, and the increasing aggressions of the <name>Pe­
		<lb/>quod Indians</name> rendered it necessary to adopt vigor­
	      <lb/>ous measures to check their insolence, which threat­
	      <lb/>ened to bring ruin upon the colonies.</p>
	    <p>In this situation of affairs, <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName> received
	      <lb/>orders to join the detachment under <persName>Captain Mason</persName>,
	      <lb/>which was sent forward to reinforce the garrison
	      <lb/>at <placeName>Saybrook</placeName>. <persName>Mr. Weldon</persName> was anxious only for
	      <lb/>the safety of his wife and <persName>Miriam</persName>, whom his ab­
	      <lb/>sence left destitute of a protector, at a time when
	      <lb/>their settlements were particularly exposed to the
	      <lb/>incursions of a powerful enemy. He therefore pre­
	      <lb/>vailed on them to remove to the house of a relative
	      <lb/>in the village of <placeName>Weathersfield</placeName>, a few miles distant,
	      <lb/>where he believed they would be more secure than
	      <lb/>in his own dwelling. Soon after his departure,
	      <lb/><persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName> was attacked by severe indisposition,
	      <lb/>which was greatly aggravated by continual solici­
	      <lb/>tude for her husband's safety, and confined her long
	      <lb/>to her own apartment. <persName>Miriam</persName> watched beside
	      <lb/>her with unwearied assiduity; but as <persName>Lois</persName> became
	      <lb/>convalescent, she sometimes stole from her sick
	      <lb/>chamber, to enjoy that exercise in the open air,
	      <lb/>which was necessary to the preservation of her own
	      <lb/>health. One morning she had extended her walk
	      <lb/>to a considerable distance with <persName>Rachel</persName> the daugh­
	      <pb n="199"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="18(2)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">199</mw>
	      <lb/>ter of her host; and in returning through a large
	      <lb/>field, where many of the inhabitants were at labour,
	      <lb/>they were surprised by the fearful yell of the <name>In­
		<lb/>dians</name>. In an instant a multitude started from the
	      <lb/>shelter of trees, where they had lain in ambush,
	      <lb/>and surrounded the unfortunate people, who were
	      <lb/>unable to offer any effectual resistance to their over­
	      <lb/>whelming numbers. <persName>Miriam</persName> on the first alarm,
	      <lb/>grasped the hand of <persName>Rachel</persName>, and with flying foot­
	      <lb/>steps, endeavoured to reach a place of safety; but
	      <lb/>they were arrested by the barbarians, who with
	      <lb/>menacing gestures commanded them to remain still.
	      <lb/>Overcome by terror, <persName>Miriam</persName> fell lifeless on the
	      <lb/>ground; and a long insensibility spared her the
	      <lb/>misery of witnessing the dreadful scene which en­
	      <lb/>sued. The savages cruelly murdered several men,
	      <lb/>and three defenceless women, who were planting in
	      <lb/>the field, killed their cattle and horses, and pillaged
	      <lb/>and destroyed every thing which came in their way.</p>
	    <p>When <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> recovered her recollection,
	      <lb/>she found herself lying in a canoe, filled with the
	      <lb/><name>Pequods</name>, armed and frightfully painted,—and <persName>Ra­
		<lb/>chel</persName> leaning over her, weeping bitterly, believing
	      <lb/>she would never revive. <persName>Miriam</persName> gently pressed
	      <lb/>her hand, but feeling her strength quite exhausted,
	      <lb/>closed her eyes, almost hoping she should not sur­
	      <lb/>vive to endure a cruel captivity, and perhaps lin­
	      <lb/>gering death. But the sobs of the affectionate girl
	      <lb/>who hung round her neck, fearing she had indeed
	      <lb/>ceased to breathe, again aroused her, and by a
	      <lb/>painful effort, she exerted herself to sit upright,
	      <pb n="200"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="18(2)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">200</mw>
	      <lb/>and speak a few words of comfort to her. The
	      <lb/><name>Indians</name> shewed some pity for their distress; they
	      <lb/>gave them water to drink from a large clam shell,
	      <lb/>and refrained from binding them, satisfied they
	      <lb/>were perfectly secure. <persName>Miriam</persName> was sometimes in­
	      <lb/>clined to draw encouragement from these favours;
	      <lb/>but when she looked round upon their fierce and
	      <lb/>savage countenances, and heard their discordant
	      <lb/>voices, her heart was chilled with apprehension,
	      <lb/>and she felt convinced that a signal interference of
	      <lb/>Providence alone, could save them from the most
	      <lb/>dreadful fate. She learned from <persName>Rachel</persName> that they
	      <lb/>had been preserved from immediate death, by the
	      <lb/>intervention of a chief, whom they called <persName>Mono­
		<lb/>notto</persName>; but whatever had induced him to shew so
	      <lb/>much forbearance, the sternness of his countenance
	      <lb/>forbade her to expect much from his compassion.</p>
	    <p>The <name>Indians</name> who were engaged in this dreadful
	      <lb/>expedition amounted to about a hundred; they
	      <lb/>filled three bark canoes, and glided down the river
	      <lb/>with astonishing rapidity, lightly dancing over the
	      <lb/>waves which were scarcely parted by the slender
	      <lb/>keels. Before dark <persName>Miriam</persName> found they were ap­
	      <lb/>proaching the mouth of the river, and she soon per­
	      <lb/>ceived the walls of fort <placeName>Saybrook</placeName>, and distinguish­
	      <lb/>ed the motions of the guard, and their arms glit­
	      <lb/>tering in the sun-beams. She determined if possi­
	      <lb/>ble to make some signal to the <name>English</name>, and her
	      <lb/>heart bounded with the hope that they would effect
	      <lb/>their rescue. But <persName>Mononotto</persName> and his savage war­
	      <lb/>riors completely surrounded their captives, to hide
	      <pb n="201"/>

	      <lb/>them from observation, and so entirely excluded
	      <lb/>every object from their view that they could not
	      <lb/>ascertain even when they passed the fort. The
	      <lb/><name>Indians</name> after a short consultation, which was suc­
	      <lb/>ceeded by a dead silence, bore off rapidly to the
	      <lb/>opposite shore. The garrison at <placeName>Saybrook</placeName> closely
	      <lb/>observed their motions, and concluding they were
	      <lb/>bent on some work of mischief, <persName>Captain Mason</persName>
	      <lb/>ordered a heavy discharge of artillery. Though
	      <lb/>at a great distance they aimed with such precision
	      <lb/>at the canoe where <persName>Mononotto</persName> stood erect before
	      <lb/>his prisoners, distinguished by his gaudy plumes
	      <lb/>and haughty mien, that the ball struck off the
	      <lb/>beak head; and for an instant it seemed on the
	      <lb/>verge of sinking. <persName>Miriam</persName> had scarcely recovered
	      <lb/>from the shock, before the <name>Indians</name>, by redoubling
	      <lb/>the strokes of their paddles arrived at the opposite
	      <lb/>shore, and hastening from their canoes they drew
	      <lb/>the frail vessels over a narrow beach, and launch­
	      <lb/>ed them on the waters of the sound. The guns of
	      <lb/>the fort could no longer reach them, and with one
	      <lb/>consent they uttered a shout of defiance which
	      <lb/>reached the ears of the garrison, who, with regret
	      <lb/>and mortification, discovered the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> maidens
	      <lb/>when it was too late to attempt their deliverance.</p>
	    <p>The <name>Indians</name> rowed incessantly till nearly mid­
	      <lb/>night, probably apprehensive of pursuit, and with­
	      <lb/>out any refreshment, except a little parched corn,
	      <lb/>which they carried in a leather pouch. They
	      <lb/>occasionally mixed some of it powdered, with wa­
	      <lb/>ter, for drink, and always offered a portion to

	      <lb/>their captives, but they felt no inclination to taste
	      <lb/>it. Poor <persName>Rachel</persName> at length fell asleep on <persName>Miriam's</persName>
	      <lb/>lap, who almost envied the repose which a keen
	      <lb/>sense of misery prevented her enjoying, and which
	      <lb/>continued undisturbed till they entered the <placeName>Pequod
		<lb/>harbour</placeName>. The inhabitants of the <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> village
	      <lb/>were soon roused from their slumbers, and in the
	      <lb/>clear moonlight, <persName>Miriam</persName> perceived a multitude of
	      <lb/>every age and sex approaching the shore, eager to
	      <lb/>welcome the returning warriors. She shrunk trem­
	      <lb/>bling from the gaze of savage curiosity, and gently
	      <lb/>awoke her sleeping companion, who had till then
	      <lb/>remained insensible to what was passing around
	      <lb/>her. The child startled from a sweet slumber, and
	      <lb/>at first unable to comprehend her situation, began
	      <lb/>to weep from alarm, which seemed extremely di­
	      <lb/>verting to the <name>Indians</name>, who laughed at her distress,
	      <lb/>and attempted to mimic her voice and gestures.
	      <lb/><persName>Miriam</persName> was endeavouring to console her, when
	      <lb/><persName>Cushminaw</persName> the adopted son of <persName>Mononotto</persName>, stepped
	      <lb/>forward from the crowd with an air of authority
	      <lb/>and displeasure which checked their savage mirth;
	      <lb/>and approaching the captives, said to them,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>Be comforted, young maidens; follow me to my
		<lb/>mother's wigwam.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><persName>Miriam</persName> started almost with a cry of joy, on
	      <lb/>hearing her native language in such a place; and
	      <lb/>reading a compassionate interest in the counte­
	      <lb/>nance of the young <name>Indian</name>, unhesitatingly prepar­
	      <lb/>ed to follow him. <persName>Mononotto</persName>, who had been ab­
	      <lb/>sent from the spot, at that moment re-appeared,
	      <pb n="203"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="18(4)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">203</mw>
	      <lb/>and addressed a few words to <persName>Cushminaw</persName>; he lis­
	      <lb/>tened to him with profound respect, and then turn­
	      <lb/>ing again to <persName>Miriam</persName> and <persName>Rachel</persName>, silently motioned
	      <lb/>them to proceed with him. The wigwam of <persName>Mo­
		<lb/>nonotto</persName> had been recently erected, and stood re­
	      <lb/>mote from the village; as they approached it, <persName>Mi­
		<lb/>riam</persName> observed through the open entrance a female
	      <lb/>busied over a large fire in some culinary prepara­
	      <lb/>tion. She started with surprise as her unexpected
	      <lb/>guests entered the apartment, and stood a moment
	      <lb/>surveying them attentively, and with an air of
	      <lb/>gentleness and pity, rather than of curiosity.</p>
	    <p><persName>Miriam</persName> on her part regarded the <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> female
	      <lb/>with involuntary admiration. She had scarcely
	      <lb/>passed the season of youth, and her mature and
	      <lb/>noble figure, at once dignified and graceful, pos­
	      <lb/>sessed that vigour and elasticity so peculiar to the
	      <lb/>natives of the forest; while her regular features,
	      <lb/>her soft and intelligent countenance, expressed a
	      <lb/>mind susceptible of elevated sentiments, and a
	      <lb/>heart warmed by the gentlest affections of her sex.</p>
	    <p><persName>Cushminaw</persName> cautiously drew a mat over the
	      <lb/>aperture through which they entered, and advanc­
	      <lb/>ing close to his adopted mother with very earnest
	      <lb/>gesticulation, entered into conversation with her.
	      <lb/>When they had finished speaking, the wife of <persName>Mo­
		<lb/>nonotto</persName> approached the captives, and taking a hand
	      <lb/>of each in her own, she said,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>Do not fear, white daughters, <persName>Mioma</persName> will care
		<lb/>for you; she will speak to <persName>Mononotto</persName> that no harm
		<lb/>come nigh you.</said>
	    </p>
	    <pb n="204"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="18(4)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">204</mw>
	    <p><persName>Miriam</persName>, encouraged by the voice of kindness,
	      <lb/>clasped her hand energetically, and replied in a
	      <lb/>tone of entreaty,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>If you have pity for us, entreat that we may be
		<lb/>sent back to our home and friends.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>We will speak for you,</said> said <persName>Cushminaw</persName>; <said>it
		<lb/>may be my father will listen to our voice.</said></p>
	    <p>Grateful for this unexpected favour, <persName>Miriam</persName> at­
	      <lb/>tempted to reply, but her spirits were weakened by
	      <lb/>fatigue and misery, and for the first time during
	      <lb/>that anxious day of captivity, her tears flowed
	      <lb/>abundantly, and prevented her utterance. <persName>Mioma</persName>
	      <lb/>seemed grieved by her distress; she spread a soft
	      <lb/>new mat, gently urged her to sit down, and when
	      <lb/>she began to smile through her tears, expressed her
	      <lb/>delight by patting her cheeks, and stroking the
	      <lb/>hair from her forehead; and appeared greatly to
	      <lb/>admire her beauty.</p>
	    <p><persName>Cushminaw</persName> soon after left the wigwam, and
	      <lb/><persName>Mioma</persName> perceiving her captives were faint for want
	      <lb/>of nourishment, hastened to set before them a por­
	      <lb/>tion of the mess she had been preparing. It con­
	      <lb/>sisted of corn, coarsely broken and boiled with
	      <lb/>fish, dressed without salt, of which the <name>Indians</name>
	      <lb/>were entirely ignorant. This unsavory repast was
	      <lb/>served up in an earthern pitkin, with no instru­
	      <lb/>ments for eating but the hands, and was altogether
	      <lb/>so repugnant to their appetites, that they could
	      <lb/>with difficulty swallow a few kernels of corn to
	      <lb/>satisfy the calls of nature. <persName>Mioma</persName> in the mean
	      <lb/>time busied herself in arranging an apartment for
	      <pb n="205"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="18(5)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">205</mw>
	      <lb/>her guests; for though a wigwam seldom contain­
	      <lb/>ed more than one room for the accommodation of a
	      <lb/>whole family, she knew it was not agreeable to the
	      <lb/>customs of the white people, and a native delicacy
	      <lb/>taught her to consult the feelings of those who
	      <lb/>were cast on her hospitality. Her simple arrange­
	      <lb/>ments were soon completed; and exhausted by the
	      <lb/>events of the day, <persName>Miriam</persName> and <persName>Rachel</persName> threw them­
	      <lb/>selves on the thick mats which were spread on the
	      <lb/>ground, and covered with the skins of wild animals
	      <lb/>soon fell into a profound repose.</p>
	    <p>It was late when they awoke on the following
	      <lb/>morning; and as <persName>Miriam</persName> looked round the singu­
	      <lb/>lar apartment, and with painful sensations, re­
	      <lb/>called the circumstances, which had brought her
	      <lb/>there; a mat was slowly drawn aside, and the
	      <lb/>merry face of an <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> child thrust through the
	      <lb/>aperture. As soon as it caught <persName>Miriam's</persName> eye, it
	      <lb/>hastily retreated, but presently reappeared with
	      <lb/>another, and they continued their sportive gam­
	      <lb/>bols, till called away by the voice of their mo­
	      <lb/>ther. <persName>Miriam</persName> trembled at the idea of encounter­
	      <lb/>ing the haughty <persName>Mononotto</persName>; but after listening at­
	      <lb/>tentively, and hearing only the children and <persName>Mio­
		<lb/>ma</persName>, singing to her <term>pappoose</term>, she ventured to leave
	      <lb/>her room, and join them. <persName>Rachel</persName>, refreshed by
	      <lb/>sleep, almost forgot her late alarms; and too
	      <lb/>young to realize the perils of her situation, with
	      <lb/>the simplicity of her happy age, she believed her­
	      <lb/>self perfectly secure, while in the presence of <persName>Mi­
		<lb/>riam</persName>. <persName>Mioma</persName> received them kindly, and set be­
	      <pb n="206"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="18(5)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">206</mw>
	      <lb/>fore them a repast similar to that of the preced­
	      <lb/>ing evening, with the addition of a cake of pound­
	      <lb/>ed corn, dried by the fire, which they found rather
	      <lb/>more palatable. She spoke <name>English</name> imperfectly,
	      <lb/>but endeavoured to encourage them with the hopes
	      <lb/>of release, and to assure them they were in no
	      <lb/>immediate danger.</p>
	    <p>Several days passed away, without any import­
	      <lb/>ant occurrence; <persName>Mononotto</persName> spent most of his time
	      <lb/>in hunting and fishing; and when in the wigwam,
	      <lb/>never intruded upon his prisoners, if they were in­
	      <lb/>clined to remain in their own apartment. He was
	      <lb/>satisfied that they were safe, under the charge of
	      <lb/><persName>Mioma</persName>, who would not suffer them to escape, and
	      <lb/>seemed willing to allow them every indulgence in
	      <lb/>his power. The miseries of captivity were mi­
	      <lb/>tigated by this lenient treatment; but to <persName>Miriam</persName>,
	      <lb/>time wore tediously away, and days were weari­
	      <lb/>some as ages. Fears for her personal safety were
	      <lb/>absorbed in anxiety for her friends; the grief of
	      <lb/>her father, of <persName>Lois</persName>, of <persName>Atherton</persName>, were continually
	      <lb/>present to her imagination, preyed upon her spi­
	      <lb/>rits, and at times reduced her to the verge of sick­
	      <lb/>ness. <persName>Mioma</persName>, was unwearied in her attentions,
	      <lb/>and endeavoured by every means, to render her
	      <lb/>situation comfortable; and in gratitude for her
	      <lb/>kindness, <persName>Miriam</persName> often assumed an air of cheerful­
	      <lb/>ness, which was foreign to her feelings.</p>
	    <p>About a week after the captivity of <persName>Miriam</persName> and
	      <lb/>her companion, a <rs type="properAdjective">Dutch</rs> vessel was seen coasting
	      <lb/>off the <placeName>Pequod harbour</placeName>. The <name>Indians</name> could not
	      <pb n="207"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="18(6)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">207</mw>
	      <lb/>omit the opportunity of shewing their hatred to the
	      <lb/>white people, and sent out several canoes to attack
	      <lb/>them; the affray ended in the capture of <persName>Cushmi­
		<lb/>naw</persName>, and many other brave young warriors of his
	      <lb/>tribe, beside several killed and severely wounded.
	      <lb/>Nothing could exceed the rage of the savages, on
	      <lb/>this occasion; and with one voice, they called upon
	      <lb/><persName>Mononotto</persName> to sacrifice the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> maidens to their
	      <lb/>revenge. <persName>Mioma</persName> had become exceedingly at­
	      <lb/>tached to them, and even the stern disposition of
	      <lb/>her husband was softened into pity, for their youth
	      <lb/>and misfortunes. She was also unwilling to con­
	      <lb/>demn them, from an apprehension, that the <name>Dutch</name>
	      <lb/>would retaliate on their prisoners, and particular­
	      <lb/>ly on <persName>Cushminaw</persName>, whom he loved with the ten­
	      <lb/>derness of a father. While perplexed in what man­
	      <lb/>ner to decide, or how to evade the requisition, a
	      <lb/>council of the nation was called, at which <persName>Mono­
		<lb/>notto</persName> was summoned to appear. He well knew the
	      <lb/>imperious <persName>Sassacus</persName> would demand the blood of his
	      <lb/>captives, and was determined to exact his submis­
	      <lb/>sion; for without his consent, he dared not exe­
	      <lb/>cute his cruel design, as <persName>Mononotto</persName> rightly claim­
	      <lb/>ed them for his lawful prize, and of course, held
	      <lb/>their lives at his own disposal.</p>
	    <p>On that eventful night, <persName>Miriam</persName>, ignorant of
	      <lb/>what was passing in the <placeName>fort of <persName>Sassacus</persName></placeName>, remark­
	      <lb/>ed that the countenance of <persName>Mioma</persName>, was unusually
	      <lb/>sad;—she seemed agitated, often looked out at the
	      <lb/>door, and started at the slightest noise. <persName>Rachel</persName>
	      <lb/>had retired early to bed; and <persName>Miriam</persName>, left alone with
	      <pb n="208"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="18(6)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">208</mw>
	      <lb/><persName>Mioma</persName>, endeavoured to draw from her the cause
	      <lb/>of her inquietude; but she evaded her questions,
	      <lb/>and attributed her uneasiness to solicitude for the
	      <lb/>fate of <persName>Cushminaw</persName>. Late in the evening, <persName>Mono­
		<lb/>notto</persName> returned to the wigwam; he entered with
	      <lb/>hurried steps, and his features still wore the trace
	      <lb/>of stormy passions, which had recently agitated
	      <lb/>them. He started on seeing <persName>Miriam</persName>, then rapidly
	      <lb/>crossed the apartment, and stood for a moment,
	      <lb/>regarding her with mingled sorrow and compas­
	      <lb/>sion. <persName>Miriam</persName> always trembled at his presence;
	      <lb/>but she now interpreted his singular emotion as a
	      <lb/>death warrant; and would have entreated <persName>Mioma</persName>
	      <lb/>to speak with him; but could not articulate a word.
	      <lb/><persName>Mioma</persName> sprang from the mat, on which she was
	      <lb/>reclining, and seizing the Sachem's arm, addressed
	      <lb/>him in her own language, with the most impas­
	      <lb/>sioned energy. His answer was slow and em­
	      <lb/>phatic. <persName>Mioma</persName> threw herself at his feet; she
	      <lb/>clasped his knees, tore the hair from her head,
	      <lb/>and, by the most violent expressions of grief, seem­
	      <lb/>ed endeavouring to shake his resolution. The
	      <lb/>countenance of <persName>Mononotto</persName> remained inflexible, and
	      <lb/>he pushed her, almost with violence from him.
	      <lb/><persName>Mioma</persName> rose from the ground, with an air of com­
	      <lb/>manding dignity; she pressed her hands on her
	      <lb/>bosom, and fixing her moistened eyes sorrowfully
	      <lb/>on her husband's face, spoke to him long, with a
	      <lb/>voice of the most persuasive tenderness. The fea­
	      <lb/>tures of <persName>Mononotto</persName> gradually relaxed; <persName>Mioma</persName>
	      <lb/>saw and pursued her advantage. Suddenly her
	      <pb n="209"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="19(1)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">209</mw>
	      <lb/>gestures became more animated, her utterance more
	      <lb/>rapid and vehement; she pointed frequently to
	      <lb/><persName>Miriam</persName>, and to her children, and at length, with
	      <lb/>the mute eloquence of nature, threw herself weep­
	      <lb/>ing into her husband's arms. The Sachem gently
	      <lb/>disengaged himself, and standing proudly erect,
	      <lb/>laid his hand solemnly on his heart, and replied
	      <lb/>in a few brief, but energetic words. <persName>Mioma</persName> ut­
	      <lb/>tered a joyful cry, and springing to <persName>Miriam</persName>, fold­
	      <lb/>ed her in her arms, exclaiming,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>You are safe, my daughter, <persName>Mononotto</persName> has pro­
		<lb/>mised that no harm shall come to you!</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><persName>Miriam</persName> embraced her preserver, again and
	      <lb/>again, with tears of heart-felt gratitude, and emo­
	      <lb/>tions too profound for utterance. She turned to
	      <lb/><persName>Mononotto</persName>,—every thing but his recent kindness
	      <lb/>was forgotten,—and, kneeling at his feet, she
	      <lb/>bathed his hands with her tears. The stern coun­
	      <lb/>tenance of the warrior was for an instant, soft­
	      <lb/>ened by tenderness; he raised her mildly from the
	      <lb/>ground, and led her back to the arms of <persName>Mioma</persName>;
	      <lb/>but ashamed of a weakness which is considered
	      <lb/>contemptible by his nation, he hastily turned
	      <lb/>away and silently retired from the wigwam.</p>
	    <p><persName>Mononotto</persName>, from that hour, faithfully kept his
	      <lb/>promise, and resolutely protected his captives from
	      <lb/>the malice of his countrymen. He was too power­
	      <lb/>ful and fearless to dread the wrath, even of the in­
	      <lb/>flexible <persName>Sassacus</persName>; and, on his part, the savage
	      <lb/>monarch dared not irritate his haughty Sachem,
	      <lb/>particularly at a moment, when he might be

	      <lb/>tempted to revolt to the neighbouring <name>Indians</name>, who
	      <lb/>had entered into alliance with the <name>English</name>.</p>
	    <p>Soon after these events, <persName>Mononotto</persName> went on a
	      <lb/>hostile expedition to the <name>Mohegan</name> country; and
	      <lb/>the disconsolate wife of <persName><choice><sic>Cashminaw</sic><corr>Cushminaw</corr></choice></persName> removed to his
	      <lb/>mother's wigwam. <persName>Mioma's</persName> attachment to her
	      <lb/>prisoners daily strengthened, and in return, they
	      <lb/>regarded her with the most grateful affection. She
	      <lb/>placed no restraint on their inclinations, believing
	      <lb/>escape impossible; and, indeed a dread of meeting
	      <lb/>the savages confined them entirely to the immediate
	      <lb/>vicinity of their dwelling. <persName>Mioma</persName> also assured
	      <lb/>them, it was the intention of <persName>Mononotto</persName> to send
	      <lb/>them back to their friends, so soon as an oppor­
	      <lb/>tunity occurred of procuring <persName>Cushminaw</persName> in ex­

	      <lb/>more cheerful and contented than she had conceiv­
	      <lb/>ed it possible to be at the commencement of her
	      <lb/>captivity; and, to employ her many leisure mo­
	      <lb/>ments, she acquired the art of weaving small bas­
	      <lb/>kets, and embroidering moccasins with porcupines'
	      <lb/>quills. The young Squaw of <persName>Cushminaw</persName> was her
	      <lb/>almost constant companion; and her affectionate
	      <lb/>disposition, the simplicity and gentleness of her
	      <lb/>untutored mind, interested <persName>Miriam</persName> extremely.
	      <lb/>She had acquired a little <name>English</name> from her hus­
	      <lb/>band, and could speak it more intelligibly than
	      <lb/><persName>Mioma</persName>, who was, besides, much engrossed by her
	      <lb/>household cares, and the labour of planting. The
	      <lb/>indolent savages kept their women constantly en­
	      <lb/>gaged in the fields, during the season of tillage;

	      <lb/>for they considered such occupations beneath their
	      <lb/>own attention, and often derided the English for
	      <lb/>spoiling, by indulgence, <mcr>creatures</mcr> who were formed
	      <lb/>for work, and capable of rendering themselves so
	      <lb/>useful.</p>
	    <p>Nearly three weeks passed away, without inter­
	      <lb/>ruption, when the <rs type="properAdjective">Dutch</rs> vessel arrived in the do­
	      <lb/>minions of <persName>Sassacus</persName>, and the captives were soon
	      <lb/>informed that a treaty was opened for their re­
	      <lb/>demption. With feelings agitated by suspense and
	      <lb/>hope, <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> listened to every rumour re­
	      <lb/>specting the negociation; and it was to gratify her
	      <lb/>with particular information, that the wife of <persName>Cush­
		<lb/>minaw</persName> mingled with the women who surrounded
	      <lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>, on the day he was received as an hos­
	      <lb/>tage. She was, however, so closely watched by
	      <lb/>the <name>Indians</name>, who knew her attachment to the <rs type="properAdjective">En­
		<lb/>glish</rs> maidens, and suspected she intended to con­
	      <lb/>vey intelligence of them, that she found it impossi­
	      <lb/>ble to enter into conversation with him. But she
	      <lb/>had taken vigilant observation; and <persName>Miriam</persName>, with
	      <lb/>a bounding heart, fancied she identified the person
	      <lb/>of <persName>Major Atherton</persName> in her imperfect description;
	      <lb/>for she was well assured he would shun no dangers
	      <lb/>to effect her rescue, if a knowledge of her situation
	      <lb/>had by any means reached him. Her suspicions
	      <lb/>were confirmed by the pen-knife he gave the Squaw,
	      <lb/>on which the initials of his name were engraved,
	      <lb/>and she felt confident of having frequently seen it
	      <lb/>in his possession at <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>. However gratify­
	      <lb/>ing this renewed proof of his affection, every other
	      <pb n="212"/>

	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">212</mw>
	      <lb/>feeling yielded to alarm for his safety; and desti­
	      <lb/>tute of proper materials, she wrote on a strip of
	      <lb/>bark, with the point of the pen-knife, the hasty
	      <lb/>lines which the young <name>Indian</name> conveyed to him.
	      <lb/>She little suspected that he was still acting upon
	      <lb/>uncertainty, and that a vague apprehension that
	      <lb/>dangers lurked around her, had alone led him to
	      <lb/>those savage shores.</p>
	    <p>The remainder of that day and the following,
	      <lb/><persName>Miriam</persName> passed in a state of continual agitation.
	      <lb/>She could not expect to see <persName>Atherton</persName>, nor did she
	      <lb/>wish it, under such circumstances; but still, in
	      <lb/>despite of reason, her cheek was flushed by every
	      <lb/>approaching footstep, and she felt involuntary sad­
	      <lb/>ness and disappointment, when she looked round,
	      <lb/>and <emph>he</emph> did not appear. The thought, that he was
	      <lb/>so near her and she could not obtain one moment's
	      <lb/>interview, was a trial of no ordinary severity. She
	      <lb/>heard, without surprise, that <persName>Sassacus</persName> had rejected
	      <lb/>the offers of the <name>Dutch</name>, and insisted on the sacri­
	      <lb/>fice of <persName>Mononotto's</persName> captives. He deceived <persName>Van
		<lb/>Haarman</persName> by asserting that the Sachem had return­
	      <lb/>ed, and yielded to his wishes; he was still absent,
	      <lb/>though momently expected, and <persName>Miriam</persName> believed
	      <lb/>the savages would not dare proceed to extremities,
	      <lb/>without his sanction. The evening of the second
	      <lb/>day arrived; <persName>Mononotto</persName> had not come back, and
	      <lb/>she heard, with trembling, that a council of war­
	      <lb/>riors was again convened in the <placeName>fort of <persName>Sassacus</persName></placeName>.
	      <lb/><persName>Mioma</persName> assumed a cheerful air, and endeavoured to
	      <lb/>encourage her; but the effort was ineffectual, and
	      <pb n="213"/>

	      <lb/><persName>Miriam</persName> read in her countenance a confirmation of
	      <lb/>her worst fears. The wife of <persName>Mononotto</persName> evidently
	      <lb/>feared the result of that night's deliberation; and
	      <lb/><persName>Miriam</persName> felt as if the last hope of life was gliding
	      <lb/>from her, at the very moment of anticipated free­
	      <lb/>dom. Unwilling to damp the happiness of <persName>Rachel</persName>,
	      <lb/>by imparting her fears, and too much depressed to
	      <lb/>witness a joy, which might so soon be turned into
	      <lb/>mourning; she withdrew from the wigwam, to
	      <lb/>commune with her own thoughts in the favourite
	      <lb/>haunt of a solitary grove; where she was soon
	      <lb/>after surprised by the unexpected appearance of

	      <lb/><persName>Major Atherton</persName>, at the moment they were so un­
	      <lb/>fortunately discovered in attempting to escape,
	      <lb/>with the energy of despair she endeavoured to free
	      <lb/>herself from the <name>Indian</name>'s grasp, and, in a voice of
	      <lb/>agony, called repeatedly and loudly upon his name.
	      <lb/>But her efforts were powerless, and her cries were
	      <lb/>drowned by the shouts of the savages, who hurried
	      <lb/><persName>Atherton</persName> onward towards the fort, which was visi­
	      <lb/>ble by the decaying watch-fires. <persName>Miriam</persName> felt that
	      <lb/>her cup of misery was full; but even in that fearful
	      <lb/>moment, every personal danger was disregarded,
	      <lb/>and the dreadful conviction that her lover must fall
	      <lb/>a sacrifice to his generous, but rash exertions to
	      <lb/>save her, alone possessed her imagination, and filled
	      <lb/>her with anguish and alarm. With the meekness
	      <lb/>of an habitually pious and submissive spirit, she
	      <lb/>lifted up her heart in prayer to Heaven, for its in­
	      <lb/>terposing mercy on his behalf, and for grace to

	      <lb/>support her own misfortunes with fortitude and
	      <lb/>resignation. Exhausted by excessive fatigue and
	      <lb/>excitement, she soon sunk into a state almost of in­
	      <lb/>sensibility, from which she was not aroused, even
	      <lb/>by the loud lamentations of the affrighted <persName>Rachel</persName>,
	      <lb/>who was borne along in the arms of a savage war­
	      <lb/>rior.</p>
	    <p>In this situation, <persName>Miriam</persName> was placed on a litter,
	      <lb/>hastily formed of the branches of trees; and the
	      <lb/>small band which was left to guard her, proceeded
	      <lb/>with quick but noiseless footsteps, along the bor­
	      <lb/>ders of the forest. Suddenly the silence was inter­
	      <lb/>rupted by the loud barking of a dog; and <persName>Miriam</persName>
	      <lb/>was started from her lethargy, by the animal's
	      <lb/>springing upon her, whining and licking her
	      <lb/>hands with every mark of affectionate recognition.
	      <lb/>She instantly remembered the dumb favourite, and
	      <lb/>constant attendant of <persName>Mononotto</persName>, which had often
	      <lb/>received her caresses in the wigwam of his master;
	      <lb/>and raising herself to return his salutation, she per­
	      <lb/>ceived the lofty figure of the Sachem, approach­
	      <lb/>ing with his train of followers, and in a moment,
	      <lb/>his well remembered voice sounded in her ears like
	      <lb/>the sweet music of returning hope. The <name>Indians</name>
	      <lb/>stopped immediately on seeing him; and <persName>Miriam</persName>,
	      <lb/>as soon as she found him near her, sprang from the
	      <lb/>litter, and throwing herself before him, in an atti­
	      <lb/>tude of supplication, exclaimed,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>Save him, I entreat you,—fly—they have led
		<lb/>him away to death.</said>

	    <pb n="216"/>

	    <p><persName>Mononotto</persName> started at the unexpected vision;—he
	      <lb/>but imperfectly comprehended her meaning, and
	      <lb/>believing she was entreating for her own safety, he
	      <lb/>raised her from the ground, and endeavoured to
	      <lb/>pronounce a few words of comfort. The image of
	      <lb/><persName>Atherton</persName> was alone present to the mind of <persName>Mi­
		<lb/>riam</persName>, and clasping her hands, with energy she
	      <lb/>continued:—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>I fear nothing for myself; rescue <emph>him</emph> who has
		<lb/>sought out danger and death for my sake, and I
		<lb/>will not shrink from any sufferings you can inflict
		<lb/>on me.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p>In the agitation of her feelings, she forgot that
	      <lb/>the Sachem was ignorant of her language; he re­
	      <lb/>garded her in silence and with perplexity; then
	      <lb/>gently placed her in the litter, and turning to his
	      <lb/>people, addressed to them a long harangue, en­
	      <lb/>forced by many emphatic gestures, and often inter­
	      <lb/>rupted by their replies. When he had finished,
	      <lb/>they all proceeded towards his wigwam, and in a
	      <lb/>few moments stopped before the humble portal.
	      <lb/><persName>Mioma</persName> attracted by the noise, hastened to draw
	      <lb/>aside the mat which covered the entrance, and with
	      <lb/>mingled joy and apprehension, perceived her hus­
	      <lb/>band supporting the two <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> maidens. She
	      <lb/>had heard that their flight was intercepted, and ig­
	      <lb/>norant of <persName>Mononotto's</persName> return, feared her incensed
	      <lb/>countrymen would at once sacrifice them to their
	      <lb/>fury.</p>
	    <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> was unfortunately seen, in his

	      <lb/>who chanced to be roving in the forest, and who
	      <lb/>carefully concealing himself from them, hastened
	      <lb/>to alarm the assembled warriors. <persName>Mononotto</persName> re­
	      <lb/>turned from his incursion on the <name>Mohegans</name>, soon
	      <lb/>after the fort was deserted, in the general pursuit
	      <lb/>after the fugitive. He heard a few contradictory
	      <lb/>reports from those whom he chanced to meet, but
	      <lb/>was ignorant of the real truth, and of <persName>Atherton's</persName>
	      <lb/>capture, till he encountered <persName>Miriam</persName> and her guard
	      <lb/>in the forest. With haughty displeasure he learn­
	      <lb/>ed that <persName>Sassacus</persName> and his warriors had presumed to
	      <lb/>pass judgment on his prisoners, and to refuse the
	      <lb/>offers of the <name>Dutch</name> to ransom them. Resolute in
	      <lb/>his determination to exchange them for <persName>Cushminaw</persName>
	      <lb/>and his fellow prisoners, he again left <persName>Miriam</persName> and
	      <lb/><persName>Rachel</persName> in the charge of <persName>Mioma</persName>—whom he severely
	      <lb/>reprimanded for her heedlessness in permitting
	      <lb/>them to escape—and returned to the <placeName>fort of <persName>Sassa­
		<lb/>cus</persName></placeName> to demand his right, and the acquiescence of
	      <lb/>the people.</p>
	    <p><persName>Mioma</persName> remarked with concern, the pale cheek
	      <lb/>and extreme dejection of <persName>Miriam</persName>, and naturally at­
	      <lb/>tributing it to her late fatigue and disappointment,
	      <lb/>with the solicitude of a fond mother, she hastened
	      <lb/>to spread the softest skins, and invite her to re­
	      <lb/>pose and refreshment. <persName>Miriam</persName> gladly withdrew,
	      <lb/>even from the eye of anxious affection, and with a
	      <lb/>sigh of heart-felt misery returned to the apartment
	      <lb/>she had so long occupied, and which till now, had
	      <lb/>been often cheered by visions of hope and future
	      <lb/>happiness. In a few minutes <persName>Rachel</persName> was sunk in
	      <pb n="218"/>

	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">218</mw>
	      <lb/>profound repose; and as <persName>Miriam</persName> stooped down to
	      <lb/>kiss away the tears which still trembled on her
	      <lb/>eyelids, she almost envied the innocent thoughtless­
	      <lb/>ness of her unreflecting childhood. In vain she
	      <lb/>courted the sweet influence of sleep. <persName>Atherton</persName> per­
	      <lb/>petually haunted her imagination—he seemed to re­
	      <lb/>proach her as the author of his misfortunes, and
	      <lb/>dreadful images of torture and death floated before
	      <lb/>her eyes with the appalling vividness of reality.
	      <lb/>It was not until the morning sun had pierced the
	      <lb/>leafy covert of the sylvan dwelling, that a disturb­
	      <lb/>ed and feverish slumber stole over her senses, from
	      <lb/>which she was soon awakened by the soft voice of
	      <lb/><persName>Mioma</persName>, who bent over her with a countenance
	      <lb/>brightened by joy, though a starting tear proclaim­
	      <lb/>ed that her pleasure was not without alloy.</p>
	    <p><said>Arise my daughters,</said> she said, <said>our light canoes
		<lb/>are launched on the blue stream, and <persName>Mononotto</persName>
		<lb/>waits to conduct thee to thy kindred.</said></p>
	    <p><persName>Miriam</persName> sprang from her lowly couch, and pres­
	      <lb/>sing her hands on her forehead, endeavoured to
	      <lb/>connect the scattered and confused recollection of
	      <lb/>recent events, while the restless wandering of her
	      <lb/>eyes, and the unnatural brilliancy of her complex­
	      <lb/>ion, betrayed her anxiety and mental suffering.
	      <lb/><persName>Mioma</persName> took the hands of the captive maidens kind­
	      <lb/>ly within her own, and resumed in an unsteady
	      <lb/>voice,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>Go my children, return to the abodes of the
		<lb/>white man, but forget not poor <persName>Mioma</persName>, who
		<lb/>loved you, and cherished you in her bosom.</said>

	    <p><said>Forget you, my friend, my preserver!</said> exclaim­
	      <lb/>ed <persName>Miriam</persName>, with impassioned energy, and twining
	      <lb/>her arms around <persName>Mioma's</persName> neck,—<said>oh never shall I
		<lb/>cease to remember you with grateful affection, and
		<lb/>to supplicate Heaven for a blessing on you and
		<lb/>yours.</said></p>
	    <p>The voice of <persName>Mononotto</persName> was at that moment
	      <lb/>heard approaching them; and <persName>Mioma</persName> disengaging
	      <lb/>herself from the embrace of <persName>Miriam</persName>, with the grave
	      <lb/>dignity which usually characterised her, retired to
	      <lb/>receive his commands. <persName>Miriam</persName> followed her with
	      <lb/>hasty steps, and grasping the arm of <persName>Mononotto</persName>,
	      <lb/>she looked earnestly in his face, and entreated
	      <lb/><persName>Mioma</persName> to express to him, her gratitude for his
	      <lb/>kindness, and to learn the situation of <persName>Atherton</persName>,
	      <lb/>and what destiny awaited him. The Sachem brief­
	      <lb/>ly answered; and <persName>Mioma</persName> taking the words from
	      <lb/>his lips, drew the agitated girl towards her, and
	      <lb/>said,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>He is safe, my daughter; ask me no more,
		<lb/>but prepare to go, while the breeze is up, and ready
		<lb/>to waft thee over the sparkling waves.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p>The disturbed expression on <persName>Mioma's</persName> countenance
	      <lb/>contradicted her assertion, and redoubled the anxi­
	      <lb/>ous fears of <persName>Miriam</persName>.</p>
	    <p><said><emph>Safe</emph><hi rend="slant(italic)">!</hi></said> she repeated with a wild laugh, <said><emph>safe</emph><hi rend="slant(italic)">!</hi>
		<lb/>and a prisoner in the midst of his enemies! oh, if

		<lb/>suffer me to die in his stead,—me, for whose sake

		<lb/>go to him,</said> she added in a calmer tone, <said>at least we
		<lb/>will die together!</said></p>

	    <p>She was rushing from the wigwam, when <persName>Mono­
		<lb/>notto</persName> arrested her steps, and firmly detained her,
	      <lb/>while he addressed <persName>Mioma</persName> with extreme earnest­
	      <lb/>ness. <persName>Mioma</persName> again interpreted his language.</p>
	    <p><said>Young maiden,</said> she said, <said>what would'st thou
		<lb/>do? Listen to the words of <persName>Mononotto</persName>. I have
		<lb/>snatched you from the flames, I have sheltered you
		<lb/>under my roof, and nourished you with my own
		<lb/>food. Thou knowest that I have a son, whom I
		<lb/>adopted in the hour of strife, and he is dear to me
		<lb/>as my own flesh; wilt thou leave him to perish by
		<lb/>the hands of his enemies, to avenge thy blood which
		<lb/>I have refrained from shedding?</said></p>
	    <p><said>No, never, never will I repay your benefits with
		<lb/>such ingratitude,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>for your sake I
		<lb/>will endure life, though every future moment should
		<lb/>be embittered by sorrow.</said></p>
	    <p>She instantly prepared to obey the wishes of <persName>Mo­
		<lb/>nonotto</persName>, and clinging to the last and uncertain hope,
	      <lb/>that the <name>Dutch</name> might still be enabled to offer some
	      <lb/>acceptable ransom for the life of <persName>Atherton</persName>, she be­
	      <lb/>came restlessly impatient for the moment of her de­
	      <lb/>parture. The sachem had all things in readiness;
	      <lb/>and with tears and embraces, the wife of <persName>Cushmi­
		<lb/>naw</persName> parted from the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> maidens, whom she
	      <lb/>regarded as the deliverers of her husband. But
	      <lb/><persName>Mioma</persName> remarked with pity the languor and debili­
	      <lb/>ty of <persName>Miriam</persName>,—the surprising change which a few
	      <lb/>hours of severe mental suffering had produced in her
	      <lb/>countenance; and with an affectionate solicitude
	      <lb/>which could not be denied, she insisted on accom­

	      <lb/>panying her to the <rs type="properAdjective">Dutch</rs> vessel. In a few moments
	      <lb/>they reached the bank of the river; a bark canoe was
	      <lb/>loosed from its moorings, and <persName>Mononotto</persName> with two
	      <lb/>of three sturdy <name>Indians</name>, paddled them swiftly from
	      <lb/>the shore. Sick at heart, <persName>Miriam</persName> turned her eyes
	      <lb/>to the spot where she had been separated from <persName>Ath­
		<lb/>erton</persName>, at the dreadful moment of discovery; and
	      <lb/>casting one wistful look towards the distant fort,
	      <lb/>she leaned her head on <persName>Mioma's</persName> shoulder, and co­
	      <lb/>vered her face to exclude every object from her
	      <lb/>view—for every object was associated with the most
	      <lb/>painful recollections.</p>
	    <p><persName>Van Haarman</persName> was waiting on the deck of his
	      <lb/>sloop to receive the liberated captives, and with an
	      <lb/>air of cordial good will, he congratulated them on
	      <lb/>their restoration to freedom. Observing they were
	      <lb/>embarassed by his gaze of curiosity, he conducted
	      <lb/>them to a small cabin he had prepared for them,
	      <lb/>whither they were attended by <persName>Mioma</persName>; and <persName>Van
		<lb/>Haarman</persName> returned to the deck, and according to
	      <lb/>his stipulation, restored <persName>Cushminaw</persName> and five of the
	      <lb/><name>Pequods</name> to the sachem <persName>Mononotto</persName>.</p>
	    <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> in the mean time was rigorous­
	      <lb/>ly guarded by the savages, who, with inhuman bar­
	      <lb/>barity triumphed over his misery, mocking him
	      <lb/>with taunts and menaces, and imitating the groans
	      <lb/>which they had sometimes extorted from their <rs type="properAdjective">En­
		<lb/>glish</rs> prisoners. They had closely pinioned his
	      <lb/>arms, and bound him to a stake in the midst of the
	      <lb/>fort, in a position which admitted neither of rest
	      <lb/>nor change. In this painful situation he was con­

	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">222</mw>
	      <lb/>demned to pass the night surrounded by his vindic­
	      <lb/>tive enemies, whose disfigured countenances glared
	      <lb/>upon him like demons, illumined as they were by
	      <lb/>the fitful fires which they kept burning, to prevent
	      <lb/>the possibility of surprise or escape. <persName>Atherton</persName> did
	      <lb/>not for an instant cherish any chimerical hopes of
	      <lb/>life. From the moment that he found himself in
	      <lb/>the power of the <name>Indians</name>, he considered death ine­
	      <lb/>vitable, and determined to meet it with the courage
	      <lb/>of a <name>christian</name> and a soldier. Yet in the midst of
	      <lb/>sufferings which had surprised him in the glow of
	      <lb/>hope and expected happiness, and in the prospect of
	      <lb/>tortures from which nature recoiled, the uncertain­
	      <lb/>ty of <persName>Miriam's</persName> fate, and the reflection that her death
	      <lb/>might be accelerated by his rashness, gave him far
	      <lb/>keener anguish than the most refined cruelties of
	      <lb/>his tormentors were able to inflict.</p>
	    <p>The night, which seemed almost endless to him,
	      <lb/>at length passed away, and late in the morning the
	      <lb/>sachem <persName>Mononotto</persName> entered the fort. The counte­
	      <lb/>nance of the warrior was stern, and he regarded
	      <lb/>the prisoner with gloomy satisfaction. More ac­
	      <lb/>cessible to pity than most of his ferocious tribe, he
	      <lb/>was moved by the innocence and tears of his young
	      <lb/>captives; and affection for his adopted son induced
	      <lb/>him to persist in procuring their release. But nei­
	      <lb/>ther the liberal offers of <persName>Van Haarman</persName>, nor his ear­
	      <lb/>nest entreaties joined with those of <persName>Cushminaw</persName>,
	      <lb/>could prevail on him or any of the savage warriors,
	      <lb/>to accept a ransom for <persName>Major Atherton</persName>. His ap­
	      <lb/>parent rank and youthful vigour rendered him a
	      <pb n="223"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="20(2)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">223</mw>
	      <lb/>victim of uncommon value, and the moment of sa­
	      <lb/>crifice was anticipated with inhuman triumph.</p>
	    <p>As <persName>Atherton</persName> sustained the haughty gaze of <persName>Mo­
		<lb/>nonotto</persName> with dignified composure, <persName>Cushminaw</persName> en­
	      <lb/>tered with a train of <name>Indians</name>, who had gathered
	      <lb/>round him to express their joy at his release. He
	      <lb/>was not permitted to address the prisoner, but stood
	      <lb/>at a little distance, looking at him with an earnest
	      <lb/>and sorrowful expression. <persName>Atherton's</persName> features
	      <lb/>brightened with momentary joy at his appearance,
	      <lb/>and the young <name>Indian</name>, comprehending his feelings,
	      <lb/>a moment after passed near him, and said in a low
	      <lb/>voice, <said>they are safe,</said> and immediately left the fort.
	      <lb/><persName>Atherton</persName> felt relieved of an insupportable load by
	      <lb/>this assurance; for he was at no loss to conjecture
	      <lb/>to whom <persName>Cushminaw</persName> alluded; and indeed his free­
	      <lb/>dom alone was a sufficient proof that <persName>Miriam</persName> and
	      <lb/>her companion were in safety. He had soon after
	      <lb/>another instance of his grateful interest; for in con­
	      <lb/>sequence of his intercession with <persName>Mononotto</persName>, the
	      <lb/>cords which bound him were loosened, and he was
	      <lb/>offered some water to allay his feverish thirst.
	      <lb/>Thankful for these favours, which were seldom
	      <lb/>granted to their prisoners, and exhausted by weari­
	      <lb/>ness and pain, he scarcely felt the relief of his new
	      <lb/>position, before he sunk into a quiet slumber, too
	      <lb/>profound to be disturbed even by the dreadful pre­
	      <lb/>parations which were sounding around him.</p>
	    <p>The <name>Indians</name> perceived the <rs type="properAdjective">Dutch</rs> vessel still ly­
	      <lb/>ing at anchor in the river, and with malignant sa­
	      <lb/>tisfaction they determined to sacrifice their captive
	      <pb n="224"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="20(2)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">224</mw>
	      <lb/>within the view of his white brethren. About sun­
	      <lb/>set, the shouts of the multitude who began to as­
	      <lb/>semble, proclaimed that the appointed hour was ar­
	      <lb/>rived. Several fires were kindled along the shore,
	      <lb/>and on a slight eminence beyond the fort, a large
	      <lb/>stake, driven into the ground, designated the place of
	      <lb/>execution. <persName>Major Atherton</persName> was conducted from
	      <lb/>the fortress by a numerous and ferocious guard; he
	      <lb/>walked with a firm and manly step; his counte­
	      <lb/>nance was serene, and the spirit of <rs type="properAdjective">christian</rs> hope
	      <lb/>and resignation evidently supported him in that
	      <lb/>trying hour. Once only, when they had bound him
	      <lb/>to the fatal stake, he cast a lingering look towards
	      <lb/>the vessel, which contained the only being perhaps
	      <lb/>who would weep for his untimely fate; and for an in­
	      <lb/>stant his lip quivered, and a deep flush overspread
	      <lb/>his pale features. It slowly passed away—he raised
	      <lb/>his eyes to Heaven, and every earthly passion
	      <lb/>seemed forever subdued.</p>
	    <p>The savages then entirely covered their victim
	      <lb/>with bark, using the most insulting gestures and
	      <lb/>menaces, which their deadly hatred could invent.
	      <lb/>Previous to lighting the pile they formed an immense
	      <lb/>circle around him, and with discordant yells, both
	      <lb/>sexes indiscriminately joined in performing the
	      <lb/>horrid war-dance. As soon as this infernal rite
	      <lb/>was completed, a torch was applied to the combus­
	      <lb/>tible materials which surrounded the unfortunate
	      <lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>, and instantly the smoke began to mount,
	      <lb/>and wreathe around him. Nothing could exceed
	      <lb/>the horror of the spectacle. <persName>Atherton</persName> was no longer
	      <pb n="225"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="20(3)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">225</mw>
	      <lb/>visible through the clouds of smoke which envel­
	      <lb/>oped him; for to render his death more painful
	      <lb/>and lingering, they had selected green materials,
	      <lb/>which long resisted the violence of the flames.
	      <lb/>The savages still encircled him; a demoniac joy,
	      <lb/>and vindictive fury was painted on their features,
	      <lb/>and their dreadful shouts of exultation were min­
	      <lb/>gled with the appalling sounds of the war-whoop.</p>
	    <p>At that fearful moment, a report of fire-arms was
	      <lb/>heard, and a shower of musket-balls poured upon
	      <lb/>the astonished group. A party of white men, sword
	      <lb/>in hand, rushed from an adjoining thicket, and with
	      <lb/>determined courage, plunged through the circle to
	      <lb/>the rescue of the prisoner. <persName>Cushminaw</persName> recognised
	      <lb/><persName>Van Haarman</persName> in their gallant leader, and with a
	      <lb/>joyful cry, he sprang forward, and severed the
	      <lb/>cords, which confined <persName>Atherton</persName> to the stake. <persName>Ather­
		<lb/>ton</persName> like one risen from the dead, leaped from the
	      <lb/>burning pile unharmed, though blackened with
	      <lb/>smoke; and snatching his own sword from the
	      <lb/>hand of a bewildered chief, joined in the defence of
	      <lb/>his brave liberators.</p>
	    <p>The <name>Pequods</name> thrown into consternation by this
	      <lb/>sudden attack, knew not how to conduct, or in what
	      <lb/>way to defend themselves. They had partaken
	      <lb/>freely of the ardent spirits which <persName>Van Haarman</persName>
	      <lb/>had purposely sent to them, on the return of <persName>Cush­
		<lb/>minaw</persName>, and their inebriation added greatly to the
	      <lb/>confusion of the scene. Stupified by terror and
	      <lb/>surprise, they greatly overrated the numbers of the
	      <lb/><name>Dutch</name>; many fled precipitately, and all seemed
	      <mw type="vol" rend="align(left)indent(+1)case(allcaps)">Vol. II.</mw>

	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">226</mw>
	      <lb/>incapable of offering the least resistance. <persName>Van
		<lb/>Haarman</persName> took advantage of their condition, and
	      <lb/>immediately ordered a retreat, which was effected
	      <lb/>in good order, and without the loss of a single man.
	      <lb/>They heard at a distance, the shouts of the <name>Indians</name>,
	      <lb/>who began to rally, but dared not pursue them;
	      <lb/>and a flight of arrows they discharged, fell
	      <lb/>harmless among the trees of the forest.</p>
	    <p>The emotions of <persName>Major Atherton</persName> were indes­
	      <lb/>cribable. Recalled to life from the borders of the
	      <lb/>grave, the first offerings of his heart were directed
	      <lb/>to that good Being, whose arm had encircled him,
	      <lb/>and led him back from the dark valley of death.
	      <lb/>As they glided over the peaceful waters, he re­
	      <lb/>mained absorbed in mental devotion and thanks­
	      <lb/>giving. Not a voice disturbed the profound silence;
	      <lb/>the dashing of the oars, and ripple of the waves,
	      <lb/>were the only sounds, which broke upon the still­
	      <lb/>ness of the night. It was not till he had gained
	      <lb/>the deck of the sloop, that <persName>Atherton's</persName> thoughts
	      <lb/>were completely recalled to earth. With a swell­
	      <lb/>ing heart, he regarded the little band who had just
	      <lb/>ventured their lives upon a doubtful and dangerous
	      <lb/>enterprise in the cause of humanity; and he deeply
	      <lb/>felt that language was inadequate to express the
	      <lb/>obligations they had imposed on him. Silently,
	      <lb/>but with a countenance more eloquent than words,
	      <lb/>he pressed the hand of each as they crowded around
	      <lb/>him; and even with tears of gratitude, embraced
	      <lb/>the generous and disinterested <persName>Van Haarman</persName>.</p>
	    <p><said>You have need of repose,</said> said <persName>Van Haarman</persName>,
	      <pb n="227"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="20(4)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">227</mw>
	      <lb/>leading him aside; <said>but first there is one who must
		<lb/>be convinced with her own eyes, that you are in
		<lb/>safety.</said></p>
	    <p>As he spoke, they descended a few steps, and
	      <lb/>knocked softly at the door of the cabin which was
	      <lb/>occupied by <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>; and with a throbbing
	      <lb/>pulse, <persName>Atherton</persName> heard the quick motion of her light
	      <lb/>step within. <persName>Van Haarman</persName> disengaged his arm
	      <lb/>from <persName>Atherton's</persName>, and hastily withdrew, unwilling
	      <lb/>to intrude upon their interview, under circumstances
	      <lb/>so peculiar and affecting. He immediately ordered
	      <lb/>the sails to be set, and weighing anchor, they sailed
	      <lb/>with a fair wind from the unfriendly shores of the
	      <lb/><name>Pequods</name>.</p>
	    <p><persName>Van Haarman</persName> had waited with extreme anxiety
	      <lb/>for the return of <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, on the preceding
	      <lb/>evening; and when he saw the dastardly <name>Dutchman</name>
	      <lb/>approaching alone in the boat, his fears and pre­
	      <lb/>dictions seemed at once fatally confirmed. From
	      <lb/>the unwilling confession of the man, he detected
	      <lb/>his cowardice, and in the excess of his anger and
	      <lb/>disappointment, ordered him to be put in irons for
	      <lb/>the punishment of his treachery. From that mo­
	      <lb/>ment, his thoughts were unremittingly bent on
	      <lb/>devising some means of rescuing his friend from
	      <lb/>the dreadful fate which awaited him.</p>
	    <p>Most unexpectedly, <persName>Mononotto</persName> on the following
	      <lb/>morning, restored the captive maidens, and de­
	      <lb/>manded <persName>Cushminaw</persName>, and five of the <rs type="properAdjective">Pequod</rs> war­
	      <lb/>riors for their ransom, agreeable to the offers of
	      <lb/>the <name>Dutch</name>. But the endeavours of <persName>Van Haarman</persName>
	      <pb n="228"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="20(4)v"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">228</mw>
	      <lb/>to include <persName>Atherton</persName> in the stipulation, were ineffec­
	      <lb/>tual, and the Sachem haughtily rejected the most
	      <lb/>liberal offers for his freedom. The grief and de­
	      <lb/>spair of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName> at times deprived her entirely
	      <lb/>of reason; again she would remain long in a state
	      <lb/>of death-like insensibility; and in her calmer inter­
	      <lb/>vals, she supplicated <persName>Van Haarman</persName> with tears,
	      <lb/>which could not be resisted, to save her lover, or
	      <lb/>suffer her to go and perish with him. Affected by
	      <lb/>her distress, and led on by a daring spirit, as well
	      <lb/>as a real interest for his friend, he resolved at all
	      <lb/>events, to hazard a bold and decisive attempt to
	      <lb/>rescue him. With little difficulty he inspired a few
	      <lb/>of his bravest men with a portion of his enthu­
	      <lb/>siasm, and engaged them to assist him in the peri­
	      <lb/>lous adventure.</p>
	    <p>With a vigilant eye, <persName>Van Haarman</persName> watched the
	      <lb/>transactions of the <name>Indians</name> on shore during the day,
	      <lb/>and the moment their fires were lighted, he pre­
	      <lb/>pared to prosecute his design. His vessel was put
	      <lb/>in readiness to sail at an instant's warning; and
	      <lb/>when he saw the <name>Indians</name> forming a circle around
	      <lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>, he removed down the river beyond the
	      <lb/>light of their flames. He reached the shore in a
	      <lb/>boat with his men; and landing in the shelter of a 
	      <lb/>grove, they proceeded cautiously along, directed
	      <lb/>by the blaze, which glanced brightly through the
	      <lb/>branches of the trees. <persName>Van Haarman</persName> had placed
	      <lb/>much reliance on the intoxicating liquor which he
	      <lb/>had presented to <persName>Mononotto</persName> in the morning, and
	      <lb/>rightly judged would be reserved for the evening

	      <lb/>feast. At the auspicious moment when their senses
	      <lb/>were deranged by liberal potations, and they be­
	      <lb/>lieved themselves secure in their savage mirth, he
	      <lb/>rushed upon them with his intrepid band, in the

	      <lb/>anchored beneath the walls of fort <placeName>Saybrook</placeName>, and
	      <lb/><persName>Major Atherton</persName> was awakened by the drums of
	      <lb/>the garrison, beating the reveillè. His drowsiness
	      <lb/>was at once dispelled, and he hastened on deck
	      <lb/>with an elastic step, and free and buoyant spirits.
	      <lb/>The familiar and exhilarating sounds of martial
	      <lb/>music, the glitter of polished arms, and the an­
	      <lb/>cient banner of his country unfurled from the ram­
	      <lb/>parts, burst gaily on his ear and eye. As he in­
	      <lb/>haled the fragrance of the dewy air, and looked
	      <lb/>round upon the wider landscape,—the distant hills,
	      <lb/>silvered by the transparent vapours, which curled
	      <lb/>around their brows,—the beautiful sweep of wood­
	      <lb/>lands, and the luxuriant meadows,—all glowing
	      <lb/>in the brilliancy of the morning sun;—his mind
	      <lb/>was filled with almost rapturous delight, and con­
	      <lb/>trasting his present feelings, with those of the

	      <lb/>and he thought the face of nature had never worn
	      <lb/>so lovely an aspect, nor the pulse of existence,
	      <lb/>bounded with such pure and joyous emotions.</p>
	    <p>But his happy reverie was soon interrupted by

	      <lb/>and hurrying below, with impatient steps he pass­
	      <lb/>ed and repassed the door of <persName>Miriam's</persName> cabin, half
	      <lb/>inclined to chide her, that her ear was so inatten­
	      <lb/>tive to the footsteps of love. Hearing no sound

	      <lb/>awake. He was much disposed to disregard her;
	      <lb/>but <persName>Van Haarman</persName> at the moment, came to inform
	      <lb/>him he was waiting to go on shore, and <persName>Atherton</persName>
	      <lb/>felt obliged to accompany him, though he more
	      <lb/>than once turned to look back, as he fancied
	      <lb/>he heard the sweet tones of <persName>Miriam's</persName> voice.</p>
	    <p>They were received with the utmost politeness
	      <lb/>by <persName>Lieutenant Gardiner</persName>, the commanding officer;
	      <lb/>and <persName>Captain Underhill</persName>, who had arrived at <placeName>Say­
		<lb/>brook</placeName> two or three weeks before, with twenty men
	      <lb/>to relieve the garrison. <persName>Captain Underhill</persName> imme­
	      <lb/>diately recognized <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, whom he had
	      <lb/>known at <placeName>Boston</placeName>, and expected to have found at
	      <lb/><placeName>Saybrook</placeName>. His unaccountable disappearance, at
	      <lb/>the moment he had voluntarily embarked in so
	      <lb/>important an undertaking, had occasioned much
	      <lb/>conjecture, and no small anxiety,<choice><sic>.</sic><corr/></choice> to those who
	      <lb/>were personally interested in him. The mystery
	      <lb/>was soon explained to the entire satisfaction of all
	      <lb/>concerned; and having delivered his credentials
	      <lb/>to <persName>Lieutenant Gardiner</persName>, his proffered services were
	      <lb/>gladly accepted by him, on the behalf of the <placeName>Con­
		<lb/>necticut</placeName> colonies.</p>
	    <p>The officers, with that respectful gallantry which
	      <pb n="232"/>

	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">232</mw>
	      <lb/>always accompanies true bravery, were solicitous
	      <lb/>to prepare suitable accommodations for <persName>Miriam</persName>
	      <lb/>and her young companion, and to render their
	      <lb/>temporary residence at the fort agreeable. <persName>Ather­
		<lb/>ton's</persName> extreme anxiety for their safety induced him
	      <lb/>to urge a speedy removal to their friends; as the
	      <lb/>critical state of the country, the danger of an at­
	      <lb/>tack from the <name>Indians</name>, and the embarrassing situa­
	      <lb/>tion of two unprotected females in the
	      <lb/>midst of a garrison, must render their abode there,
	      <lb/>perilous and unpleasant. He knew not how soon
	      <lb/>he should be called away, and the idea of leaving
	      <lb/><persName>Miriam</persName> in that place, and under such circum­
	      <lb/>stances, was not to be endured. A pinnace from
	      <lb/>the river towns had put in at <placeName>Saybrook</placeName> on the pre­
	      <lb/>ceding day, and was only waiting for a favourable
	      <lb/>wind to proceed to the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>. It offered
	      <lb/>few conveniences which the occasion required, but
	      <lb/><persName>Atherton</persName> thought it would be better for them to
	      <lb/>proceed directly in it, than run the chance of an­
	      <lb/>other opportunity, which was not likely soon to occur,
	      <lb/>and might not be more advantageous. It was im­
	      <lb/>possible for the garrison, at that critical time to
	      <lb/>fit out a vessel for their accommodation; and
	      <lb/>though <persName>Van Haarman</persName> would gladly have carried
	      <lb/>them through the voyage, he did not feel autho­
	      <lb/>rized to exceed his instructions, which were to de­
	      <lb/>liver them to the <name>English</name> at <placeName>Saybrook</placeName>. He how­
	      <lb/>ever promised to escort them through the waters
	      <lb/>of the Sound, when they would be beyond the ter­
	      <lb/>ritories of the <name>Pequod Indians</name>, and the danger of
	      <pb n="233"/>

	      <lb/>any hostile attack. The master of the pinnace
	      <lb/>was well known to several persons in the fort, and
	      <lb/>sustained an excellent character. <persName>Atherton</persName> there­
	      <lb/>fore felt no hesitation in placing the objects of his
	      <lb/>solicitude, under such protection; and he received
	      <lb/>a ready promise to bestow on them every possible
	      <lb/>attention, and to leave them, with the friends of
	      <lb/><persName>Miriam</persName>, at <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>. <persName>Atherton</persName> learned from him,
	      <lb/>that <persName>Mrs. Weldon</persName> had entirely recovered from her
	      <lb/>illness, though still in deep affliction for the sup­
	      <lb/>posed loss of <persName>Miriam</persName>, which was generally con­
	      <lb/>sidered inevitable. She then enjoyed the solace of
	      <lb/>her husband's society, who had returned to <placeName>Hart­
		<lb/>ford</placeName> with <persName>Captain Mason</persName>, immediately on the ar­
	      <lb/>rival of <persName>Captain Underhill</persName> at <placeName>Saybrook</placeName>.</p>
	    <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName> hastened to impart this intel­
	      <lb/>ligence to <persName>Miriam</persName>, and to consult her on his pro­
	      <lb/>posed arrangements. While yet conversing, they
	      <lb/>were joined by <persName>Van Haarman</persName>; and <persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName>,
	      <lb/>the founder of the fort and settlement of <placeName>Saybrook</placeName>,
	      <lb/>and afterwards, for many years, a useful and dis­
	      <lb/>tinguished governor of the <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> colonies.
	      <lb/>He was a young man of superior abilities, which
	      <lb/>were greatly improved by travelling, and an ex­
	      <lb/>tensive acquaintance with letters and mankind.
	      <lb/>With the benevolence and urbanity, which cha­
	      <lb/>racterised his father, he also imbibed a firm pre­
	      <lb/>dilection for puritanical doctrines; and though es­
	      <lb/>teemed one of the most accomplished gentlemen,
	      <lb/>and elegant scholars of the age, he was content
	      <lb/>to sacrifice the honours and preferments, which

	      <mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">21</mw>

	      <lb/>courted him in his native land, to plant what he
	      <lb/>considered the true faith, in the rigid soil of <placeName>New-
		<lb/>England</placeName>.</p>
	    <p>The object of his visit, was to request <persName>Miriam</persName>
	      <lb/>and <persName>Rachel</persName>, to remove to his house, which was
	      <lb/>pleasantly situated within the impalement; and
	      <lb/>where he promised them perfect retirement, and
	      <lb/>the attentive care of a respectable female, who su­
	      <lb/>perintended his household. <persName>Miriam</persName> cheerfully ac­
	      <lb/>ceded to his request, for her spirits were languid,
	      <lb/>and her strength debilitated by suffering and fa­
	      <lb/>tigue, and she gladly exchanged the confinement
	      <lb/>and confusion of the sloop, for an agreeable and
	      <lb/>quiet situation.</p>
	    <p><persName>Mr. Winthrop</persName> invited <persName>Atherton</persName>, <persName>Van Haarman</persName>
	      <lb/>and the officers of the garrison, to dine with him,
	      <lb/>on that day; but <persName>Miriam</persName> declined appearing at ta­
	      <lb/>ble, from a natural aversion to encounter the gaze
	      <lb/>of strangers, under circumstances which excited
	      <lb/>so much curiosity. <persName>Atherton's</persName> feelings were much
	      <lb/>gratified by her reserve; but it disappointed the
	      <lb/>guests, in general; for they had heard high enco­
	      <lb/>miums on her beauty, and felt their interest strong­
	      <lb/>ly awakened by her adventures. As soon as the
	      <lb/>company began to disperse, <persName>Atherton</persName> requested
	      <lb/>permission to speak with <persName>Miriam</persName>; and <persName>Mr. Win­
		<lb/>throp</persName>, with a significant smile, directed him to a
	      <lb/>room where he had parted from her in the morn­
	      <lb/>ing. He found her sitting alone by a window,
	      <lb/>which opened into the garden, where <persName>Rachel</persName> was
	      <lb/>amusing herself with the gambols of a playful
	      <pb n="235"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="21(2)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">235</mw>
	      <lb/>dog. As he entered hastily, he observed that she
	      <lb/>had been weeping; but her countenance instantly
	      <lb/>brightened with pleasure, as she rose with a smile
	      <lb/>and a blush to receive him.</p>
	    <p><said>These are tears of joy, I trust, dear <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said><lb/>said <persName>Atherton</persName>, looking earnestly in her face; <said>sure­
		<lb/>ly you have now no source of unhappiness to call
		<lb/>them forth.</said></p>
	    <p><said>No, none,</said> replied <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>I should be un­
		<lb/>grateful to repine at any thing, almost in a moment,
		<lb/>when Providence has interposed to snatch me from
		<lb/>a dreadful fate. But—</said> she added hesitatingly;
	      <lb/>and stopping abruptly, cast her eyes on the
	      <lb/>ground.</p>
	    <p><said>But what?</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>, anxiously, <said>tell
		<lb/>me, <persName>Miriam</persName>, if there is any thing I can do to ren­
		<lb/>der you more happy, and you cannot doubt my
		<lb/>zeal in your service.</said></p>
	    <p><said>There is nothing that I can wish for,</said> answer­
	      <lb/>ed <persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>you have already done for me more
		<lb/>than words can express; you have laid me under
		<lb/>obligations which a life of devoted gratitude could
		<lb/>never repay.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Nay, dear <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>one sunny
		<lb/>smile, one glance of affection, has cancelled all, and
		<lb/>more than all, that I could do or suffer for your
		<lb/>sake. But I would learn the meaning of that hesi­
		<lb/>tation, that untold something, which just now
		<lb/>trembled on your lips;—surely you, who are al­
		<lb/>ways so ingenuous, need not now use such reserve
		<lb/>to me.</said></p>
	    <pb n="236"/>
	    <milestone unit="sig" n="21(2)v"/>
	    <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">236</mw>
	    <p><said>I have perhaps used too little towards you,</said> re­
	      <lb/>turned <persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>and indeed, I fear you will think
		<lb/>me weak and foolish, if I acknowledge that the
		<lb/>thoughts of my intended voyage have power to de­
		<lb/>press my spirits for a moment.</said></p>
	    <p><said>On the contrary,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, I cannot suffi­
	      <lb/>ciently admire your cheerful acquiescence in the plan
	      <lb/>we have adopted for you; and which, though it seems
	      <lb/>the only one that can insure your safety, under pre­
	      <lb/>sent circumstances, exposes you to so many incon­
	      <lb/>veniences, that I cannot reflect on it without the ut­
	      <lb/>most solicitude, nor too deeply regret that it is im­
	      <lb/>possible for me to go with you, and protect you in
	      <lb/>this emergency.</p>
	    <p><said>I have no fears for myself,</said> replied <persName>Miriam</persName>; <said>I
		<lb/>am a rugged daughter of <placeName>New-England</placeName>, unused to
		<lb/>the gentle nurture of your <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> maidens, and
		<lb/>from childhood accustomed to fatigue, and taught
		<lb/>to meet the unavoidable evils of life without repin­
		<lb/>ing. But why should I blush to acknowledge it,
		<lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>? I tremble with apprehension at the
		<lb/>thoughts of parting from <emph>you</emph>, of leaving <emph>you</emph>, in
		<lb/>this place of danger.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Dearest <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, with a glow
	      <lb/>of grateful pleasure, <said>how can I thank you for this
		<lb/>kind expression of interest! a sweet assurance of
		<lb/>your affection, more precious to me than the wealth
		<lb/>of kingdoms, and which I shall cherish as the de­
		<lb/>lightful harbinger of a happy and more lasting re­
		<lb/>union, when the gloomy, but I trust, brief days of
		<lb/>our separation have passed away.</said></p>

	    <p><said>It is not leaving you, at which I repine,</said> said
	      <lb/><persName>Miriam</persName>, with a faint smile; <said>at another time, I
		<lb/>would, I ought to do it voluntarily without regret;
		<lb/>but now I quit you on the eve of a fearful combat,
		<lb/>with a powerful and barbarous enemy, whose very
		<lb/>name is dreadful, and whose <quote>tender mercies,</quote>
		<lb/>you have already bitterly experienced, are <quote>cru­
		  <lb/>elty.</quote></said></p>
	    <p>
	      <said>Your fears for me, dear <persName>Miriam</persName>, are too grateful
		<lb/>to my feelings, not to give me pleasure; but I trust
		<lb/>they are wholly groundless; I feel a secret confi­
		<lb/>dence, that He, who has once so mercifully deliver­
		<lb/>ed me from their hands will still be my shield and
		<lb/>defence, and that He will give his people a signal
		<lb/>victory over their heathenish foes.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>May your words prove prophetic!</said> returned
	      <lb/><persName>Miriam</persName>. <said><persName>Atherton</persName>, forgive my womanish fears,</said>
	      <lb/>she added; <said>but I know your courage, and I am
		<lb/>assured it will lead you wherever dangers most
		<lb/>thickly abound; remember, I entreat you, that your
		<lb/>life is too valuable to be thrown away.</said></p>
	    <p>
	      <said>If it is of value to you, <persName>Miriam</persName>, I shall be in­
		<lb/>clined to prize it but too highly; though I would
		<lb/>not give you reason to blush for my cowardice.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>I must first,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>forget your past
		<lb/>services; I must first cease to remember, <persName>Atherton</persName>,
		<lb/>the intrepid courage with which you have twice
		<lb/>hazarded your life to preserve mine; and when I
		<lb/>forget these things, then will <quote>my right hand for­
		  <lb/>get its cunning.</quote></said></p>

		<lb/>you; if you knew how much selfishness was min­
		<lb/>gled in my wishes to serve you,—how wretched my
		<lb/>life would be without you,—how closely my happi­
		<lb/>ness is interwoven with your own,—you would not
		<lb/>think that I had made any uncommon efforts, that my
		<lb/>trifling exertions were worthy to excite this excess
		<lb/>of feeling;—so speak no more of it, or I shall fear
		<lb/>that your interest for me is excited only by the
		<lb/>cold impulse of gratitude, which would have ex­
		<lb/>panded as generously towards any other object,
		<lb/>even the most indifferent, to whom you felt in­
		<lb/>debted.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      <said>Think so, <persName>Atherton</persName>, if you will, if you <emph>can</emph>;
		<lb/>and it were better, perhaps, and far happier for us,
		<lb/>if no other sentiments than those of kindness and
		<lb/>gratitude had been suffered to take root and flour­
		<lb/>ish in our hearts.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>No, it cannot be so, my own <persName>Miriam</persName>,</said> said
	      <lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>, with energy; <said>I feel assured that bright­
		<lb/>er days are in store for us, and that it will not al­
		<lb/>ways be a crime to indulge the pure and hallowed
		<lb/>affections of the heart. In this hope, our parting
		<lb/>must not be sad; this is no place for one so inno­
		<lb/>cent and lovely, and I wait even impatiently for
		<lb/>the moment of your departure; and may He, who
		<lb/>rules the winds and waves, lead you in safety to the
		<lb/>shelter of your father's roof, and the protection of
		<lb/>his arms.</said></p>
	    <p><said><persName>Atherton</persName>, you are too sanguine,</said> said <persName>Miriam</persName>;
	      <lb/><said>but be it so; we will not increase the pain of the

		<milestone unit="sig" n="21(4)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">239</mw>
		<lb/>future, but submit patiently to that Providence,
		<lb/>which directs every event in wisdom.</said></p>
	    <p>
	      <said>You are right, my <persName>Miriam</persName>; and when the din
		<lb/>of battle has ceased, I will return to you, and sue
		<lb/>for the treasure of your affections with an eloquence
		<lb/>which love shall dictate, and the heart of a father
		<lb/>cannot resist.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>We may at least look forward with hope,</said> said
	      <lb/><persName>Miriam</persName>, blushing; <said>but it is a question which time
		<lb/>alone can decide. I have now a request to make,
		<lb/>which I am sure you will not deny me.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I can refuse nothing that you ask,</said> said <persName>Ather­
		<lb/>ton</persName>; <said>you have only to speak, and if it is in my
		<lb/>power you shall be obeyed.</said></p>
	    <p><said>If,</said> resumed <persName>Miriam</persName>, <said>the fortune of war should
		<lb/>place the family of <persName>Mononotto</persName> at your disposal,
		<lb/>will you for my sake treat them with that kindness
		<lb/>which they showed to me during my captivity;
		<lb/>and which I shall probably never have an opportu­
		<lb/>nity of returning in the least degree?</said></p>
	    <p><said>Be assured,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>that every
		<lb/>possible attention shall be bestowed on them which
		<lb/>even your grateful solicitude could desire. And
		<lb/>now my dear <persName>Miriam</persName> I have a simple boon to ask
		<lb/>from you;—it is one of these silken tresses which
		<lb/>I would wear as a precious charm when I can no
		<lb/>longer be with you, except in the delusive dreams
		<lb/>of fancy.</said></p>
	    <p><persName>Miriam</persName> with a smile yielded to his wishes, and
	      <lb/>in compliance with his request had just bound the
	      <lb/>glossy ringlet around his arm when their conver­

	      <lb/>sation was interrupted by the entrance of <persName>Mr.
		<lb/>Winthrop</persName> and <persName>Van Haarman</persName>.</p>
	    <p>On the following morning the <rs type="properAdjective">Dutch</rs> sloop took
	      <lb/>advantage of a favourable wind, and convoyed the
	      <lb/><placeName>Connecticut</placeName> pinnace beyond the waters of the
	      <lb/>Sound. They had scarcely sailed out of sight be­
	      <lb/>fore a fleet of three vessels, containing ninety
	      <lb/>men, destined to act against the <name>Pequods</name>, ap­
	      <lb/>proached the fort. Their appearance, which had
	      <lb/>been long expected, occasioned the utmost joy;
	      <lb/>they landed under a discharge of artillery, and
	      <lb/>were received with military honours by the garri­
	      <lb/>son. This small army left <placeName>Hartford</placeName> in company
	      <lb/>with seventy <name>Mohegan</name> and river <name>Indians</name> who
	      <lb/>had united with their force, and were commanded
	      <lb/>by <persName>Uncas</persName>, grand Sachem of the <name>Mohegans</name>. But
	      <lb/>as the navigation of the river was much impeded
	      <lb/>by the unusual lowness of the water, the <name>Indians</name>
	      <lb/>became impatient of the restraint and delays, and
	      <lb/>begged permission to land and proceed on foot.
	      <lb/>This was granted them on condition of effecting a
	      <lb/>junction with the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> at <placeName>Saybrook</placeName>; but strong
	      <lb/>doubts were entertained of their fidelity, which was
	      <lb/>seldom proof against interest, revenge, or any
	      <lb/>other passion of their savage hearts. On this oc­
	      <lb/>casion, however, they were true to their word; and
	      <lb/>the next day arrived at the fort, bringing intelli­
	      <lb/>gence that they had fallen in with a party of the
	      <lb/>enemy, completely routed them, and killed and
	      <lb/>wounded several of their number.</p>

	      <lb/>commander in chief of the <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> forces and
	      <lb/>their <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> allies. He was an experienced sol­
	      <lb/>dier, and highly prized for his undaunted courage
	      <lb/>and profound knowledge of military tactics; with
	      <lb/>which he united the virtues of a sincere <name>christian</name>,
	      <lb/>and the deportment of a gentleman. He was at
	      <lb/>that time about thirty-five years old, tall and ath­
	      <lb/>letic, with commanding features, a frank and in­
	      <lb/>telligent countenance, and a martial air and de­
	      <lb/>meanor. In early life he had served in the <rs type="properAdjective">Nether­

	      <lb/>celebrated general so highly valued his talents and
	      <lb/>conduct, that in after years when the unhappy
	      <lb/>struggle arose between <persName>Charles the first</persName> and his
	      <lb/>parliament, he earnestly entreated <persName>Captain Mason</persName>
	      <lb/>to return and assist in the defence of his national
	      <lb/>rights. But the Captain was preferred to the
	      <lb/>highest offices of the Colony, and so firmly attach­
	      <lb/>ed to his adopted country and the religion of the
	      <lb/><name>Puritans</name> that he could not be prevailed on to
	      <lb/>abandon them.</p>
	    <p>The army lay wind-bound at <placeName>Saybrook</placeName> for two
	      <lb/>days; and the time was almost entirely spent in
	      <lb/>consultations respecting the manner of proceeding,
	      <lb/>in which <persName>Captain Mason</persName> and his officers entirely
	      <lb/>disagreed. The Court had instructed them to pro­
	      <lb/>ceed directly to the <placeName>Pequod harbour</placeName>; but for many
	      <lb/>reasons the Captain judged it expedient to sail
	      <lb/>first to the <name>Narraganset</name> country, and go from

	      <lb/>agree in opinion it was finally left to the decision
	      <lb/>of <persName>Mr. Stone</persName>, who accompanied the troops as chap­
	      <lb/>lain. He was desired to set apart a time for devo­
	      <lb/>tions suited to the occasion, to seek direction from
	      <lb/>the God of battles, and entreat his protection and

	      <lb/>Like the patriarch of old he <quote>wrestled until the

	      <lb/>dle of <name>May</name>, the little army of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, with
	      <lb/>their <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> allies, anchored in the noble <placeName>Bay of
		<lb/>Narraganset</placeName>. The fruitful and finely variegated
	      <lb/>tract of country which has since received the name
	      <lb/>of <placeName>Rhode-Island</placeName>, and whose shores are washed by
	      <lb/>the waters of the Bay, was at that time inhabited
	      <lb/>by a hardy race of savages, scattered throughout
	      <lb/>the interior, and leading an erratic life of freedom
	      <lb/>and independence. This populous tribe could then
	      <lb/>send forth upwards of four thousand warriors to
	      <lb/>the field of battle, and was the only nation east of
	      <lb/>the <placeName>Hudson</placeName>, who had rendered themselves formi­
	      <lb/>dable to the ferocious <name>Pequods</name>. They were conti­
	      <lb/>nually at war with them, and had hitherto success­
	      <lb/>fully resisted their encroachments. Their fertile
	      <lb/>lands and salubrious climate had not allured the
	      <lb/><rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> planter to wrest from them the inheritance
	      <lb/>of nature; nor had the footsteps of art yet tracked
	      <lb/>the soil, and mingled her magic charms with the
	      <lb/>magnificence of its native scenery, except where

	      <lb/>the <placeName>Providence plantation</placeName> displayed her youthful
	      <lb/>settlement, crowning the head of the Bay, and like
	      <lb/>a sylvan deity decked with the offerings of rural
	      <lb/>industry.</p>
	    <p>There the celebrated <persName>Roger Williams</persName> had laid
	      <lb/>the foundations of a flourishing colony, and amidst
	      <lb/>the dominions of the savage, found that refuge
	      <lb/>from persecution, which he had vainly sought in
	      <lb/>the abodes of civilized man. The wild and untu­
	      <lb/>tored children of the forest regarded him as a
	      <lb/>father and a friend; and though defenceless and
	      <lb/>exposed, he held them in subjection and awe, by
	      <lb/>the mild ties of gratitude and affection. His influ­
	      <lb/>ence was uniformly exerted to repress their hostility
	      <lb/>against the neighbouring <name>English</name>; and with the
	      <lb/>genuine spirit of benevolence and forgiveness, he
	      <lb/>was unremitting in his efforts to do good to those
	      <lb/>who inveighed against the errors of his creed and
	      <lb/>ejected him from <rs type="properAdjective">christian</rs> fellowship. <persName>Major
		<lb/>Atherton</persName> had heard much of that extraordinary
	      <lb/>man, and hoped his curiosity would be gratified by
	      <lb/>a personal interview, as they approached so near
	      <lb/>the place of his exile. But he was disappointed
	      <lb/>on finding the residence of <persName>Canonicus</persName>, grand sachem
	      <lb/>of the <name>Narragansets</name>, was much nearer the entrance
	      <lb/>of the Bay, which rendered their further progress
	      <lb/>inexpedient.</p>
	    <p>The next day being the <name>Sabbath</name>, their business
	      <lb/>was suspended, and divine service was performed

	      <lb/>rence and devotion. On Monday, <persName>Captains Ma­
		<lb/>son</persName> and <persName>Underhill</persName>, with a sufficient guard, repaired
	      <lb/>to the dwelling of <persName>Canonicus</persName>, to acquaint him with
	      <lb/>their motives for visiting his country with so large
	      <lb/>a force, and request permission to pass through it
	      <lb/>in peace, to attack the <rs type="properAdjective">Pequod</rs> forts. The young
	      <lb/>sachem <persName>Miantonimo</persName>, to whom the old king had
	      <lb/>resigned the reigns of government, assembled his
	      <lb/>chief counsellors and warriors to hold a <mcr>talk</mcr> with
	      <lb/>the <name>English</name>; and after gravely listening to the
	      <lb/>arguments of <persName>Captain Mason</persName>, he answered that he
	      <lb/>highly approved his designs, and would send some
	      <lb/>of his own subjects to assist him. He however ex­
	      <lb/>pressed a doubt that the white men were too feeble
	      <lb/>to oppose the <name>Pequods</name>, who were exceedingly va­
	      <lb/>liant, and also powerful in numbers.</p>
	    <p>Encouraged by this reception, <persName>Captain Mason</persName>
	      <lb/>ordered his men to land, except a few, who were
	      <lb/>left in charge with the vessels, and proceed to the
	      <lb/>place of rendezvous. In the evening, an <name>Indian</name>
	      <lb/>came from the <placeName>Providence plantation</placeName>, bringing a
	      <lb/>letter from <persName>Captain Patrick</persName>, who had arrived there
	      <lb/>with forty men from the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>. He re­
	      <lb/>quested <persName>Captain Mason</persName> to wait until he could join
	      <lb/>him with his troops; but although a union of forces
	      <lb/>was desirable, the officers in general were averse
	      <lb/>to the delay. The soldiers were already impatient
	      <lb/>to proceed, and it was of the utmost importance to
	      <lb/>surprise the enemy, which could not be effected
	      <lb/>without using great dispatch. It was customary
	      <lb/>among the <name>Indians</name> to entertain the squaws of either

	      <lb/>hostile nation in their camps, and many of the <rs type="properAdjective">Pequod</rs>
	      <lb/>women were mingled with the <name>Narragansets</name>, who,
	      <lb/>it was feared, would convey intelligence of their
	      <lb/>approach.</p>
	    <p>On the following morning therefore, the army,
	      <lb/>consisting of about eighty <name>Englishmen</name>, sixty <name>Mo­
		<lb/>hegan</name> and river <name>Indians</name>, and two hundred <name>Narra­
		<lb/>gansets</name>, took of their line of march. Before even­
	      <lb/>ing they reached the <placeName>Nihantick</placeName>, a frontier to the
	      <lb/><name>Pequods</name>, which was then governed by a <rs type="properAdjective">Narra­
		<lb/>ganset</rs> sachem. But the <name>Nihanticks</name> treated the
	      <lb/><name>English</name> with haughty insolence, and would not
	      <lb/>receive them into their fort; and <persName>Captain Mason</persName>,
	      <lb/>aware of their treachery, placed a strong guard
	      <lb/>around the impalement to prevent any one from
	      <lb/>passing out to betray them. There they encamped
	      <lb/>that night, and in the morning were joined by
	      <lb/>another party of <name>Narragansets</name>, which induced
	      <lb/>many of the <name>Nihanticks</name> to offer their services; so
	      <lb/>that the army re-commenced its march with a force
	      <lb/>of nearly five hundred <name>Indians</name>.</p>
	    <p>The <name>English</name> endured excessive fatigue and suf­
	      <lb/>fering throughout the day; the weather was oppres­
	      <lb/>sively warm; they were almost destitute of suitable
	      <lb/>provisions, and obliged to travel through a path­
	      <lb/>less wilderness, encumbered with heavy arms and
	      <lb/>ammunition. In the afternoon the country became
	      <lb/>more open, and they crossed a large field which
	      <lb/>had been planted with Indian corn, and was water­
	      <lb/>ed by a pure stream. Here the captain ordered
	      <lb/>his men to halt and refresh themselves, while he
	      <pb n="247"/>

	      <lb/>called a council of his officers, and consulted the
	      <lb/><name>Indians</name> respecting the distance of the forts. <persName>We­
		<lb/>quash</persName>, formerly a petty sachem, who had revolted
	      <lb/>from the <name>Pequods</name>, and who afterwards became a
	      <lb/>convert to <name>christianity</name>, and a zealous apostle among
	      <lb/>his brethren, proved an intelligent and faithful
	      <lb/>guide. He assured <persName>Captain Mason</persName> it would be
	      <lb/>impossible to reach the royal fortress of <persName>Sassacus</persName>
	      <lb/>before midnight. It was twelve miles beyond the
	      <lb/>fort of <placeName>Mistick</placeName>, which was also held by the <name>Pe­
		<lb/>quods</name>, and both were considered impregnable.</p>
	    <p>The <name>Narragansets</name>, learning that the <name>English</name>
	      <lb/>intended to attack the <name>Pequods</name>, and even the dread­
	      <lb/>ful <persName>Sassacus</persName>, in their forts, were filled with asto­
	      <lb/>nishment and alarm, and nearly an hundred imme­
	      <lb/>diately returned to their own country.</p>
	    <p><persName>Captain Mason</persName> had determined to divide his force
	      <lb/>and make a simultaneous attack on the two forts;
	      <lb/>but on finding that they were so remote from each
	      <lb/>other, the extreme fatigue of his men induced him
	      <lb/>to alter his plan, and proceed first with his whole
	      <lb/>army to <placeName>Mistick</placeName>, which lay not far in advance.</p>
	    <p>With invincible courage and in perfect silence,
	      <lb/>the brave little army renewed its march, the In­
	      <lb/>dians falling in the rear, through an excess of fear,
	      <lb/>utterly incompatible with their native boldness and
	      <lb/>hardihood. About dark they reached a pleasant
	      <lb/>valley which offered a verdant couch to their weary
	      <lb/>limbs. Here they pitched their camp, between
	      <lb/>two large rocks, in the now flourishing village of
	      <lb/><placeName>Groton</placeName>; which has since been celebrated in the

	      <lb/>page of history by the infamous attack of the trai­
	      <lb/>tor <persName>Arnold</persName>, who with the cold-blooded malice of
	      <lb/>a demon and a renegade, slew the defenceless gar­
	      <lb/>rison of <placeName>fort Griswold</placeName> after they had surrendered
	      <lb/>to the <rs type="properAdjective">British</rs> arms, and spread misery and deso­
	      <lb/>lation around the very scenes which had nurtured
	      <lb/>his infancy and witnessed his childish sports, if
	      <lb/>indeed a heart so utterly polluted could ever have
	      <lb/>glowed with the pure and innocent enjoyments of
	      <lb/>the guileless age.</p>
	    <p><persName>Wequash</persName> was sent forward to reconnoitre, and
	      <lb/>soon returned with the welcome intelligence that
	      <lb/>the <name>Pequods</name> still maintained the most perfect secu­
	      <lb/>rity. They had seen the <name>English</name> pass in their
	      <lb/>vessels towards the <placeName>Narraganset</placeName>, and believing
	      <lb/>they feared to attack them, were holding a high
	      <lb/>feast, singing and dancing, without any suspicion
	      <lb/>of their approaching danger. Indeed the noise of
	      <lb/>their rejoicing was heard by the sentinels, who
	      <lb/>were posted considerably in advance, until
	      <lb/>after midnight.</p>
	    <p>Long before that time, however, almost every
	      <lb/>eye in the camp was closed in sleep. <persName>Major Ather­
		<lb/>ton</persName>, though not less exhausted than most of his
	      <lb/>fellow-soldiers, felt the mild and balmy influence
	      <lb/>of the evening air too refreshing to admit of slum­
	      <lb/>ber. For some time he continued walking before
	      <lb/>his tent, and busied with thoughts as strangely
	      <lb/>diversified as the events of the few last months of
	      <lb/>his life had been. The moon rode high in the
	      <lb/>heavens, and seemed pouring her light upon a
	      <pb n="249"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="22(3)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">249</mw>
	      <lb/>world of shadows. The utmost stillness prevailed;
	      <lb/>the sentinels moved to and fro with the noiseless
	      <lb/>tread of spectres; scarcely a leaf trembled on its
	      <lb/>stalk, and every blade of grass stood erect and
	      <lb/>glittering with dew. The winding <placeName>Mistick</placeName> flowed
	      <lb/>through its green banks like a stream of silver;
	      <lb/>but even the gurgling of its waters was suspended,
	      <lb/>and the shadows of the distant hills lay like giants
	      <lb/>slumbering on the plain.</p>
	    <p>There was something solemn and soothing in the
	      <lb/>scene; something inexpressibly beautiful, but life­
	      <lb/>less and uncheering. <persName>Atherton</persName> thought of the com­
	      <lb/>ing morrow, when the strife of battle would invade
	      <lb/>the peaceful retirement, and the thunders of war
	      <lb/>disturb the harmony of nature; and though he look­
	      <lb/>ed forward with the courage and ardour of a sol­
	      <lb/>dier, it was also with the compassion of a benevo­
	      <lb/>lent heart, and the seriousness of a reflecting mind.
	      <lb/>But other and softer emotions soon absorbed him.
	      <lb/>He thought of <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>—her beauty, her play­
	      <lb/>ful grace, her artless affection, was each the theme
	      <lb/>on which he dwelt with the passionate tenderness
	      <lb/>of a lover; until, reminded by a change of guards
	      <lb/>of the lateness of the hour, he pressed to his lips the
	      <lb/>lock of hair she twined round his arm, and with a
	      <lb/>sight retired to his hard and lowly pillow.</p>
	    <p>Two hours before day-break the army was again in
	      <lb/>motion; and after devoutly supplicating Him, who
	      <lb/><quote>giveth strength to the weak,</quote> advanced with renovat­
	      <lb/>ed spirits towards <placeName>Mistick fort</placeName>. <persName>Captain Mason</persName> di­
	      <lb/>vided his men into two companies, one commanded

	      <lb/>by himself, the other by <persName>Captain Underhill</persName>; and
	      <lb/>following a circuitous path for about two miles, they
	      <lb/>came to the base of a considerable eminence, on
	      <lb/>which the fort was situated. The <name>Indians</name> still con­
	      <lb/>tinued far in the rear, so overpowered by terror,
	      <lb/>that it was in vain to depend on their assistance.
	      <lb/>On receiving a command from <persName>Captain Mason</persName> to
	      <lb/>remain and see how <name>Englishmen</name> could fight, they
	      <lb/>began to rally, and formed a circle round the fort,
	      <lb/>though at a distance which protected them from
	      <lb/>personal danger.</p>
	    <p>The <name>English</name> rapidly ascended the hill, and had
	      <lb/>almost gained the pallisadoes unperceived, when
	      <lb/>the barking of a dog alarmed the <name>Pequods</name>, and in
	      <lb/>an instant the dreadful sound of the war-whoop an­
	      <lb/>nounced that they were prepared to commence the
	      <lb/>combat. The troops poured a discharge of mus­
	      <lb/>ketry into the fort, and at the same moment the two
	      <lb/>divisions rushed, sword in hand, through the prin­
	      <lb/>cipal entrances, which had been partially secured
	      <lb/>by the branches of trees. The <name>Pequods</name> defended
	      <lb/>themselves with the most desperate and heroic cour­
	      <lb/>age; and a scene of carnage ensued, perhaps un­
	      <lb/>paralleled in the annals of our country.</p>
	    <p>But it is not our intention to invade the province
	      <lb/>of the historian, by entering into the details of this
	      <lb/>sanguinary conflict, from which the feelings of hu­
	      <lb/>manity recoil with horror. Suffice it to say, a
	      <lb/>complete victory was achieved by the conduct and
	      <lb/>intrepidity of the <name>English</name>, though the laurels of the
	      <lb/>conqueror were unhappily stained with the blood of
	      <pb n="251"/>

	      <lb/>the innocent and defenceless. In little more than
	      <lb/>an hour, a flourishing village of seventy wigwams
	      <lb/>was reduced to ashes, and upwards of six hundred
	      <lb/><name>Indians</name>,—the aged, and the feeble infant, the war­
	      <lb/>rior in his strength, and the mother with her help­
	      <lb/>less children, were destroyed by the sword, or pe­
	      <lb/>rished in the flames.</p>
	    <p>The <name>English</name> had only two killed, but nearly
	      <lb/>twenty of their number were severely wounded;
	      <lb/>and the whole army was faint and exhausted by
	      <lb/>their extraordinary exertions. Under these cir­
	      <lb/>cumstances their situation became extremely criti­
	      <lb/>cal. They were in the midst of the enemy's coun­
	      <lb/>try, which they had now aroused to vengeance, and
	      <lb/>every moment liable to an attack from the <name>Indians</name>
	      <lb/>of the other fortress. Their ammunition was near­
	      <lb/>ly expended, and they were destitute of provisions
	      <lb/>and necessaries for the wounded; having left their
	      <lb/>surgeon, and every thing not absolutely needful, in
	      <lb/>the vessels at <placeName>Narraganset</placeName>, which had been delayed
	      <lb/>by contrary winds from joining them at the ex­
	      <lb/>pected time. All the <name>Indians</name>, except <persName>Uncas</persName> and his
	      <lb/>party deserted. While <persName>Captain Mason</persName> and his of­
	      <lb/>ficers were consulting in this emergency, the ves­
	      <lb/>sels, <quote>as if guided by the hand of Providence,</quote> were
	      <lb/>discovered sailing before a fair wind into the <placeName><rs type="properAdjective">Pe­
		<lb/>quod</rs> harbour</placeName>.</p>
	    <p>Their joy at this welcome and almost unhoped
	      <lb/>for relief, was considerably damped by the appear­
	      <lb/>ance of three hundred hostile <name>Indians</name> approaching
	      <lb/>from the royal fortress. <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, with a

	      <lb/>chosen band, was sent forward to oppose their pro­
	      <lb/>gress, and he advanced upon them with so much
	      <lb/>spirit and promptitude, that they were glad to re­
	      <lb/>tire from the contest. <persName>Captain Mason</persName> then gave
	      <lb/>orders to march, the wounded being placed on mats,
	      <lb/>and carried by the friendly <name>Indians</name>. But when the
	      <lb/><name>Pequods</name> ascended the hill, and beheld the ruins of
	      <lb/>the fort, and the destruction of their countrymen,
	      <lb/>their rage became uncontrollable. They tore the
	      <lb/>hair from their heads, used the most violent ges­
	      <lb/>tures of grief, and in a paroxysm of despair, de­
	      <lb/>scended furiously upon the <name>English</name>. A few vol­
	      <lb/>leys from the rear guard again dispersed them;
	      <lb/>and after proceeding a short distance, the army
	      <lb/>halted on the margin of a brook, and indulged a
	      <lb/>few moments of rest and refreshment.</p>
	    <p>They then marched nearly six miles through an
	      <lb/>untracked and marshy ground, pursued by the ene­
	      <lb/>my, who continually discharged their arrows
	      <lb/>amongst them. Fortunately they did no injury;
	      <lb/>but the musketry of the <name>English</name> severely annoyed
	      <lb/>the <name>Indians</name>, and at length compelled them to re­
	      <lb/>treat.</p>
	    <p>The gallant little band reached the <placeName>Pequod har­
		<lb/>bour</placeName> in good order, with their colours flying, and
	      <lb/>were received on board the vessels with every de­
	      <lb/>monstration of joy. In less than three weeks from
	      <lb/>their departure, the troops returned to <placeName>Saybrook</placeName>;
	      <lb/>where, to use the words of <persName>Captain Mason</persName>, they
	      <lb/>were <quote>nobly entertained with many great guns,</quote>
	      <lb/>and treated by <persName>Lieutenant Gardiner</persName> with the most
	      <lb/>attentive hospitality.</p>

	    <p>The news of this signal victory was received with
	      <lb/>universal satisfaction throughout the colonies; but
	      <lb/>the <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> still deemed it expedient to send
	      <lb/>forward the remainder of the troops which they
	      <lb/>had raised; and accordingly a hundred and twenty
	      <lb/>men, under the command of <persName>Captain Stoughton</persName>,
	      <lb/>sailed immediately for the <placeName>Pequod harbour</placeName>. <persName>Major
		<lb/>Atherton</persName>, determined not to desert the cause which
	      <lb/>he had espoused, rejoined <persName>Captain Mason</persName>, who,
	      <lb/>with forty men, effected a junction with <persName>Captain
		<lb/>Stoughton</persName>, accompanied also by several of the prin­
	      <lb/>cipal gentlemen of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>, who attended as

	    <p><persName>Sassacus</persName> in the mean time, hard pressed by the
	      <lb/>enemy, and insulted by his own subjects, who im­
	      <lb/>puted all their misfortunes to his haughtiness and
	      <lb/>temerity, finding it unsafe to remain longer in his
	      <lb/>dominions, destroyed the fort and wigwams, and
	      <lb/>with the feeble remnant of his once fierce and pow­
	      <lb/>erful tribe, retired to <placeName>Quinnipiack</placeName>, now <placeName>New-Ha­
		<lb/>ven</placeName>. Their extreme terror of the <name>English</name>, whom
	      <lb/>they had lately despised, deprived them of all reso­
	      <lb/>lution and forethought, and during their painful
	      <lb/>flight, these poor outcasts were reduced to the low­
	      <lb/>est degree of misery. They were obliged to dig for
	      <lb/>clams along the shores, and search the woods for
	      <lb/>roots to subsist upon; and being encumbered with
	      <lb/>women and children, the <name>English</name> were without dif­
	      <lb/>ficulty enabled to pursue them closely.</p>
	    <p>The <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> and <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName> troops pro­
	      <lb/>ceeded to <placeName>New-Haven</placeName> by land, the vessels coasting

	      <lb/>along the shore; and in three days arrived there
	      <lb/>without overtaking the <name>Pequods</name>, except a few strag­
	      <lb/>glers, whom they captured. Deceived by a smoke
	      <lb/>in the woods, which they supposed proceeded from
	      <lb/>the enemy's encampment, they hastily prepared for
	      <lb/>action; but soon discovering that it arose from fires
	      <lb/>kindled by the <name><rs type="properAdjective">Connecticut</rs> Indians</name>, they retired to
	      <lb/>their vessels, which lay at anchor in the harbour.
	      <lb/>They then sent forward one of the captives to re­
	      <lb/>connoitre, and he returned with intelligence that
	      <lb/>the <name>Pequods</name> were resting at a place about twenty
	      <lb/>miles distant, called <placeName>Unquowa</placeName>, since <placeName>Fairfield</placeName>.
	      <lb/>The <name>English</name> resumed their march with alacrity,
	      <lb/>and early in the afternoon, arrived at the desig­
	      <lb/>nated place. Several large corn-fields marked it
	      <lb/>as an <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> settlement, and ascending a hill, they
	      <lb/>observed a number of wigwams separated from them
	      <lb/>by an extensive morass thickly covered with trees
	      <lb/>and bushes. This dismal swamp was nearly di­
	      <lb/>vided in the middle, and in one part of it about an
	      <lb/>hundred <rs type="properAdjective">Pequod</rs> warriors, with their squaws and
	      <lb/>little ones, and nearly two hundred of the neigh­
	      <lb/>bouring <name>Indians</name> were gathered to conceal them­
	      <lb/>selves. The <name>English</name> entirely surrounded it so as
	      <lb/>to prevent the escape of any; but an unfortunate
	      <lb/>division arising among the officers, much time was
	      <lb/>consumed in debate, which might have been more
	      <lb/>profitably spent in action. An interpreter was
	      <lb/>however sent to parly with the <name>Indians</name>, and offer
	      <lb/>protection to such as had not done violence to the
	      <lb/><name>English</name>; and many gladly availed themselves of
	      <pb n="255"/>
	      <milestone unit="sig" n="22(6)r"/>
	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">255</mw>
	      <lb/>the offer. The Sachem of the place, at the head of
	      <lb/>his friendly <name>Indians</name>, delivered himself up, present­
	      <lb/>ing his garment of beaver-skin to conciliate their
	      <lb/>favour; and he was followed by many old men,
	      <lb/>women and children, in the whole amounting to
	      <lb/>upwards of two hundred.</p>
	    <p>But the <rs type="properAdjective">Pequod</rs> warriors, with undiminished spi­
	      <lb/>rit, disdained the offer of life, and declared their
	      <lb/>intention of defending themselves to the last mo­
	      <lb/>ment. <persName>Captain Mason</persName>, therefore, ordered the nar­
	      <lb/>row of the swamp to be cut through, and encircling
	      <lb/>it with his troops, they rested on their arms during
	      <lb/>the night. Just before day a thick fog arose, and
	      <lb/>the <name>Indians</name> taking advantage of it with their ter­
	      <lb/>rific yell, suddenly rushed upon <persName>Captain Patrick's</persName>
	      <lb/>quarters, and endeavoured to force their way through
	      <lb/>them. <persName>Captain Mason</persName> hearing the noise and con­
	      <lb/>fusion, sent a detachment to learn the cause, and
	      <lb/>give assistance, if necessary. But the tumult in­
	      <lb/>creasing, he raised the siege and repaired himself
	      <lb/>to the place, where he found <persName>Captain Patrick</persName> and
	      <lb/>his men bravely contending with a formidable num­
	      <lb/>ber, whom they had several times driven back to
	      <lb/>their covert. A few rounds of shot again obliged
	      <lb/>them to retreat; but they presently returned with
	      <lb/>irresistible violence upon the besiegers, and about
	      <lb/>seventy of the chief warriors burst through their
	      <lb/>intrenchment, and fled beyond the possibility of pur­
	      <lb/>suit. <persName>Sassacus</persName>, and the sachem <persName>Mononotto</persName> were
	      <lb/>among those who escaped. About twenty were
	      <lb/>killed in the skirmish, and a hundred and eighty of
	      <lb/>both sexes and every age were taken prisoners.

	      <lb/>This second victory was complete, and the brave
	      <lb/>and powerful tribe of <name>Pequods</name> was totally extermi­
	      <lb/>nated. Of the few who escaped, some took refuge
	      <lb/>with the <name>Mohawks</name>, and were slain by them, others
	      <lb/>were incorporated with the <name>Narragansets</name> and <name>Mo­
		<lb/>hegans</name>; their names became extinct, and their coun­
	      <lb/>try was alienated to the <name>English</name>.</p>
	    <p>This memorable, but almost forgotten contest,—
	      <lb/>however trifling it may appear in comparison with
	      <lb/>the more brilliant conquests of <placeName>Europe</placeName>, which have
	      <lb/>so often convulsed her fairest kingdoms, and deluged
	      <lb/>her fields with the blood of thousands of victims
	      <lb/>to her ambition or revenge,—was notwithstanding,
	      <lb/>productive of the most important consequences, and
	      <lb/>strikingly exhibits the firmness and courage of the
	      <lb/>early settlers of <placeName>New-England</placeName>. Indeed, consider­
	      <lb/>ing the weakness of the colonies, and their limited
	      <lb/>resources, and the strength and numbers of the
	      <lb/>enemy, their success appears almost miraculous;
	      <lb/>and under the smiles of Heaven can only be attri­
	      <lb/>buted to the prompt and cheerful exercise of that
	      <lb/>intrepid valour, which they brought with them from
	      <lb/>the land of free and heroic spirits.</p>
	    <p>The destruction of the <name>Pequods</name> filled the neigh­
	      <lb/>bouring <name>Indians</name> with such dread of the <name>English</name>,
	      <lb/>that they voluntarily sought their friendship, and
	      <lb/>for upwards of forty years, refrained from open
	      <lb/>hostilities against them; until the ambitious <persName>Philip</persName>
	      <lb/>of <placeName>Mount Hope</placeName>, by his insidious and revengeful
	      <lb/>conduct, tempted their wrath, and eventually in­
	      <lb/>volved himself in ruin.</p>

		<lb/>brook</placeName>, on the return of the army, and a due pro­
	      <lb/>portion given to <persName>Miantonimo</persName> and <persName>Uncas</persName>; the rest
	      <lb/>were distributed among the troops of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>
	      <lb/>and <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>. The wife and children of <persName>Mono­
		<lb/>notto</persName> were discovered with the captives, and in
	      <lb/>return for their kindness to the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> maidens,
	      <lb/>they were treated with the greatest attention and
	      <lb/>respect. The sweetness and modesty of <persName>Mioma's</persName>
	      <lb/>countenance and manners interested every one;
	      <lb/>and <persName>Major Atherton</persName> in particular, grateful for the
	      <lb/>protection she had extended to <persName>Miriam Grey</persName>, ex­
	      <lb/>erted himself to alleviate the misfortunes, which
	      <lb/>had overwhelmed her family and country. But
	      <lb/>whatever <persName>Mioma</persName> endured, it was in silence; not a
	      <lb/>murmur or a sigh escaped her; and though pensive
	      <lb/>and retiring, the loftiness of her spirit was still
	      <lb/>visible in her serene and dignified deportment.
	      <lb/><persName>Captain Mason</persName> in a letter to <persName>Governor Winthrop</persName>,
	      <lb/>recommended her to his particular care; and during
	      <lb/>the voyage to <placeName>Boston</placeName>, <persName>Major Atherton</persName> was entrusted
	      <lb/>with the charge of herself and children.</p>
	    <p>The troops of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName> and <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>
	      <lb/>took leave of each other with feelings of mutual
	      <lb/>good will and interest peculiar to brave men, who
	      <lb/>have been associated in scenes of danger and glory.
	      <lb/><persName>Major Atherton</persName> received the most gratifying ac­
	      <lb/>knowledgments of his personal bravery and mili­
	      <lb/>tary skill, in the conduct of the war; and impa­
	      <lb/>tient of a moment's delay, returned with <persName>Captain
		<lb/>Stoughton</persName> and his party to <placeName>Boston</placeName>, where they

	    <p><said>I could scarcely get rid of such a burthen so

		<lb/>good people of <placeName>Connecticut</placeName>.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Did you not have the command of this <rs type="properAdjective">Ply­
		<lb/>mouth</rs> reinforcement, Captain?</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>,
	      <lb/><said>or were your services required for the home de­
		<lb/>fence?</said></p>
	    <p><said>We find it will not do to leave any corner un­
		<lb/>guarded; for these treacherous villains to creep
		<lb/>into,</said> said the Captain; <said>though they have grown
		<lb/>rather shy of the guns of our battery, since some
		<lb/>of their heads were put up to garnish it; besides,
		<lb/>cousin <persName>Atherton</persName>, I am growing too old to go an hun­
		<lb/>dred miles or more to fight for my neighbours;
		<lb/>though while I can grasp a sword, it shall be wield­
		<lb/>ed to protect my own colony from insult.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I suspect, sir,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>you could keep
		<lb/>pace with the youngest of us now, even in march­
		<lb/>ing through the wilderness of the <placeName>Narraganset</placeName>,
		<lb/>which might put the strength of any one fairly to
		<lb/>the test.</said></p>
	    <p><said>My sinews are pretty flexible yet,</said> returned the

		<lb/>have had to sustain; but I have not so much use
		<lb/>for them now as I had, when fighting with our
		<lb/>brave <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> gallants, under the banners of good
		<lb/><persName>queen Bess</persName>, of blessed memory, to keep the <name>Dutch</name>
		<lb/>in possession of their dykes and ditches.</said></p>
	    <p><said>They say you shewed prodigious agility,</said> said
	      <lb/><persName>Peregrine</persName>, gravely, <said>when <persName>Mr. Calvert</persName>—</said></p>
	    <p><said>Your troublesome ears are always drinking in
		<lb/>idle tales,</said> interrupted the Captain, quickly; <said>but
		<lb/>it is no matter, boy, for no one thinks you are worth
		<lb/>minding.</said></p>
	    <p><said>A happy privilege,</said> returned <persName>Peregrine</persName>, <said>which
		<lb/>I shall use discreetly, as occasion may require.
		<lb/>But, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>, you have not yet asked us
		<lb/>what is going on at <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, and I am sure there
		<lb/>is, at least, one person there, whom you would be
		<lb/>glad to know something about.</said></p>
	    <p><said>There are many in whom I feel interested,</said> re­
	      <lb/>plied <persName>Atherton</persName>; <said>but I judged from your gay coun­
		<lb/>tenance, that no misfortune had befallen the place
		<lb/>or people, and I hope very soon to return there and
		<lb/>satisfy myself from personal observation.</said></p>
	    <p><said>We may go together then, perhaps,</said> said <persName>Pere­
		<lb/>grine</persName>, <said>I only remain here as a guard of honour to
		<lb/>the Captain; and I think he will release me, at a
		<lb/>moment's warning; the rest of our company re­
		<lb/>turned two or three days since, though I sought to
		<lb/>detain <persName>Master Ashly</persName> for my special amusement;
		<lb/>but he grew impatient to see his promised bride,
		<lb/>whom he was obliged to leave just as he had attain­
		<lb/>ed her smiling consent to be his.</said></p>

	    <p><said>Is <persName>Mr. Ashly</persName> married?</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>, chang­
	      <lb/>ing colour, <said>and may I know who is the happy ob­
		<lb/>ject of his choice?</said></p>
	    <p><said>It has been long known who he would choose,</said><lb/>replied <persName>Peregrine</persName>; <said rend="pre()">but perhaps you have not heard,
		<lb/><persName>Major Atherton</persName>, that <persName>Mr. Grey</persName> has returned from
		<lb/><placeName>England</placeName>, which is supposed to have hastened <persName>Ben­
		  <lb/>jamin Ashly</persName> into the bands of wedlock.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Hastened him,</said> said the Captain laughing, <said>be­
		<lb/>cause <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, like an honest man, refused to
		<lb/>compel his daughter to marry against her will; so
		<lb/><persName>Master Benjamin</persName>, finding there was no hope for
		<lb/>him in that quarter, turned his eyes on <persName>Mistress
		<lb/>Rebecca Spindle</persName>, who has been wooing him with
		<lb/>smiles every since she heard the joyful news, that
		<lb/><persName>Miriam Grey</persName> had rejected his addresses; they are
		<lb/>now married or will be soon, for the prudent spin­
		<lb/>ster, as I hear, did not take long to deliberate on
		<lb/>the propriety of obliging him.</said></p>
	    <p><said>A very suitable match, I should think,</said> said
	      <lb/><persName>Atherton</persName>, who felt greatly relieved by the Cap­
	      <lb/>tain's narration, <said>though the lady seems to have
		<lb/>some advantage over him, in point of age.</said></p>
	    <p><said>And experience too,</said> said <persName>Peregrine</persName>,<choice><sic>’</sic><corr/></choice>
	      <said rend="pre()">or she
		<lb/>would never have cajoled him into matrimony, with
		<lb/>such an untempting visage; he had better have
		<lb/>looked after a pretty laughing damsel, some twenty
		<lb/>or thirty years younger than himself, as <persName>Captain
		  <lb/>Standish</persName> and I intend to, one of these days; though

	    <p><said>And it would be right enough, too,</said> said the
	      <lb/>Captain, good-humouredly, and without appearing
	      <lb/>to notice his allusion. <said>If such sage persons as
		<lb/>you and I, <persName>Peregrine</persName>, who have been so long
		<lb/>schooled in the ways of the world, consent to play
		<lb/>with such mischievous beings, we ought not to com­
		<lb/>plain if they forget our dignity, and give us an
		<lb/>unlucky blow.—Ha, cousin <persName>Atherton</persName>, what say
		<lb/>you?</said></p>
	    <p><persName>Atherton</persName> started on hearing his name pronounc­
	      <lb/>ed, for he was at that moment thinking of <persName>Miriam
		<lb/>Grey</persName>, and drawing encouragement for his own
	      <lb/>hopes, from the lenity of her father. Following
	      <lb/>the train of thought, which led him back to her
	      <lb/>cheerful home, he replied without exactly under­
	      <lb/>standing the question.</p>
	    <p>
	      <said rend="post(”)">Go, sir,<choice><sic>’</sic><corr/></choice> I am ready at this moment, any time
		<lb/>when it may please you.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><persName>Captain Standish</persName> looked at him with a signifi­
	      <lb/>cant smile, and laying his hand on <persName>Atherton's</persName>
	      <lb/>shoulder, said,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>I see how it is with you, <persName>Edward</persName>; but bear up
		<lb/>a good heart, till we can storm the enemy in his
		<lb/>own quarters, and God willing, the prize shall be
		<lb/>yours at last. I have a snug little room at <persName>Master
			<lb/>Cole<choice><sic/><corr>'</corr></choice>s</persName>, so come with me now, and we will talk over
		<lb/>these matters at our leisure. I would learn some­
		<lb/>thing more about your friendly visit to <persName>Sassacus</persName>,
		<lb/>and his people, and the warm reception they gave
		<lb/>you,—to say nothing of your mad chase after <persName>Mi­
		  <lb/>riam Grey</persName>, which had like to have made a bon-fire
		<pb n="265"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="23(5)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">265</mw>
		<lb/>of you both—for which, craving your pardon, cou­
		<lb/>sin <persName>Atherton</persName>, I have ever since thought you deserv­
		<lb/>ed to be decked out with a cap and bells; for I
		<lb/>cannot learn that she was in any danger, till you
		<lb/>provoked the <name>Indians</name> to vengeance.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>I thought differently,</said> returned <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>and
		<lb/>I am mistaken, sir, if you would not have done ex­
		<lb/>actly as I did, had you been placed in the same cir­
		<lb/>cumstances.</said></p>
	    <p><said>It may be so,</said> said the Captain, <said>and I dare say
		<lb/>you did all for the best; but I would not have you
		<lb/>throw away your life, even for my little rose-bud,
		<lb/>if you could do her no good by it.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I suppose,</said> said <persName>Peregrine White</persName>, archly, <said>Ma­
		<lb/>jor <persName>Atherton</persName> chose to see with his own eyes; we
		<lb/>all know it is dangerous to intrust a third person,
		<lb/>in matters of importance, especially if there is a
		<lb/>fair damsel in the case.</said></p>
	    <p><persName>Captain Standish</persName> twirled his sword round with
	      <lb/>some violence, but made no reply; and after a mo­
	      <lb/>ment's embarrassing silence, <persName>Atherton</persName> said,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>As you are acquainted with <persName>Miriam's</persName> captivity,
		<lb/>you must have heard of her <rs type="properAdjective">Indian</rs> protectress;
		<lb/>she is amongst our prisoners, and I am charged to
		<lb/>place her in the hands of <persName>Governor Winthrop</persName>—so
		<lb/>I must beg you to excuse me, sir, while I execute my
		<lb/>commission.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>Go,</said> replied the Captain; <said>and you will find
		<lb/>me at the inn, whenever you choose to look for me.
		<lb/>And hark'ee, cousin <persName>Atherton</persName>, I should like to
		<lb/>have a peep at this said <persName>Mioma</persName>, as they call her,
		<pb n="266"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="23(5)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">266</mw>
		<lb/>myself; one would suppose she was a tawny angel
		<lb/>from my rose-bud's description, and, in truth, I
		<lb/>think she must have as good a heart as was ever
		<lb/>lodged in a heathen body, to shew such kindness to
		<lb/>her white captives.</said></p>
	    <p>As soon as <persName>Major Atherton</persName> had placed the wife
	      <lb/>and children of <persName>Mononotto</persName>, in the family of <persName>Mr.
		<lb/>Winthrop</persName>,—where they were treated with that de­
	      <lb/>licate attention, which generous and benevolent
	      <lb/>minds are ever ready to bestow on the unfortu­
	      <lb/>nate,—he became extremely impatient to return to
	      <lb/><placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, and decide the doubts and hopes which
	      <lb/>had so long agitated him, and on which his future
	      <lb/>plans, and as he thought, happiness entirely depend­
	      <lb/>ed. But he was obliged in courtesy to remain
	      <lb/>several days, as the Court of <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>
	      <lb/>had set apart a day of thanksgiving, to be observ­
	      <lb/>ed throughout the colony, for the signal victory
	      <lb/>obtained over the <name>Pequods</name>; on which occasion the
	      <lb/>officers, who had served in that campaign were
	      <lb/>invited to partake of a public dinner.</p>
	    <p>On the morning of the appointed day, the inha­
	      <lb/>bitants of <placeName>Boston</placeName> repaired to the meeting-house,
	      <lb/>and united their hearts in grateful praise to Him,
	      <lb/>who had given <quote>peace to their borders,</quote> and <quote>scat­
		<lb/>tered the heathen before them.</quote> When the devo­
	      <lb/>tional exercises were concluded, the magistrates of
	      <lb/>the town escorted the military officers to an inn,
	      <lb/>where a plentiful repast was prepared for them;
	      <lb/>and each individual seemed resolved to shew the
	      <lb/>abundance of his thankfulness, by partaking liber­
	      <pb n="267"/>

	      <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">267</mw>
	      <lb/>ally of the good things set before him. How grate­
	      <lb/>ful should we be, to our venerable ancestors, for
	      <lb/>transmitting to us, so ingenious and agreeable a
	      <lb/>mode of acknowledging our obligations to the he­
	      <lb/>roes and benefactors of our country, and of express­
	      <lb/>ing our gratitude to the Father of all, by eating to
	      <lb/>satiety of the bounties he has provided for us! A
	      <lb/>custom, still scrupulously observed, and almost the
	      <lb/>only one remaining of those worthy <name>Puritans</name>,
	      <lb/>which the liberality of the present age has thought
	      <lb/>proper to countenance and encourage!</p>
	    <p><said>These <placeName>Massachusetts</placeName>' people,</said> said <persName>Captain
		<lb/>Standish</persName>, to <persName>Atherton</persName>, after they had retired, <said>do
		<lb/>certainly <quote>strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel;</quote>
		<lb/>they have passed a law in their wisdom, forbidding
		<lb/>the drinking of healths, to save a man from the sin
		<lb/>of getting merry; and here, on this joyful day,
		<lb/>we have been sipping our wine like owls in a
		<lb/>church-yard, without a good wish to our king, our
		<lb/>country, or our Mistress, <persName>Edward</persName>. Now at this
		<lb/>very moment, they are fitting out a vessel, to send
		<lb/>the poor <rs type="properAdjective">Pequod</rs> women and children to <placeName>Bermuda</placeName>,
		<lb/>and sell them for slaves! May it be long before we,
		<lb/>of <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, imitate such humanity!</said></p>
	    <p><said>Impossible!</said> exclaimed <persName>Atherton</persName>, indignantly,
	      <lb/><said>What, sell the untamed children of the forest for
		<lb/>slaves? they, who are born free as the wild deer,
		<lb/>whom they pursue! do they hope to bend their
		<lb/>proud spirits to the yoke of bondage! they cannot
		<lb/>be so inhuman!</said></p>
	    <p><said>They hope to get money for them, I suppose,</said><pb n="268"/><milestone unit="sig" n="23(6)v"/><mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">268</mw><lb/>answered the Captain, drily. <said>They have already
		<lb/>tried to make servants of some, but they proved
		<lb/>too cunning and fleet of foot, and took to their
		<lb/>heels, without waiting to learn the customs of civi­
		<lb/>lized life. Cousin <persName>Atherton</persName>,</said> he added warmly,
	      <lb/><said>I know that I have been censured for my zeal
		<lb/>against these savages, who, if not made to feel and
		<lb/>fear, would have crushed our feeble colony in its
		<lb/>birth; but never has my sword been the instrument
		<lb/>of cruelty, or my counsel aided a plan so infamous,
		<lb/>as that of consigning human beings to a life of
		<lb/>slavery.</said></p>
	    <p><said>In whom,</said> asked <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>did this project
		<lb/>originate? Surely the rulers of a free and <rs type="properAdjective">chris­
		<lb/>tian</rs> people cannot sanction a practice, so inconsis­
		<lb/>tent with the benevolence of the gospel, and which
		<lb/>aims a deadly blow at the root of liberty.</said></p>
	    <p><said>The rulers alone, have the responsibility,</said> said
	      <lb/>the Captain; <said>and they have been so long exercis­
		<lb/>ed in the school of persecution, that it would seem
		<lb/>they have grown enamoured of its discipline, and
		<lb/>not content with instructing their own people, are
		<lb/>gathering in pupils from the wilderness of this new
		<lb/>world.</said></p>
	    <p><said><persName>Mioma</persName> and her children,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>I
		<lb/>trust are exempted from this cruel sentence; I would
		<lb/>purchase their freedom at the expence of my whole
		<lb/>patrimony.</said></p>
	    <p><said><persName>Governor Winthrop</persName> has promised to protect
		<lb/>them,</said> replied <persName>Captain Standish</persName>, <said>in return for
		<lb/>their kindness to the <rs type="properAdjective">English</rs> maidens. But we
		<pb n="269"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="24(1)r"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">269</mw>
		<lb/>must let them manage affairs in their own way;
		<lb/>and I believe they are in the main conscientious,
		<lb/>and mean to do <quote>God service,</quote> though sometimes
		<lb/>it turns out most unprofitable to men.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Well, we will leave them in charity,</said> said <persName>Ather­
		<lb/>ton</persName>, <said>and I confess to you, Captain, I feel very
		<lb/>impatient to return to <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, since there is no
		<lb/>longer any thing to detain us here.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I do not doubt your word, <persName>Edward</persName>,</said> returned
	      <lb/>the Captain, <said>and if the wind blows right in the
		<lb/>morning, we will spread our sailed and push gaily
		<lb/>into the good harbour, and we shall soon see, if a
		<lb/>certain damsel smiles encouragement on us.</said></p>
	    <p>Early on the following morning, <persName>Captain Stan­
		<lb/>dish</persName>, with <persName>Peregrine White</persName>, and <persName>Major Atherton</persName>
	      <lb/>left <placeName>Boston</placeName>; and towards the close of the day, ar­
	      <lb/>rived in safety at <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>. <persName>Atherton</persName> sprung
	      <lb/>first upon the shore, with a step too quick, and with
	      <lb/>hopes too buoyant, to wait the slower motions of
	      <lb/>his companions. As he looked round, with a lover's
	      <lb/>eye, on the scenes where he had imbibed and
	      <lb/>cherished a pure and exalted passion, connected
	      <lb/>as they were, with the image of her, who had in­
	      <lb/>spired it, and reposing in the calmness and beauty
	      <lb/>of a summer's evening, his heart bounded with plea­
	      <lb/>sure, and he fancied the serenity of the earth and
	      <lb/>heavens was propitious to his hopes, and a happy
	      <lb/>omen of success.</p>
	    <p>A few moments brought him to the house of <persName>Mr.
		<lb/>Grey</persName>; he paused an instant, under the spreading
	      <lb/>oak, where he had first listened to the voice of <persName>Mi­
		<mw type="vol" rend="align(left)indent(+1)case(allcaps)">Vol. II.</mw>

		<pb n="270"/>
		<milestone unit="sig" n="24(1)v"/>
		<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">270</mw>
		<lb/>riam</persName>; he inhaled the fragrance of her favourite
	      <lb/>sweet-briar; and the door around which it cluster­
	      <lb/>ed was open, and seemed inviting him to enter.
	      <lb/>With a trembling hand he opened the little wicket,
	      <lb/>and hastily approached the threshold. A brilliant
	      <lb/>twilight rendered every object distinct, and he
	      <lb/>quickly perceived <persName>Mr. Grey</persName> reclining in his elbow
	      <lb/>chair, and indulging the luxury of an evening pipe.
	      <lb/>Close beside him, sat his daughter, busied with her
	      <lb/>needle, and both were apparently so much engross­
	      <lb/>ed by their own reflections, that <persName>Atherton</persName> had
	      <lb/>entered before the sound of his steps aroused them.</p>
	    <p><persName>Miriam</persName> first observed him, and starting from her
	      <lb/>seat, she uttered an exclamation of joyful surprise,
	      <lb/>and again sunk upon the chair, while her varying
	      <lb/>complexion betrayed the strong agitation of her
	      <lb/>feelings. <persName>Atherton</persName> was in an instant beside her,
	      <lb/>and forgetful of every thing, but the pleasure of
	      <lb/>seeing her again, and in safety, without uttering a
	      <lb/>word, he pressed her hand to his lips, with the
	      <lb/>most impassioned tenderness. <persName>Miriam</persName> attempted
	      <lb/>to withdraw her hand, and her eyes were directed
	      <lb/>anxiously to her father. <persName>Atherton</persName> understood her
	      <lb/>meaning, and hastily turned to address him.</p>
	    <p><persName>Mr. Grey</persName> had risen, and stood regarding them
	      <lb/>with attention; <persName>Atherton</persName> thought without displea­
	      <lb/>sure. Encouraged, but still embarassed how to
	      <lb/>proceed, he was about to apologize, for his intru­
	      <lb/>sion, when <persName>Mr. Grey</persName> offered him his hand, and
	      <lb/>said,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said><persName>Major Atherton</persName>, I understand your feelings,
		<pb n="271"/><milestone unit="sig" n="24(2)r"/><mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">271</mw><lb/>and it is needless for you to excuse them; my pre­
		<lb/>sence was, perhaps, unexpected to you, and proba­
		<lb/>bly undesired.</said>
	    </p>
	    <p><said>Not undesired, sir,</said> said <persName>Atherton</persName> eagerly; <said>I
		<lb/>have long wished to see you; to reveal to you my
		<lb/>hopes; to entreat you to sanction my union with
		<lb/>your daughter.</said></p>
	    <p><said>Young man,</said> said <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, <said>do you know
		<lb/>what you ask of me? do you know that <persName>Miriam
		  <lb/>Grey</persName> is the daughter of a <name>Puritan</name>? that, from her
		<lb/>birth she has been devoted to the faith of her father,
		<lb/>nurtured in the principles of his persecuted church,
		<lb/>and taught to love the country of his adoption?</said></p>
	    <p><said>And I,</said> replied <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>am the son of a <name>puri­
		  <lb/>tan</name>, a <name>puritan</name> in principle and practice, who early
		<lb/>taught me to reverence her creed, and respect the
		<lb/>rights and consciences of those, who in sincerity
		<lb/>adopted it.</said></p>
	    <p><said>And yet,</said> said <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, <said>with the light of
		<lb/>truth before your eyes, you turned from it, and,
		<lb/>like <persName>Balaam</persName> of old, <quote>loved the wages of iniquity,</quote>
		<lb/>and clave unto the darkness and errors of <name>Episco­
		  <lb/>pacy</name>; and how can I be assured that you will not
		<lb/>turn aside my poor child from the true religion,
		<lb/>and entrap her in the false and subtle mazes of
		<lb/>your superstitious rites.</said></p>
	    <p><said>My honour, and the pure and ardent affection,
		<lb/>which I am proud to acknowledge for your daugh­

	      <lb/><said>Give me the hand of <persName>Miriam</persName>, and, from that mo­
		<lb/>ment, her country shall be mine, and her religion,

		<lb/>so far as it is consistent with my principles and con­
		<lb/>science. In the ordinary acts of worship I trust
		<lb/>our hearts will ever be united; more you cannot
		<lb/>require of me, nor even to obtain her love, dearly
		<lb/>as I prize it, would I consent to retract the faith
		<lb/>of my fathers, unless convinced it was erroneous.</said></p>
	    <p><said>I like your candour, <persName>Major Atherton</persName>,</said> said <persName>Mr.
		<lb/>Grey</persName>, after a moment's pause; <said>but are you assur­
		<lb/>ed that the affections of my daughter are already
		<lb/>given to you, and that only <emph>my</emph> consent is necessa­
		<lb/>ry to your union?</said></p>
	    <p><said>Sir,</said> replied <persName>Atherton</persName>, <said>I have every reason to
		<lb/>believe it; peculiar and trying circumstances re­
		<lb/>vealed our sentiments to each other, sooner per­
		<lb/>haps, than prudence would justify; but in justice
		<lb/>to <persName>Miriam</persName>, I must declare to you, that she has
		<lb/>uniformly discouraged my addresses, with a firm­
		<lb/>ness which principle and filial duty could alone
		<lb/>inspire.</said></p>
	    <p><said>My son,</said> answered <persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, with emotion,
	      <lb/><said>you have twice adventured your life to snatch my
		<lb/>daughter from peril and death, and I have long
		<lb/>examined myself, lest my gratitude as a father
		<lb/>should weaken my duty as a <name>christian</name>; but God
		<lb/>has inclined the heart of <persName>Miriam</persName> towards you,
		<lb/>and in submission to the will of Him, who <quote>lov­
		  <lb/>eth mercy rather than sacrifice,</quote> I entrust her
		<lb/>temporal and eternal happiness to your keeping;
		<lb/>and may the spirit of truth enlighten your under­
		<lb/>standing, and lead you to embrace that pure
		<lb/><quote>faith which was once delivered to the saints.</quote></said></p>

	    <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName>, overwhelmed by this almost
	      <lb/>unhoped for consent to his wishes, remained si­
	      <lb/>lent, for a moment, and unable to express his
	      <lb/>grateful acknowledgments. He looked round for
	      <lb/><persName>Miriam</persName>, but she had retired at the commence­
	      <lb/>ment of their conversation, and <persName>Mr. Grey</persName> led the
	      <lb/>way to an adjoining apartment, which was occu­
	      <lb/>pied only by the object of their search. <persName>Miriam</persName>
	      <lb/>cast a timid look at her lover and father, as they
	      <lb/>entered with countenances agitated by different
	      <lb/>emotions; and a deeper blush crimsoned her cheeks,
	      <lb/>as she met the eyes of <persName>Atherton</persName>, beaming with a
	      <lb/>tenderness and pleasure which at once announced
	      <lb/>his success. She rose as they drew near her, and
	      <lb/><persName>Mr. Grey</persName>, taking her passive hand, placed it in
	      <lb/><persName>Atherton's</persName>, and laying his own on the head of each,
	      <lb/>said, with solemn emphasis,—</p>
	    <p>
	      <said>My children, I give you to each other; and
		<lb/>may the blessing of the God of love descend upon
		<lb/>you, and unite your hearts in his fear and ser­
		<lb/>vice; and may he bless you, in <quote>your basket and in
		  <lb/>your store, in your going out and your coming
		  <lb/>in;</quote> and make your lives useful and happy, until
		<lb/>in his own good time, he shall see fit to call you
		<lb/>unto <quote>his eternal rest.</quote></said>
	    </p>
	    <p>So saying he slowly folded his arms, and re­
	      <lb/>tired from the room, leaving the lovers to the un­
	      <lb/>interrupted indulgence of those new and happy
	      <lb/>emotions, which his unexpected consent had awak­
	      <lb/>ened.</p>
	    <p><choice><sic>‘</sic><corr/></choice>It is probable many tender things were said,
	      <pb n="274"/><milestone unit="sig" n="24(3)v"/><mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">274</mw><lb/>and many important articles arranged, on that
	      <lb/>occasion; for on the following <name>Sabbath</name> the banns of
	      <lb/>marriage were published, in compliance with an
	      <lb/>early law of <placeName>New-England</placeName>,—which is still en­
	      <lb/>forced, to the great embarassment of all modest
	      <lb/>persons, who are about to put on the happy chains
	      <lb/>of matrimony.</p>
	    <p>This public confirmation of an event, which had
	      <lb/>long been agitated, greatly scandalized many
	      <lb/>worthy people, who had not till then, believed the
	      <lb/>exemplary <persName>Mr. Grey</persName> could be so utterly given
	      <lb/>over to the <quote>buffetings of Satan,</quote> as to sacrifice
	      <lb/>his only child to a son of <name>Episcopacy</name>,—one who
	      <lb/>had faith in the mother church, and kneeled to
	      <lb/>repeat prayers from a printed book, read by a
	      <lb/>Bishop in lawn sleeves.</p>
	    <p><said>I would not believe it,</said> said <persName>Mrs. Ashly</persName>,
	      <lb/>alias <persName>Rebecca Spindle</persName>, <said>truly our <quote>hedges are
		  <lb/>broken down,</quote> and <quote>grevious wolves have entered
		  <lb/>into the fold, and are leading our lambs astray.</quote></said></p>
	    <p><said>You are right, <persName>Rebecca</persName>,</said> answered her com­
	      <lb/>plaisant spouse; <said>and had the damsel <persName>Miriam
		  <lb/>Grey</persName> listened unto me, she would have chosen a
		<lb/>yoke-fellow from the Lord's own people, instead
		<lb/>of this <quote>strange vine from <placeName>Egypt</placeName>.</quote></said></p>
	    <p><said>It is no concern of ours, to be sure,</said> said the
	      <lb/>wife; <said>but to me, it seems a clear tempting of
		<lb/>Providence, and in special after its great mercy
		<lb/>in delivering her from the hands of the heathen;
		<lb/>but she was ever a giddy young thing, as I have
		<lb/>often told you, <persName>Benjamin</persName>.</said></p>

	    <p><said>I have always found her discreet and prudent,
		<lb/>save in one instance,</said> returned <persName>Master Ashly</persName>,
	      <lb/><said>and when she has attained your age and expe­
		<lb/>rience <persName>Rebecca</persName>, I doubt not she will repent her of
		<lb/>this great evil.</said></p>
	    <p><said>It may be so,</said> answered <persName>Rebecca</persName>, mildly;—for
	      <lb/>the honey-moon was not yet in its wane; <said><quote>but as
		  <lb/>she has sowed, so must she reap,</quote> and I fear <persName>Ben­
		  <lb/>jamin</persName>, it will be in tears.</said></p>
	    <p>Fortunately the fears of <persName>Mrs. Ashly</persName> were not
	      <lb/>realized. The union of <persName>Major Atherton</persName> and <persName>Mi­
		<lb/>riam Grey</persName>, proved lasting and happy. Time as
	      <lb/>it rolled on and withered the graces of youth, left
	      <lb/>them in possession of the richer treasures of vir­
	      <lb/>tuous and contented minds; and the endearing rela­
	      <lb/>tions of domestic and social life. <persName>Atherton's</persName> attach­
	      <lb/>ment to the primitive habits of <placeName>New-England</placeName> daily
	      <lb/>strengthened, and familiarized to its simple mode
	      <lb/>of worship, he became eventually a sincere, but
	      <lb/>liberal <name>Puritan</name>.</p>
	    <p>Shortly after his marriage, <persName>Mioma</persName> and her
	      <lb/>children were received into his family; and the
	      <lb/>grateful affection of <persName>Miriam</persName> was exerted to re­
	      <lb/>pay the kindness they had shewn her, and to
	      <lb/>lighten the yoke of captivity, which was peculiar­
	      <lb/>ly galling to the lofty spirit of <persName>Mioma</persName>. The per­
	      <lb/>secuted remnant of the <name>Pequod Indians</name>, who es­
	      <lb/>caped the destruction of their nation, finding that
	      <lb/><quote>every man's hand was against them,</quote> in the au­
	      <lb/>tumn repaired to <placeName>Hartford</placeName> to seek protection from
	      <lb/>the <name>English</name>, which was granted them on condi­

	      <lb/>tion of their paying an annual tribute. <persName>Cushmi­
		<lb/>naw</persName> perished in the fight of <placeName>Mistick</placeName>; and of the
	      <lb/>chief Sachems of his haughty tribe, <persName>Mononotto</persName>
	      <lb/>alone survived. He was rejoined by his family
	      <lb/>soon after the treaty at <placeName>Hartford</placeName>, and forbidden to
	      <lb/>return to his own country, retired with them to
	      <lb/>the banks of the <placeName>Hudson</placeName>.</p>
	    <p><persName>Major Atherton</persName>, in the following year, revisited
	      <lb/>his native land, but the ties which once bound him
	      <lb/>to it were weakened by absence, and the influence
	      <lb/>of that party spirit, which was then preparing the
	      <lb/>way for those bloody scenes, which terminated in
	      <lb/>the death of the unfortunate <persName>Charles</persName>. He dis­
	      <lb/>posed of his paternal inheritance, and returned to
	      <lb/><placeName>America</placeName>, where his affections were entirely con­
	      <lb/>centrated.</p>
	    <p><persName>Mr. Grey</persName> lived to enjoy a green old age, and
	      <lb/>saw a new generation rising up to take the place
	      <lb/>of their fathers, and hand down to their children's
	      <lb/>children those principles of civil and religious
	      <lb/>freedom, which guided the <name>Pilgrims</name> to the <placeName>Rock of
		<lb/>Plymouth.</placeName></p>
