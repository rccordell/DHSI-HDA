	  <lb/>of the public, a book containing productions of an interest­
	  <lb/>ing young authoress. The occasion is one relatively of
	  <lb/>importance, and certainly of great interest to myself.</p>
        <p>I am not in the habit of introducing myself or others to
	  <lb/>notice by the adjective <mentioned rend="pre(“)post(”)">colored,</mentioned> &amp;c., but it seems proper
	  <lb/>that I should just say here, that my authoress is a colored
	  <lb/>lady, a member of my church, of pleasing piety and
	  <lb/>modest worth.</p>
        <p>The book contains her own thoughts, expressed in her
	  <lb/>own way. The best way to do justice to young writers,
	  <lb/>is to weigh their thoughts without so strict a regard to
	  <lb/>their style as we should pay in the case of elder writers.</p>
        <p>The matter of this book is miscellaneous, in <mcr rend="slant(italic)">prose</mcr> and
	  <lb/><mcr rend="slant(italic)">poetry</mcr>. The topics are judiciously selected, and it must
	  <lb/>be pleasing to the friends of youthful piety to see that
	  <lb/>religion is placed first; and the more so when it is known,
	  <lb/>that in this, the writer has followed her <emph>renewed</emph> turn of
	  <lb/>mind. The article on religion is full of piety and good
	  <lb/>sense.</p>

        <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">xviii</mw>
        <p>This is itself a high commendation to the book. It
	  <lb/>contains the pious sentiments of a youth devoted to the
	  <lb/>glory of God, and the best good of her readers. This is
	  <lb/>an example worthy to be imitated. I know of <choice><sic>k</sic><corr/></choice>nothing
	  <lb/>more praise-worthy than to see one of such promise come
	  <lb/>before the public, with the religion of Christ uppermost in
	  <lb/>her mind. It will be well for our cause when many such
	  <lb/>can be found among us. In her biographical sketches, she
	  <lb/>shows in a very interesting way, her <emph>social</emph> piety. She has
	  <lb/>paid a just tribute to the memory of a number of her
	  <lb/>departed companions. This has been well conceived.
	  <lb/>Departed worth deserves permanent tributes. If they
	  <lb/>were youth, what is more fit than that their surviving
	  <lb/>youthful companions should pay those tributes?</p>
        <p>My authoress has a taste for poetry. And this is much
	  <lb/>to the advantage of any one who makes an effort in this
	  <lb/>difficult part of literature. The opinion has too far pre­
	  <lb/>vailed, that the talent for poetry is <emph>exclusively</emph> the legacy of
	  <lb/>nature. Nature should not be charged of withholding her
	  <lb/>blessings, when the only cause of our barrenness is our
	  <lb/>own indolence. There is no doubt that the talent for
	  <lb/>poetry is in a high degree <emph>attainable</emph>. My authoress has
	  <lb/>evinced her belief in this position. She is willing to be
	  <lb/>judged by the candid, and even to run the hazard of being
	  <lb/>severely dealt with by the critic, in order to accomplish
	  <lb/>something for the credit of her people. She has done well
	  <lb/>by what nature has done for her, in trying what art will
	  <lb/>add. The fact is, this is the only way to show the fallacy
	  <lb/>of that stupid theory, that <soCalled rend="slant(italic)">nature has done nothing but fit us
	    <lb/>for slaves, and that art cannot unfit us for slavery!</soCalled></p>
        <p>My authoress has followed the example of <persName ref="p:pwheatley.boe">Philis
	    <lb/>Wheatly</persName>, and of <persName ref="p:terence.nea">Terence</persName>, and <persName>Capitain</persName>, and <persName ref="p:fwilliams.jya">Francis
	    <lb/>Williams</persName>, her compatriots.</p>
        <p>These all served in adversity, and afterwards found that
<pb n="vii"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">xix</mw>
	  <lb/>nature had no <emph>objection</emph>, at least, to their serving the world
	  <lb/>in high repute as poets. She, like as <persName ref="p:pwheatley.boe">Philis Wheatly</persName> was,
	  <lb/>is passionately fond of reading, and delights in searching
	  <lb/>the Holy Scriptures; and is now rapidly improving in
	  <lb/>knowledge.</p>
        <p>Should her book which is here offered, meet with due
	  <lb/>encouragement, her talents will receive an impetus which
	  <lb/>will amply repay her patrons, and the generation in which
	  <lb/>she lives.</p>
        <p>To those with whom my authoress is more particularly
	  <lb/>identified, I must remark, that so far from having a pre­
	  <lb/>tence to disparage her book, we have many considerations
	  <lb/>which enforce the obligation to give it a prompt and ready
	  <lb/>patronage. To some of these I beg leave to advert, in
	  <lb/>conclusion.</p>
        <p><label>1.</label> Young writers are always in <emph>peculiar need of patro­
	    <lb/>nage</emph> to enable them to set out in a successful and useful
	  <lb/>career. It is often the case, that their fortune turns upon
	  <lb/>their first attempt, and that they fail, not so much for
	  <lb/>want of merit, as for want of that patronage which their
	  <lb/>merit deserves.</p>
        <p>Elder writers, in general, have gained a reputation, and
	  <lb/>therefore have this acquisition to augment their chance
	  <lb/>for patronage in any particular effort. But the young
	  <lb/>writer has no such capital to begin with. In their first
	  <lb/>effort for patronage the odds is against them, since they
	  <lb/>have, at the same time, to try for reputation. Under
	  <lb/>these circumstances they more naturally look to those
	  <lb/>whose sympathies <emph>ought</emph> to be in favor of their success.</p>
        <p><label>2.</label> From the above general principle, our young
	  <lb/>authoress justly appeals to <emph>us</emph>, her own people, (though not
	  <lb/>exclusively,) to give her success. I say the appeal is
	  <lb/><emph>just</emph>. And it is just because her success will, relatively, be
	  <lb/>our own. A mutual effort is the legitimate way to secure
<pb n="viii"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="1(2)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">xx</mw>
	  <lb/>mutual success. <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, <placeName>Greece</placeName> and <placeName>Rome</placeName>, successively,
	  <lb/>gave their own authors success, and by a very natural
	  <lb/>consequence, the reputation which they secured to their
	  <lb/>authors became their own. The history of the arts and
	  <lb/>sciences is the history of individuals, of individual nations.
	  <lb/>When <placeName>Egypt</placeName> was a school for the world, all the <name>Egyptians</name>
	  <lb/>were not teachers of the arts and sciences. The <name>Romans</name>
	  <lb/>were not all <name>Ciceros</name>, nor were the <name>Greeks</name> all <name>Homers</name>, or
	  <lb/><name>Platos</name>. But as <placeName>Greece</placeName> had a <name>Plato</name> why may we not have
	  <lb/>a <name>Platoess</name>?</p>
        <p><label>3.</label> This book has a claim upon our youth, and especial­
	  <lb/>ly those of the writers own sex. She has a large heart
	  <lb/>full of chaste and pious affection for those of her own age
	  <lb/>and sex; and this affection is largely interspersed over the
	  <lb/>pages of her book. If you will reciprocate this affection
	  <lb/>you will, I doubt not, read this book with pleasure and
	  <lb/>profit. With these remarks, and my best wishes to you
	  <lb/>and our authoress, I close, that you may pass on to her
	  <lb/>own pages, and read for your improvement.</p>

          <p>The religon of Christ not only arms us with
	    <lb/>fortitude against the approach of evil, but sup­
	    <lb/>posing evils to fall upon us with the heaviest press­
	    <lb/>ure, it lightens the load by many consolations to
	    <lb/>which others are strangers. While bad men trace
	    <lb/>in the calamities with which they are visited, the 
	    <lb/>hand of an offended Sovereign, <name>Christians</name> are 
	    <lb/>taught to view them as well-intended chastisements
	    <lb/>of a mericful father. They hear, amidst them,
	    <lb/>that still voice which a good conscience brings to
	    <lb/>their ear: <quote>Fear not, for I am with thee; be not
	      <lb/>dismayed, for I am thy God.</quote></p>
          <p>Where can the soul find refuge but in the bosom
	    <lb/>of religon?  There she is admitted to those pros­
	    <lb/>pects of providence and futurity which alone can
	    <lb/>warm and fill the heart. Lift up thy head, O
	    <lb/><name>Christian</name>, and look forward to yon calm, uncloud­
	    <lb/>ed regions of mercy, unfilled by vapors, unruffled by 
	    <lb/>storms—where celestial friendship, the loveliest
	    <lb/>form in Heaven, never dies, never changes, never
	    <lb/>cools!  Soon thou shalt burst this brittle earthly
	    <lb/>poison of the body, break the fetter of mortality,
	    <lb/>spring to endless life, and mingle with the skies.</p>
          <p>How many of us are able to say that we are

	      <lb/>man is satisfied from himself;</quote> he despises not the
	    <lb/>advantages of fortune, but he centers not his hap­
	    <lb/>piness in them. With a moderate share of them
	    <lb/>he can be contented; and contentment is felicity.
	    <lb/>Happy in his own integrity, conscious of the es­
	    <lb/>teem of good men, reposing firm trust in provi­
	    <lb/>dence, and the promises of God, he is exempted
	    <lb/>from servile dependence on other things. He can
	    <lb/>wrap himself up in a good conscience, and look
	    <lb/>forward, without terror, to the change of the
	    <lb/>world. Let all things fluctuate around him as
	    <lb/>they please, that by the Divine ordination, they
	    <lb/>shall be made to work together in the issue, for his
	    <lb/>good; and, therefore, having much to hope from 
	    <lb/>God, and little to fear from the world, he can be
	    <lb/>easy in every state. One who possesses within
	    <lb/>himself such an establishment of mind, is truly
	    <lb/>free.</p>
          <p>The character of God, as Supreme Ruler of the
	    <lb/>world, demands our supreme reverence, and our
	    <lb/>cordial and entire obedience to his will. Hence
	    <lb/>proceeds our duty to worship him; for worship,
	    <lb/>external acts of homage, are the means of pre­
	    <lb/>serving, in our minds that fear and reverence, a
	    <lb/>spirit of obedience. Neglect of worshiping God
	    <lb/>is inevitably followed by forgetfulness of God, and
	    <lb/>by consequence, a loss of the reverence for his au­
	    <lb/>thority, which prompts to obedience. We know
	    <lb/>that God is love; and love among men is the <emph rend="slant(italic)">ful­
	      <lb/>filment of the law</emph>. Love is the principal source
	    <lb/>of other virtues, and of all genuine happiness.
	    <lb/>From a supreme love to God, and from a full per­
	    <lb/>suasion of his perfect benevolence and almighty
	    <lb/>power, springs <emph rend="slant(italic)">confidence</emph>—a trusting in him for
<pb n="006"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="1(5)v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">24</mw>
	    <lb/>protection, for safety, for support, and for final
	    <lb/>salvation. This confidence in God, springing from
	    <lb/>love, implying cordial aprobation of his character,
	    <lb/>and obedience to his gospel, is <mcr rend="slant(italic)"><name>Christian</name> faith</mcr>.
	    <lb/>This is the <emph>anchor of the soul, sure</emph> and <emph>steadfast</emph>; 
	    <lb/>the foundation of the <name>Christian's</name> hope; it is this
	    <lb/>alone which sustains the good man amidst all the
	    <lb/>storms of life, and enables him to meet adversity,
	    <lb/>in all its forms, with firmness and tranquility.</p>
          <p>It is impossible to love God without desiring to
	    <lb/>please him, and as far as we are able, to resemble
	    <lb/>him; therefore, the love of God must lead to every
	    <lb/>virtue, in the highest degree. We may be sure we
	    <lb/>do not truly love him, if we content ourselves with
	    <lb/>avoiding flagrant sins, and not strive, in good
	    <lb/>earnest, to reach the greatest degree of perfection
	    <lb/>of which we are capable. Thus do these few words
	    <lb/>direct us to the highest <name>Christian</name> virtue. Indeed,
	    <lb/>the whole tenor of the gospel is to offer us every
	    <lb/>help, direction and motive that can enable us to
	    <lb/>attain that degree of faith, on which depends our
	    <lb/>eternal good.</p>
          <p>There are many circumstances in our situation
	    <lb/>that peculiarly require the support of religion to
	    <lb/>enable us to act in them with spirit and propriety.
	    <lb/>Our whole life is often a life of suffering. We can
	    <lb/>not engage in business, or dissipate ourselves in
	    <lb/>pleasure and riot as irreligious men too often do:
	    <lb/>We must bear our sorrows in silence, unknown and
	    <lb/>unpitied. We must often put on a face of serenity
	    <lb/>and cheerfulness when our hearts are torn with an­
	    <lb/>guish, or sinking in despair.</p>
          <p>There is not, in my opinion, a more pleasing and
	    <lb/>triumphant consideration in religion, that this:
<pb n="007"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="1(6)r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(outside)">25</mw>
	    <lb/>of the perpetual progress which the soul makes
	    <lb/>towards the perfection of its nature, without ever
	    <lb/>arriving at a period in it. To look upon the soul
	    <lb/>as going on from strength to strength to consider
	    <lb/>that she is to shine forever with new accessions of
	    <lb/>glory, and, brighten to all eternity; that she will
	    <lb/>be adding virtue to virtue, and knowledge to knowl­
	    <lb/>edge; carries in it something wonderfully agreea­
	    <lb/>ble to that ambition which is natural to the mind
	    <lb/>of man. Nay, it must be pleasing to God him­
	    <lb/>self, to see his creation forever beautifying in his
	    <lb/>eyes, and drawing nearer to him by greater de­
	    <lb/>grees of resemblance. With what astonishment
	    <lb/>and veneration may we look into God's own word,
	    <lb/>where there are such hidden stores of virtue and
	    <lb/>knowledge, such inexhaustable sources of perfec­
	    <lb/>tion! We know not yet what we shall be; nor
	    <lb/>has it ever entered into the heart of man to conceive
	    <lb/>the glory that will be always in reserve for him.</p>
          <p>Thus make our lives glide on serenely; and
	    <lb/>when the angel of death receives his commission
	    <lb/>to put a period to our existence, may we receive
	    <lb/>the summons with tranquility, and pass without
	    <lb/>fear the gloomy valley which separates time from
	    <lb/>eternity. May we remember that this life is
	    <lb/>nothing more than a short duration, a prelude to
	    <lb/>another, which will never have an end.</p>
          <p>Happy thou to whom the present life has no

	    <lb/>good education without religion. A good educa­
	    <lb/>tion is that which prepares us for our future sphere
	    <lb/>of action and makes us contented with that situa­
	    <lb/>tion in life in which God, in his infinite mercy, has
	    <lb/>seen fit to place us, to be perfectly resigned to our
	    <lb/>lot in life, whatever it may be. Religion has been
	    <lb/>decreed as the passion of weak persons; but the
	    <lb/>Bible tells us <quote>to seek first the kingdom of heaven,
	      <lb/>and His righteousness, and all other things shall be 
	      <lb/>added unto us.</quote> This world is only a place to pre­
	    <lb/>pare for another and a better.</p>
          <p>If it were not for education, how would our
	    <lb/>heathen be taught therefrom? While science and 
	    <lb/>the arts boast so many illustrious names; there is
	    <lb/>another and more extended sphere of action where
	    <lb/>illustrious names and individual effort has been
	    <lb/>exerted with the happiest results, and their au­
	    <lb/>thors, by their deeds of charity, have won bright
	    <lb/>and imperishable crowns in the realms of bliss.
	    <lb/>Was it the united effort of nations, or of priestly
	    <lb/>synods that first sent the oracles of eternal truth
	    <lb/>to the inhospitable shores of <placeName>Greenland</placeName>—or
	    <lb/>placed the lamp of life in the hut of the <name>Esque­
	    <lb/>maux</name>— or carried a message of love to the burn­
	    <lb/>ing climes of <placeName>Africa</placeName>—or that directed the deluded
	    <lb/>votaries of idolatry in that benighted land where
	    <lb/>the <placeName>Ganges</placeName> rolls its consecrated waters, to <placeName>Calva­
	      <lb/>ry's</placeName> Sacrifice, a sacrifice that sprinkled with blood
	    <lb/>the throne of justice, rendering it accessible to ru­
	    <lb/>ined, degraded man.</p>
          <p>In proportion to the education of a nation, it is
	    <lb/>rich and powerful. To behold the wealth and
	    <lb/>power of <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>, and compare it with <placeName>Chi­

	    <lb/>ideas of the latter, how narrow their conceptions,
	    <lb/>and are, as it were in an unknown world.</p>
          <p>Education is a system which the bravest men
	    <lb/>have followed. What said <persName ref="p:alexander.neu">Alexander</persName> about this?
	    <lb/>Said he: <quote>I am more indebted to my tutor, <persName ref="p:aristotle.mdp">Aris­
<lb/>totle</persName>, than to my father <persName ref="p:philip.tqm">Philip</persName>; for <persName ref="p:philip.tqm">Philip</persName> gives
	      <lb/>me my living, but <persName ref="p:aristotle.mdp">Aristotle</persName> teaches me how to
	      <lb/>live.</quote> It was <persName ref="p:inewton.els">Newton</persName> that threw aside the dim­
	    <lb/>ness of uncertainty which shrouded for so many
	    <lb/>centuries the science of astronomy; penetrated
	    <lb/>the arena of nature, and soared in his eagle-flight
	    <lb/>far, far beyond the wildest dreams of all former
	    <lb/>ages, defining with certainty the motions of those
	    <lb/>flaming worlds, and assigning laws to the fartherest
	    <lb/>star that lies on the confines of creation—that
	    <lb/>glimmers on the verge of immensity.</p>
          <p>Knowledge is the very foundation of wealth, and
	    <lb/>of nations. <persName ref="p:aristotle.mdp">Aristotle</persName> held unlimited control over
	    <lb/>the opinions of men for fifteen centuries, and gov­
	    <lb/>erned the empire of mind where ever he was
	    <lb/>known. For knowledge, men brave every danger,
	    <lb/>they explore the sandy regions of <placeName>Africa</placeName>, and di­
	    <lb/>minish the arena of contention and bloodshed.
	    <lb/>Where ever ignorance holds unlimited sway, the
	    <lb/>light of science, and the splendor of the gospel
	    <lb/>of truth is obscure and nearly obliterated by
	    <lb/>the gloom of monkish superstition, merged in the
	    <lb/>sable hues of idolatry and popish cruelty; no
	    <lb/>ray of glory shines on those degraded minds;
	    <lb/><quote>darkness covers the earth, and gross darkness
	      <lb/>the people.</quote></p>

	    <lb/>symmetry of his form, or in the exquisite structure
	    <lb/>of his complicated physical machinery; capable of
	    <lb/>intellectual and moral powers. What have been 
	    <lb/>the conquests of men in the field of general sci­
	    <lb/>ence? What scholastic intrenchment is there
	    <lb/>which man would not have wished to carry—what
	    <lb/>height is there which he would not have wished to 
	    <lb/>survey—what depth that he would not like to ex­
	    <lb/>plore?—even the mountains and the earth—hid­
	    <lb/>den minerals—and all that rest on the borders of
	    <lb/>creation he would like to overpower.</p>
          <p>But shall these splendid conquests be subverted?
	    <lb/><placeName>Egypt</placeName>, that once shot over the world brilliant rays
	    <lb/>of genius, is sunk in darkness. The dust of ages
	    <lb/>sleeps on the besom of Roman warriors, poets, and
	    <lb/>orators. The glory of <placeName>Greece</placeName> has departed, and

	    <lb/>quence, or <persName ref="p:homer.nee">Homer</persName> to soar and sing.</p>
          <p>It is certainly true that many dull and unprom­
	    <lb/>ising scholars have become the most distinguished
	    <lb/>men; as <persName ref="p:jmilton.kta">Milton</persName>, <persName ref="p:inewton.els">Newton</persName>, <persName ref="p:wscott.edy">Walter Scott</persName>, <persName ref="p:aclarke.fgn">Adam

	    <lb/>quired by mental discipline. Hence, we perceive
	    <lb/>that the mind is capable of wonderful improve­
	    <lb/>ment. The mother of <persName ref="p:wjones.qom">Sir William Jones</persName> said to

          <p>How altogether important, then, is education;
	    <lb/>it is our guide in youth, and it will walk with us in

          <p>A good education is another name for happiness.

          <p>We ought not to fail to combine with our clear

	    <lb/>your youthful amusements, may no unfeelingness be
	    <lb/>found. Engrave on your minds the sacred rule
	    <lb/>of <quote>doing unto others as you would wish them to
	      <lb/>do unto you.</quote> For this end, impress yourselves
	    <lb/>with a deep sense of the original and natural
	    <lb/>equality of men.</p>
          <p>True benevolence ought to reign in every per­
	    <lb/>son; it does not shut our eyes to the distinction
	    <lb/>between good and bad persons, or between one
	    <lb/>nation and another, or between two stations; or
	    <lb/>to warm the heart unequally to those who befriend
	    <lb/>us, and those who injure us. It reserves our
	    <lb/>esteem for good and bad men, and our complacency
	    <lb/>for our friends.</p>
          <p>Towards our enemies it inspires forgiveness, 
	    <lb/>humanity, and a solicitude for their welfare. It
	    <lb/>breathes universal candor, and liberality of senti­
	    <lb/>ment. It forms gentleness of temper, and dic­
	    <lb/>tates affability of manners. If human under­
	    <lb/>standing apprehends any thing according to truth
	    <lb/>and right, the <emph>benevolent</emph> character is the proper
	    <lb/>object of the love of every rational mind, as the
	    <lb/>contrary is the natural object of aversion. Every
	    <lb/>human, or other finite mind, is more or less amia­
	    <lb/>ble, according as it has more or less of this excel­
	    <lb/>lent disposition; it is evident that infinite goodness
	    <lb/>is infinitely amiable.</p>
          <p>True benevolence and humility are always ac­
	    <lb/>ceptable, and always knows. We ought not to do
	    <lb/>any thing benevolently, from vanity, or a desire
	    <lb/>of having our deeds known or applauded. Strive
	    <lb/>to remember those benevolent and immortal men
	    <lb/>who have done so much good in our country, and

	    <lb/>death shall have put an end to their labors, and
	    <lb/>their works.</p>
          <p>Think of the benevolent and immortal <persName ref="p:jhoward.uoe">John 
	      <lb/>Howard</persName>, putting pleasure far from him, to the
	    <lb/>intention of promoting good. <persName ref="p:jelliot.sgp">John Elliot</persName> devoted
	    <lb/>his days to the instruction of the poor <name>Indians</name>.
	    <lb/>And ever regardless of his own wants, supplied
	    <lb/>others, and neglected himself.</p>
          <p>We ought not one of us ever to be weary in
	    <lb/>well doing. But feel, and esteem it necessary
	    <lb/>for us to do good, in what shape soever it calls
	    <lb/>upon us. It is the duty of the young, as well as
	    <lb/>those who are grown up, to study the best means
	    <lb/>of relieving the destitute.</p>
          <p>To remove ignorance is an important branch of
	    <lb/>benevolence. To distribute or lend useful, and 
	    <lb/>religious books, is an important branch of benev­
	    <lb/>olence. For what is better than instructing the
	    <lb/>mind: it is certainly better than giving money or
	    <lb/>clothes, which soon pass away, and may be 
	    <lb/>misused.</p>
          <p>I have known Ladies forming themselves into
	    <lb/>a society, for the purpose of assisting the poor;
	    <lb/>and have done much good in the undertaking.
	    <lb/>The young should always solicit the advice of
	    <lb/>their parents, or older friends, in their charities;
	    <lb/>for they may bestow charity without consideration.
	    <lb/>The relief of the poor require more knowledge of
	    <lb/>mankind, than those whose years are few, can be
	    <lb/>expected to possess.</p>
          <p>There was a gentleman, who was esteemed high
	    <lb/>in the Courts of our land, who was rich in posses­
	    <lb/>sions, yet refused an aged, and tattered beggar,
	    <lb/>who asked alms of him. Said he, <said>if I had au­

	      <lb/>thority, I would put you, and all such others into
	      <lb/>close custody. Begone from my doors, I will not
	      <lb/>give you a farthing.</said></p>
          <p>I should think this very improper, and very un­
	    <lb/>natural for a person to say who was not wealthy,
	    <lb/>much more, for a person who has a plenty
	    <lb/>of this world's goods, and professes Christianity.
	    <lb/>I ask any one, <said>hoarded up, what is wealth?</said>
	    <lb/>It certainly can afford no real comfort to them­
	    <lb/>selves, or others.</p>
          <p>Says a writer, <quote>Integrity, or the observance
	      <lb/>of justice, then, is essential to private and public
	      <lb/>happiness. It is the fundamental principle in all
	      <lb/>the numerous concerns of society. Every deviation
	      <lb/>from justice and rectitude among men, is a viola­
	      <lb/>tion of the divine commands.</quote></p>
          <p>It is beautifully observed by a British author,
	    <lb/>that, <quote>there is happiness in the very wish to make
	      <lb/>others happy.</quote> It is thus that the pleasures deriv­
	    <lb/>ed from good actions comes in aid of moral pre­
	    <lb/>cepts. We are excited by our own happiness to 
	    <lb/>do what conscience dictates, and the laws of God
	    <lb/>require. In all cases of this kind, our happiness
	    <lb/>coincides with our duty. And it is thus that man
	    <lb/>becomes a miniature likeness of his Maker, in
	    <lb/>whom are inseperably united supreme moral ex­
	    <lb/>cellence and supreme felicity!</p>
          <p>Let not ease and indulgence contract our affec­
	    <lb/>tions, and wrap us up in selfish enjoyment. Let
	    <lb/>us ever accustom ourselves to think of the distres­
	    <lb/>ses of human life: of the solitary cottage, the dy­
	    <lb/>ing parent, and the weeping orphan. Never sport
	    <lb/>with pain or distress in any amusement, nor treat
	    <lb/>even the meanest insect with wanton cruelty.</p>

          <p rend="first-indent(1)"><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">A Babe</hi> slept in its cradle, and its name was
	    <lb/><name>Diligence</name>. It was joyful in the hands of those
	    <lb/>who nursed it. It was healthful, and ever play­
	    <lb/>ful, waiting for the fond caress of its parents. It
	    <lb/>bid fair promise to become a man.</p>
          <p>The babe grew to be a boy. Among the 
	    <lb/>thoughts which visit children, came one whose
	    <lb/>name was <name>Negligence</name>. It came to him with pre­
	    <lb/>tended diligence, and tried to enforce upon him
	    <lb/>the name of <name>Negligence</name>. The parents said to
	    <lb/><name>Diligence</name>, <said>remove this <name>Negligence</name> far from you.</said>
	    <lb/>But <name>Negligence</name> said, <said>trust in me, and I will tell

          <p><said>And of what canst thou tell me,</said> replied <name>Dili­
	      <lb/>gence</name>. Then answered <name>Negligence</name>, <said>Diligence
	      <lb/>is an unknown path, and o'er scattered by many
	      <lb/>thorns. Where none that are wise do ever travel,
	      <lb/>and which, in the end, will cause you much 
	      <lb/>trouble.</said></p>
          <p><said xml:id="peq001">I will not listen to thy idle tale,</said> said he,
	    <lb/><said xml:id="peq002">depart from me, I know you not, or from whence

	      <lb/>to you; I will try to walk in the path which my
	      <lb/>fathers have walked in before me.</said></p>
          <p>The boy became a youth. Once, as he lay in

	    <lb/>low. <name>Negligence</name> was merry, and talked easy of
	    <lb/>life. And said he, <said>follow me, and be regardless
	      <lb/>of habit, and thy heart shall be merry as mine,
	      <lb/>when I sing to thee.</said></p>
          <p>But <name>Diligence</name> said, <said>youth, be mine altogether;
	      <lb/>for <name>Diligence</name> and <name>Negligence</name> cannot remain
	      <lb/>together. <name>Diligence</name> is not slow to perseverence,
	      <lb/>is active in duty, and will be a friend to <emph>him</emph> all his

          <p>When he awoke, <name>Negligence</name> had left him, but
	    <lb/><placeName>Diligence</placeName> staid to bless him. He became a man,
	    <lb/>but <name>Diligence</name> was constant with him. And he
	    <lb/>drank deep at the fountains of Intelligence.</p>
          <p>At length, age found the man, and turned the
	    <lb/>hairs of his head white. His eye grew dim, and
	    <lb/>the world seemed to him an altered place. But,
	    <lb/>Alas! he had changed, and the blood was now
	    <lb/>cold in his veins.</p>
          <p><name>Diligence</name> looked on him and spoke to him in
	    <lb/>graver tones than in former times, and was to him
	    <lb/>a long tried friend. He sat down beside him, and
	    <lb/>the aged man said, <said><name>Diligence</name>, thou hast been
	      <lb/>with me. Thou hast staid me, and improved my
	      <lb/>intellect, which might have been lost.</said></p>
          <p>Then answered <name>Diligence</name> meekly, <said>It may be
	      <lb/>so. I trust that all who follow this principle, may
	      <lb/>never disown their name. I have borne it for

	      <lb/>brilliant as when they first came into my hands.</said></p>
          <p><name>Negligence</name> looked mournful, and ceased to ask
	    <lb/>to be forgiven of her error. She stopped in her
	    <lb/>career, and was no more to go forth, singing

          <p>Having fully made up his mind to seek another

          <p>In summer, men travel about, they wander wide

	    <lb/>of summer, the farmer works and is wearied. The

	    <lb/>of the long days. Summer brings flowers, and
	    <lb/>permits us to admire nature's works. During the
	    <lb/>mild seasons, the father prepares what is neces­
	    <lb/>sary in his family for winter; the mother cal­
	    <lb/>culates garments for her little ones, to shield 
	    <lb/>them from the inclemency of that approaching

          <p>In autumn, the farmer hastens to the field, to

	    <lb/>us fruit, and repays us for the toils of summer.
	    <lb/>The leaves fall from the trees, flowers begin to
	    <lb/>fade, and die! This is a good period of the year
	    <lb/>to contemplate the shortness of life; and like the

	    <lb/>In winter the students gain much time for medita­

	    <lb/>into the mind. It is the season that the child sees

          <p>Youth, in particular, should constantly bear in
	    <lb/>mind, that every comfort they enjoy, all the intel­
	    <lb/>lectual attainments which render them superior to
	    <lb/>the savage, they owe to their parents. Think of 
	    <lb/>the miseries of orphanage. The greatest loss
	    <lb/>that can befall a child, is to be deprived of pious
	    <lb/>and affectionate parents. While you are surround­
	    <lb/>ed by such blessings, never be so ungrateful as to
	    <lb/>injure them by disobedience.</p>
          <p>In their absence, their commands ought always
	    <lb/>to be observed the same as in their presence. To

          <p>When you are in school, consider it a privilege

	    <lb/>If pupils refuse to obey the directions of their

          <p>If persons know not obedience how can they
	    <lb/>teach it to others, which may in time be their lot?
	    <lb/>A person who will not obey, is not capable of com­

          <p>To instruct others is beneficial to the mind. It
	    <lb/>deepens the knowledge which it already possesses,
	    <lb/>and quickens it to acquire more. It is beneficial

	    <lb/>moves to set a good example. It improves the 
	    <lb/>affections. For we love those whom we make
	    <lb/>wiser and better, and their gratitude is a sweet
	    <lb/>reward.</p>
          <p>Time is more valuable than money. If you
	    <lb/>hinder a scholar from studying, you commit a rob­

          <head>Description of a Desert.</head>
          <p><quote><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">They</hi> wandered in the wilderness in a solitary
	    <lb/>way. Thirsty, their souls fainted in them.</quote>—
	    <lb/><mcr rend="case(smallcaps)"><title>Psalms</title></mcr>.</p>
          <p>It is difficult to form a correct idea of a desert,
	    <lb/>without having seen one. It is a vast plain of
	    <lb/>sands and stones, interspersed with mountains of
	    <lb/>various sizes and heights, without roads or shelters.
	    <lb/>They sometimes have springs of water, which
	    <lb/>burst forth, and create verdant spots.</p>
          <p>The most remarkable of deserts is the <placeName>Sahara</placeName>.
	    <lb/>This is a vast plain, but little elevated above the
	    <lb/>level of the ocean, and covered with sand and
	    <lb/>gravel, with a mixture of sea shells, and appears
	    <lb/>like the basin of an evaporated sea.</p>
          <p>Amid the desert there are springs of water,
	    <lb/>which burst forth and create verdant spots, called
	    <lb/>Oases. There are thirty-two of these which con­
	    <lb/>tain fountains, and Date and Palm trees; twenty
	    <lb/>of them are inhabited. They serve as stopping
	    <lb/>places for the caravans, and often contain villages.</p>
          <p>Were it not for these no human being could
	    <lb/>cross this waste of burning sand. So violent,
	    <lb/>sometimes, is the burning wind, that the scorching
	    <lb/>heat dries up the water of these springs, and then
	    <lb/>frequently, the most disastrous consequences
	    <lb/>follow.</p>
          <p>In <date when="1805">1805</date>, a caravan, consisting of 2,000 persons
	    <lb/>and 1,800 camels, not finding water at the usual

	    <lb/>resting place, died of thirst, both men and ani­
	    <lb/>mals. Storms of wind are more terrible on this
	    <lb/>desert than on the ocean. Vast serges and clouds
	    <lb/>of red sand are raised and rolled forward, burying
	    <lb/>every thing in its way, and it is said that whole
	    <lb/>tribes have thus been swallowed up.</p>
          <p>The situation of such is dreadful, and admits of
	    <lb/>no resource. Many perish victims of the most
	    <lb/>horrible thirst. It is then that the value of a cup
	    <lb/>of water is really felt.</p>

          </p>
          <p>I once passed several weeks in the family of a 
	    <lb/>farmer. It was once of the most pleasant, and use­
	    <lb/>ful visits I ever had made. I ever saw, that indus­
	    <lb/>try, contentment, and economy which constitutes
	    <lb/>every happy household.</p>
          <p>The whole family rose before the sun. Before
	    <lb/>eating breakfast, the farmer commended himself,
	    <lb/>and his family to the care of God through the day.
	    <lb/>When breakfast was over, every one proceeded to
	    <lb/>the regular business of the day. The farmer with
	    <lb/>his sons, and workmen went to the field. The
	    <lb/>mother and daughters to their stand to superin­
	    <lb/>tend the household affairs.</p>
          <p>When I looked about the house, and saw the
	    <lb/>many comforts of the family, and that most were
	    <lb/>wrought by the labor of their hands, I said what in­
	    <lb/>dustry and economy prevails here.</p>
          <p>Masses of yarn were assorted to prepare stock­
	    <lb/>ings for the father and brothers, and the fleece of 
	    <lb/>the lamb was sheared, and prepared for clothing, 
	    <lb/>in which they fearlessly braved the cold of winter.</p>
          <p>The family were taught not to be ashamed of
	    <lb/>honest industry, and it was a rule whatever was
	    <lb/>done, to be done well. All seemed to obey, and
	    <lb/>knew not how to forget this rule. There were sent
	    <lb/>to market, in the best order, the surplus of the
	    <lb/>dairy, and poultry yard, and loom. The mother
	    <lb/>taught her daughters to consider the interest of
	    <lb/>their father as their own, and instructed them by

	    <lb/>her own example how to lessen his expenses. This
	    <lb/>seemed to me the kind of industry, which more
	    <lb/>than any other promoted cheerfulness and health.</p>
          <p>The mother had no inclination to teach her
	    <lb/>daughters to be fine ladies, or to have them make
	    <lb/>a great appearance in the world; her constant aim
	    <lb/>was, to make them useful, and to prepare them for
	    <lb/>a future sphere of action.</p>
          <p>Their countenances were pleasant and peaceful,
	    <lb/>like those who do right. Their quietness of mind
	    <lb/>seemed to proceed from a sense of justice, or of do­
	    <lb/>ing their duty even to inanimate things; for we
	    <lb/>owe a duty to every article in our possession, and
	    <lb/>to every utensil with which we work; the duty of
	    <lb/>keeping them in order, and in a good condition.</p>
          <p>In reading we find that some of the most illus­
	    <lb/>trious men that ever filled our country, were the
	    <lb/>sons of farmers. There industry was great to
	    <lb/>elevate those means, by which to accomplish the
	    <lb/>object in view. A sense of their industry alarmed 
	    <lb/>them not. They were willing to labor, on ac­
	    <lb/>count of studying the best means of relieving the

          <p>With them, indeed, life was short. Ere a week

          <p>His sister companion repeated to him passages

          <p>Seated upon his bed, she bowed her face to his

	    <lb/>the grave. The generations that now exist must
	    <lb/>pass away; and more arise in their stead, to fill
	    <lb/>the places which they now occupy, and do effec­
	    <lb/>tual good.</p>
          <p>Some of the marble speaks of those who have
	    <lb/>not long since died; others appear quite ancient.
	    <lb/>Yet, memory can never fill the places of most of
	    <lb/>these, who slumber here in tombs. Trace back—
	    <lb/>their relations are not among the living. Ere
	    <lb/>a day they slumbered in the silent grave.</p>
          <p>In the grave by my side sleeps some sainted
	    <lb/>priest; the marble speaks his fame. Perhaps he
	    <lb/>has undergone the fatigues of life; he has been
	    <lb/>an eminent servant in his Master's calling, and
	    <lb/>now has his reward in heaven. He has died the
	    <lb/>death of the righteous; he has given up this world
	    <lb/><quote>with joy and not with grief.</quote> He has had diffe­
	    <lb/>rent stations in life; he has, perhaps, been in
	    <lb/>various parts of the world, has proclaimed the
	    <lb/>gospel to the heathen, he has experienced prosper­
	    <lb/>ity and adversity; he has seen families and kin­
	    <lb/>dred rise and fall; and he has now closed his 
	    <lb/>eyes upon this world forever more.</p>
          <p>Methinks I see before me the family burying
	    <lb/>ground. At the head sleeps the father and the
	    <lb/>mother. The children are deposited within the
	    <lb/>ground. The words about seem to say, live and
	    <lb/>die as did this family; upon this saying I did
	    <lb/>relent.</p>
          <p>As I walked on, I seated myself down upon a
	    <lb/>grave; it was the grave of an infant. It seemed
	    <lb/>to be sleeping on until the resurrection <quote>of both

	    <lb/>ed that cheerful, and innocent countenance which
	    <lb/>this infant has shown? Then I prayed to the
	    <lb/>Lord to shelter me, and to deliver me from all evil.</p>
          <p>I saw a countless number of trees. Among
	    <lb/>them was a willow. I thought of what a child
	    <lb/>once said. <quote>Tree, why art thou always sad and
	      <lb/>drooping? Am I not kind unto thee? Do not

	    <lb/>said an author—<quote>but it answered not. And as
	      <lb/>it grew on, it drooped lower and lower; for it was
	      <lb/>a weeping willow.</quote></p>
          <p>I stooped myself down over the grave of an aged 
	    <lb/>sire. I said to him, tell me of this grave! Me­
	    <lb/>thought that he answered—<said>ask him who rose
	      <lb/>again for me.</said> Noble sire, thou hast seen peace
	    <lb/>and war succeeding in their turn; the face of thy

          <p>After all thou hast beheld, thine eyes are now

	      <lb/>ticut</placeName>, <date when="1816-03-12">March 12th, 1816</date>. An ingenuous temper, a
	    <lb/>quickness of understanding, a benevolent spirit,
	    <lb/>a flexibility of nature, and a solemn sense of
	    <lb/>divine things, were observed in her tender age;
	    <lb/>and in the dangerous ascent of life, her feet were
	    <lb/>guided and preserved in the paths of rectitude and
	    <lb/>goodness; so that she was not only free from the
	    <lb/>stain of vice and vanity in her rising years, but
	    <lb/>looked to things superior to the world, and its vain
	    <lb/>and trifling amusements.</p>
          <p>Her thirst for knowledge was great, although
	    <lb/>she had not the advantage which many have, who
	    <lb/>less improve it. But although not skilled in the
	    <lb/>depths of knowledge, yet she possessed <name>Christian</name>
	    <lb/>virtue, which often the profound historian does
	    <lb/>not.</p>
          <p>In friendship, she was firm, affectionate, and

	    <lb/>confiding. She rendered every service in her
	    <lb/>power to those whom she loved. She regarded all
	    <lb/>with whom she associated with <name>Christian</name> kindness,
	    <lb/>and by a warm and generous sympathy, she made
	    <lb/>their sorrows her own.</p>
          <p>Though she was agreeable in her person, she
	    <lb/>did not sacrifice her time to the decoration of dress.
	    <lb/>She was always neat in her apparel, but did not
	    <lb/>allow the toilet to interfere with other duties. Her
	    <lb/>feelings were the kindest, and the most social;
	    <lb/>and her manners were unaffected. For empty
	    <lb/>ceremony and osten<choice><sic/><corr>ta</corr></choice>tious fashion, she had neither
	    <lb/>time nor taste.</p>
          <p>All her deportment was marked by true humil­
	    <lb/>ity. And though her excellence could not shield
	    <lb/>her from enmity, and from the slanders of that
	    <lb/>envy which follows eminent goodness, and <quote>like
	      <lb/>the shadow, proves the substance true,</quote> she avoided
	    <lb/>resentment, and considered herself thus called upon
	    <lb/>to exercise the <name>Christian</name> virtue of forgiveness.</p>
          <p>She was often a subject of ill health. Her last
	    <lb/>sickness was occasioned from a violent cold which
	    <lb/>she had taken. This terminated her existence.
	    <lb/>Now the value of that religion which she had cho­
	    <lb/>sen was fully realized. She was enabled to endure,
	    <lb/>without murmuring, severe affliction.</p>
          <p>As religion was the subject of her meditations
	    <lb/>in health, it was more forcibly impressed upon her
	    <lb/>mind during illness. She knew the duty of resig­
	    <lb/>nation to the will of her Maker, and of depend­
	    <lb/>ence on the merits of a Redeemer. These senti­
	    <lb/>ments were often expressed by her, to persons who
	    <lb/>visited her dying bed.</p>

          </p>
          <p>All future hopes of recovery, by her friends,
	    <lb/>were at length given over. To her it was not
	    <lb/>unwelcome news. Her parents mourned to think
	    <lb/>of the loss of so affectionate a daughter; great
	    <lb/>was her loss, seemingly, to her sisters; and soci­
	    <lb/>ety mourned the loss of a valuable friend.</p>
          <p>Death to her was no unwelcome messenger.
	    <lb/>The close of her life was like the fading of a

	    <lb/>The virtues which made her beloved, continued
	    <lb/>to flourish, and put forth new and fresh blossoms,

          <p>With so calm and peaceful a mind, so blessed

	    <lb/>she went to <placeName>East Granby</placeName> and lived some years
	    <lb/>in the family of the Pastor of that village, where

          <p>She remained in <placeName>Hartford</placeName> till the close of her
	    <lb/>life. She was esteemed for good behavior, and
	    <lb/>assistance in society; attending to the concerns
	    <lb/>of her own, and leaving alone those of others. She
	    <lb/>did not figure in the gay and more fashionable forms

          <p>While young she had not the advantages of a

	    <lb/>more than one or two days in a week. Yet, even

	    <lb/>some of the rudiments of knowledge with great la­

	    <lb/>to a most severe trial.</p>
          <p>The years of her childhood being spent in the
	    <lb/>country, she had less advantages of education than
	    <lb/>many. There being but one school, the scholars
	    <lb/>were quite numerous; and those whose station
	    <lb/>was inferior to many in the school, were neglected;
	    <lb/>their rights trampled upon, and their time abused.</p>
          <p>She had a permanent regard for the <name>Sabbath</name>,
	    <lb/>and for religious services; attending both the <name>Sab­
	      <lb/>bath School</name>, and divine worship three times upon
	    <lb/>that day. The intervals of worship, she spent in
	    <lb/>reading the Holy Scriptures, or religious books.
	    <lb/>She was exceedingly strict in her improvement of
	    <lb/>time. By rising early, she secured the best part of
	    <lb/>the day for her domestic employments, and for the
	    <lb/>necessary duties devolving upon her station. Sim­
	    <lb/>plicity of living and industrious habits, she partic­
	    <lb/>ularly regarded; ornaments seldom known, among
	    <lb/>the nobility of a republic.</p>
          <p>She took good care of all that was entrusted to

	    <lb/>she took delight in it. <quote>A place for every

	    <lb/>and to the end of her days she was anxious to
	    <lb/>live in the fear of God, and to walk before him
	    <lb/>with a humble heart.</p>
          <p>Her last sickness, which terminated in death,
	    <lb/>was painful in the extreme. She bore it with
	    <lb/><name>Christian</name> patience. When physicians and friends

	    <lb/>Providence. <said>If,</said> said she, <said>I had any hopes of
	      <lb/>recovery, it would be my soul's desire to bring glo­
	      <lb/>ry to the name of the Lord, proportionable to all
	      <lb/>the dishonor I have done Him, in my whole life:
	      <lb/>and particularly by endeavors to convince others
	      <lb/>of the danger of their condition, if they continue
	      <lb/>impenitent; and by telling them how graciously
	      <lb/>God has dealt with me.</said></p>
          <p>All the faculties of her mind were perfect until
	    <lb/>the last. It is thought that few people see death
	    <lb/>approach them, as she did. In short, her death
	    <lb/>was like her life; easy, unaffected, and pious.</p>
          <p>The morning that she died, she came down stairs
	    <lb/>with little help, and appeared to be gaining health.
	    <lb/>But such appearances are often deceptive. She
	    <lb/>sat down awhile, when she was persuaded to return
	    <lb/>to her room; she seemed to be unwilling, and said
	    <lb/>that she would like to sit awhile. She had grown

	    <lb/>weaker by leaving her room, and required much
	    <lb/>help to get back. When she reached her room,
	    <lb/>she threw herself upon her bed and exclaimed,
	    <lb/><said>Never again shall I see, what I have seen.</said></p>
          <p>Between six and seven in the evening, a friend
	    <lb/>went to her room, and said that she was going to
	    <lb/>hear a lecture on that evening. She expressed her
	    <lb/>willingness and wished to have her repeat to her
	    <lb/>what she heard when she returned. The friend
	    <lb/>had not been long seated before some one called
	    <lb/>for her. Said she, <said>Is <persName ref="p:jpell.rge">Julia</persName> dead?</said> It was in­
	    <lb/>deed true. She had ceased to breathe. Thus
	    <lb/>she peacefully died, in the 27th year of her age,

	    <lb/>the daughter of <persName ref="p:hsherman.mnw">Henry Sherman</persName>, and enjoyed the
	    <lb/>benefit of the example of pious parents. She
	    <lb/>early displayed an amiable disposition, a mind of
	    <lb/>strong powers, and an affectionate heart.</p>
          <p>The subject of this sketch, from a child, never
	    <lb/>enjoyed good health; but was always feeble and
	    <lb/>inclined to disease. She was ever pale, and look­

	    <lb/>ed like one that was smitten in youth, and was
	    <lb/>declining every day.</p>
          <p>While small, she was not like most children
	    <lb/>which many have seen; she was diligent and
	    <lb/>thoughtful, and always seemed to take an interest
	    <lb/>in the God of creation; she was never quick or
	    <lb/>unsubmissive, but always bore the same composed
	    <lb/>and pleasant countenance.</p>
          <p>Though not having the advantage of many chil­
	    <lb/>dren, on account of her health, yet, while at the last
	    <lb/>school she attended, and at others before, she
	    <lb/>gained a common school education. But it is
	    <lb/>probable, had she had the advantage which many
	    <lb/>have, she might have been more learned. But
	    <lb/>the time which health permitted her to attend was
	    <lb/>very irregular.</p>
          <p>Her moral sensibilities were uniformly strong.
	    <lb/>To do right, to avoid wounding the feelings of
	    <lb/>others, and always to speak the truth, were her
	    <lb/>rules of action. Her conscience was tender, and
	    <lb/>if she had committed any fault, she acknowledged
	    <lb/>it with frankness.</p>
          <p>She was a favorite with her teachers. They
	    <lb/>were gratified by her proficiency, and pleased
	    <lb/>with her amiable disposition. She realized the
	    <lb/>importance of a good education, and while per­
	    <lb/>severing, reaped the reward, prepared for every
	    <lb/>faithful scholar, increase in knowledge and habits
	    <lb/>of self-control.</p>
          <p>When quite young her excellent father died,
	    <lb/>and she, with a younger sister, was then under
	    <lb/>the care of a tender and pious mother. In the
	    <lb/>winter of <date when="1838">1838</date>, she made a public profession of
	    <lb/>her <name>Christian</name> faith. In this act, she always re­

	    <lb/>joiced, as giving strength to the confidence which,
	    <lb/>from still earlier years, she had placed in her
	    <lb/>heavenly protector. She now sought the society
	    <lb/>of the wise and pious, as she had ever been wont
	    <lb/>to do, that of those who were older than herself.</p>
          <p>At the age of fifteen, she was capable of super­
	    <lb/>intending her mother's largest tables; if she saw
	    <lb/>any thing go on wrong among the servants, she
	    <lb/>would forbear mentioning it to them, until she
	    <lb/>had first spoken to her mother. She would say,
	    <lb/><said>I would rather you would speak to them, for I am
	      <lb/>younger than they are.</said> So would this young
	    <lb/>person try to keep friends among all individuals.</p>
          <p>All who knew her, spoke of her being singular
	    <lb/>from most persons of her age. She was an exam­
	    <lb/>ple for all who did, and do not put their trust in a
	    <lb/>crucified Saviour.</p>
          <p>In the winter of <date when="1839">1839</date>, her health began visibly
	    <lb/>to decline. Symptoms of pulmonary consumption
	    <lb/>were plainly revealed. She employed physicians
	    <lb/>from several places; but help for her was now 
	    <lb/>given over. And had she wished for shelter be­
	    <lb/>neath a <name>Georgian</name> clime, that privilege would not
	    <lb/>have been granted for her, on account of the laws.</p>
          <p>The following spring disease bec<choice><sic>o</sic><corr>a</corr></choice>me seated. She
	    <lb/>was no more to go among her friends, or to behold
	    <lb/>her school room. Her frame wasted to a skeleton,
	    <lb/>and a hollow, racking cough, told that she was
	    <lb/>soon to die.</p>
          <p>Said a friend, <said>I called upon her one day, I
	      <lb/>found her reclining upon the sofa, her head resting
	      <lb/>upon the side; she exhibited great difficulty in
	      <lb/>breathing, but seemed calm and serene, trusting

	      <lb/>in God, who had been with her through affliction.</said>
	    <lb/>She lived a life of prayer. The Bible which
	    <lb/>she had loved and obeyed, was her stay, as she
	    <lb/>passed through the dark valley. Like a child
	    <lb/>yielding to its parents, she laid herself in His ever­
	    <lb/>lasting arms.</p>
          <p>The lovely works of God were then brighter to
	    <lb/>her than they ever yet had been; the precious
	    <lb/>truths from the Bible, which from earliest memory
	    <lb/>she had loved, tarried with her, till the Angels
	    <lb/>came.</p>
          <p>It was in the evening, month of <date when="1839-08">August, 1839</date>,
	    <lb/>that death came upon her like a friend, soothing
	    <lb/>her into gentle slumber. Without a gasp or strug­
	    <lb/>gle she slept in <persName ref="p:jchrist.hjn">Jesus</persName>, <quote>patience having had its
	      <lb/>perfect work.</quote></p>
          <p>Let the young, in forming their own characters,
	    <lb/>be assiduous to secure the same sources of happi­
	    <lb/>ness, which cheered this lovely and exemplary
	    <lb/>young lady, and enabled her, during long decline,
	    <lb/>to comfort others with her own radiant counte­
	    <lb/>nance, and to close her life like a music strain.</p>
          <p>The pleasing contemplation of so peaceful and
	    <lb/>happy a conclusion of life as this, and others
	    <lb/>which we often read, is sufficient, to elevate the
	    <lb/>soul, and to make all the glories and enjoyments
	    <lb/>of this transient scene sink into nothing. Ah!

	      <lb/>New York</placeName>, <date when="1818-06-10">June 10th, 1818</date>. She appeared to
	    <lb/>possess a truly noble mind, an amiable and benevo­
	    <lb/>lent temper. Her pious resignation, and religious
	    <lb/>deportment, under the pressure of very deep dis­
	    <lb/>tress, afford a highly instructive example, and an
	    <lb/>eminent instance of the glory of religion to sus­
	    <lb/>tain the mind, in the greatest storms and dangers,
	    <lb/>when the waves of affliction threaten to over­
	    <lb/>whelm it.</p>
          <p>This young lady spent a great part of her time
	    <lb/>in perusing the Holy Scriptures, and other reli­
	    <lb/>gious books. She had a just esteem for all persons
	    <lb/>whom she thought religious and virtuous. She
	    <lb/>appeared to be happily disposed from very early
	    <lb/>life, being good and gentle before she was capable
	    <lb/>of knowing that it was her duty to be so. This
	    <lb/>temper continued with her, through the whole 
	    <lb/>course of her life.</p>
          <p>At the age of fourteen, she made a public pro­
	    <lb/>fession of her <name>Christian</name> faith. Whatever her
	    <lb/>other virtues, their lustre was greatly increased by
	    <lb/>her humility. She was strict in the observance
	    <lb/>of religion. She adopted the rule of the <name>Psalmist</name>,
	    <lb/><quote>evening, morning and noon, will I pray,</quote> and
	    <lb/>retired three times a day for secret prayer.</p>
          <p>But her health which had always been feeble,
	    <lb/>began to decline. Consumption was deeply seated.

	    <lb/>At times she was able to leave her room, and would
	    <lb/>attend a benevolent institution. From thence she
	    <lb/>took a piece of work, and endeavored to finish it;
	    <lb/>but it seemed as though her health would not per­
	    <lb/>mit. She had such a desire to finish it, that she
	    <lb/>would seek her bed for rest, and then rise and go
	    <lb/>to her work. At length she finished it, and sent
	    <lb/>it to the <name>Society</name>.</p>
          <p>She was at last confined to her room, no more
	    <lb/>to go out of it. She was visited by many pious
	    <lb/>persons, to whom she expressed a desire and wil­
	    <lb/>lingness to die; to depart from this world of sor­
	    <lb/>row, to be with her God. The whole time of her
	    <lb/>sickness, she was in a cheerful, thankful frame of
	    <lb/>mind; leaving all to God, and referring to the dis­
	    <lb/>posal of Providence.</p>
          <p>She was continually blessing those around her,
	    <lb/>as death approached. <said rend="post()">May we meet in an eter­
	      <lb/>nal, a glorious world!</said> Beseeching them to press
	      <lb/>forward, for a glorious prize awaited them; to be
	    <lb/>faithful unto death and they should obtain it.<sic>”</sic></p>
          <p>She expressed a wish to a female friend to have
	    <lb/>her present, when she should breathe her last.
	    <lb/>When the time approached, she said to her moth­
	    <lb/>er, <said>send for this dear friend, that she may wit­
	      <lb/>ness my death.</said> Ere that friend reached her,
	    <lb/>she had fallen asleep in the arms of her Saviour.</p>
          <p>A short time before she died, she said to this
	    <lb/>friend, <said>I have an article of dress in such a place,
	      <lb/>which will answer for my <emph rend="case(smallcaps)slant(upright)">shroud</emph>. If you will
	      <lb/>have the goodness to prepare my grave clothes,
	      <lb/>and have them in readiness, that I may see them
	      <lb/>before I die, you will be rewarded, and I receive
	      <lb/>satisfaction.</said></p>

          <p>According to her wish, those garments were
	    <lb/>prepared, and brought to her room. The friend
	    <lb/>told her mother, that she need not show them to
	    <lb/>her unless she called for them. She did not how­
	    <lb/>ever call for them, until this friend arrived. At
	    <lb/>length she called for them; they were shown to
	    <lb/>her. A benignant lustre enkindled in her dim
	    <lb/>eyes, while surveying the robes, which, at her own
	    <lb/>request, had been prepared to deck her for the
	    <lb/>tomb!</p>
          <p>At one instant, she found death stealing upon
	    <lb/>her; a little while after, and she would be singing
	    <lb/>that sweet song,—<quote>Blessing, and honor, and glory,
	      <lb/>and power, be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne,
	      <lb/>and to the Lamb for ever and ever!</quote> She made a
	    <lb/>request to see all her dear friends around her be­
	    <lb/>side.</p>
          <p>She mentioned the names of those, whom she
	    <lb/>thought would take the most interest in witnessing
	    <lb/>her death. They were sent for; all of them came
	    <lb/>except one; he being a minister of the Gospel,
	    <lb/>was out of town. As soon as they gathered
	    <lb/>around her, she said that one was absent. On be­
	    <lb/>ing told the cause, she appeared satisfied.</p>
          <p>Thus she lived, and thus she died. An emi­
	    <lb/>nant instance of <name>Christian</name> fortitude, patience, and
	    <lb/>meekness. Thus was she prepared to say, <quote>Oh!
	      <lb/>death, where is thy sting! Oh! grave, where is thy
	      <lb/>victory!</quote> It was on the <date when="1838-09-15">15th of September, 1838</date>,
	    <lb/>that her spirit departed, to become an inhabitant
	    <lb/>of those regions above, where just spirits reign.</p>
