pre antoines dale palm by thomas bailey aldrich cambridge welch bigelow and company printers to the university  pre antoines date palm men shal not wenen every thing a lye but yf himselfe yt seeth or elles dooth for god wot thing is never the lasse sooth thogh every wight ne may it not ysee chaucers legende of goode women pre antoines datepalm near the levee and not far from the old french cathedral in new orleans stands a fine datepalm thirty feet in height growing out in the open air as sturdily as if its sinuous roots were sucking strength from their native earth sir charles lyell in his second visit to the united states mentions this exotic the tree is seventy or eighty years old for pre antoine a roman catholic priest who died about twenty years ago told mr bringier that he planted it himself when he was young in his will he provided that they who succeeded to this lot of ground should forfeit it if they cut down the palm wishing to learn something of pre antoines history sir charles lyell made inquiries among the ancient creole inhabitants of the faubourg that the old priest in his last days became very much emaciated that he walked about the streets like a mummy that he gradually dried up and finally blew away was the meagre and unsatisfactory result of the tourists investigations this is all that is generally told of pre antoine in the summer of  while new orleans was yet occupied by the rebel forces i met at n on the coast of new england a lady from louisianamiss badeau by namewho gave me the substance of the following legend touching pre antoine and his wonderful datepalm if it should appear tame to the reader it will be because i have nt a black ribbedsilk dress and a strip of pointlace around my throat like miss badeau it will be because i have nt her eyes and lips and southern music to tell it with when pre antoine was a very young man he had a friend whom he loved as he loved his life mile jardin returned his passion and the two on account of their friendship because the marvel of the city where they dwelt one was never seen without the other for they studied walked ate and slept together antoine and mile were preparing to enter the church indeed they had taken the preliminary steps when a circumstance occurred which changed the color of their lives a foreign lady from some faroff island in the pacific had a few months before moved into their neighborhood the lady died suddenly leaving a girl of sixteen or seventeen entirely friendless and unprovided for the young men had been kind to the woman during her illness and at her deathmelting with pity at the forlorn situation of anglice the daughterswore between themselves to love and watch over her as if she were their sister now anglice had a wild strange beauty that made other women seem tame beside her and in the course of time the young men found themselves regarding their ward not so much like brothers as at first they struggled bravely with their destiny month after month for the holy orders which they were about to assume precluded the idea of love and marriage but every day taught them to be more fond of her even priests are human so they drifted on in a dream the weak like to temporize and she if anglice shared their trouble her face told no story it was like the face of a saint on a cathedral window once however as she came suddenly upon the two men and overheard words that seemed to burn like fire on the lip of the speaker her eyes grew very luminous for an instant then she passed on her face as immobile as before in its setting of wavy gold hair entre or et roux dieu fit ses longs cheveux one night mile jardin and anglice were not to be found they had flownbut whither nobody knew and nobody save antoine cared it was a heavy blow to antoinefor he had half made up his mind to run away with her himself a strip of paper slipped from a volume on antoines desk and fluttered to his feet do not be angry said the bit of paper piteously forgive us for we love three years went by wearily enough antoine had entered the church and was already looked upon as a rising man but his face was pale and his heart leaden for there was no sweetness in life for him four years had elapsed when a letter covered with outlandish postmarks was brought to the young priesta letter from anglice she was dyingwould he forgive her mile the year previous had fallen a victim to the fever that raged on the island and their child little anglice was likely to follow him in pitiful terms she begged antoine to take charge of the child until she was old enough to enter a convent the epistle was finished hastily by another hand informing antoine of madame jardins death it also told him that anglice had been placed on board a vessel shortly to leave the island for some western port the letter delayed by storm and shipwreck was hardly read and wept over when little anglice arrived on beholding her antoine uttered a cry of joy and surpriseshe was so like the woman he had worshipped as a mans tears are more pathetic than a womans so is his love more intensenot more enduring nor half so subtile but intenser the passion that had been crowded down in his heart broke out and lavished its richness on this child who was to him not only the anglice of years ago but his friend mile jardin also anglice possessed the wild strange beauty of her motherthe bending willowy form the rich tint of skin the large tropical eyes that had almost made antoines sacred robes a mockery to him for a month or two anglice was wildly unhappy in her new home she talked continually of the bright country where she was born the fruits and flowers and blue skies the tall fanlike trees and the streams that went murmuring through them to the sea antoine could not pacify her by and by she ceased to weep and went about the cottage with a dreary disconsolate air that cut antoine to the heart a longtailed paroquet which she had brought with her in the ship walked solemnly behind her from room to room mutely pining it seemed for those heavy orient airs that used to ruffle its brilliant plumage before the year ended he noticed that the ruddy tinge had fled from her cheek that her eyes had grown languid and her slight figure more willowy than ever a physician was consulted he could discover nothing wrong with the child except this fading and drooping he failed to account for that it was some vague disease of the mind he said beyond his skill so anglice faded day after day she seldom left the room now at last antoine could not shut out the fact that the child was passing away he had learned to love her so dear heart he said once what is t that ails thee nothing mon pre for so she called him the winter passed the balmy spring air had come and anglice seemed to revive in her little bamboo chair on the porch she swayed to and fro in the fragrant breeze with a peculiar undulating motion like a graceful tree at times something seemed to weigh upon her mind antoine noticed it and waited at length she spoke near our house said little anglicenear our house on the island the palmtrees are waving under the blue sky o how beautiful i seem to lie beneath them all day long i am very very happy i yearned for them so much that i grew sickdont you think it was so mon pre mon dieu yes exclaimed antoine suddenly let us hasten to those pleasant islands where the palms are waving anglice smiled i am going there mon pre ay indeed a week from that evening the wax candles burned at her feet and forehead lighting her on the journey all was over now was antoines heart empty death like another mile had stolen his new anglice he had nothing to do but to lay the blighted flower away pre antoine made a shallow grave in his garden and heaped the fresh brown mould over his idol in the tranquil spring evenings the priest was seen sitting by the mound his finger closed in the unread prayerbook the summer broke on that sunny land and in the cool morning twilight and after nightfall antoine lingered by the grave he could never be with it enough one morning he observed a delicate stein with two curiously shaped emerald leaves springing up from the centre of the mound at first he merely noticed it casually but at length the plant grew so tall and was so strangely unlike anything he had every seen before that he examined it with care how straight and graceful and exquisite it was when it swung to and fro with the summer wind in the twilight it seemed to antoine as if little anglice were standing there in the garden the days stole by and antoine tended the fragile shoot wondering what sort of blossom it would unfold white or scarlet or golden one sunday a stranger with a bronzed weatherbeaten face like a sailors leaned over the garden rail and said to him what a fine young datepalm you have there sir mon dieu cried pre antoine and is it a palm yes indeed returned the man i had no idea the tree would flourish in this climate mon dieu was all the priest could say if pre antoine loved the tree before he worshipped it now he watered it and nurtured it and could have clasped it in his arms here were mile and anglice and the child all in one the years glided away and the datepalm palm and the priest grew togetheronly one became vigorous and the other feeble pre antoine had long passed the meridian of life the tree was in its youth it no longer stood in an isolated garden for pretentious brick and marble houses had clustered about antoines cottage they looked down scowling on the humble thatched roof the city was edging up trying to crowd him off his land but he clung to it like lichen and refused to sell speculators piled gold on his doorsteps and he laughed at them sometimes he was hungry and cold and thinly clad but he laughed none the less get thee behind me satan said the old priests smile pre antoine was very old now scarcely able to walk but he could sit under the pliant caressing leaves of his palm loving it like an arab and there he sat till the grimmest of speculators came to him but even in death pre antoine was faithful to his trust the owner of that land loses it if he harm the datetree and there it stands in the narrow dingy street a beautiful dreamy stranger an exquisite foreign lady whose grace is a joy to the eye the incense of whose breath makes the air enamored may the hand wither that touches her ungently because it grew from the heart of little anglice said miss badeau tenderly cambridge printed by welch bigelow  co aleck and pete or the hand of the diligent maketh rich saint louis southwestern book and publishing compy  and  washington avenue  aleck and pete or the hand of the diligent maketh rich saint louis sw book and publishing co  washington av  entered according to act of congress in the year  by the sw book and publishing co in the clerks office of the district court of the united states for the eastern district of missouri aleck and pete or the hand of the diligent maketh rich aleck and pete or the hand of the diligent maketh rich how are you aleck how are you pete these exclamations came at the same moment from two young men who met in the hall of the southern hotel the latter had just turned from the register where he had been looking over the arrivals the former from reading the flaming playbills  which decorated the side of the hall alexander h and peter m had been fellowsalesmen and roommates for three or four years during which time a warmer and more enduring friendship had grown up between them than often characterizes those who are not united by the ties of kindred what their surnames were is not important  to our story the short and familiar ones they applied to each other will answer our purpose a hearty hand shaking followed the meeting of the old and fast friends where have you been and how have you got on these two or three years said pete since i last saw you starting for california wasnt it no replied aleck for montanathough i went to california afterward and instead of two or three it is nearer six years since i left here six years exclaimed pete i had no idea it was so long but time speeds unnoticed when he treads on flowers is for once truth as well as poetry but what have you been doing old fellow  anyhow made a beginning at least for a fortune  i hope not by a long shot pete if your path has been through flowers mine has been through thorns i tell you they have not left me a stitch of pants but what i have on and a scanty invoice of upper rigging and as to a fortune i shall think myself rich if i get something to do to pay expenses till next spring when ill go to oregon or alaska or somewhere and now tell me how you have got along these hard times had better luck than ive had i hope ive no great cause to complain aleck but i have a long story to tell you and have not time for it this morning where can i see you this afternoon to have a long chat over old times suppose you call here and take supper with me after that we will go the theatre to see collins in arrah na pogue then stay the night with methat will be like old times sure enough cant do it aleck for several reasons in the first place my wife your wife shouted aleck you married yes truly why not but ill tell you all about it this afternoon and as to going to the theatre im obliged to you for the invitation but i havent been in one for five years and wont be for five more if i know myself the thunder you havent exclaimed aleck whats come over you well come and take a drink anyhow i feel as if i needed something to sustain me under this awful news of your having fallen into matrimony excuse me aleck but i have not smiled for five years neither youre making up for the privation now pete for youre as smiling and looking as happy as a big sunflower well have a cigar at least thankee aleck ive quit smoking and chewing too whew whistled aleck as he stepped back two paces and eyed his old friend from head to foot with looks of wonder and incredulity given up theatres  and drinks and cigars and stuck to it for five years see here pete have you turned methodist parson where are you going to hold forth next sunday no aleck said pete gravely im at my old business of salesman at the old place im no preacherat least of theologythough i do  sometimes exhort a little on kindred topics ill give you a specimen this evening from the text the hand of the diligent maketh rich so till  pm  goodbye they parted the one going down to his place of business on second street the other sauntering into the barroom where somehow he omitted his usual brandy cocktail contenting himself with a cigar he followed pete down town to look up his old acquaintances and to try to procure a situation at the appointed time and place the pair met again and went up to alecks room to converse an hour or so about the past present and future now aleck said pete throwing himself into a cushioned chair let me renew my question of this morning how have you got on these five yearswhere have you been and what have you been doing ive been in almost every state and territory between here and the pacific besides some in mexico  sometimes i made a little money then again lost it at last finding no good opening in california  i packed up last week at san francisco for this my old stamping ground which after all seems to offer as many advantages as any other in the union i want a situation what chance do you think there is for a boy of my size in fact i must make something soon for i havent money enough in my pocket to keep the blue devils a month longer from dancing a jig there its a short yarn alecki make it so in order to hear how youve done in the meantime got along pretty well it seems to meall but the marrying which i dont more than half believe well if you are married im crazy to see the divinity who tempted you to bow your neck to the yoke matrimonial where are you boarding im bound to make you an early visit she was rich of course no aleck she was poor like myself you shall see her this evening we are keeping house at carondlelet poor and keeping house exclaimed aleck come come pete youre drawing the longbow a little too strong you shall see for yourself well go down on the  train youll take supper with us and see my establishment im sorry my house is not large enough to admit of my accomodating accommodating you for the night but you can come back on the  train and get to the hotel by early bedtime thankee pete ill go with pleasure but do tell me what has wrought this transformation in your character and habits which seems to me little short of a miracle no miracle at all said pete nor luck neither it was simply the result of attention to the text i quoted this morning the hand of the diligent maketh rich we parted he continued five years ago last springyou going to montana and i remaining reluctantly in my old situation i was lonely for a while i tell you i was for we had  been roommates and cronies for over three years i tried to find some good fellow to fill your place for i could not well afford to keep that big room alone studying this over for some days i began to review the kind of life we had led and i was not long in arriving at the conclusion that that your late chum broke in aleck was one of the most prudent moral and every way exemplary young men in st louis fit to be president of the young mens christian association no aleck i concluded that you and i had been the greatest ninnies the most exemplary asses that ever carried off the blue ribbands at a donkey show complimentaryvery said aleck but how so we were getting twelve hundred dollars a year when you left i believe said pete yes you twelve hundred i a hundred more for i had been a year longer in the house said aleck how much did we save out of our salaries asked pete save replied aleck not a dollar that i know of at least i didnt in truth i had to leave with some little bills unpaid till i remitted you for themyou recollect yes now aleck what became of our money why we spent it of course replied aleck what else is money for true but were we not fools to spend it all and the way we did to waste so much on things we could well have dispensed withindeed what often injured us how much did we spend each of us on cigars and tobacco alone let me see said aleck studying a quarter or so a daysay two dollars a week and how much for drinks we were very temperate you know not more than two or three a day put it another two dollars  a week how much for theater tickets and consequent hackhire gloves bouquets suppers etc not over an average oflet me see said aleck puzzled rather hard to calculate big item put them down at an average of threefifty a week and billiards continued pete oh a mere trifle not over a dollar and a half a week your figures aleck are not above the mark and yet the amount in the aggregate if we had only stopped to foot it up would have alarmed us look at it cigars and tobacco two dollars drinks two dollars theaters etc three and a half billiards a dollar and a half nine dollars a week four hundred  and sixtyeight dollars a year more than a third of our income your array of figures looks serious certainly said aleck but what would you have a young fellow do save like a miser and live like a hermit no not if he is content to remain a poor devil all his life but if he is poor and wants to rise to acquire property to become a selfsupporting respectable man he has no means to effect his object but to be economical as well as industrioushe must save a part of his earnings and persevere in this course for years in this way a majority of our rich men began life it is the only sure way to success those who rise by speculation who become rich suddenly are the exceptions not the rule industry and economy will win fifty times where speculation does once such aleck were my reflections as i sat one sunday morning at our window a week after you left i had spent nearly all my earnings i had not saved more than enough to pay my expenses for a month if i had chanced to be sick for that time i had no idea of remaining  in a subordinate position all my life and yet i had not even begun to lay up a fund to begin business  on in short i had acted like an ass for a moment i felt disheartened but i recovered hope and determined to turn over a new leafto be wiser in future and to begin that very moment i pitched my half smoked cigar out of the window resolving to never touch another i abandoned drinks also forthwith and theaters and billiards they and a few other superfluities had cost me over five hundred dollars a year i determined to save that sum in future and you really stuck to it pete yes i did though i suffered a sort of martyrdom  for two or three months which was hardest to quit asked aleck cigars and tobacco replied pete the others were comparatively easy for two months or more i feared i would have to take to them again i was almost unfitted for attending to business in fact a medical friend advised me to use them moderately  fearing bad results to my health but i stuck to my resolve and came off conqueror in two years from that time i had saved over eleven  hundred dollars i married then and spent most of my savings for furniture to begin housekeeping on the senior partners of our house thought i had acted rashly in marrying but when i explained  the whole to mr c who you know with all his stern exacting ways has the kindest heart in the world for young men who are striving to rise as he didwhen i told him of my abstinences my savings my style of housekeeping and plans for the future he instantly approved of the whole and generously ordered an increase of two hundred dollars  a year to my salary the same increase he told me should be made yearly as long as i kept on in the same track it is three years since i married  and i have never regretted the adventure i have found it as easy to save as before indeed our savings have increased but come aleck i see it is time for us to start for the depot you shall see for yourself how i am fixed and then laugh at  or pity me as you will aleck turned to the mirror made some improvement  in his toilet and accompanied his friend to the cars after a few minutes ride they were at the handsome suburban town of carondelet a short walk brought them near mr ms house a  small twostory cottage with whitecurtained windows  trim fences shrubbery vines everything suited to such a residence the whole betokening comfort taste and industrious care a pretty twoyear old boy toddled down the path with outspread  arms and face beaming with delight to meet his expected father aleck had not time to recover  from the pleasant surprise at finding that it was  petes son and his own namesake when he was introduced to mrs m who was awaiting their  arrival and holding the gate open to admit the party he was received with the courtesy due to an esteemed friend of her husband though something  of a connoisseur in the matter of female costume  aleck failed to note anything about that of his new acquaintance except that it was very neat and ladylike her face commanded instant respect as well as admiration while her figure and movements  were the very personification of grace and  dignity what a lucky fellow pete is thought  he as they entered the small but pretty parlor to  possess such a wife and son and home if he added he is only able to keep up such an establishment while mrs m was making some additions to the supper table the two friends walked out into the garden which like the house showed evidences of skill taste and much labor a large vine hung  full of clusters of grapes and a few pear and peach trees were bending under their loads of luscious fruit flowers too were not wanting to lend beauty to utility the gravel walks were level smooth and clean the borders neatly trimmed you keep a gardener i suppose said aleck inquiringly yes or rather the gardener keeps meat work my wife and i do all the work the heavier and rougher parts of course fall to my share indeed but when do you find time for this work of mornings and eveningsan hour a half or even a few minutes on my part my wife often spends some hours at it when the weather is very fine it helps to keep her in good health besides our vegetables and fruits add much to our table which from the time of the violets in spring till that of the chrysanthemums of autumn is never set without a bouquet to adorn it the supper bell tinkled and they went in mr m bearing in his hand a basket of choice fruit to serve for a dessert the repast need not be described  it was all a husband returning from daily toil could ask or expect from the hands of a loving wife aleck thought he had never tasted one so delicious its flavor was no doubt hightened by the air of contentment purity and love which threw a charm over the entire household the minutes sped rapidly while the two friends conversed about the events of the last five years nine oclock was at hand and aleck prepared to depart for the city mrs m joined her husband in inviting him to come down to see them often arrived at the depot they had a few minutes to spare before the train would come up you must be thinking of beginning business for yourself soon inquired aleck of pete no he replied times are too unsettled most of those who are in business would as lief be out profits are small expenses high and currency deranged i prefer a good salary for a while longer besides i hold it to be a mans first duty to provide for his wife or child or parent i have therefore invested most of my savings in such a way that if i were to die tonight my family would be moderately but surely provided for how did you invest asked aleck by securing a policy of life insurance which i did for five thousand dollars on the tenpayment fifteenyear endowment plan and i must say that no act of my life ever gave me greater or more permanent satisfaction it gives me but little trouble to pay the premiums yearly i have to make only ten of them if i live fifteen years i will receive from eight to ten thousand dollars if i am taken ill dangerously so the reflection that my beloved ones are provided for will add to my peace of mind and help to restore me to health and if through some extraordinary chance or providence i become bankrupt the law preserves my life insurance from seizure by rapacious creditors  my wife and child would secure it amid the wreck to save them from poverty ive heard a great deal lately about life insurance  said aleck but confess i had a prejudice against it though for no very definite reason perhaps  it was because it looked like a very serious matter something like making a will or buying a lot in a cemetry cemetery  or getting married but your approval gives me a better opinion of it and induces me to believe that it is not as i thought one of the humbugs brought out so frequently of late to diddle us out of our money no aleck it is neither a novelty nor a humbug  life insurance companies have been in operation  for many years in europe and have been regarded with great favor by the public it was  introduced into this country more than thirty years ago but remained almost dormant until within the last few years since then say since the year  it has increased with wonderful rapidity it is even said that its operations have quadrupled in the last four years the amount of the policies held in this country now is estimated at two thousand millions of dollars and the work is not more than fairly started it is this very rapidity of increase and this magnitude  which excited my fears interrupted aleck you may dismiss that fear said pete the principles on which life insurance is built are so unfailing and so perfectly understood now that the best judges of finance and business in general have decided that there is no mode whatever in which money can be invested that presents greater assurance  of permanence and safety in fact it has been declared on undoubted authority that there is nothing  in the commercial world which approaches even remotely the security of a well established and prudently  managed life insurance company i give it up pete replied aleck i will dismiss  my prejudices against life insurance companies  and will probably follow your example in securing a policy as soon as i have a little spare cash but the first thing with me now is to secure this i am nearly out of money and must get something  to do right away and you must help me to find a situation come around in the morning said pete and ill see what can be done for you and now aleck as the train is coming up to the depot i have only time to ask you what you think of my doings since you went away which are you ready to doto laugh at or pity me laugh at or pity you exclaimed aleck no from the bottom of my soul i envy you though i would if i could double your prosperity and happiness  you richly deserve them you have acted like a man of sense and i like a dogoned fool you have employed your last five years in laying the foundation of a fortune i have wasted mine in thoughtless dissipation never despair said pete kindly it is never too late to reform you have sowed your wild oats now resolve to use the talents heaven has given you for a better purpose have courage determine to conquer your evil habits and youll me out right side up yet pete old fellow said aleck as he pressed his  friends hand nervously and tried to conceal his troubled feelings pete old fellow you have this day taught me the best lesson i ever learned in my life im going like you to turn over a new leaf and to follow your example ill settle right down here in st louis from this day forth and forever ill forswear and abjure cigars tobacco drinks theaters  billiards cards fast horses et cetera et cetera  ill work as hard and save as closely as ever you did and ill copy you in securing with the first surplus cash i have a life insurance policy for the benefit of my old mother god forgive me for neglecting her so long here his voice grew thick and his friend with a kindly pressure of the hand interposed your head and heart are all right again aleck have courage stick to your resolves and all will go well with you in future stick to them exclaimed aleck ill do it or die trying if i dont i wish i may be teetotally and eternally toot toot whistled the locomotive all aboard shouted the conductor the train was in motion aleck sprang on the platform and was whirled away up to the city an interesting love story found in a rebel camp ground an interesting love story found in a rebel camp ground written by a southern soldier drafted into the rebel army whose sympathes were with the north newyork         a loye story i suppose as it is common it is necessary to say something in the way of introduction or preface however as my story is short it will only answer for the same itself most young men when becoming acquainted with a young and beautiful girl are rather bashful and feel some what confounded and i of course not being very different from the rest of my sex you may consequently imagine my feelings on that occasion however i mustered all my courage and strained my nerves to their utmost in or der to meet that trying time it was in the beautiful month of may when first i saw the object of my story and on the first sight i became smitten with her mild modest and most interesting appear ancenot saying a word about her beauty or accomplish ments she had all that nature could give with one exception and i felt as if it were my duty to furnish that in the first place an introduction was needed and how to get it i did not know ten thousand ways entered my head but all were condemed if there were to be any party or meeting she might go to in the neighborhood i would go and throw myself in her waybut no such chancei would not allow any obstacle that might spring up to pre vent me from such an opportunity i was for one month laboring under great mental agony when at last an oppor tunity presented itself and i was determined to embrace it let it turn out as it would the little country schoolhouse where my darling catharine was preparing herself for col     lege process was situated but a short distance from my own humble dwelling the grandeur and sublime appear ance of that little log cabin i beautiful college did i say beautiful i will acknowledge i thought so the reader may judge for himself as i give a description of that dear little spot the house wad made of logs and from its appearance one would think it was boones first settlement in the north state it was situated in a marshy country surrounded by a turpentine plantation without fence or garden but still to me it seemed beantifulno spot on earth was so dear when at work my mind was there and i have often thrown the plow or shovel or what ever it might be away for the purpose of harnessing old charleyyou may talk of fast and fine horses but he beat all in these digginswell he might for he cost me three hundred dollars in round cash i have often sat behind him when the road was hard and smoothe and imagined myself going at the rate of a mile a minute especially when passing that dear little romantic spot young men in thest parts are nowhere if they have not horse buggy and harness consequently i provided myself with that necessity as being a surety to a successful courtship and marriage there was one thing yet in the way that blasted all my hopes for a while the teacher of this little insti tute was my bitterest enemy though his intention was to make me believe he was my best friend and would speak a good word for me on all favorable occasions i soon feund him to be a wolf in sheeps clothing and for that reason i hated him worse than i did the very devil i ask the reader if i hbdenft reasoi say yes i know you would this opportunity i spoke of was on tuesday in in the latter part of july it commenced raining in the fore part of the day and continued incessantly and therefore i could not bear to think that she being prized by me above all other earthly beings should go home alone no i could   notthough i was not accquaind but now is  never while in this state of meditation  was in the barn with what few hands my father could spay shell ing corn for the mill i came to the conclusion as it was lanting season to plant one crop ad ot another would be quite unlike farming so i resolved to go and see cathar ine so i ordered bill a smart and intelligent negro boy of nineteen summers to get my holjroady i cant hold any longer i x ant you to put the harness oncharley and hitch him to the top buggy i am going to see that gal if i get a worse kicking thain arn jones got last week friom nancy brown what

believe i never felt so awkward in all my life and almost abandoned the idea of going  but i could not back out then now i hear the noise of charleys hoofs coming to the door and the sum mons of the boy that all was ready i brushed my hair and out i goescharges bill with his busine y hair and buggy it up straightguivesg my coat colla an extra pull      ana then i am off now my head is filled with a thousand ideas what to do or say how can i excuse myself she will think i am dead in love with her and i must acknowledge i am but it will not do to let her know it and now there is that infernal teacherid rather meet the devil than him his very looks makes me feel miserable i felt that he knew the thoughts of my mind o what piercing eyes i he turns my heart inside out halloo there is the school house hark i hear a bell it is recess by hookey now the children are shoving to the door to see hlo can get out first there they are skipping hopping and jumping the rope some one thing some another here comes a larger crowd of young ladies and there is my catharine she sees mewhat must i do i believe they are going to the spring yes there they go running now is my chance though i was mortally afraid i would not speak rightso here goes i tied my horse to a tree and down i goes to the spring i found catharine in a sitting posture face to ward the spring as if she were meditating upon human na ture gazing upon that crystal fountain and as i came up in the sound of her voice it fell on my ear like the sound of a death bell my heart was in my mouth they all looked up tithl astonished faces and seemed to be frightened to see me approach thfem while sitting under the loving green they all looked beautifil the large and majestic oak that sha ded the spring land the dim reflection of the sun as it shone through the leaves played upon their beautiful counte nances which added stillmore to their beauty o what a moment that wao to me i felt as if there were a hive of bees withinmy head however i made out to step up to catharine the object of my affections and was about to excuse myself when my foot slipped and in i went up to my chin in the spring o what a laugh the young gils did have it appeared to be the funniest thing they had ever seen but now i was so mortified though   there was one that did not laugh bnt seemed as much hurt at it as i was myselfit was catharine now these were the thoughts of my mind o here i am dripping wet from head to toe what shall i do how shall i excuse myself before the fair dame this lovely girl of sixteen summers she was beautiful her hair hung in long black tresses over her shoulders and her deep blue eyes all testifying of in telligence and beauty although she was a loving picture i had to take my leave of her the sun was then setting in the western horizon i bid her good evening with the hope of meeting her again in the sunshine of her beautiful coun tenance it was indeed an hour of deep meditation and love though the sky was dark and gloomy heavy clouds hung in dark sullen masses over land and sea the wind in pitiless agonies whistled and moaned around the cottage of my humble dwelling as i drove up

speaking of marriage says  it is like any other disease while there is life there is hope well massa what is hope   well bill some say it is one thing and some another it is said to be an anchor to the soul it is the guiding star of our life but who sahall be able to define all that is con tained in that little word hope how thankful we ought to be for this little word called hope it cheers us thiough all the vicissitudes of life when one hope fails we soon erect another to lean upon when we are sad and discourag ed hope comes as a glad messenger and cheers our droop ing spirits well massa  guess from what you have said you havent nothing to do but rest contented and hope for better timesso pop goes the weaselcome on charley      let me give you a good rubbing down and a good dry stable where is a plenty of corn and fodder now charley eat hearty for i expect massa will drive you soon for he is dead in love with rsoae gal chiarley paws and snorts as he chews his feed enough to say all right but the storm cleared away and nature reappeared in  all her beauty and grandeur the stars reappeared in all their silent beauty and as each constellation appeared and disappeared the night still slept on in beauty morning dawned and as the stars disappeared the sun arose in unclouded brilliancy aind disappeared the gloom that lad so long overshadowed as it was while approach ing the schoolhouse there i espied as i thought the belle of the world a morning glory looked like a rose in its bloom an angel form often i would make it my business to pass by the school house and every time i did so i would see my darling sit ting by the window and i thought she was the prettiest thing under heaven the smile that floated on her rosy cheeks looked so lovingly and her sparkling eyes so charm ing that every time i saw her my love would increase at last it got to such a high pitch i had to dress up all in my best to go and see miss catharine the darling of my heart sire lives in craven countyso off i goes like a doctor to his patient at a rate of a mile a minutego along charly what did i feed you for so soon as i hove in sight of my loved ones house and it seemed as soon as i came in sight charley was the proud est fellow i ever saw it seemed as if he tried to look over the house he held such a high and gay head very often i would take miss catharine behind charley and go some fifteeen or twenty miles to church or some oth er place of enjoyment and when i did it seemed as if char ley was aware of it forhe appeared more active then and a prouder horse i never saw now i had been in miss    catharines presence several times before i popped the ques tion it was the hardest thing i ever attempted to do in all my life but after i mashed the potatoe and began to talk lasses it seemed to be the easiest thing i ever under took to do o it was a lovely thing a feeling of enjoy ment although a strange feeling and an uneasy one though i loved it for the same reason i loved kittie and i believe kittie loved me for pretty soon we were engaged to be mar ried o that infernal teacher he was all the time laying stumbling blocks in my way and others would rise up against me some on the left and some on my right and some in front and some in the rear but after all she loved me or she promised to go through weal or woelet what come what may she was mine and i was hers but the hardest thing i ever done was to ask the old folks for her but at last i raised ambition enough and went to the house  but not finding her father at home i waited till i reached his plantation about two miles from his house when i found him he was sitting behind the barn feeding some pigs well we talked away for about two hours before i mentioned it but at the same time wanted to do it  but was afraid the answer would be no so many had tried to break me up in this match some had said i was insolvent and some say i were a rumsucker gambler and a spendthrift so every time i tried to ask him it choked me mv spittle woulld become ropey and dry and thirsty as if i had been without water for several days  but after a while i managed te get it out edgeways m r doublin your daughter catharine has promised me her hand providing you and her mother will condescend to sanction it the old fellow hung his head for about two minutes and said i will give you n answer in a few days now  was in a sweat sighing and blowing wishing ibhad stayed back now we were moving in the direc     tion of his house i trying to get his good graces now we are at his residence i see my darling kittie i told her what the old man had said she said its just like papa i goes back again but kittie tells me her father wishes her to go to school two or three years first be fore marrying so i waited and waited and kept by her side nearly all the time for two years one more year yet and our marriage will come offbut o this war this cruel war between the north and the south has commenced what shall i do o what shall i do it will not do to marry now and to be a secessioner is against my will i am for the union and the union alone i am for the country that our forefathers fought for i am for the old stars and stripes the flag i were cradled under this flag may it never be trodden under the foot of any man and to sum up the whole may i see our ccuntry yet united and may my last breath be spent under the star spangled banner o may our country be as it once were a black republican and a secessionist i do dislike for freeing our negroes and settle them in the midst of us i am oppoosed to it but if the government will pay us for our negroes and place them in a territory to them selves then i am foremancipation i am for a gov ersment that has no negroes in it o may the time soon come when our nation reunited clear of the black race may it be a nation of white people these are my sentiments although i am in a rebel camp ground i am a drafted soldier and if these lines were to reach headquarters and i in their reach what would be the consequence would i be shot or would i be hanged the last of poor jack skinner my ever dear lover this will inform you that i am yet    alive and quite well but in low spirits i guess you under stand the nature of war by this time as it has brought on many changes such as is painful o what sorrowful times indeed it makes me feel as if i were lost and ruined forev er why so because you are not here by my side o this cruel war when will it be over so we can meet to part no more till death i cannot say when i can come again as times is so critical it may be in a few days and it may be m never but if we never meet any more this will be my wish to thee may the blessing of god wait upon thee may the sun of glory shine around thy head may the gates of peace and plenty honor and happiness be always open to thee and thine may no strife distress thy days may no sor row distress thy nights may the pillow of peace kiss thy cheeks and pleasure of imagination atttend thy dreams and when length of years make thee dreary of earthly joys and the curtains of death cling around thee to finish thy existence may the angel of god take care that the expiring lamp shall not receive one rude bast to hasten the extinction and finally may the saviors blood wash thee from all im purities and at last usher thee into a land of everlasting felicity domestic happiness there can scarcely remain a doubt in the minds of any all the railing on the subject to the contrary notwithstand ing that the true sphere of worldly happiness is decidedly

gaunt crane the hissing serpent and the frightful alligator entered according to act of congress in the year  by john p jewett and company in the clerks office of the district court of the district of massachusetts cassy or early trials cassy or early trials chapter i the swamp it was a wild gloomy evening the wind blew in fitful gusts and whistled round the corners of the mean tenements in which dwelt the slaves of a large landed proprietor in the state of mississippi two women were seated on low stools the elder one was hardfeatured and stern looking the other was thin and delicate her eyes were red with weeping and a little child about five years old almost naked nestled in her bosom we are going to have a stormy night said the latter but i will go i can bear this no longer julia returned the other think better of it you will go to certain death how can you expect to reach a place of safety without money or friends there will be thousands of miles to travel there will be rivers to cross there will be forests to wander through o julia think again better to trust to the woods and waters than trust to this hard taskmaster my husband fled where he is i know not but i hope he is not far from the land of freedom master says he is hidden near here and that if i do not discover his retreat he will beat me nay worse than that he says he will tomorrow sell my child from me as the poor woman said this she strained again and again her little one to her bosom the storm within was so tumultuous that she thought not of the storm without she seized a little bundle of clothes which she had ready and taking her child in her arms she rushed out and fled towards the forest cassys master and mistress fear of pursuit lent her wings she flew rather than ran until she found herself in a part of the forest where the trees were so thick and the ground so covered with brushwood that her bleeding feet could carry her no farther without resting nor did she notice until then how much the storm had increased since she left the plantation my child my child this is terrible exclaimed she as a tall tree at a little distance from the one under which she had stopped was riven with a loud crash from top to bottom by the lighting while the thunder instantly broke over their heads with a deafening peal little cassy hid herself in the scanty skirt of her mothers gown she was terrified at the darkness which was rendered still more frightful by the frequent flashes of lightning which revealed for the moment the wild and trackless forest in which they had sought shelter when morning dawned the rays of the sun could scarcely penetrate through the thick foliage of the trees the poor wanderers were weary cold and hungry yet they could not stop they could not waste their precious moments in seeking for food or rest the knowledge that her absence from the plantation must soon be discovered added to her terror and seizing in her arms her child with increased force she pushed her way through the brushwood and went on and on until she came to the edge of a swamp which she had heard spoken of as being many miles distant from the entrance of the forest she paused to look around her to what a wretched place was she come the ground as far as the eye could reach was covered with stagnant water from which proceeded a sickly smell large trees were standing in the swamp but the fetid water was fast destroying their trunks soon they would fall as well as the steeplelike fungi which grew beneath and add to the general decay from the boughs of the trees hung tangled masses of dank moss showing the damp and unwholesome atmosphere this was a familiar place to the gaunt crane the hissing serpent and the frightful alligator whose faint musky odor loaded the air the poor mother thought but little of all this she was free o happy word free she had taken the first step she doubted not but that she would accomplish the rest alas poor woman how could she expect with a child in her arms to perform what so many others had failed in doing alone she did not know the means that are taken to discover fugitives she did not know the hatred a master bears towards his runaway slave julia who knew it would be death to breathe for any length of time the noxious atmosphere of the swamp ascended a little eminence on which stood a grove of cypresses she then gathered together a few boughs and made a sort of little hut for here she intended to remain for a few days subsisting on roots and berries until she supposed pursuit would be over and then bend her steps to the river trusting to the charity of some kindhearted man to take her in his boat up the river mississippi she felt how deep were her wrongs and she could not but believe that the relation of them would create interest and pity in the breasts of freemen mammy why do you stay here all day asked cassy again and again i am so hungry do let us go back my child returned the mother do you want to be taken from me that bad man whom we called master said he would sell you and that you should go and live among strangers i should not be with you my darling to take care of you you would be quite quite alone we have come here to be free tomorrow we will set out on our journey to the country where there are no slaves do you see that little bird hopping among the branches continued the mother pointing upwards if we reach that happy land we shall be free as that bird do you want to go back no mammy no but do let us go on i dont like this dreadful place chapter ii the capture my little readers i will not dwell upon the terrible incident that followed suffice it to say that the mother one night was startled out of sleep by the deep baying of a dog which had scented her footsteps through the brushwood a yell of agony burst forth as the dog seized her and she would have been torn limb from limb had not some men called him off they were led back to the plantation and the next day both mother and child were exposed for public sale in the market they stood silent and dejected they were unfettered for there was no occasion to put chains on a poor woman whose feet were torn with briers and whose shoulder was stiff and sore by the gripe she had received from a fierce bloodhound her head hung down her hands were clasped in agony but a keen observer might have seen a restless wandering of the eye the heaving bosom and swelling nostrils as a man of savage aspect stepped forward and examined cassy with an intention of bidding for her the sound of wheels was heard approaching within a carriage was seated a lady of gentle mien who was passing by unconscious of the horrible scene that was being enacted the mother forgot her pain and suffering in her anxiety to save her child she ran to the carriage and clinging to it exclaimed pity pity good kind lady what do you want said mrs hallfor that was the ladys name buy my child buy my little cassy mrs hall was greatly affected at the poor womans distress but what could she do she was going a journey of above a thousand miles she was going to live in a free state and would have no need of slaves the lord will reward you continued the woman earnestly she is an active little child and will wait on you hand and foot discovered but if i buy her she will be separated from you i cannot buy no lady i know you cannot i have but a short time to live but i shall die happy if i know she is with you o if you have children of your own think of my feelings if my little one should fall into the hands of the man who is bidding for her the woman had touched a tender chord in mrs halls heart she had had a little daughter a sweet fairhaired child who within the last few months had fallen a prey to the scarlet fever which had ravaged the country she said no more but descending from her carriage followed the mother to the market and communicating privately with her master she became the owner of little cassy the poor mother pressed her child to her breast she kissed her again and again she laughed and wept by turns but her joy and love triumphed over every selfish feeling she turned aside and joined the group of wretched slaves who like so many cattle were patiently waiting to be driven home by their new masters to pursue their daily round of tasks mrs hall took cassys hand and led her to the carriage the variety of the scene the novelty of riding the kind words and looks of mrs hall soon turned her tearswhich at first flowed abundantlyinto smiles and though she was timid and fearful lest she should do any thing to offend she could not refrain from expressing her wonder and admiration at every thing she saw mrs halls first object was to procure for her little companion suitable clothes and then they set out upon their journey up the mississippi for though of late years mrs halls home had been in the neighborhood of natchez having lost her husband and only child she had determined to return to the home of her youth on the banks of the beautiful river ohio cassys mother found no purchaser she returned to the plantation with the other unsold slaves but she was a changed creature she was quiet and docile and seemed to have lost all energy and spirit she did as she was required and had no inclination to rebel she cared not for herself but she would have gone through fire and water to save her little one her child was free it would be kindly treated it would be taught and would receive more care than she could have given it o how the poor mother loved her child when she returned to her dwelling how she missed its pretty prattle which though it cheered her on through lifes stormy journey had often cost her such pain and anguish when thinking that it might be torn from her that she would have gladly seen it laid in the cold grave how she cherished the one or two trifles that it had loved nay more than that the poor mother sought for its little footprints in the damp mud through which it had walked on the way to the market and daily did she kneel down and press to them her trembling lips a fact when heavy rain came and washed them away she felt as if she had been robbed of the last trace of her little darling chapter iii the new home little cassy felt very happy when she found herself in her new home and her surprise was very great when mrs hall showed her a little room which she said was to be her own it was so pretty and comfortable that cassy said if she only had a gay macaw like those she said her mother had seen in africa she should feel just like a little princess for kings and queens could not have a prettier room than hers was mrs hall could not give her a macaw but her father gave into cassys care an old favorite bird which he said she was to call her own it was not always kept in the cage but was often allowed to fly about the room for it was so tame that it had no wish to leave its home he also gave her a pretty little dog named carlo as soon as they were settled in their new abode mrs hall procured some books in order to instruct cassy and that she might have the advantage of a companion she offered to teach with her mary clay a little girl from the village whose parents though very respectable were poor and unable to give her much education at first cassy was very slow in learning for neither she nor her mother had ever had the least instruction but she was so attentive and tried so much to learn that she made great progress besides teaching her to read and write she taught her to sew and knit and how to keep her room tidy and every morning she fed the chickens and looked for the eggs and made herself in other ways useful she used to be very happy when mrs hall would talk to her about the good god who sent his only son into the world to save sinners and mrs hall told her that god loved black children as well as white and that he had prepared a beautiful place for all those who love him and keep his commandments cassy tried in every way to please mrs hall she would sit for hours together watching her to be ready to get any thing for her directly she wanted it mrs hall in her turn loved her little black girl and found her a great comfort in her lonely hours cassy in her new home with mary clay mother said cassy for so she was desired to call mrs hall  how kind it was of you to buy me and bring me here how lucky it was for me that you were passing just then it was not luck cassy nothing happens by chance it was gods will that you should find a friend in me and it was he who directed my steps towards the place where your poor mother saw me and he put into my heart the feeling of pity which led me to buy you how much happier i am than the poor slaves i left behind methan my poor mother added cassy her eyes swimming in tears i wish they had all good friends like me so do i cassy replied mrs hall but it is not so you should pray for your poor countrymen and ask god to give them kind masters and to make them patient under their trials but would he hear me asked cassy anxiously i should not know what to say god is very willing to hear all who ask him returned mrs hall and a few words do quite as well as a great many mrs hall then taught her a short prayer asking god to bless all the slaves and particularly to watch over her poor mother cassy quickly learned it and said she would say it every night and morning for she hoped so much that god would comfort them and make them happy one day cassy ran to mrs hall in great haste saying o mother mother the air is full of feathers and the ground is covered with them enough to make ever so many beds and pillows indeed said mrs hall smiling run and bring me some in your hand cassy ran out and her astonishment was by no means diminished when the feathers as she supposed them to be disappeared upon the palm of her little black hand it was snow which is seldom or never seen so far south as the state of mississippi one evening mrs hall invited a number of children to come to her house it was christmas time and she liked every one to enjoy themselves at that happy season it was so glorious for us that christ came down upon earth to teach us what we ought to do after supper mrs hall took them into a room where there was a beautiful little fir tree planted in a large flower pot and lighted up by a great many little wax tapers which were placed about it from the branches of the tree hung bonbons and presents for all the party there was a purse for one a pencil case for another books for some playthings for others for cassy there was a pretty workbox fitted up with scissors thimble needles pins cotton and a great many other useful things the box was too heavy to hang from a branch so it was placed on the flower pot at the foot of the tree cassy was delighted with her christmas gift and thanked her dear friend again and again for giving her so pretty a present and told her that she would try to sew very neatly that she might make for herself all her own clothes chapter iv the mischief maker although mrs hall loved the little black girl there were a great many people who did not like her the servants were jealous of her and mary clay took a great dislike to her she used to call her names and laugh at her black skin and woolly hair i wonder what you are come here for you little ugly nigger said she one day we must take care how we leave our things about for they say all black folks steal o mary indeed i would not steal returned cassy i never stole any thing in my life dont tell me said mary if you have never stole it is only because you could not find any thing to steal you will be in prison before very long i dare say and then what will be the use of all your fine clothes you mean little slave poor cassy burst into tears this treatment was so different from any she had ever before received at dinner mrs hall noticed her red eyes and inquired what was the matter cassy told her what had passed and mrs hall comforted her by saying she did not believe she would take any thing that did not belong to her she desired her to repeat the sixth commandment which she had learned in her catechism thou shalt not steal and she explained to her how she would offend god by breaking it mrs hall afterwards spoke to mary and reproved her for behaving so cruelly mary told her she was sorry and would not do so again but instead of really feeling sorry she was very angry with cassy for telling of her and determined to do all she could to injure her in mrs halls good opinion cassy was particularly fond of gay colors and any little pieces of silk or velvet that were given to her she thought a great deal of and in her leisure hours employed herself in making them into patchwork one day mrs hall brought down stairs a bag which she opened before mary and cassy it was full of scraps of silk of all shapes and colors and she gave each of them any they wished to have i dare say cassy took them excepting three or four pieces which were of larger size than the others and which mrs hall said she would reserve for another time cassy admired the larger pieces exceedingly they were so gay and bright and kept them in her hand until mrs hall had put all the others in the bag when she rolled them together and put them at the top mary had remarked how much cassy admired them and wondered within herself whether she was intending to take them and determined to watch her and then tell mrs hall several days after this mary thought she would look into the bag to see if the pieces of silk were goneas she fully expected to find the case instead therefore of going straight home to her dinner as usual she went only a short distance and then turned back and after ascertaining that mrs hall and cassy were in the garden she ran up stairs and opened the bag but to her great disappointment there lay the pieces of silk on the top just as cassy had put them in it would have been well for mary if she had closed the bag and gone away to her dinner but satan who is always ready to persuade us to do wrong was at hand and tempted her on and on she had sinned in suspecting cassy of stealing satan had thus found an entrance into her heart and would not leave her without doing further mischief she took out the scraps of silk and closed the bag with hurried steps and a fluttering heart she ran to cassys room and concealed them under some linen in her clothes drawer she then left the house fearing and wondering whether any one had seen her she thought not that gods eye was upon her she thought only of being revenged on a poor little innocent child in a strange country and almost without friends mary fully expected that mrs hall would go to cassys drawer as she often did and discover the pieces but it so happened that either she did not go for some weeks or else she went but did not notice them mary therefore became very impatient fearing that her scheme would fail she did not know what to do to draw mrs halls attention to them as she was anxious to do as she was afraid of cassys finding them herself and in her surprise showing them to mrs hall one day when she and mrs hall were alone in cassys room cassy having gone out on an errand for mrs hall mary observed that cassys drawer was partly open so she slipped to it when mrs hall was engaged in writing and pulled forward the pieces of silk o how pretty said she unrolling the little bundle and going towards mrs hall i wonder where cassy got these from mrs hall instantly recognized the pieces of silk for she had remarked cassys admiration of them cassy said she as she entered the room where did you get these from they are not mine mother they were in your bag but they were found in your drawer continued mrs hall in my drawer exclaimed the astonished child you did not give them to me no i know i did not give them to you therefore how did they come in your drawer indeed mother said cassy i am sure i do not know i am sure i did not put them there cassy said mrs hall sorrowfully are you speaking the truth mother said the little girl as the tears chased each other down her black cheeks i am sure i never will tell you a storyyou who are so very good and kind to me mrs hall now looked towards mary who was gazing through the window with a confused air mary said she have you seen these since the day i put them into the bag no maam said she firmly but without looking at mrs hall how came you to find them i was passing by the drawer and saw them peeping out that could not be the case returned mrs hall seriously i was close by just before you spoke and noticed the open drawer but there was nothing of the kind to be seen there o yes i am sure there was indeed there was i know cassy wanted them and i dare say she took them i dont believe she did take them mary said mrs hall who recollected what had passed between the two children a few weeks previously i hope you did not put them there if you did as i fear is the case you have acted most cruelly towards this poor little girl mary if you were in a strange country with only one friend would you like some one to try to make that one friend hate you supposing i had believed that cassy had taken them and i had sent her to prison or sold her as a slave should you have been glad would you not be sorry to see a fellowcreature suffer without deserving it you have father mother and plenty of friends yet you are jealous because cassy has one i am very sorry you should have such an unkind feeling in your heart i dont care whether you love her or not answered mary sullenly but i dont see what business niggers have among white people mary returned mrs hall quietly do you not know that god made us all of the same flesh and blood do you think that because you happen to be white god loves you better than cassy who is black no indeed god loves those who are good who is the best you or cassy you have told a story you have tried to ruin cassy in my estimation that she might lose the only friend she has i do not think that cassy would tell a falsehood and she tries to do what she knows is right i assure you mary at this moment god loves the black girl better than he does the white one mrs hall then told her that as she considered herself too good to be with cassy she had better not come to school any more mary angrily left the room she was very much annoyed at the turn the affair had taken and would willingly have undone it all she liked learning and had really been very glad to be instructed with cassy she had studied with mrs hall many things that were not taught in the village school not only had she begun to play on the piano but mrs hall had promised to teach her to draw in the spring on inquiry mrs hall discovered that for some time mary had been in the habit of tormenting poor cassy and she had told the servants that had it not been for the learning she got she would never come into the house again love your enemies chapter v the runaway slave mrs halls brother having business in the south by mrs halls request he went to the plantation where cassys poor mother was to make inquiries respecting her with some difficulty he learned that she had died a few months after the departure of her child as soon as her earthly care was provided for she drooped into the grave cassy cried very much when she heard that her mother was dead for she had indulged in a hope that she should see her again indeed she often talked of the means she would take to earn sufficient money to buy her mrs hall consoled her by telling her how much better off she was for she would be sure to meet with love and mercy from her heavenly master if unable to do so from her earthly one one evening as mrs hall and cassy were strolling by the river side they observed a negro approaching them he had no hat on but an old handkerchief tied round his head his clothes were torn and he had on neither shoes nor stockings still though so forlorn in appearance he was a pleasant looking man his eye had a quick intelligent glance and the expression of his mouth showed he was a man of good disposition as he drew near for a moment fear and distrust were depicted on his countenance but they vanished as he addressed mrs hall pardon me madam said he i am a poor man sadly in want i have not tasted any thing excepting a crust of bread i begged for twentyfour hours will you grant me food and shelter for a short time mrs hall perceived that he was weak and weary and desired him to go immediately to the house madam said he i observed your kindness to that little girl which led me to hope you bear no ill will to my unfortunate race if a runaway slave asked your protection would you deliver him up to his enemies never returned mrs hall who instantly perceived she was addressed by one of those unhappy beings you may depend on me as a friend as she spoke she led the way through the garden and entered the house by a door which opened on the veranda she took him into cassys room on account of its being the most retired as she dared not trust all the servants with the information that a runaway slave was in her house she then proceeded to the dining room where dinner was already set and sent by cassy sufficient food for a good meal and afterwards provided him with clean clothes when all the servants had gone to bed mrs hall sent cassy to tell the poor man that she wished to speak to him cassy returned after being away some minutes with tears of joy in her eyes and her face radiant with smiles the slave mother mother exclaimed she he says he is my father he says he is sure he is for i am very like his wife julia and that he had a little girl named cassy that he lived on a plantation near natchez and ran away three years ago his name is francis and i remember quite well that was my fathers name then followed a great many explanations for there was no doubt about franciss being cassys father and it was very pleasing to mrs hall to see these poor creatures locked in each others arms talking over all they had done and suffered since they parted francis was much affected when he heard of the death of his wife he said he had hoped long ago to reach canada and that it was his intention to devote the first money he earned to buying his wife and child but adverse circumstances had detained him on the road this length of time he had met with sickness with dangers and had it not been for the kindness of a gentleman who interfered he would have been retaken and carried back to the plantation he came from they say madam continued francis turning to mrs hall that we ought not to run away but submit patiently to our lot the lot in which god has placed us it is easy for free people to say so but were they slaves they would not submit to all we have done they say we are well clothed and lodgedit may be so but that is not all we want the cattle at our masters plantations are as well off as the slaves we want to have homes of our own we want to have our children educated in short we want to feel there is something to live for francis said a great deal to mrs hall about her kindness in taking cassy he said he never would forget it and hoped he would one day be able to show his gratitude at an early hour the next morning the carriage was at the door mrs hall and cassy entered it and they drove away but within a short distance from the house they overtook cassys father who had been desired to walk slowly on and taking him in they drove to the railway depot here mrs hall not only supplied him with money but she spoke to the conductor of the train whom she knew and requested him to do what he could to advance his flight that he did so mrs hall was made acquainted one morning by a letter bearing a canadian postmark it was not written by francis but the words were his though he employed some one else to put them on paper for he could himself neither read nor write he thanked her for her great kindness and prayed heaven to bless the friend of the slave chapter vi the stolen child a few months after the events related in the last chapter there was a great excitement among the slaveholders for from some cause or other many slaves men women and children had run away from their masters plantations the newspapers were filled with advertisements and the walls in many places were covered with placards giving descriptions of the offenders and offering rewards for their apprehension many people whose business was not in a very prosperous condition now turned slave hunters and some were not particular whether the description exactly agreed or not but seized on any unfortunate colored person whom they found defenceless and bore him off to the supposed masters to receive the reward or else to the slave market to be sold on their own account one day when mrs hall was gone out to pay some visits cassy went into the fields as usual watching the lambs skipping and running races and feeling as happy and lighthearted as they did she had every thing she wanted she had the best friend in all the world her father was safe in a free country and her poor mother had no more pain or sorrow but was in a better country still presently her attention was arrested by seeing a man on the other side of the fence she wondered what he could be doing but as he seemed to be picking up something she took no more notice of him for a few minutes when looking the same way again and not seeing him she thought she would go and look what he had been picking up she had scarcely put her feet down on the other side of the fence before the man started up from beneath it where he lay concealed and seizing hold of her dragged her roughly across the field poor cassy screamed with terror but alas her cries were unheard by all save the affrighted sheep and a night owl who left her nest in the hollow trunk of a tree and screeching as she flapped her heavy wings mingled her cries with those of the stolen child it was some hours before cassys absence was remarked and when it was observed the servants took but little notice of it until it was getting ting late and they were expecting mrs halls return they then sought for her and great was mrs halls consternation to find that the child was missing poor little cassy who can imagine her feelings dragged away from a happy home by a fierce bad man and with the dreadful prospect he dragged her roughly across the field before her of being sold as a slave she begged she implored she entreated but all was of no avail a man who could steal human flesh and blood was not likely to be moved by tears he roughly pulled off her shoes and stockings and casting a look of disapprobation at her pretty frock he rubbed his coarse hand over her neatlycombed hair for her tidy appearance would have belied his assertion that she was his runaway slave cassy knew not what to do she at length ceased to scream but her tears flowed fast they walked on a long way until cassys wearied limbs and bruised feet refused to carry her any farther when a man with an empty wagon passing them cassys companion asked him to allow him to ride as he had been so fortunate as to capture his runaway slave and he wanted to get on a steamboat with her as soon as possible the man lifted cassy in and took his seat by her side the driver did not look unkind and the child observing a pitiful expression cross his features as he saw her bleeding feet began to tell him her pitiful story but was immediately stopped by the man at her elbow these little rogues make up such good stories for themselves that they sometimes almost deceive their masters but it wont do with me i assure you they wont run away twice from me i reckon tis a pity they should ever try it returned the other it is seldom they get clear off and if they are taken i guess they suffer for it i am not his slave indeed i am not interrupted cassy in spite of the hardhearted mans efforts to keep her quiet pshaw said he you wont make the gentleman believe that she is my property and if my property leave me i reckon i have a right to get it again if i can you have the law on your side any way returned the driver sorrowfully descending from the wagon and lifting cassy out who clung to him with both arms and i guess i must not interfere with the laws chapter vii the escape they were on the steamboat cassy looked around but no friendly eye met hers no one seemed to heed or care for the poor little girl she did not address any oneshe knew it would be useless she had tact enough to see there was no one there who would listen to her story or who would believe it if she told it it was getting late and the man pointed to some bags which lay in a dark corner and desired her to lie down all hope was gone for by morning cassy knew they would be many miles away from her dear home tears flowed abundantly down her swollen cheeks suddenly they were arrested and she fervently clasped her hands mother said i must pray to god if ever i was in trouble and that he would deliver me from it or else comfort me and make me able to bear it i never thought about that and i am going to bed without saying my prayers said she as she rose shocked at her forgetfulness she knelt down and said her usual short prayer and added o god let this cup pass from me she had often talked to mrs hall about those words they were now the first that came into her mind and she thought they would do as well as any others then she recollected that they were christs own words when he was in trouble and she was glad she had thought of them after all said she to herself i am not so badly off as he was there is no fear of my being put to death i will work very hard for my master and try to please god as she thought this sleep closed her eyelids and she slept sweetly and soundly until she was awakened by a man shaking her roughly cassy looked very much frightened she could not think where she was or how she came in such a strange place she thought she had been at home in her own little bed by degrees the truth flashed upon her and caused her tears again to flow then she thought of her prayer of the past night and her determination to do as her new master told her she followed him silently for they were going to land as the man intended hiring a wagon at this place to cross the country as they stood on the wharfthe man engaged in earnest conversation with a friend he had accidentally met on the boatcassy was startled by the grasp of a strong hand on her arm fellow said a manly voice what business have you with that child whats my business is none of yours i reckon returned the other trying to force cassy from his hold help help cried the gentleman as he seized the man by the collar of his coat this man is a child stealer escape from bondage but no help came as is often the case when human help is wanted none is at hand and the man seeing the turn the affair was likely to take and being cowed by the unhesitating manner of the gentleman twisted himself from his grasp and fled down a narrow alley the gentleman whose interference was so well timed was no other than mrs halls brother who was unexpectedly returning from his journey in the south he was standing waiting for a boat when he observed a man leading a crying child down the steps that is a poor little slave thought he who has a hard master he stepped back in the shade of some buildings to watch them more narrowly when to his great surprise he recognized his sisters little favorite words cannot express the gratitude poor cassy felt at this happy escape she kissed her deliverers hand again and again she was so affected she felt as if her little heart would burst the expected boat soon came up and they took their places in it a lady who was also a passenger and had a little girl of about the same age as cassy supplied her with shoes and stockings and a shawl to protect her from the cold cassy thought they never would come to the end of their journey she was so anxious to reach home so anxious to tell her dear friend that she was safe and well how pleasant it is to go home at any time but doubly so when danger has threatened us abroad and we go home to peace and happiness who cannot imagine the feelings of cassy as she recognized each familiar object thought little of when within her reach but cherished o so fondly when believed to be gone forever cassys little dog was the first to greet her it was lying on the green turf in the garden but cassys footsteps ere her voice reached its ear arrested its attention it was by her side in a moment leaping up and licking her hands and face and howling in the very excess of joy and delight carlos barking brought to the door mrs hall and the servants the former felt truly thankful that her prayers had been heard she had done all in her power to recover the child but she knew that it was the hand only of providence that could lead the little wanderer home the servants welcomed her back with real pleasure for when she was gone there was not one who did not regret her absence she was always so cheerful and good natured cassy said mrs hall as she was preparing to go to bed have you thanked god for your wonderful deliverance no mother but i will mother added she earnestly when in the boat i remembered your words and prayed to god to deliver me from my trouble the next morning when i did not expect it at all help came dont you think god heard my prayer yes cassy indeed i do returned mrs hall you see how powerful god is chapter viii the last next morning when cassy awoke she was in a burning fever occasioned by the violent excitement she had undergone her frame always delicate could not withstand the shock mrs hall watched tenderly by her bedside she cooled her heated brow and moistened her parched lips but the fever increased she was delirious many days at one time she would call loudly for help and in the most touching accents would seem to entreat the passersby to save her then she would pray and would say i will be patient indeed i will be good and she would nestle down in the bedclothes for a few seconds then again she would almost jump out of bed with terror and fright many days passed by the fever abated but left the poor child so weak and low that great fear was entertained for her recovery the whole house was wrapped in great gloom even carlo seemed to know that he must be gentle and still for instead of jumping on her bed as he usually did and frolicking about he crept silently into the room and looking at her as she lay motionless and almost unconscious he gave a low whine and then curled himself up in a distant corner of the apartment the bird which hung in its usual place seemed to partake of the general sadness its wings drooped and its song was seldom heard i do not say that it was aware of cassys illness but though fed every day without doubt it was not so carefully tended as it would have been by its little black mistress after long confinement to a sick room how pleasant it is to leave it to breathe the sweet pure air how balmy does it feel on a warm day in the month of april after being long deprived of it cassy felt it so as she was carried out into the garden and laid on the sofa all nature seemed animated and cheerful at the return of spring all seemed glad and joyful excepting mrs hall and with a sad heart she watched by cassys side for she saw plainly that a few more weeks would take from her her little favorite she had a painful duty to perform she did not think it right to see the child under the impression that she would get well when the doctors had said that all human means had been tried and that she was fast sinking into the grave one day when cassy was rather better than usual mrs hall knelt by the sofa how is my little cassy today asked she o much better i think directly the warm weather comes i shall be quite well o i do so wish it was here and that i could run about again carlo looked at her and gave a low whine but cassy it may be a long time before then returned mrs hall sadly summer may bring many changes then dont you think i am better cassy in your complaint people often feel nearly well when they are really very ill indeed am i going to die exclaimed the child her eyes filling with tears and clasping her hands as she bent forward to catch mrs halls answer my child said mrs hall it would not be kind in me to tell you you were better when i thought differently nothing is impossible to god he may see fit to restore you to health or he may see fit to take you to heaven during the next half hour few words were spoken but cassy cried most bitterly mother said she at last will you talk to me again tell me more about it if i were to say said mrs hall that i was going to take you to africa to the home of your mother and that you would see her there and birds and flowers more beautiful than any you have ever seen you would be very happy i know you would well cassy you are going to a home more beautiful than africa in africa you would feel heat and thirst and pain but in heaven there is no pain nor sorrow nor sighing the bible tells us that god sits there on a white throne surrounded by glorious angels who with harps in their hands sing beautiful songs about god you like singing cassy in heaven you will hear sweeter singing than you ever did on earth mrs halls words comforted the poor child and in a few days she became quite reconciled to the idea of death and could speak quite cheerfully about going home may mary come to see me i should like to see her once again asked she mary came but her manner was constrained and cold she feared that cassy would reproach her about the pieces of silk but they were not mentioned indeed cassy did not think of them she thought only of loving every body mother said she about a week after this do you think i shall die today i have such a pain in my chest is it very dreadful to die i trust my child returned mrs hall you will suffer very little pain you must think of christ whose agony was very great indeed and that will help you to be patient cassy dear your pain cannot be worse than his think how he hung on the cross how dreadful it must have been to have nails pierced through his hands and feet and then he had a spear run into his side and a crown of thorns placed on his head besides this he had not even water given to him when he was thirsty but vinegar made still more disagreeable by having bitter gall mixed with it o no mother my pain is not nearly so great as that and it was not of only pain of body continued mrs hall that he suffered but his anxiety of mind was worse than the pain of his body he thought of the sins of the whole world and how sad it must have made him to see so many wicked people about him yet he died willingly his great love for us caused him to give up his life that we might share in the eternal happiness of heaven on a serene beautiful morning in the month of may a small funeral procession might be seen winding its way to the village churchyard the light coffin was covered with a white pall the solemn ceremony was performedearth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust the little black girl the despised negro was consigned to the grave but her soul had taken flight to dwell for countless ages through all eternity in the mansions of the blessed cornelio or the false vocation new york p oshea  bleecker steeet  entered according to act of congress in the year  by p oshea in the clerks office of the district court of the united states for the southern district of new york c a alvord stereotyper and printer cornelio or the false vocation we often confound with vocation the complacent dream of pride holder i two centuries ago there lived in magdebourg a family that presented a striking example of the effects of labor and economy there was not one who did not know and esteem honest wilhelm grusner the mastercarpenter all that he possessed was his industry and his two sons albert and cornelio grusner had founded an establishment if not sumptuous and important at least honest and respectable of course it will be supposed that he made his sons two aidsdecamp albert was particularly useful to him and it would have been very hard to decide whether wilhelm or albert worked the most assiduously at his daily task so albert though only twentytwo was as much esteemed as those who are many years older and more experienced there was not a mother who did not wish him for her soninlaw his future life seemed clearly traced before him it was not so with cornelio baptized with this italian name on account count of his having had for godfather a sign painter from milan cornelio who had attained his eighteenth year had no particular inclination for his fathers trade he became more and more tired of the compass the rule the plane and the hammer on the other hand he conceived for painting a perfect enthusiasm had he any spare money he quickly spent it for pencils and colors then he would employ the precious hours that should be devoted to his work at tracing out shapeless sketchesfor the poor stripling artist had but nature to direct him and in his behalf nature had not been as liberal as she had been to carregio claude lorraine and other geniuses so richly gifted cornelio had more ambition than means to attain his end in the first place he would have required a master but he had none wilhelm grusner was always furious whenever he found in his house a strayed paint brush and he thrust his hand through more than one piece of canvas thats it cried the carpenter more daubings more nonsense why lose so much time and money in things that will never be of any use believe the sense of a workman and the tenderness of a father it is not right that you should have notions that later will be pernicious to you cease then your painting and follow the example of your brother er ah he is a workman he is and i predict that he will make his way as one may well imagine cornelio though respectful towards his parents did not want for excuses to oppose those paternal remonstrances he always undertook to cite the example of artists crowned by fame but he did not name such as had died either in misery or despair in those kind of struggles cornelio was it is true seconded by his mother who adopted without reserve all her sons ideas so then whilst the father was proud of the work and the practical skill of his albert madam grusner was puffed up with the artistic efforts of her cornelio there came a moment when one should give up to the other it was grusner and when he had a right to command he swerved from his severity so that mina his wife should not be afflicted cornelio is now at liberty to follow his inclination for painting he multiplies the number of his sketches his portraits his frescoes and there was not a wall in his fathers house but what was covered with colors by the apprenticepainter he felt very happy when an order was given for the first portrait one of the wealthiest traders of the fair of dantzick master petrus greinlich had confided to cornelio the care of handing down to posterity his own remarkable effigy and cornelio nelio gave him the worth of his money petrus greinlich was delighted to see that the artist had made him a superb velvet doublet bound with orangecolored satin a real lace collar and a hat with feathers the whole figuring on the perspective of a palace you will be a great artist exclaimed the brave trader quite flattered at having it so cheap now you see my dear said mina to the carpenter that i was right to favor our sons vocation but the carpenter shook his head in token of incredulity some time after this wilhelm grusner was struck with apoplexy and he died whilst uttering those sorrowful rowful and prophetic words poor cornelio poor cornelio well said master greinlich one day as he entered the house of widow grusner now there my young artist you must not be so grieved you have shed enough tears and you have sufficiently proved your filial piety work in its turn must take its place resume your painting but my dear mr greinlich what can i do i am so disheartened i have good news to communicate to you the respectable curate of our metropolis has seen my likeness he is delighted with it and he immediately determined upon confiding to you the decorations of a chapel to me exclaimed cornelio moved and excited with joy to you my dear friend yes to you tomorrow you can begin the undertaking with reason has it often been said that men consider very little whether they are suitable for holding certain situations as long as those situations suit them so cornelio accepted the good offer that was made without reflecting if it were not more prudent to refuse it to enter upon such a serious undertaking thorough knowledge arid set rules would have been necessary but where had cornelio learned the science which the task demanded nevertheless he accepted it as soon as the scaffolding was ready he mounted it full of ardor and vanity indeed it was curious to see his hair standing upright his flashing eyes his compressed lips he having all the appearance of one inspired perhaps minus the inspiration as he leaned on the edge of the scaffolding he took care to look if he were observed then he would assume an authoritative attitude what a pity he made such bad use of the brush that he handled so well and that he had but the hat and dress of titian otherwise let us pardon him his little extremes of vanity it is next to an impossibility that the first success does not produce like effects from morning till night cornelio was there in his chapel dabbling zealously against the walls which would have probably complained if they had had a tongue our artist sought most assiduously the display of flashy colors and neither did he spare skyblue chromeyellow or scarletred at a distance you would have taken it to be an aviary of birds of paradise from time to time good artists came and cast an ironical glance on the work but cornelio did not heed them or else he attributed those demonstrations of criticism to pure jealousy rivals cried he envious fellows we well know what it signifies and to put a stop to the underhand jealousy of those he called his enemies he enclosed his chapel in vast draperies he hoped by this means to obtain great success by surprise on the inaugural day he had already conceived in his mind the praise he was to receive and the words he would return in thanks a conquering king would not feel more important on entering his capital what disappointment for poor cornelio when the day that was to ring forth his triumph had come a great crowd composed mostly of artists writers clergy worldly men were there in the body of the chapel waiting for the painter to draw aside his tapestry hangings the resounding bassvoice of master greinlich exclaimed see now if my protoge is not worthy of the honor granted him oh when i interest myself about people i take care to know them well and esteem them according to their merits the examination took place we shall not say that there were various opinions various criticisms nor that they came to blows nor tore each others hair to defend more or less the merit of the work an unanimous opinion prevailed throughout the crowd it was manifested by the loudest the heartiest and the most prolonged laugh that had ever been heard in germany petrus greinlich himself seeing the general hilarity contrived as he struck his big stomach to laugh outright as the rest cornelio pale mute and confounded ed did not at first understand the nature of this demonstration he was even at a loss to conjecture its cause but he could not so far doubt of his own merit as to misunderstand the general feeling a cold sweat trickled down his forehead his knees bent under him and the unhappy man sank down upon a bench that chance had very fortunately placed near him the shouts continued to be heard and cornelio as if moved by some sudden impulse rose up muttering in a groaning tone my god my god he opened a small door marked by the woodwork and opening into a hall that led to one of the side entries off the church the air of the street brought him a little to his senses he ran on precipitately and only stopped to breathe when he arrived near his fathers house there again cornelio was struck with a novel sight contrasting however with the one of which he had been a witness on a little square on which was situated the house of the grusner family a crowd of people was assembled their appearance was bold and picturesque their costume simple popular and poetic those men wore beaver hats or caps on the side of their heads and brown woollen cloaks on their shoulders their demeanor betokened a spirit of independence and a stern gravity which did not exclude gayety they all gazed towards the house as if expecting ing some one or something a window opened albert appeared on the wooden balcony then the robust lungs of all those tradesmen shouted forth a thousand bravos whilst the words reechoed long live albert grusner the king of carpenters in the middle ages and even since that epoch the greater number of associations of tradesmen elected a king on a certain day which was generally on that of the patron saint of the parish in one group cornelio heard these words which mortified him exceedingly albert is indeed worthy of the homage which we pay him he is a good and brave tradesman he has not his equal in all magdeburg he is not like his lazy brother who shuns his fathers trade to be an artist yes said another voice but im sure his behavior will bring him illluck in cornelios present state of mind this sorrowful prediction excited still more his exasperation forgetting all caution he approached the group and exclaimed in a voice full of terror and anger that your evil warnings may fall upon your own head you fool i am cornelio whose conduct you blame the man thus addressed coolly replied your rage proves one thing that you are in the wrong if you had no remorse of conscience you would not shout so loud this sensible answer instead of calming the artist enraged him the more and he cried cursed be this town cursed be its inhabitants i shall go seek justice elsewhere and never shall i put my foot into this house where vulgar labor receives the honors due to genius as he finished this abrupt declamation he retraced his steps dashed through the crowd and disappeared ii indeed cornelio had no particular view when he left magdeburgno thought for the future and we could add no means he had thought but of one thingto escape from the scene of his humiliationto hear no longer the sarcasms pronounced against his paintings and the acclamations that welcomed his brother such feelings were condemnable whosoever runs the risk of criticism and flatters himself with high expectations should endure animadversions patiently secondly the success of a brother should rejoice and not grieve the heart hut so it was cornelio was deaf to all but the turbulent voice of his passions he wandered away from his native city he rushed on breathless and exhausted insensible to the beautiful scenery and to the monuments which presented themselves to his view what had become of this love of art this desire to contemplate the masterpieces of great men since the hour of his departure cornelio had not entered a church an irresistible movement led him on not knowing what road he was following finally the absolute want of money stopped him exhausted too proud to solicit public charity our traveller sank down at the angle of a wall determined to wait stoically that hunger which would deliver him from the wretchedness of this life a rough voice made him shudder well what is it said some one theres a fine looking fellow pale and emaciated without answering cornelio raised his eyes and saw before him a robust personage of dark complexion and of eccentric costume his belt filled with daggers and pistols like a corsair or highwayman i perceive said this man that fatigue has overcome you drink first a little of this and he handed him a gourd then we shall make acquaintance a little of this genuine liquor revived vived cornelio who of a naturally confiding disposition had soon made the unknown man acquainted with his sad experience in return said the latter i shall also speak frankly my name is ralph dickson the sea is my country with a few brave companions i have undertaken expeditions and followed the glorious example of christopher columbus americus vespucci vasco de gama such a trade affords honor and profit each of our voyages would enrich a whole city with the quantity of gold and precious stones we amass and bring back it is the thirst of adventures the hope of new discoveries that tempts us incessantly to risk our own lives just now i am charged to recruit here and there strong and able companions who would replace those whom fever fights and storms have carried off for i will not deceive you there is great peril in our trade you appear perfectly disgusted with the existence you have heretofore had and you seemingly wish to shun your fellowcitizens the best way then is to follow us take part in our undertakings and you will reap great advantage the prospect of adventure pleased cornelio who made few objections to the shrewd manuvres of captain ralph he consented to go two days after the above conversation cornelio embarked at hamburg burg on the ship pluton she was a fine sailing vessel and she was amply furnished with war provisions though our former artist was of a hardy and adventurous disposition his inexperience in the art of navigation soon drew upon him the railleries of his companions those men who hardly pronounced a word without blaspheming were ignorant of the first laws of politeness arid they consequently threw aside all restraint to live for pleasure to obtain money at all hazards to spend whilst on shore to have always in hand either a bottle or dice such were their habits cornelios mind was too refined not to suffer by this contact and sometimes he would so far manifest fest his disgust as to wound the pride of the pirates who sought in every way to take revenge they handled him roughly and more than one of them threatened to throw him overboard if he then had ever been in a way of painting it would have afforded him some consolation but on the pluton arts were not spoken of war and pillage were their only occupations the whole crew had sworn a ferocious hatred to cornelio and such was his life when one night ralph dickson gathered around him all his men on the deck my friends said he we shall now manuvre cleverly to gain a stand in the little bay you see yonder glimmering in the twilight tomorrow morrow at dawn of day a rich spanish galleon the trinidad will pass this way to take in supplies i am rightly informed like tigers we shall rush upon this promised booty if we succeed in taking it our fortune is made courage then and no quarters no quarters repeated the pirates cornelio resumed ralph you are accused of being a coward you dislike this lifein a word you tremble before danger who accuses me of that demanded cornelio whose eyes flashed with fury never mind said the captain it is essential that you put a stop to this talk by your conduct henceforth tomorrow you shall have the honor to be the first to attack thank you ralph i shall prove that i am not a coward the next day indeed the trinidad came in sight the pirates manuvered tolerably well to ply windward and to gain the broadside of the enemy without any particular damage the grappling irons were cast cornelio with axe in hand dashed forward closely followed by his comrades but no sooner had he put his foot on the spanish vessel than he uttered a loud scream and threw down his arm wretch traitor howled the pirates and one of them struck his sword with all his might on the head of cornelio who fell senseless on the deck however the struggle raged on with inexpressible fury life was at stake and no one asked or had mercy the clashing of irons the reports of firearms mingled with the horrible imprecations of the corsairs the groans of the wounded and the death agony of the dying the beautiful weather the splendor of the sun made a striking contrast with this scene of desolation the right cause won repulsed on all sides the freebooters were either obliged to plunge into the sea or reembark precipitately they had left but one prisoner in the hands of the spaniards it was cornelio the poor fellow horribly wounded seemed as it were not belonging to this world from time to time he opened his eyes feeling a little composed by the care that was given him but he had no knowledge of the situation nor of the place he was in thus the days passed on and though slow a change for the better took place sometimes a wellknown voice would affectionately whisper in his ear courage this startled but revived him he heard them also say do not yet show yourself excitement would prove fatal at length this mystery ceased when the sick man was nigh restored to his health a man who by his appearance and his dress seemed to be the doctor of the ship approached cornelio and said to him in a kind tone my friend yon were in very bad company and in consideration of your being wounded and a pirate our brave sailors would have thrown you into the sea if it had not been that providence sent you wonderful protection think over in your mind of the name of your liberator indeed sir i cannot say you do not know replied the doctor with a smile you are yet weak i understand  that nevertheless think againperhaps memory may aid you what person in the world has your interest the most at heart alas said cornelio sadly who could it be but my poor dear brother but what chance is there of my ever seeing himabove all here my brother that i left stealthilyungrateful that i am for he was happy honoredand vile jealousy entwined my heart with her serpents oh my good albert that you may some day forgive me  i forgive you said a voice that he had already heard several times the convalescent screamed opened his arms and albert wasfolded to his heart after this first and sweet emotion a few explanations were exchanged cornelio accused himself unceasingly hush hush said albert do not fatigue yourself the doctor has forbidden excitementlisten then to me at the moment of your sudden disappearance the greatest inquietude overwhelmed us having vainly searched for you in the town we were convinced that you had left magdeburg new researches were fruitless   my mother was dreadfully grieved but what was her despair when she learned accidentally that you had embarked on a pirate vessel seeing her wasting away sick in danger i offered to leave and go seek you were it to the end of the world god directed me as i am now near you and that i can take you back to her who awaits you impatiently cornelio overwhelmed with emotion pressed his brothers hands another thought floated in his mind tell me why you are so thoughtful tenderly asked albert must i confess it answered cornelio indeed i dare not speak well then i was thinking of the humiliations i experienced in our native place have i been sufficiently scoffed at how can i ever appear before my fellowcitizens have a little more philosophy brother if you are the first to laugh at this mishap no one will henceforth think of railing at you in such cases it is best to meet jokes halfway besides magdeburg does not worry about the sign painteralbert tis past be calm i shall say no more and when we shall have arrived at home you then will be at liberty to painti shall work for both of us at this last sentence cornelio became absorbed in deep reflections three months after this eventfor at that time vessels were not propelled by steamthe two brothers entered magdeburg albert so as to deal gently with his mothers sensitiveness had already written to announce their speedy return how their hearts beat as they knocked at the door it was night the house seemed to be illuminated in an unusual manner the servant opened the door at the sight of the brothers she uttered a scream and with one hand covered her eyes flowing with tears what is the matter said at the same time albert and cornelio ah jesusmaria why have you returned speak speak my god my god why speak then wretched woman your poor mother well is dead a double groan responded to this distressing news the two brothers ascended hastily and as they crossed themselves they entered the room where mina was reposing both fell on their knees sobbing and sobbed out the words mother mother a man who was religiously watching the dead woman extended his hand to the afflicted young men and said gravely be strong be resigned mina was tired waiting for you and she has gone to protect you from on high this friend that providence had sent there was greinlich ah my poor mother said cornelio i alone have caused your death wretch that i am i have overwhelmed you with sorrow and i arrive in time to behold the result of my faults cornelio said the old man god reserved for you this great lesson now you can understand how much you were in the wrong to despise your fathers profession o mr greinlich o my mother and you my dearest brother i take you now as witness to my sincere repentance from tomorrow i shall second you in your labors never shall i murmur and believe me that the worthless painter will

where we find the hero of the following story at the age of ten valentine duval was left an orphan after the death of his father and mother he was alone and desolatehaving nothing to his name but misery it were vain for him to solicit the pity of the villagers for they were as poor and as needful as valentine was himself nevertheless with hope and courage one meets if not fortune some favorable chance this thought strengthened valentine his village claimed him no longer on the other hand the world was wide before him he set out one morning but before leaving he entered the humble little church and offered up one of those fervent prayers which cannot fail to be heard by our father on high valentine is on his way alas how cold is the poor little orphan he shivers his teeth chatter his benumbed feet refuse to carry him he is famished with hunger and besides an unknown agony is wasting away his frail existence twenty times is the weary little traveller on the point of stretching down oh the snow and awaiting in its icy shroud an inevitable death but a secret voice a divine presentiment urged him to take courage oh lord oh lord murmured the orphanand he tottered on at length he perceives a tiled roof oh happiness a housea farmthere is hope valentine presses his stepshe arrives he reaches the gateway he falls exclaiming help help for gods sake on awaking from his swoon he perceived around him three or four persons whose appearance was indicative of goodness and compassion an aged man particularly fixed his attention this man was endeavoring to warm valentines hands unfortunate child said he so young and so destitute whence do you come my little friend valentine told him the name of his village that his father and mother were deadand tears rolled down his cheeks when i found myself alone in the world added he i had no other wish but to die but our curate exhorted me to be patient and he told me that providence would not abandon me i started then with the hopes of getting something but shall i have strength to continue my journey the old man gazed at him with paternal tenderness and exclaimed oh why am i in such a deplorable situation otherwise i should have been pleased to adopt you for you appear a good lad but tomorrow my farm will be sold tomorrow after thirty years hard labor jacob kauffmann will be driven from his old homestead you can have hope but i have none whilst the farmer spoke valentine felt that inward pain which agonized him on his way he uttered a stifled groan and fainted valentine was attacked with smallpox that dreadful malady was then snatching its victims by thousands for jenner this benefactor to whom there should be one hundred statues had not yet made known his admirable discovery of vaccination how could valentine recover cast as he was into the most abject misery having for nourishment but hard crusts steeped in water and lying on an old pallet with scarcely any covering it was a mystery and his recovery was probably the work of that providence whom the orphan never invokes in vain however the young traveller was on foot and he was on the point of his departure so as to be no further charge to the good kauffman when the latter anticipating his resolution said my child you are now well thank god i have been able to care you a little on account of my creditors allowing me time now i must indeed quit this farm and hire myself out to strangers do you likewise think of earning your bread at your age it is dangerous to live by begging it inclines to habits of indolence oh that is not my intention mr kauffman tis well listen then to what i am going to say there is notfar  from here a hermitage where a few pious men have retired from the world to consecrate themselves to god and prayer their only riches is the possession of four or five cows which afford them milk and cheese will you become the guardian of this little herd willingly i have spoken of you to those good fathers of your gentleness of your honesty they are disposed to receive you when you wish i shall take you thither i can accompany you now said the boy resolutely he added it will spare you at least one meal the farmer took his protg to the hermitage where valentine again was welcomed when jacob kauffman went on his way home the childs gaze followed him wistfully he should ever love this excellent old man who had saved his life ii from the day that valentine entered the house of the kind hermits lie found the peace and happiness of a quiet life he had bread to eat it was not indeed the comforts of a home which you enjoy dear readers but it was an easy an honest occupation in the midst of natures own quietude valentine began the day by prayer he terminated it in the same manner he never neglected his religious duties he who had no father to protect him no mother to care or caress him what consolation lie found in the thoughts of god and the blessed virgin who is the true patron of innocence in contemplating the beauties of creation he acquired the knowledge of a being whom he venerated as the author of all things the master of life and of destiny the employment of his time was well regulated the young herdsman did not restrict himself to the driving of his cows from meadow to meadow he found no pleasure in stretching himself upon the green sod as those do who lead that life though he scrupulously fulfilled his task his thoughts were elevated and noble a great change was operating as if unawares on his mind this change was a thirst for learning how had this simple child divined the invaluable possession of intellectual knowledge how had the love of study proved to him that the science of the firmament is called astronomy that related events of nations were termed history and that the form of the earth the positions of countries towns and rivers were comprised under the title of geography we cannot say and howsoever it may have been he had not received those ideas from the lips of the hermits with whom he had been but so short a time it is to be supposed then that valentine had learned by the greatness of his genius by the intensity of his studies all that professors have taught for centuries admirable example of patience there is a young man who imposes upon himself a law of becoming not only a scholar but a genius once having made inroads through the regions of intelligence he lingers not on the way in default of instruments he invents he constructs his own instruments and geographical maps he learns something each day each day he increases his stock of knowledge iii one afternoon valentine was sitting at the foot of a tree with his head bent over a species of map wrought in bark he was so wrapped up in his own thoughts that he seemed lost to aught else around those words what are you doing there my boy caused him a sudden start he instantly looked up and perceived a man dressed in an elegant hunting suit not in the least intimidated by the brilliant appearance of this personage he quietly answered sir i am seeking the road to quebec to quebec repeated the stranger in utter amazement do you know what quebec is why sir do you indeed suppose me so ignorant quebec is the principal city of canada well answered my boy you study geography then during your leisure moments oh sir it is my passion and astronomy and history but i dont know latin oh if i had books you shall have them my friend you shall have them exclaimed the stranger then suddenly fifteen or twenty persons all richly attired came forward and exclaimed ah prince you are here we were seeking you to finish the hunt we were growing rather uneasy my horse carried me off and led me astray but i dont regret this incident for it has furnished me an opportunity of making a wonderful discovery which which exclaimed all present the discovery of this herdsboy indeed murmured disdainfully some of the young noblemen gentlemen said the prince sternly suspend your opinion this boy whom you see will rise far above many who are placed high by rank and fortune instead of besotting himself by this life in the open air by sleeping away the hours of life while his herds graze he has appreciated the advantages of learning he has aimed at becoming a scholar and i confess that his answers have astounded me your name my boy valentine duval you will become illustrious that name will yet be known come with me the education which you have so well begun shall be completed but i belong to the hermits i shall send them one of my officers to apprise them of your departure no no my lord i should be ungrateful to leave so abruptly allow low me to return with my herds and bid them farewell be it so valentine you are as good as you are learned the herds boy whistled for his cows and disappeared in the direction of the hermitage iv three years of study at the college of m completed the studies of valentine after this novitiate coming out as professor the young man was nominated private librarian and professor of history by one leopold at luneville henceforth his fortune was assured here is the use he made of it in the first place he sought out kauffman the poor man was yet living but so miserably that he hardly earned what would keep him alive and that little was obtained by the sweat of his brow do you remember me mr kauffman asked valentine no sir i am that orphan whom you saved so generously when you were depressed yourself by reverses of fortune the old man uttered a cry and tenderly embraced his former protg heaven has blessed me resumed the young man a worthy prince gave me means of instruction and has placed me near him but i have not forgotten you i have come to offer you the means of spending the rest of your days in comfort a cottage a little garden and a pension drawn from the salary of valentine were the return of kauffmans charity as to the good hermits their exdrover boy had not lost sight of them at his desire and at his expense their pious retreat which the inclemencies of the weather had in a decree impaired was restored and built up valentines fame became so great that the emperor francis called him to vienna to establish a cabinet of medals there in the midst of the great and the learned valentine lived many long years the goodness of his heart remained unchanged pride was unknown to his mind and ambition had no place in his soul an admirable model for those who propose seeking and acquiring knowledge a bright example for those who possess it history of the mulligan guard  history

mike with a wink thi being agreed to the party broke up and started in dif lerer directions with the exception of widow mahoney who remained at her battery and proceeded to turn water enough into her whiskey bottle to make up for the treat she had stood dickens has said that barkis was willing well let it also be recorded that mulligan was willing when captain hussey poured into his ear the contents of his heart he jumped at the proposition as a terrier goes for a rat he did more than this he gave mike fifty dollars towards arming and equipping the guard and the bold captain turned away almost too happy to contain himself in fact he was too happy to contain all of that fifty dollars and so he proceeded to take several  sups and to drink health and success to the mulligan guards who and what are the mulligan guards was already being asked in captain husseys wake but let us stick close to the history we are writing after getting over his spree a bit captain hussey found paddy mcgloin and together they visited simpsons the eele brated armorer in the bowery for the purpose of purchasing equipments for the guard the artist has given a graphic representation of the scene to which words are almost superfluous both captain hussey and lieutenant mcgloin are there displayed in all their glory as is also the worldrenowned simpson who is showing them relics of past wars and offering them for a song       the hstory of the mulloan guard      captain hussey was very much taken with a jagged sabre which simpson informed him upon his word and honor selp me was worn by the duke of wellington at the battle of bos worths field having a tinge of romance about him as well as a love for old heroes captain hussey determined to arm and ornament himself with this historic weapon as for lieutenant mcgloin he being so far the only other member of the guard he was obliged to put up with a musket yet to satisfy his ambition and inborn pride simpson assured him that it was borne bravely in the thickest of the battle of waterloo and that one of napoleons old guard fell clasping it to his bosom and shouting for the iamperial laglas thus satisfied the captain paid the bill and away they went whistling le sabre de mon pere the captain drawing his sword and the guard  shouldering his waterloo musket and marching along behind greatly to the delight and astonishment of the bowery pedestrians that night the guard had its first drill at the grocery store of widow mahoney captain hussey had plovided himself with a book of hardees tactics and was fully prepared to put the guard  through in a way to bring out the sweat although several people watched the drill no one took part in it for quite a while save paddy mcgloin but after watehing progress some gamins applied for admission to the ranks and two or three of the bestlooking ones were accepted then the drill began again in earnest captain hussey waved his sword in one hand and his book of tactics in the other why the divil dont yees shoulder arms he yelled as the guard gave evidence of indifference to his orders bekase im tired replied paddy u out  a ojr laucl niver bef tired     o    rt tristouy of the

land saying which she proceeded to nuss him then the drill was resumed but it soon became evident that paddy had been  nussed too much for he was a trifle un steady on his pegs and kept the party roaring by attempting to obey orders even the captain was showing the effect of the milk he had taken and was giving impossible orders mixing the members of his command up in a fearful mess but the boys enjoyed it hugely as with brooms and mophandles they were going through the manual of arms bedad i can do betther than that mysilf said mrs ma honey coming out from behind her counter come on thin misthress mahoney said mcgloin will yees try a drill widdy asked the captain faith i will she replied loudly begorra yees shall be the daughther of the regiment shouted paddy whereat the others

be aisey now said she now go ahead wid yer drillin captain tintion fats that asked the widow thats lookin at me so it is said hussey ill do that same shoulder arms the command was obeyed pretty well only paddy mcgloin felt so good at the close proximity of the widdy that he thrust his bayonet into the ceiling overhead as he was shoulder ing his musket kape down yer murtherin tool said the widow about face march in executing this order the widow mahoney was so much taken up that she tumbled over one of the smaller members of the guard and catching at paddy to break her fall she brought him to the floor with her tipping over a tub of pickles a box of smoked herrings and a basket of potatoes in the midst of which the demoralized guard floundered swashed and cussed for a few moments before regaining its feet but the widdy had been badly used while down to say nothing of the ruin to her stock of goods and she was as mad as a short tailed cow in fly time seizing paddy mcgloin by the hair and managing to get on top of him she banged his nut up and down in the briny confusion making a pestle of his head to mash the pickles and potatoes which lay upon the floor be neath them in vain he shouted that he had enough in vain he shot for help and it was only when captain hussey attempted a rescue that she left paddy and went for him but he leaped upon the counter and drawing his sword managed to keep her away bad luck to yees for a pack of batea  ahe yelled          t  iiistory of tie mulligan guaid the ruction at widow maiioneys tih wirdow aiead faith i think im bate said paddy struggling out of the mash and rising to his feet git out ov this shouted the enraged widow at this moment a policeman attracted by the crowd that had gathered around the door of the little grocery entered to inquire the cause of the rumpus its just nothing at all at all said mrs mahone suddenly comprehending the situation we wus afther havin a bit of a drill mr mcguire thats all thats all be gob but i thought ye wur tearin the house down replied the officer looking around och twas paddy an i havin a bit of a love spat thats all were the mulligan guard so we are well dont get so lovin ony more wid yer guard said the policeman as he turned to go faith we wont   thai hstory of the mulligan guard     this slight interruption to the drill resulted in the interest of the organization after all for jerry orourke and teddy sul livan came into the store and at once enrolled themselves as privates subject to drill of the mulligan guard each of them borrowed a bearskin cap and musket from their friends and thus equipped they returned to finish the evenings drill by this time the widow had put up the shutters of her little grocery store and the guard  had put down a goodly quantity of her bad whiskey so things were in easy working order then the drill began again the boys being kept in the back ground and particular attention paid to the men but some how things were continually getting mixed and presently teddy sullivan in shouldering his weapon got it wrong end to and banged widdy mahoney on the none with the butt end of it as she was approaching with a sup  for the gallant captain teddy got put out of doors by the indignant widdy and didnt get in again that night however the drill broke up by all hands going to sleep in the grocery and remaining there until the next morning the next night another drill was had at which the hon mr mulligan was present and expressed himself as very proud of his namesake then he treated all hands left a tendollar bill with widow mahoney for future sups for the bys and took his leave the next thing on the programme was to carry out the pro posed target excursion a band consisting of a concertina and banjo player was engaged and also a huge darkey to carry the target the turnout created a great excitement in the seventh ward there was a tremendous crowd gathered around widow ma honeys grocery and when the bold and gallant captain hussey led his guard into the street one long loud shout rent tl e     the hstory of the iullwaa n oiard         tuie hstory of the mullgan uaidu air which caused the captain to straighten up with a deeper bend in his back than ever a crowd followed them while the police found considerable trouble in keeping a road open for the march but when the guard halted in front of the residence of the hon mr mul ligan and mistress mulligan came out and presented captain hlussey with a huge wreath the shouts of the throng and the noise of the band was perfectly deafening mrs mahoney had followed them up to this point and so full of happiness was she now that she shouted vociferously and knocked down two or three other women who presumed to laugh at the appearance of the mulligan guard but away they went  through jackson street up to avenue a still followed by a shouting crowd of admirers it was a great day for the east side after a long and triumphant march the guard at last reached jones woods where a halt was made and preparations entered into to prepare for shooting at the target there were several prizes to be had for the various grades of marksmanship and all hands were anxious to get a crack at the target the darkey was to boss the target and feeling his import ance he at once started off with and set it up about fifty yards from the spot selected for shooting the captain was the first to go for the bulls eye he took an ordinary musket but after firing the darkey reported no sign of the bullet this made hussey feel rather bad and when a few of the crowd laughed he turned upon and offered to fight them all for a cent apiece then paddy mcgloin braced up for a shot but his bullet did not record itself in the target and again the crowd howled and paddy got revenge by kicking a little boy then teddy sullivan took a shotat something probably not the target for he did not hit it and the crowd yelled and   the hstory of the mulligan guard     captain iiussey began to feel that he was not alone in his misery the darkey by this time concluded that he was in as much danger of getting hit where he was as he would be behind the target so by the time jerry orourke got ready to fire he had taken the target and waa holding it in his hands when jerry fired that darkey dropped like a bullfrog and a cry went up that he had been killed a rush was made for him when he got up and began to search for the hole in his anatomy but it was not found or felt but a hole was found in his old felt hat whereat jerry was hailed the victor and award ed the first prize he having shot nearest to the hulls eye then the crowd shouted again and a fight was imminent and greatly needed but captain hussey seized the target and ran away followed by the guard arriving at a convenient place he procured a small auger and began boring holes in the target fats that for captain asked private mcgloin be jabers this is to save the reputation of the mulligan guard exclaimed the captain vehemently hows that asked the guard faith wud yees have the bulls eye go back widout beil hurted widin ten feet the members of the guard saw the point and at once com mended their bold leaders ingenuity the target was handsomely fixed the name of each mem ber written opposite of a certain hole and the reputation of the mulligan guard made secure then began the preparations for dinner and it was a regular seventh ward lay out and no mistake a pound of crackers a pound of cheese and a square gallon of whiskey composed it of course there was too much cheese and too many crackers but being generous men they gave this surplus to the boys who accompanied them to see the sport and absorbed the red eye themselves     so  the hstory of thej mulligaff guard   th hstory of the muigau ouard       it was nearly night before this portion of the days sport in cluding speeches and toasts was concluded and then prepara tions were made for the homeward march during the dpay the leader of the band entered into negotia tions with an itinerant drummer whom he found on the grounds out of a job he filled him full of whiskey and engaged him the fact of being drowned by the vociferations of the public made the leader feel cheap and hence the addition but that homeward march how shall it be described the glories of the day culmin ated in that tramp and the writer lacks the eloquence of pen to place it properly before the reader to begin with captain hussey was in high feather the target had been crammed full of glory and the guard crammed full of whiskey the additions to the band in the shape of the snare drum touched the martial heartstrings of every partici pant and when the word was given forward march and the band began to play it seemed as though each man was gifted with wings and a tenhorse power pair of lungs there are momentsof inspiration in this life there are times when that inspiration will expand there are great and momentous occasions when the spirit of a people will culminate in a song or hymn that will decide their destinies and create character for the future historian the mafrselaise god save the king yankee doodle watch on the rhine shoo fly tramp tramp tramp and other immortal hymns are evidences of this spasmodic in spiration so also in this instance the words of the mul ligan guard were not writen they sprang into wild and burning existence on this occasion as the guard left jones woods the band played a lively march and it is supposed that the band was momentarily in spired and the members of the guard yea even the enthusi         tile htstoiry f tie mulluian guaid private mcgloin as he appeared a moment after firing the an cient musket so eloquently recommended to him by the enthusiastic simpson speaking aftenrwrda of the senaationa he experienced while whirling around in the air like a fourth of july pinwheel private mcgloin said lie telt sure that he had been kicked by the father of mules the truth was that old gun had been loaded for a great many years and private mcgloin added another charge without knowing it so after all the old tube wasnt so much to blame for kicking as it did   the hstory of the mulligan guard       astic gamins who followed it all joined in the chorus of the hymn which was born of the genius of the occasion we shouldered guns and marched and marched away from jackson street way up to avenue a drums and fifes did sweetly sweetly play as we marched marched marched in the mulligan guards isnt there whole hunks of inspiration in that chorus it was certainly a grand sight to see them march on their return home the tramp to the field of glory did not equal the return therefrom in the first instance they lacked the ia    ho the darkey showing hs hat and the mark of mcgloins shot         the hstory of the mulliga guard spiration of success and whiskey two of the greatest incentives of our natures and the crowds which followed them when they went out to victory were nothing to those which hailed and accompanied their return old and young caught the spirit and melody of the newly hatched hymn and all the way from jones woods back to jackson street were those grand heroic words taken up and given breath loud huzzas greeted the guard on every side and even the policemen who are generally ready to put down anything in the shape of a lowpressure riot forgot the requirements of duty and took up the glorious song joining in it with a will and swinging their hats to fan the fires of the general enthusiasm but if all this glory attended the guard on its way home what shall be said of its reception at the grocery store of widow mahoney the widdy  was fairly beside herself had it not been for some of her female friends she would have stood on her head in fact she attempted it several times and was exceedingly in dignant that she was not allowed to have her own way in ex pressing her excessive delight but the  headquarters was a lively place during the remain der of that day and night widow mahon y no longer put a price upon her liquid ohbejoyful but all who could crowd their way up to her counter were welcome to partake provided they drank to her pets the mulligan guard in fact every thing she had in her store was at the disposal of anybody who was or pretended to be friends of her  hy   the hstory of the mulligan guard          the hstory of the mtlligan guard night was already fooling around the seventh ward and excitement centered around the little grocery of widow ma honey the prettiest girls in the neighborhood sought the place and if ever heroes were laurel and lovecrowned it was that valliant mulligan guard presently the band mounted upon some barrels began to play donnybrook fair and then there was excitement and selecting of partners such music as that could not run to waste and before many bars of it had been gone over it was being put down upon the sandy floor of that little grocery as only live irish lads and lasses can put it down captain hussey took the buxom widow mahoney and they proceeded to rattle the dust out of the cracks of that floor the widow weighs only a trifle less than two hundred pounds and at dancing a jig she owns to no equal in the land hi i  she screamed as she footed it  hows this for hoigh u good enough i  shouted everybody hi i wheres

dance until everybody else was down and off their pins finally teddy be gan to weaken and yet mrs mahoney seemed to be as fresh as a daisy and kept up her rubadubdub in good old irish fash ion making the floor creak and bend at every step while the dust rose in choking quantities and kept the remainder of the party coughing and sneezing or wetting what dust they swal lowedwetting it down so to speak by taking free drinks of the festive widows whiskey and yet teddy hated to acknowledge himself beaten the eyes of the entire party were on him and he was determined to put in his very last step but fate was against him and at last he spoke to his partner are yees there yet widdy be gob i am dont yees see me she asked crossing over and planting one of her big feet quite near to one of teddya

lave mysilf a corpse at yer feet bully for you shouted the crowd come on shouted the widow whoop hi yaand at it they went all others giving way and all interest centering on the now perspiring widow and the gallant captain round about forward and back rub adub dub went their feet for the next half hour and yet that fat widow showed no signs of giving up the contest the room was crowded and every door and window was full of interested looking faces but at length the captain began to cave there was a curious indecision noticed in his step a languidness in his break down and finally he retired and widow mahoney was hailed a the jig queen of the seventh ward then followed refreshments and a merry night was had of it in the widows little back room stories were told songs sung pretty girls kissed and courted the widow complimented and everybody voting it the happiest occasion that ever was and a fit finale to the first days triumph of the guard it was past midnight when the party broke up and then they did so with the full song and chorus of the now celebrated mulligan guards it was a great occasion and ended with noise enough to waken the soundest sleeper in the ward the band did its duty after which the drummer fell over into a barrel of soft soap and slept soundly until morning            tie hstory of tiie mulligan guard  the final scene  grand contest for jig superiority

and the old homestead where lived father and mother brother and sister and above all the wife of his bosom and darling children all yea all were idols of his heart he had written to his family the wee before so they were somewhat expecting him  but still he intended to surprise them it was a beautiful harvestday in the month of july the road was clean and hard and the weary horses trotting leisurely along had just turned the corner from the woods out upon the turnpike where the scene before them was most beautiful to behold the silvery little lake just on the right was like a mirror in the lap of earth on its further shore towered up the church steeple from among a cluster of neatly painted cottage         home on a fuirlougii dwellings all familiar to the soldier the old mill the store and the schoolhouse were each pointed out to the driver and then the hard smooth macadamized road so straight for miles with its milkwhite fence on either side and the moving golden fields of grail on the left the green pasture where the kine were feeding and the snowwhite sheep re clining was most enchanting to belold just here the soldier spies a large grey squirrel bounding from the fence next to the grain field to a large tree with his mouth full of wheatheads just look a there ex claimed whittaker see that villain makes me think of the rebs hes made a raid on that wheatfield now see him skedaddle the reapers are approaching from just over the hill bending to their work with their heavy cradles cutting down the golden grain ah says the soldier that puts me in mind of how we mowed  c down meaning   home on a fuirlough     the rebs at antietam one of the laborers hearing the remark of the soldier looked up when joseph whittaker recognized his own brotherinlaw halloo

possible no says the soldier taint possible i tell ye its me hurrah for our side and with a xvill the five hard laborers gave three cheers for the union soldier upon which the stagedriver and passengers gave three more and a hearty laugh followed when the loud crack of the whip sent the horses flying down the road the soldier standing erect shouted to wilson to come down ton iht but wilson had already dropped his cradle and was running at his best speed up across the lots t         home on a furlough to tell his wife of the arrival of her own dear brother from the war in the meantime the stage had got away in the distance and the soldiers countenance grew sad for they approached the grave yard where slept the iemains of his brother who fell by his side in a severe engagement the summer before stop here said the soldier and the driver reined up close to the stile leading to the village deathyard as the weary soldier alighted he remarked to the driver my home is just over the hill you know beyond the cemetery and ill walk up across lots after i visit my brothers grave and go in the back way dont tell the folks as you drive by that i have come the stage leaves him and hurries on turn ing the corner half a mile below and jogs slowly up the long winding hill approach ing the summit and just rounding over the top of the hill the driver beholds a group of   home on a fuirlough     persons in a beautiful little yard just before a pretty brown cottage straining their eyes toward the coach as it swept by them the driver barely hearing the remark of the old gentleman who headed the group as he ex claimed no joseph today the coach flies on and we leave it and turn to the fa mily in the dooryard old mr whittaker and his wife and younger daughter of sixteenl summers were there besides the daughterinlaw josephs wife with her little children one a sweet babe of eleven months who had never looked on his fathers face father whittaker turned tremblingly from the gate toward the house as the coach disappeared from view exclaiming well well disappointed again yes replies the old lady such is life ah me disappointment is the common lot of us all and she sat down with a sigh upon the oaken settee beside her younger daugh                         home on a furlough ter and resumed her work again winding yarn and the daughterinlaw wiped away the falling tear and yet full of hope ex claims never mind well see him tomor row maybe hopeful creature bless her dear soul mutters the old man as if talking to himself and then thinking of his dead son who was sent home from the battle field embalmed in his countrys flag and in his countrymens heart but a year ago his mind turned toward the graveyard and one expression set the disappointed group to crying but helen the daughterinlaw arose saying oh come it wont do to brood over disappointment the lord is better than all our fears let us go in to tea but really i did expect joseph to sup with us tonight and the

for the southern district of new york   hopes anchor t seconnet and charley hope it was at seconnet point on the rhode island coast in the summer of  that i first met in his manhood the person who gives name to this sketch at seconnet one of the most picturesque points of all the new england shore and one that would be more frequented if there was more actual seeking for health and less for the attractive fashionable dissipations of wateringplace life i was thoroughly wearied and beaten out with city life and the july heat was terrible then when not quite decided where to go for relief i met a wellknown master of the piscatory art who said go down to seconnet and west island a dozen miles southeast of newport you will catch any quantity of health and seabass n the island and i have pulled in stripedbass there ranging all the way up to the forties so i obeyed and went to newport by boat thence by carriage around by the head of rhode island mount hope and the stone bridge and down the main land to seconnet point              iopes ancior the seconnet house stood perhaps it still stands i have not seen it since that summer at only a hundred or two of yards from the rocky beach at that extreme point of little rhody which almost joins massachusetts and looks across the open atlantic towards the entrance of vineyard sound it had cheery piazzas overlooking the sea with a sufficient air of fashion and resort to warrant something better than the makeshift style of larder and cookery and yet rurallooking and pleasantly homelike between it and the sea the single field was a pleasant grassy lawn with a few paths worn across it to the verge of the bluff almost beside it ran the hardbeaten road leading away to what pretended to be the abodes of a higher civilization behind it at only a few rods distance commenced a belt of woods stretching away to an unbroken forest and swamp and offering as tempting walks in its outer portions as it supplied of impassable thickets and detaining quagmires to the thorough explorer across the water westward only three or four hundred yards rose west island high and rocky crowned with the two or three houses which afforded shelter and supplied refreshment to parties of the ruder sex who came down to seconnet for fishing only it seemed that one could almost have stepped across such a little distance where the water must be shallow but keener eyes could detect  the viciousness of the surf that broke white around the dangerous rocks even in the calmest weather and there were not wanting those who remembered upset boats and lost lives in crossing that diminutive reach the seconnet house was not full in the profitable   hope s ancithor  significance of the word but it contained quite enough inhabitants for comfort and enjoyment a very consider able number of providence people a lesser representation from other rhode island towns and their suburbs a score of bostonians half a score of new yorkers and even a few from philadelphia and the westthese made up a quite sufficient variety in age sex costume and character promenades at all hours whortleberryparties to the woods in the morning bathing and fishingparties to one point or another of the beach or to the island hops at night to the music of the piano a violin and a flute these with the inevitable amount of maternal watchful ness and matcharranging of paternal comings and goingsaway of flirting and gayety among the young people made up a very respectable field for observation and as i have already said for enjoyment by any one not too exigeant i have said that there were a few new yorkers at the seconnet none of them chanced to be acquaintances of mine and yet there were a few of whom i knew quite as much as if i had enjoyed that privilege mrs wilmerding wife of a wellknown and wealthy merchant attracted my attention within a few minutes after reaching the house i do not say that i should have laid quite so much stress on the presence of the handsome but pass woman of fortyfive but for the fact that she was accompanied by her only and petted daughter clara whom i had known without introduction or acquaintance and loved in the same way that we love children statues and pictures through at least two winters of opera and              ioies anchor street rencontre mr wilmerding as i had no difficulty in understanding had been unable to leave his important midsummer mercantile transactions so far behind him as seconnet whence he could not visit the city oftener than once or twice a week and consequently his wife and daughter who felt or fancied the need of that peculiar rhode island coast air had been allowed to make their way east and to seconnet without his accompanying when the mere remark is made that clara wilmerding was very handsome nothing whatever has been said of her what i should like to convey of her is that her beauty was of the most refined and fragile order always seeming to bring up that singular but expressive phrase the wealthy curled darling whether that peculiar characteristic lay in her soft brown hair in her softer brown eyes in the transparency of her complexion or in the rounded litheness of a form not often equalledi cannot pretend to say i only know that the next natural thought after falling in love with her was that of all the women in the world this delicious little bit of human flesh aud blood should be taken care of carefully housed and tended wrapped up and fenced against every evil and misfortune to the extreme of shakspeares idea that  the very winds of heaven should not be allowed to visit her too roughly ah welli had more than once said to myself seeing the smiling and most amiable girlish beauty flashing light over an opera parquette or meeting her cloaked and hooded in the hallway when some performance was over ah well she will marry some time i suppose but j      i   hopes anchor          what a pity of pities it would be if she should so marry as either to find unhappiness or meet misfortune that delicate soul and that tender form of womanhood would be alike incapable of enduring either wrong or adversity let me add that clara wilmerding seemed exceedingly well chaperoned even without her fatherher mother being one of those sternlymatronly women capable of exercising the strongest spirit of command even if they show an occasional deficiency in the more winning qualities i should also add that as i afterwards dis covered the wilmerdings had been at seconnet for some thing more than a week before i reached that place i saw miss clara on the piazza very soon after my arrival it was early evening when i saw her again and under circumstances which threw me into a profound fit of reflection the old country habit of boyhood sent me wandering alone out into seconnet woods to hear the birds sing their farewell song of the day and catch the first damp perfume of the early evening at all events this i did on that first evening at the beach after temporarily exhausting the attractions of the shore during the afternoon and the result was that second glimpse of miss wilmerding i was slowly strolling back towards the hotel through one of the byepaths which in their very sight suggested long promenades and confidential communications the spot being far enough from the house to make it nearly sure that the ordinary average of visitors would not venture so far when silent myself i caught the low murmur of voices near me and the next moment caught a glimpse of                                      hopes anchor two figures passing along an intersecting byeroad a little broader than the one i was traversing which led down into the very deepest recesses of that part of the wood which the theatrical people would call  practicable it is surprising how much we sometimes see in an instant just as at other times we stupidly gaze for a much longer period without recognizing what lies plainly before us i had not on that occasion looked at the couple who passed without seeing me more than sixty seconds when iknew that they were in love with each other there was that in the attitude of the lady leaning fin the true sense of the word on the arm of her attendant in the upturned glance which i caught under the evening light and the bending down of the other face above that countenance of girlish beautythere was that which told the whole story in the most attractive manner and that which could no more be doubted than it can be described it was not only the two attitudes attracting my atten tion there was something more quite as important though entirely in connection with the effect already described not only was clara wilmerding evidently in love but she was in love withwhom a handsome young fellow enough certainly with his tall figure wellcut and energetic stripling face and air of under standing precisely what he intended to do and how it was to be done but then this person upon whose arm the daughter of the new york merchant was leaning so confidingly was such a stripling and then he wascharles hope   itopes anchor         in order fully to understand my surpriseand may i not add my dissatisfactionit is necessary that i should explain who was charles hope and what i knew of him i knew nothing wrong or unfavorable of himthank heaven for that it was not the young fellow but his circumstances with which i was momentarily quarreling i had known his father a man of moderate means connected with an ironmanufacturing house at provi dence and whose death occurred about  i had made occasional visits to the house of the elder hope robert during the later years of his lifeone or two of them before he became a widower and his only boy a half orphan and at least two others after the death of mrs hope when the boy was approaching but had not fully reached manhood i had melancholy reason to know too that beyond high spirits and probable good qualities young charley had inherited nothing from his father whose last days had been embittered by the failure of the house with which he was connected and the duty which he recognized and fulfilled of giving up everything to  those who had trusted him  there was one sister married to a man of moderate means and so provided for to a certain extent and here the near relatives of young hope seemed to end of the young man himself i had seen little since the  death of his father i knew of him as having entered a mercantile house in boston and bearing the reputation of being an energetic and industrious subordinate liked by his employers and with quite enough ability to rise had there been any fortune ol influence at his back but             hopes anchor that fortune or that influencewhere was either to be found and how many years might rationally be ex pected to elapse before the son of the broken providence ironmaster could hope to find the means of placing himself in a position beyond that of a moderatelypaid employe was i wrong in looking upon the young fellow that evening with a sentiment of pain and disapproval what was he to be wooing as so evidently he was the daughter of the new york millionaire not that i had any doubt of his being morally and mentally a companion for her or for any one of ninetynine out of one hundred of the carefully sheltered young girls who flutter around the drives of the central park in luxury corresponding to that of london rotten row or the paris bois de boulogne but that the money question came at once to intensify that other doubt which had to do with the family affections if as seemed almost certain the two young people had been accidentally flung together in some one of the many opportunities of american travel or wateringplace encoun ter and if as seemed certain they were really in love with each other what was to be the end of it all with some people in view i should merely have said ohthis is of little or no consequencethey will drift apart before any danger comes of the acquaintance just as they have drifted togetherbut i remembered quite enough in the boy to be certain that he would be found less practical and less practicable than this assurance presupposed even if the young lady should not chance to develope a corres   hopes anchor          ponding amount of unprofitable stubbornness so i fell back upon the question what was to be the end probably a couple of broken hearts or at least one parental disapprobation a thing of certainty unhappi ness almost a foregone conclusion suffering not a very remote probability with the limited capacities of the lover and the petted and papered uselessness of the beautiful temptation what a long speculation i had gone through within a few minutes after seeing that young couple cross by the patha very long and profound speculation its subject being the behavior and welfare of two others neither of whom would have been very likely to thank me for the interest had they seen me as they did not and possessed the power of looking into my mentality they vent on and passed out of sight towards the seconnet no doubt i plunged deeper into the woods under the incitement of my new train of thought and ended by stepping into a quagmire rousing and being bitten by a whole colony of ambushed mosquitoes and returning to the house so late that i found only the dilapidated remains of a supper all which latter did not disprove of course that i who could not take care of myself was the fittest of mentors for others i             iiopes anchor ii west island and hopes anchor naturally one of the earliest of my employments that evening after my return to the hotel and late experiment at supper was to pay a visit to the little office and examine the register suggestively enough as i passed along the piazza i saw one of the objects of my solicitudemiss wilmerding to witsitting with her mother and one or two other elderly people looking bewitchingly handsome but conversing with the gravity of forty and appearing so daintily demure that probably any other single person in the house would have been suspected of a flirtation before her as i had more than half suspected i found no such name as that of charles hope  on the register of the seconnet it was evident then that he could not be staying at the house as certainly the old trick of booking under an assumed name would have been too silly for a thought it might be then that he was stopping at some one of the semiprivate houses in the neighborhood either because his funds were so limited that even the moderate expenditure at the seconnet was thought unwise or because the young fellow really had in him more of the elements of the intriguant than i had supposed and preferred to obtrude himself as little as possible on the notice of madame mere perhaps to escape altogether her knowledge of his being in the neighborhood if the latter should be the case the fact would only prove that   iiopes anclor         the trouble had begun in the shape of family disapproba tion and partial restraint if the other then the comment was not less forcible on the prospect of marriage between that daughter of a wealthy family and a man who was even obliged to board at a cheaper house in order to be near her i think that i went to sleep that night in the little bedroom which they gave me overlooking the rough coast and the moonlit water and with the grand old song of the sea sounding pleasantly in my drowsy earsi think that i went to sleep i say musing much more upon the two young people than was at all profitable for a man who certainly had quite enough subjects for anxiety of his own and i am sure that i had scarcely more than fallen into my first sleep when i commenced dreaming of an elopement taking place from that very house across the british channel with the two parties blending charles hope and myself miss wilmerding and some female relative of my own the morning however made the dream of the night nonsense as well as part of the speculations of the day and unexpectedly placed me in contact with that one of the subjects of my anxiety demanding the most of my attention the most prominent of objects from the piazza of the seconnet was the rocky high west island presenting the strongest of temptations especially to one who had so lately been in conversation with the prince of fishermen was i not the least fortunate of sportsmen with conse quently the strongest of desires in that direction  and              hopes anchor had i not been assured by him that even stupidity could not prevent the catching of a certain number of three or five pounders from the top of those rocks the long and short of it is that i wanted my fish and was going after them at once on the first full day of my stay at seconnet the task of getting across to the island was not a difficult one especially to any person boasting of as much seacoast experience as myself where there was a crossing for which money required to be paid little fear that some tarry old salt in a small way would not be found lounging about at the point of embarkation i went across the lawn to the rocky headland with the beach stretching below i found the tarry old salt in readiness sitting by the side of his boat and professional enough in his getup to have belonged to the navy or some great ocean mail service i engaged him for the perilous voyage of four hundred yards be the same more or less to the island and for the return therefrom at a certain hour in the afternoon      i we were just about to shove off with myself for single fare when there came a cheery hail from the fence at the top of the bluff and then a tall light form sprang down over the rocks end ran down to the boat with hold on joe i if you are going to the island suppose that you carry two instead of one jest as this gentleman sayshe has took the boat but maybe hed make room responded the boatman with less regard to grammar than to my temporary pro prietorship of his craft   hopes anchor          make room   certainly why    i had not noticed the personality of the new comer until at that instant and i need not say that i was gratified to discover the son of my old friend and the absorbed lover of the evening before he recognized me with pleasure after a moment and we shook hands warmly then expressing our mutual additional pleasure at going to west island in such company we shoved off and in spite of what the old boatman declared the perils of the passage were landed safely on that wildest of rocky islands and best spot for seabass on the round globe in a very few minutes of dexterous rowing i have neither occasion nor intention to detail the fishing experience of that day farther than to say that for once in my life i had as many bites as i wished and really caught so many darkscaled fellows that my back ached with the very stooping to pick them up hope excelling me at the rate of about two to one and some of the ladies from the seconnet excelling all the males in at least the same proportion besides the fishing there was something very delicious in the day and the location a brighter breezier july day never dawned there was only a modicum of discom fort in the occasional burst of rough merriment from small stag parties  inhabiting the west island house and to sit on that rock thirty or forty feet above the water with a magnificent sea view with the spray often dashing coolly to the top and still fishing with ease comfort and success was something out of the common order             iiopes anchor then the conversation but this reminds me that in the conversation of that day the only excuse lies for all this long story without hopes anchor the whole affair would be the most melancholy of hamlets without any prince to speak of the anchor had no relation to the old fishermans boat or its mooring it was simply a breastpin or as our transatlantic cousins more properly call it a bosompin i noticed it the moment after our first meeting and admired the taste while taking some exception to the size and pronounced character of the ornament the shank was of chased silver with flukes of some red stone and the cross stock of gold while fast to the ring at top was a tiny venetian chain of exquisite workmanship which scarcely suggested bringing up a vessel with a round turn  in the event of needing to anchor in heavy weather i have a foible of talking of nearly everything that i see necessarily very often to the wrong person or under circumstances making any conversation on the subject improper consequence i could not avoid the impro priety of alluding to that special personal adornment it was when we had been some time on the island and when the sacred hunger for fish had begun to be some what dulled that the desultory conversation tan into such a channel that i felt the necessity of interpolating the anchor i had previously learned from hope that he had been something like a fortnight at seconnet boarding at the private residence of a distant relative a quarter of a mile from the house and ascertained from   hopes anchor         what i now  recognize may have been indefensible  pumping that he still retained his place in the boston mercantilehouse with no change of any consequence in position that is a somewhat remarkable breastpin of yours i aid when the necessity of gabbling grew too strong upon me for resistance ell what you do not like it he replied humph well i said  that depends one may like a thing aid even admire it and yet not quitei mean may have certain objections to it now for instance we have a certain official in new york who wears a diamond cross worth about three thousand dollars and the clustered diamonds are very beautiful and yet  yet you would not wish to wear it he interrupted no neither would i undoubtedly the first comfortable moment to the owner of such a breastpin would be that when he first forgot that he owned it ut mine you see is so very different it is not small enough to lose easily  that may be easily conceded i assented then it is odd he continued  and has a certain charm from that fact to me at least and there are half a dozen reasons why i hope to wear it to the very day i i die and why i certainly shall wear it if it does not become lost or stolen ah yes i recognize one i said your name is hope and hope is understood to be in that particular line of the marine hardware business may i suppose that you are wearing it as a promising coat of arms as             hopes anchor some of the english families use similar cognizances yes partially so he replied my name is hope and mythological hope leans on an anchor so why should not another hope carry one but that is the least of my reasons for wearing this particular pin dont you remember that i am a rhode islander and that little rhody adopts that symbol do you wish any more as many as you like seeing that you have such a stock of excuses on handi half laughed  humph thank you for nothing he replied witn a voice as gay as my own at that moment hauling in a sea bass of prodigious size and dropping his hook again mechanically it was quite as moment before he spoke again and when he did so there was no merriment whatever in his voice  it was almost painfully earnest as was his whole manner you will scarcely credit me i suppose mr t he said when i tell you that i set the most superstitious value on that pin and that no motive on earth would induce me to part with it not alone because my name is hope and because i am a rhode islander but because i have every reason to believe that it is my  totem that it is in some mysterious way connected with the welfare of my life pray do not interrupt me even if you think me very foolish he continued perhaps reading in my face symptoms of the suppressed cacoethes loquendi for i value your good opinion higher than you know for the sake of the friendship once existing between my father andlvourself and you must really allow me to tell   holurk ancuou       lu you without laughing at me more than is necessary why i hold this fancy certainly my dear young fellowi assented go on and depend upon my not laughing at all even if i should take the privilege of wondering first and foremost then he continued  when i was quite a boy and in your city one day two ladies relatives took me with them to a fortuneteller i do not believe in such people and yet   well one of the sybils there were two half frightened me to death by going through some kind of incantation that i cannot describe in which clouds of smoke and incense played a part and out of which clouds came a dark shadowy object finally resolving itself into an anchor the sorceress screamed when she saw it said that she had not intended to bring it up but that it related not to the lady whose fortune she was trying but to me i do not remember what else she said as her language was half gibberish but i do remember that the anchor i saw had the peculiar colors that i have tried to get imitated in this and that i can no more shake off the impression that the symbol is connected with all my best interests than i can cease breathing of my own will all thatis not quite so singular to me as it might be to many other persons i remarked when he paused for a moment i have seen and heard some things of the same character quite as remarkable and i am the last person to laugh at what i do not happen to understand because if i did i should be laughing nearly all the time            nhopes anchor i have had the omentested once he went on after a glance at me to see whether i was really speaking in earnest which changed into an expression of absolute gratitude when he saw that i was really doing so do you know that fearful reef of rocks round near the mouth of the vineyard sound that i believe they call dead mans no well it is no matter i was going inl from nantucket in a little schooner two years ago at about this time when a furious northwester came on with almost the suddenness of a flash blew away mainsail and jib and left us nothing but the foresail with the fore sail alone we could not make any way and we commenced to drift on that reef where the schooner would have gone to pieces in about eight minutes and the four of us would all have been drowned in ten i never quite knew what the little implement was practically worth of which i wear this faint resemblance in my shirtfront until that hour or rather towse wours for all night long we lay off those hungry rocks ready to gnaw us up and swallow us at any moment safe so long as that anchor held lost beyond hope if it dragged or gave way i suppose that all of us prayed more or less during that fearful night but i have an idea that if iprayed at all it was to the anchow to hold on tle morning came at last the gale abated the sea went down a little we set the fragment of an old jib on her and with that and the foresail managed to clear the rocks and get into the sound that is all and i suppose there is little or nothing in the incident but you can                  ji    opes anchor        f imagine that my superstition if that is the proper name for it was strengthened instead of weakened by that experience i had been listening with great interest carried away in spiteof myself by the force of the speaker who so evidently felt all that he uttered and finding one more reason even than name state fortunetelling and ex perience for the love which so deified the anchor charley i said at length i fancy that you cling to the anchor for another reason that you have not named  that you have hope phrenologically speaking very large and somehow associate that emblem with your confident belief that you can do anything he turned round on me with a halfangry suddenness which moderated down into surprise how do you know that you are right however it is partially on that account that i love and believe in hopes anchor yes i have hope very large no one knows as yet how truly i believe in myself and my des tinyhow certainly i can and will accomplish what i  thoroughly intend i thought that my time had come for probing him at the same time that i made him aware of the extent of my knowledge in a certain direction your hope and confidence i suppose charley go so far as to lead you to believe that you can marry clara wilmerding conquer her family and not reduce her to misery             hopes anchor the young mans face was very angry for just one instant he turned upon me again and this time almost fiercely mr t   he exclaimed roughly what do you know about my private affairs  what right have you  i suppose that he remembered himself for he paused and then i added i know nothing more than this charley hope that i was your fathers friend and should be sorry to see his son committing any act that would make himself and others unhappy his tone was less severe as he asked but what do you know of any connection of mine with miss wilmerding i hope you will tell me that i will i have known the young lady by sight for some time and last evening back in the woods yonder i saw you together and saw that you were in love with each other humph he said with a laugh that nettled me a little now you fancy that you have spelled out a romance mr t   and excuse me if i spoil it i am not going to deny that i am in love with miss wil merding nor the hope and belief that she loves me in return but there is another part of the romance which i see by your eyes that you suspect and yet that has no truth whatever i am not going to run away with her and marry her in defiance of her family and i was not walking with her clandestinely last evening   ropes anchor          i was a little nonplussed by this frank statement which certainly destroyed the groundwork of more than half my speculations but if i lost something in one way i gained in another i had more materials than before for wonder her family know of the attachment theni asked after a moment as the only reply they do and approve of it noi suppose not at least i am satisfied that they would have preferred as a match for their daughter some person with more means at command but i am proud to say that i believe they know and trust me and that they are not likely to oppose our marriage when the time cones and when may that be that momentno sooner and no later he answered with flashing eyes and a face of handsome pride  wlten i can marry her with a certainty of not depriving her of any comfort or luxury that she could othterwise reasoljbly expect to enjoy in other words when i can  take care of her as they call it pretty nearly as she deserves humph thinki said they are rich you are poor how many years of weary waiting may there not be before you see that happy day are you sure that you will not grow tired of waitingthat you can indeed do all you purposeso keep and protect her you love as to leave no ground for selfreproach             hopes ancor hush he said almost sternly  dont croak please it will do no good and may do harm then his face lit up with all its old boyish enthusiasm as he added pointing once more to the emblem seethis is hopes anchor i believe in it and you shall sce whether or not i fail promise me to say nothing of all this to any one and also promise me that some day when i send you a note you will come and see meand hier i made both promiseswhat else could i do and i kept both   hopes anchor        r i how  hopes anchor did its duty how little we know of the mode in which any fulfill ment is to come of that for which we so ardently wish and how seldom a prayer if answered is so answered that we at once recognize the connection of the reply with the petition the time given me by charley hope for his marriage with clara wilmerding had been  when he could marry her without depriving her of any comfort or luxury and yet how little he could have looked for ward at the moment of speaking to the true and alas the sad influences which should bring that opportunity the civil war had not long broken out at the time of tlhe meeting at seconnet it grewspreadwidened did its work of good and wrought its work of ruin it crippled the resources of the boston house with which the young man stood connected and held him back from opportunities of rising that his energy would otherwise have undoubtedly embraced if it did not create it kept him rising slowlyoh so slowly that my prophecy might have been fulfilled in gray hairs if not in dis couragement when oh when could the struggling young fellow hope to become the mate of the merchants daughter then it did another thingyet nore sad and more cruel it broke the heart and the fortunes of james              hopes anchor wilmerding at very nearly the same blow leaving his wife a widow straightened if not in absolute poverty and his daughter no longer the wealthy curled darling in fortune if she yet retained the physical grace and fragility indicated by the name it was a year after the death of her father when charley hopes determination at once overcame any remaining objections on the part of her stillproud and naturallyanxious mother and shrinking timidity on the part of the young girl herself they were married unwisely as i could not but believeat the house of a relative of clara in boston and so one part of the destiny was accomplished i have said that i feared true the young man had kept the letter of his word not marrying in such a way as to reduce his bride in comfort actually possessed but had he not broken it in spirit should he not have waited untilsome assurance had been gained against absolute poverty was there not danger still of his doing the very thing which i had feared from the begin ningexposing that sweetest and most delicate of human flowers to some nipping frost from which no mortal hand could defend her i am not sure but those fears grew stronger instead of weakening when in the june of the following year i responded to the third invitation which had been given me and went to see the young birds in their little nest a cottage at the eastern end of chelsea towards lynn what should i see when i reached the placespite of the hopeful tone which pervaded the invitations would   hopes anchor         i not find the young husband worried and anxious in spite of the confidence of his nature would he not manifest some token that the load of care was too heavy as conjoined with the other and ordinary load of labor and of quite as much consequence would i not find the sweet face of clara already beginning to wear a pinched and querulous expression ai the wearing away of the gilding of  love in a cottage  and the approach of those realities connected with the vulgar want of accustomed luxuries what i did find was this a very pleasant little cottage flowerclimbed backed by a pretty garden and fronted by the near shore boston bay and a fine view of nahant a complete little equipment with one servant a husband toiling manfully but bearing no mark in face or manner that the toil was beyond him or that any undue anxiety troubled his nightly rest or made his waking hours weary a charming young wife even prettier in the neat dress in which she managed her limited household than she had been when sweeping over the drive or fluttering at the operaand evidently as happy as love and congeniality can make a true american girl fears and anxietieswhy i flung them to the winds that evening after tea when pretty clara was superin tending the disposal of the china and when charley and i sat on the little porch and blew clouds of tobaccosmoke amid the hanging flowers what were fears and anxie ties herewhere so evidently both thepartners were fitted for the engagement into which they had entered             hopes anchor and where happiness made its home if there was such a home on earth you see there is no discount on hopes anchor mr t  said charley when i had expressed some of my felicitations it is here odd as ever pointing to the emblem  and if i do not miss a figure i have already proved that i can be a mate for a rich mans daughter and console her for the loss of some material things that a part of her sex consider indispensable and the futurewhat are your prospects for the futurebusiness ones i mean charley i could not avoid asking slow but sure as the anchor would be i suppose if it took a fancy to locomote was the reply  i am funding a little constantly and so have something for a rainy day it may need two or three years yet before i get into the firm but that i will do as sure as my name and nature are hopeas surely as i did what i promised you that i would do on west islandas surely as i have already proved that i can take care of my darling                   i received a telegram from a friend at boston on the th day of december  i pen the transcription

answer that melancholy summons it could not be that the bright young fellow whom i had so well known andyes let the word be usedloved it could not be that he with all his high hopes and all his surroundings of happiness was dead it could not be that the young wife and motherl so lately a thing to be almost envied was now a thing to be pitied with the deepest pity that could emanate froe the human heart and beyond this first question of the laceration of the affections what lay it was dreadful to be obliged to think of it at such a moment but the thought coluld not be dismissed what was to become now of the com paratively helpless woman no longer with only herself to care for but the mother and only protectress of a little daughter of less than two years the hand that had been so bold and determined forherthe hand of the breadwinnerlay cold and nothing more of support could flow into it or from it with so little time elapsed and not even yet admitted into the firm which had been his confidentt expectation it was not possible at the best that the young husband could have left behind him any hing of consequencea few hundreds perhaps beyond the furniture and appointments of the little house at chelseaat most a thousand or two and what awould that be as affording any dependance to the helpless widow even to wuin bread for herself and childif as i believed her family could

been like half the men of your day and generation you have not kept the woman you loved from penury and suffering even though you have done your best in your blind and selfconfident way where is your anchor now poor poor charleyand where is theirs who leaned on you i reached boston and chelsea the poor young fellow killed on the previous morning by a box slipping from the hooks at one of the wharves that he was visiting on some errand connected with the houselay already coffined still handsome and defiantlooking though dis figured by the accident the poor wife distracted and heartbroken was in an upper room attended by some sympathizing friends and almost beyond the present power of realizing her situation i am obliged to draw a curtain over the scenes that followed god keep us all from witnessing the like and make us truly grateful when we escape we buried my dead friend at mount auburn on the second day after my arrival and it was not until then that there was either heart or opportunity to talk of that worldly subject his affairs it was by poor widowed clara hope herself that a package was put into my hands bearing my name and   hopes anchor         endorsed to be handed to mr j t jr if possible in the event of my deathno matter at what date c h i opened laid aside the accompanying papers and read what perhaps surprised me as much as any document that had ever fallen into my hands during a somewhat long life in which things out of the common have been no rarity chelsea march th  dear mr j t  jr  you were my fathers find and circumstances which i hope that you will never regret have made you more my friend and confident than i should ever have pre sumed to ask you to become but trusting that you have never regretted anything done for me i am about to lay a burden upon you which i am sure that you will accept as the very fact of your receiving and reading this will prove that the order of nature has been reversed and that i am dead i have no idea at the time of penning these lines whether you will read them during this very year poor fellowi did j t jr ten years hence twenty years or never but if you do live to read them i hope and trust that you will respond to my wishes accompanying please find a willvery brief because i have few to whom i should care to bequeath anything if i had never so much you and my dear wife are named executors with power to choose a third in case of necessity i shall alter the document occasionally perhaps but you will find it very nearly as i intend it to be at my latest moment of consciousness and oppor andoppor             hopes anchor tunity please act as requested and supplement the kindness by being what you can of friend and adviser to my wife and any children that i may leave there is another matter of quite as much consequence i have been aware ever since my marriage of the pro priety of insuring my life so as to make sure what i promised you on west island years ago and prevent the possibility of my dear ones falling into penury before i die it may chance that i have fulfilled all my expecta tions and accumulated a competence if it happens other wise this will secur their temporary welfare as nothing else could do and without any reference to the time that may have elapsed it was only last week that i found time to complete what i should have completed before one of the other papers in this package you will find to be a policy for ten thousand dollars on my life in the anchor life insurance company new york i almost fancy that i hear you laugh even over my dead body at the way in which hopes anchor comes up again in the name of the company i have chosen and i do not deny that i think very much of the omenthat i would rather trust a company so named than any other the anchor  has been very good for me so far and the old fortune teller seems to have been right but that you may not laugh too long or too loudly over my fancy in choice let me say that i have had other reasons in choosing this companythough by the time you read this i hope that my confidence will have been long justified by its success and fairness in the first   iopes anciio         place i know some of its managers personally through business relations with the house with which i am con nected and they strike me as thoroughly reliable then the general plans and special features of the company seem to appeal to every sensible mind as affording an admirable balance between the company and its policy holders as you will see from one of the pages of their prospectus which i cut out and fasten here to show you some day or other may it be many a long year first what were its leading characteristics in  lstits rates are the lowelst of any mutual company in america dit affords absolute

affords the fullest legal security to married women and their children and now i have troubled you long enough but i have less hesitation in doing so because if this ever speaks to you it will be then

it was indeed the voice of one from the dead speaking how much sooner than the poor fellow could have anticipated but the tale it told was a pleasant one its presence or its absence marking the difference between the widow simply though sadly bereaved and yet in comfortand the same widow literally penniless and almost lacking time from her miserable breadgrind ing avocations even for grief charley hope had been wiser than i dreamed even if more unfortunate than either of us could have supposed in advance he had done all he promised on west island proving himself a fit mate for the

clerks office of the district court of the district of massachusetts  to the reader  for a good many years the author of this little book has devoted considerable atten tion to the subject of nutrition in its application to the various aricles of food in common use the amount of their nutri tive properties colnpared to their bulk and ease of digestion and their influence on our health and growth he believes that at least onehalf of the diseases that terminate in death are produced by imprudence in eating and the prevailing ignorance in regard to the proper selection of our food no people on u the face of the earth are so abundantly favored in the quantity and general cheapness of every kind of food need he say that no people ale so wasteful and indifferent  in regard to its proper preparation for the tabl as a consequence we are universel sufferers therefrom he has often thpught that a famine of a few weeks duration  would be of incalculable benefit to the country it certainly would be the oy thing to teach us the necessity of some wisdom in regrd to our sustenance       from many ears experience he is convinced that two meals a day are better than three unless the first meal is taken very early in the morning in fact even but one meal a day when animal food forms the principal article consumed is sufficient for a sedentary person always providing   iv       to the   reader providing good judgment is used in the selection and the eating of that single meal a day  complete digestion occupies from two to six hours when the body is in good health should not the stomach have a few hours rest to recover itself from the fatigue of its labor fortunate is it for mankind that sleep intervenes to compel cessation of the digestive work once in twenty four hours in the following pages the author has embodied certain facts and exmperimertts in the person of mr gluten as showing what was accomplished by a strict attention to diet accompanied by judicious bodily exercise in a large number of persons of actiye temperament who incline to those pursuits that require extra mental power growth is arrested soon after puberty the brain absorbs the entire nutriment taken into the system wre all know of individual cases where a change in a persons habits or occupation have resulted xin an extraordiiiary increae of flesh a moderate mental activity is necessary for health and conduces to long life and if the body is supplied with that kind of nourishing food the appetite craves growth will continue till the system arrives at its maturity which may not be till fortyfive years of age in the appendix the author has embodied his ideas in a practical form although thiey are often at variance with longestablished views yet the reader will form his own opinion whether they are entitled to any consideration the author      i was lean and i became stout there are some afflictions so insidious in their character that ere we are fully reconciled to their presence they have silently interwoven themselves into our nature and forced us to accept themas speak from my own experience when i assert that of all minor afflictions extreme leanness is entitled to the most cormmiseration yet there are stages of leanness as well as obesity wherein the balance of com fort may not be disturbed but any variation toward the extreme awakes no sympathy from others yet tries our good nature to the utmost the suffering i have undergone both physical and mental  which can be attributed to my unfortunate lean ness should entitle me to universal compassion badt as past sorrows are soon forgotten s  will not seek to perpet erte their aremembrance only so far as they may bear on the facts i am going sto relate providence in making me so lean thought to absolve herself for her shortcoming by giving se ian extremely sensitive mental organization we havet read of persons who from some undefined mental clockwork could always tell the exact hour of the day  and also of those who could prvi e n              scent     r             scent an easterly storm several hours in advance of its arrival but to me was given the power of divining a persons thoughlts by merely glancing at their eyes and to tell their disposition from the sound of their voice and to guage their mental calibre from seeing them eat and knew from their walk whether they were rich or poor or in easy circumstances perhaps the reader may think these gifts a sufficient compensation for my leafiness of body i could never so consider them for my moral nature was continually pained by detecting the falsity of many who were regarded as pure and virtuous when in their heart and daily life they were wickedannd depraved thus  has it ever been that sin seeks to make itself attractive to accomplish its iniquity while virtue often wears the sombre garb of indigence to carry out those sublime decrees that form the basis of our redemption in dress and all those vaccomplishments that are essen tial to the proper equirements of a gentleman i acknowl edged no superior thoroughly acquainted with the true combination of colors i knew how to harmonize them ih my own person  and though possessed of those graces that command the admirationof the wellbred person of society it was only my unfortunate jeanness that prevented me from making a good appearance of this i was daily ard hourly conscious and finally ljow to acquire a genteel modicum of adipose matter became the sole absorbing  study of my life  i consulted many eminent physicians both of the regular and empirical practice bet with one exception they all invariably recommended gluttony as the only remedy they knew for the accomplishment of the desired result the exception was that of a famous indian doctor who said go a niackereling that ll do it f but i preferred some thing nearer home that would not necessitate so abrupt a change                      change in my social habits though in a hygienic point pf view i think the advice remarkably sensible for an indian while pursuing my investigations to that end i became enamoured with the daughter of a welltodo itizen who ifad long carried on a lucrative business on one of the wharves that my love was reciprocated i had no reason to doubt yet i dared not make a proposal for fear that my unfortunate leanness would prove the sole barrier to the realization of my happiness but circumstances of a jeal  ous nature forced me to bring the affair to a crisis and one evening i called on agnes maria determiied that i would know my fate at once       o that i could forget whfat transpired at that momentous interview really mr gluten pardon my candor but y ou  are so very lean  if  you are righti am lean forgive my presumption but she accompanied the refusal with a smile and a ten derness so charming that even the pain she had inflicted was not without its pleasure although excited nearly to frenzy i could not judge her harshy for i was lean and in imagining myself the husband of such a beautiful girl i was forfed to acknowledge that my person would be a neverfailing subject for coarse jokes and inuendoes with all our acquaintance with feelings thus so charitably disposed in her favor i bowed myself from her presence with all the grace i was master of and left the house a disappointed man                  the way to my lodgings lay across the common and as the breeze from the public garden partially cooled my excited brain the thought suddenly occurred to me if there were no royal road to flesh whether nature could not r be coerced into performing er duty toward every member of her numerous family the more i polidered the subject in my mind the firmer did i become convinced that nature itx    could           could be coerced   if an individual dwelling hirtyfive hundred miles in an easterly direction could by the aid of science and regimen reduce himself from corpulence to a moderate degree of flesh then why could not another indi vidual dwelling the same distance in a westerly direction change his leanness for a comfortable state of adipose  but bow to accomplish it   some of those wonderful discoveries of which the world is now enjoying the ripened fruit were suggested to man in thelhour of his despair when the mind has seemed in the lowest state of mental abasement and the demon of selfdestruction is flitting before the victim like an evil phantom there comes a ray of inward light which increases in intensity until the soul seems lifted to a sphere more grand and heavenly than niortal thought ever dared to dwell thus prepared for its great gift the nind uncon scious conceives in one short moment that which the labor of centuries would not have accomplished i ad crossed the common and arrived at boylston stree when the ligihts in the public library arrested my attention i stopped i hesitated one minute and my resolve was taken that minutes decision proved my sal vatidn from being a lean and unhappy man whose life could be summed up as shadowless i became contented and happy and threw a shadow that ultimately expanded to generous proportions i crossed the street and centered the library and passing to the readingroom i seated myself at the table never before did i seemso utterly passive toward all exterior things why i was there i could not tell but some power within seemed to direct me i took up a catalogue before me and mechanically opening the leaves my eyes fell on the top line of the th page the line seemed to change from  see baiting on corpulence     from black to red then the letters to enlarge themselves to colossal size and slowly move to the centre of the page and glow with a dazzling luminous light gradually they became fainter then finally disappeared and the page resumied its former appearance for a few minuted my brain seemed paralyzed then a peculiar rushing sound like that of an approaching hurricane coursed through my ears accompanied by the return of consciousness i arose and went to the libraryroom and procured the book so remarkably indicated it was an ancient volume bound in velluni and darkened by the dust of ages while turning over the leaves at random i noticed that some former owner had marked passages here and there with red ink i turned to the titlepage it was printed in huge letters with red and black ink   how my hands trembled and my heart quickened its action as ii read in unmis takable words the following  t  ve tre wante to be t atte iom to cdantt e lnselffe from ne fteanne se e   toie atte of  bobze wlen i left for my lodgings the priceless volume bore me company and before i sought repose in sleep i had mastered its contents from titleppage to finis thus so providentially placed in my hands were the means of attain ing my longcherished hopes  i                   c               o          my new life                  bi   n order to faithfully carry out the instruc tions laid down in tle ancieint volumeit c  t was necessary i should have the assistance   i fr  olof my landlady mrs nodar and when i entered that lady s sittingroom on the   morning after the events i have just rela ted it is piossile i may hatve exhibited unusual exhilarity for a man of my temperament which she uncharitably attributed to the presence of an alcoholic stimulant but a certain severity of manner which long contact with the acerbities of a boardinghouse had forced her to assume brought me suddenly to my senses two minutes conversation reinstated me in her good opinion and put her in possession of the purpose of my visit and i will do her justice to say that she entered into the new undertaking with a degree of warmth entirely unexpected in a person of her precarious position it miht havebeen owing to the pecuniary recompense that invariably rewards success in any longawishedfor result or it may have been that her curiosity was excited by the novelty pf the ideas to be acted on it was mutually agreed that all my meals should be served in my own roonm and though this pro ceeding caused universal remark at the time among my fellowboarders in a few cdays it quieted down tothe belief that i had become to proud for their company  t       that  o             that day i called on professor collodion at his rooms in washington street and sat for mny photograph which when finishe d with india ink was far more satisfiactory for its truthfulness than flattering in its general outline and filling up to my request that he would destroy the negative he assured me he certainly would if not already done i also went to a neighboring grocery and ascertained my exact weight which was ninetytwo pounrdswith out favor on either side with these essential preliminaries and strong in the determination that nothing should be wanting to ensure the perfect success of my project i spent the remainder of the day at my place of business and when i retired to bed that night my anticipations of futuie happiness were as lively as any man under thirty years of age ever allowed himself to indulge in wednesday may  i am thus particular in stating the exact day i com menced my new life for the results that ensued proved the correctness of the marvellous statements in regard to the nutritive properties ofcertain kinds of food as laid down by the author of the ancient volume passed a disagreeable night haunted by frightful visions of giants ogres dwarfs and deformed pigmies who held high carnival round my bed accompanied by discordant sounds as if twetityjdifferent operas were being performed at the same time my excited imaginationh suggested that this was got up by evil spirits to frighten me from my purpose but i was proof against it if anything it served to strengthen me the more for i considered it a natural result                  result of the morbid state of my entire physical organization i learned the next day that a fellow boarder named boggs who occupied the adjoining room had some musical friends to spend the evening and their imitations of popular singers was the cause of my distorted dreams just before dawn i passed into a deliciouslytranquil sleep of fifteen minutes duratioln in which i imagined myself the adonis of manly beauty and that i was on the way to church with agnes maria decked in bridal array who continually repeated o how wonderful the change from what you wereand had she not pinched me severely and broke the spell i truly believe i should have gone through the entire marriage ceremony including the giving of a twenty dollar gold pieceto the presiding clergyman while rum  inating on the strange effect that dreams often produce i heard a heavy tread approaching y chamber door and presently a sharp voice whispered through the keyhole   mr gluten it is time for your morning exercise my faithful landlady said that  i jumped out of bed and opened wide the windows and during the next five minutes i went through a course of physical exercise that brought every muscular organ into active play this not only sent the blood galloping through every part of my bodyfrm the back of my neck to the ends of my toesbut also sent a bootjack or other handy missile against the partition which separated my room from that of neighbor boggs as i had just then concluded my exercise there was no further occasion of wrath on the part of boggs but i made up my mind it would be judi cious for mrs nodar to inform the excitable boggs that hurling bootjacks agaiast the partition very early in the morning was not conducive to perfect harmony among her boarders       such   i          such violent exercise immediately after so many hours of rest produced a most exhilarating effect qufkly clos ing the windows i hurried on my clothes as fast as possible and by the time i had finished my toilet the fatigue had passed away and left a very comfortable feeling of warmth throughout my entire body  while the clock was striking seven my landlady entered the chamber followed bj servant with a large waiter con taining my breakfast which she proceeded to arrange in proper order on the centretable pon my word mr gluten your face has considerable color how s your appetite there suiting lthe action to the last word she raised the cover of a dish and exposed to view a most tempting display my look of sfatisfaction was her reward the respect for that ladys attainments rose instantly to adoration before leaving the room she entertained me with her opinions on the probabilities of my success she was sanguine i had taken the right course for flesh and flanked her assurance by recalling to mind an uncle of hers somewhere out west oridown south who used to be a very spare man when young but all at once took a start and fleshed right up and she believed he was soon afterwards elected an alderman or undertaker another time madam  i pointed to the breakfast cooling she uttered an exclamation not complimentary to her foresight and disappeared who that has arrived to mans estate cannot recall some particular occasion of his youth when a certain dinner or supper he had partaken of or a particular article of food he then enjoyed more exquisite to the taste than anything ever since indulged in i happy days of childhood when the appetite is keen and prodigious and the digestion of marvellous power the exquisite relish of that breakfast will live long in                my        my memory everything was cooked to perfection and whether it was owing to the physical exercise i had gone through or the exhilaration consequent to my new plans for the future never before did i experience that perfect satisfaction nutritious food has the power to confer when it pleases the appetite and agrees with the digestion when going down stairs onmy way out i met mrs nodar who inquired if my breakfast had pleased me i answered by requesting her to accept the first instalment of my promised gratuity and in placing the valuable greenback in herprlm i may have pressed the hand more than was necessary as a decided color suffused ithat good ladyscheeks as she returned her acknowledgments thus doth the stomach sympathize with and expand the heart during every hour of thatlay i was conscious of an agreeable change in my health i felt an elasticity of spirits and an inclination for activity pleasurable in the extreme at five oclock i left my place of business and returned home for dinner and half an hour afterward i sat down before the most tender and nicelycooked joint of meat it was possible to produce and all the accom paniments were prepared with equal skill and excellence in fact my landlady had done herself credit to qute  a hackneyed expression of newspaper reporters so so madame why have you never exerted your skill before         there are some forms of expression the human face has the power to convey with which mere words arenute in comparison it was in this manner mrs nodar chose to reply of course i would not infer that any pecuniary consideration influenced her in my favor thus proceeded day after day the same routine of per formance and my progress was greater than i had dared to hope my two meals a daybreakfast at eight and    dinner   dinner at halfpast five sufficed to fully satisfy tie neces sary requirements demanded by the increased power of the various organs in their efforts toward my new growth i will here state that the food selected combined in a propor tionate degree aniia vegetable and farinaceous wheither any liquid of a stimulating character had a place in my bill of fare i will only say that what my appetite craved that did i indulge in rely upon it i did not disobey the rules laid down in the ancient volume wednesday june lstjust two weeks ago today since i commenced my new diet  i have gained seven pounds of flesh i feel very sanguine that the means i have adopted will produce the beneficial result i have so long desired i am conscious of an increased nervous fonce which tendsparticuiarly to the spine and conveys he idea that my backbone is enlarging heretofore i have always experienced a peculiar chilly feeling down my back which no amount of clothing was ever able to relieve but within a few days that feeling has entirely disappeared walking gives me a most pleasurable sensation and the exercise produces a gentle glow over my whole body i have also experienced more regularity in those essential daily duties without which health is impossible this alone is a benefit that cannot be overestimated my mental organization which was always extremely susceptible has remained about the same perhaps i am less easily dis turbed by those little anhoyances that make us conscious life is but a series of joys and sorrows sunshine today and darkness tomorrow  one of tha laws insisted on in the ancient volume wsas perfect tranquility of mind which must nt be departid from although my good nature has met with many severe trials yet i have ever been  equal to the occasion  and i doubt     doubt much if i should have resented any indignity except that of nosepulling perhaps that might prove more than even flesh and blood could submit to fortunately for the reader of these experiences my moral strength was not subjected to such severe test wednoesdy june th on entering the grocers this  moining i overheard his man remark i say bije see that fellow is really getting some flesh onllhis hones although the expression was coarse and insulting i did not feel any animosity towaird him on the contrary i treated him with marked consideration and asked how sugar stood not that i cared three straws for the commercial value of that saccharine compound but it was the first thought which suggested itself as being within the scope of his mental capacity the scales indicated a slight leaning beyond one hundred and eight pounds thus duripg the past two weeks i had gained nine pounds i was apprehensive at the outset that the rapid increase of flesh would be what is termed  bloat but as it seemed hard and compact with no apparent yielding t the pressureof the hand i was satisfied it was the kind usually supplied by the slow process of nature friday july thmrs nodar whilelaying the cloth for my dinner today said that my continued absence from the public table occasioned considerable remark mr boggs had coarsely suggested that she mrs n was fattening me expressly for the matrimonial market the idea tickled me exceedingly and i owe that blunt man for a hearty laugh  but my landlady regarded the expression as a direct insult to herself as it was known she had a husband somewhere about the house though he seldomventured higher than the kitchen so humble were his aspirations          instead                           instead of visiting the grocer i have availed myself of an ingeniouslycontrived chair owned by a foreigner which is suspended for hire every pleasant day on the tremont street mall i patronize him two or three times a week and he has taken considerable interest in my progress i told him i was using a certain nutritious diet with remark able success  theres nothing like plenty of good roast beef and hale to make a man fat itts wittles and drink i like but yer cant get such hale as they ave in the old country j while the above remark was on its passage i had seated myself ih his chair why mister you re chuck eightstonesix   see for yourself it was true i had increased ten pounds during the past twentyfive days  for two or three weeks i had been conscious that my clothes were getting uncomfortablysnug so that afternoon i called on my tailor and ordered a new suit he was pleased to complimentme on my improved appearance several of my acquaintances were knowing to the fact ofmy efforts for physical improvement and every day i received congratulations on my success i am willing to  acknowledge that my vanity was gratified by the interest i created  while in washington street today i saw agnes maria  approaching she was alone and when she recognized me i could see by her pleased expression that i still occu pied a place in her favor my first thought was to salute her politely and pass on but when we met she seemed to hesitate in her step i immediatelytook advantage of ithis and held out my hand she accepted it with frankness and allowed me to retain her own longer than usual for those         not  in great britain they reckon weight by the stone which is  pounds        not intmate me m      h p   not intimate which gave me much pleasure she inquired how i had been since she saw me last particular em phasis on the  last accompanied by such a roguish expression and in answer to her inquiry if i had  not been to europe i assured her that at no time during the past six months had i been beyond the sound of the old south bell she was surprised and thought my improved appearance was due to a sea voyage i turned and ac companied her and was so enraptured by her conversation that time distance and all material things were forgotten in the pleasure of our renewed affection we arrived at  her home and she invited mtin if only for a moment mamma will be so delighted to see you        gould i hesitate could any man have refused especially when the acceptance would give mutual pleas ure and when too the request was accompanied by a winning fascination that no man cqild havewithstood whose senses were in healthful vigor the mother was both surprlsed and pleased and when i inform the reader that the time passed so pleasantly the clock struck ten ere i could brace up sufficient resolution to bid them good night some idea may be had of the state of my feelings ha ha ha  mrs nodar had kept my dinner hot since halfpast five on my way home i had made up my mind to take that lady into my confidence and impart tohler the information that agnes maria and i had renewed brfitnimacy but when i encountered her in the entryshe had been on the watch for me her manner was so irate that i was glad to hasten up stairs to my room and lock the door in less than three minutes afterwards she presented herself and after some hesitation whether to overlook this first violation of the rules i had myself prescribed she enquired ironically   i       ironically if i were ready fori my dinner but she was morally certain i would decliine it i had thought this over in my mind and decided on the plan of action certainly my dear riadam ah you see the fact is    by this time shemust have reached the kitchen for i heard the dishes rattle she soon reappeared with all the preparations of the delayed dinner and made every thing ready without uttering a word my study of human nature hadtaught me that silence was most effectualn all cases of slumbering wrath i observed that plan in the present instance with perfect success that the reader may not think me imprudent in thus deciding to eat a dinner so soon after having partaken of a supper with agnes maria i will confess that i was so pleased with my reinstatement in that dear girls affec tions that such comrmon things a bread and butter had had no cliatce in my thoughts consequently when i got home and found my dinner awaiting me i concluded to eat it arid did with a satisfaction unusually gratifying the next morning my landlady had recovered her good nature and was exceedingly talkative she brought me an invitation fronm the boarders to dine with them that day a sboggs was going to california they wished to give him a parting  time i sent them my regrets but promised to remember them so that morning i called at a winestore and ordered a dozen of sparkling catawlba as my share towards the parting festivities  when i entered the house that afternoon for my dinner mrs nodar seemed very much excited just then my ears were saluted by hoarse bacchanalian voices from the dining room singing  old john brown with an energy that if the soul of that martyr republican was still marching on it was having a glrious accompaniment the spark ling catawha was evidently working in the stomachs of its victims        saturday august thmy weight is now one hun dred and thirtyfour pounds the increase since july th has been sixteen pounds i think the happy turn in my affairs with agnesmaria has donre much in my favor i have not diminished my efforts and i am very certain that i have learned the secret to attain any amount of adipose up to a certain point and while lhave been so rapidly acquiring flesh my mind has maintained the increased physical development thus keeping the equilibrium be

the pleasurable feeling mental vigor bestows on page th i enumerated some charac teristic peculiarities i possessed as a compensation for my leanness of body i find that my perceptive power has of late greatly increased and acts independently of the will in this i feel compelled to recognize a lighler than human agency that has singled me out for the honor of this great gift all afflictions have their recompense though the power to discern it is often wanting my physical exercises have been directed exclusively to the strengthening of the spine and through the increased vitality consequent therefrom all the various organs have received their apportioned increase of power working together with that harmony only possible when all are in healthy condition hece the remarkable results so rapidly brought about the grand essential to health and happiness is comprised in the true knowledge of the stomach education has confined itself exclusively to the development of the brain educate the stomach and the mental forces will take care of themselves previous to commencing my present system the food which     which i had been taking so constntly was not of that kind my system

fortunate individual in more ways than i can express but   every worldly pleasure has its drawhack my remarkable success in the attainment of flesh has become so extensively known that goodnatured people al over the country favor me with letters of inquiry in relation thereto i believe there is no man more willing to become a public benefactor to his fellow mortals but i would like it better if my gratuitous labor of eorre ond ence could be diffused over a larger space of time in speaking of this in the presence of a philanthropic friend he suggested that i embody the principal features of my experience in a pamphlet for general circulation  but     c  but sir i replied that which produced such bene ficial effects in my case may not prove equally effectual in those persons of a different constitutional temperament the reply was characteristic of the man and his humane  ideas  we are sent into this world for the common good he who omits a single opportunity of benefiting his fellow creatures forfeits his right to a single hour of happiness  thursday octorber ththis morning i notified my landlady that i should vacate my room on the first of next month she received the information with apparent indifference this did ot surprise me for i have recently been conscious that she had transferred her sympathies to some other quarter i think that the pecuniary favors i have so amply bestowed should have entitled me to grateful remembrance but the necessity of keeping boarders for a iiving tends to lessen those nicer sensibilities of which gratitude is the chief i have recently noticed that mrs nodar has received two new boarders and what struck me as singular they are both lean men  though not quite as lean as i had been the thought occurred to me that perhaps she was using my secret for her own pecuniary benefit today i received a polite note from professor collodion congratulating me on my remarkable success and inviting me to call at his rooms and sit for my photograph this from collodion gratified me exceedingly for on my pre vious visit the day before i commenced my  new life he met with considerable difficulty in obtaining a good likeness for the reason of peculiar atmosphere he told me but i was conscious of his saying to his assistant the fellow is too thin to throw a shadow the rascal was now pro fuse with his acknowledgmentsof the honor i was doing him    him by accepting his invitation after events confirmed my belief of what actatted his apparent generosity those gratifications that minister to pur selflove though perhaps trifling in their importance and evanescent in their character will often give a momentary pleasure that we prize far superior to the successful attainment of a lifelong struggle when the professor brought me the proof imperfect and unfinished as it was it gave me more pleasure than i dared confess i saw before me the realization of what six months persistent efforts had accomplished at that precise moment i was recognized as in the full pos session of that material substance which in its grace and perfect development forms the artistical line of beauty that will make a handsome picture observed the pro

how soon he may make a figure that  any of us would envy i ordered two copies to be finished in his best style and sent with the bill viewed entirely in the light of a work of art they presented a remarkably good appearance                    wednesday november th tomorrow will be my weddingday i cannot fully realize that such positive happiness is so nearsat hand when i look back to the many years trials i have passed through with scarcely a ray of hope that i should ever emerge from my unfortunate leanness to that comfortable state of flesh vouchsafed to all mankind the present seems like the beginning of my life with new hopes and aspirations to look forward to and new trials and afflictions to meet and throughout all to iv       to remember that not only my own individual happiness but that of all with whom i am associated is in my keeping  yet will the reader believe me i am thankful that i was so long afflicted it has made me a philosopher and are not philosophers

be equally divided among all patrick the porter receiving the same as maffit the book keeper need i say that i have been faithfully served there have been but few changes and i feel tolerably safe that my interests arewell cared for customers have often spoken of their uniform good treatment by all my assistants i am willing to acknowledge that i have been exceeding prosperous  this afternoon i was waited on by all my clerks w presented their congratulations on my approaching n ar riage and asked me to accept a trifling mark of their good will towards me it was a handsome service of silver

that they had not found the truereason set it down as providential and gave him up as doomed to death fortunately for the young man by the decease of a distant relative he became sole heir to a large

afterward he began to look like the young persons of his own age his recovery was considered miracu lous he had gained upwards of fifty pounds in less than three months in his case growth and even nourish ment itself had been arrested by some unknown cause in this connection i would strongly impress on the minds of parents with growing children that if they would have their offspring possess good sound constitutionsm with more of the pliysical stamina and less of the mental let them have meat once a day and a plenty of rough and rol licking exercisl at all times and the more noise they make with their lungs the less chance of their ever having sore throat or diptheria but i would not have it inferred that they may be allowed at that time as much animal food as they may wish far from it the appetite for meat grows by what it feeds on only a small quantity should be allowed and thaitportion not exceeded their children would thus have something solid for nature to make bone  and                  and muscle of and let no parent ever confine their chil dren to any stereotype food that is the same thing day after day without i change even roast turkey palls on the appetite two days after thanksgiving a plenty of milk with good yeast bread and butter vegetables particu larly boiled onions which keep the bowels regularand fruit of all kinds will complete the requirements of their health and growth children should at all times be comfortably clothed and never be allowed to go out in the cold without their legs and body being thoroughly protected a cruel fashion of halfdressing children has been the direct cause of more deats than all the infantile diseases combined bathng  the common belief that health requires the whole body to be immersed daily is one of those popular fallicies many goodnatured people get possessed of two or three times a week  or even once a week during the inclement winter seasonis su fcient for health i knew of awitdy who the year round used to take her children out of their bed in the morning and cruelly  souse  them into cold water after losing two or three by death from her mistaken regard for their health her husband humanely interfered and saved the remainder probably the greatest benefit may be obtained by taking a piece of coarse flannel wet with cold water and conamen ing at the hands move slowly upwards to the neck and shoulders

the weakness or lameness so often experienced by sedentary persons it will also increase the vital power of those nerves that act in sympathy with the bowels and they will respond to the labor of

no one affliction is more universal than tlis and yet the remedy for its radical cure can be obtained of any apothecary perhaps the reader will instantly exclaim of course pills my candid belief is that if the community had risen in their might and anger and crucified the rascal who first made a pill the act would have canonized every person engaged in it and after generations would have maintained those long years of life spoken of in the scriptures  from the earliest age down to the present e pills have been in universal request for the cure of costiveness and they have never cured a single case i there are occasions where a physician may prescribe a pill for some specific purpose which will prove beneficial but never as a remedy for constipation the only true remedy is the injection syringe inventors have succeeded in making these articles of flexible rubber with metallic connections and which now render the necessity of their use a positive pleasure instead of a torment as before these may be readily obtained at all the drug stores and apothecaries they retail for about two dollars and will last two or three years tepid water or even cold water is the only liquid necessary and the desired effect is immediate let no one think that even a daily resort to the injection syringe will ever produce a necessity for its use it is never so after frequent using in a little while the bowels will recover their natural nervous power which lolg con tinued costivenesshas impaired an injection given to a person struck with paralysis will often by moving the bowels restore the person to animation and in many cases of stoppage if used immediately relief will be obtained and life may be saved nutritious           nutritious food what is generally understood by nutritious food is everything that is usually eaten there  can be no greater mistake each human being is in some way constituted differently although with the same general organs and functions and the like desires and tastes what agrees with and nour ishes one person may not have the sam good effect on another some may eat the most indigestible food without being disturbed while to others it may cause dangerous illness it should be the duty of all to learn the kird of food that best agrees with themthat is what gives the most satisfactory enjoyment whatever it may be then tkat is the food which harmonizes with and nourishes them and will increase their growth and with equal reason that which invariably causes distress must be avoided by observing this simple rule the stomach will sustain its tone the spirits their cheerfilness and your days will be long in the land  stimulantsthe re are some constitutions which have  become debilitated through sickness or exposure to cimatic

victims of this insidious disease by their neglect to keep up the nourishment of their bodies by nutritious food when i see a man enter an eatinghouse or coffee room and order coffee and a piece of

organs gradually lose their power for want of nourishment and death speedily enters and takes possession coffee though possessing great stimulating power and a good aid to digestion when taken with other food cannot be used by every one to some persons who are very fond of it it is a seductive poison if too freely indulged in it will paralyze the digestive organs the action of the liver and

he had a ipe university educa tion and had mixed much with the aristoracy of great britain which sad given to his manner a  ght a very au isoghlty air but he was good man at heart cuc a nd ind an generous thaugh proud and haughty a n manners indeed his pride had been somewhat humbled by events which occurred in his family before he left england which it is not neces sary to relate as they have no special connection with this story suffice it to say that mr austin came to this country with a large fortune when his daughter was only three years of age and theron an infant and pur chased a small but beautiful estate at the place above named the little girl who was christened mary carolin avtis wa as beautiful as a little fairy when a child and as she advanced in years and budded into womanhood manifested the most brilliant gifts ofrmind and the most dazzling charmsof person at the period of which we write she was in the very perfection of her loveliness she was a girl of full medium stature lively and spirited in her manners and yet often of a dignified and queenlike air which deeply impressed the spectator with a sense of passion and of power yet undeveloped her features were exquisitely regular and fine and so plastic and expressive that you could see the very emotions of her heart pass across her face as you often see shadows come and go upon a landscape on a changeable summers day her hair was black and glossy and richly abundant and her eyes were bright and black and looked so laughing so witty and so deep and tender by turns that you could not but look at them with the deepest interest miss austin was educated by her father with the most watchful care and with no regard to expense she was sent to the best academies at philadelphia wilmington and baltimore and she had private tutors at home and her fater also devoted himself to the task of assisting and directing her education with the greatest earnestness particularly in refer ence to her moral and religious training the young woman exhibited talents which well repaid all this cultivation and long before the time when the twful scenes which we are about to describe took place  mary carry as she was familiarly called was celebrated throughout the coun try where she visited for her extreme beauty and her varied learning and accomplishments she seemed to be a universal genius and was equally famous for her skill in painting music singing dancing and other polite arts she also wrote poetry published in the wilmington papers which ws much admired and was thought by many to be the production of the milford bard a celebrated poet in that state now deceased but with all these attractions the rev mr austin observed in his daughter traits of character which made him tremble for her happiness she was tender and loving but she was also fiery and pashionate at times and fearfully violent she was religious and devotel to the practice ox   every virtue but shfe was so imaginative and fond of poetry and ro mances and novelreading tiat the poor father found it i hard task to keep her strong and excitable mind from wandering in forbidden paths she was in truth at this dangerous period of life a beautifiiland bril liant girl full of life and feeling and passion kind and loving yet wild and haughty and imperious religious yet wayward and thoughtless the admiration the wonder and the fear of her friends as the reader will readily suppose so beautiful a creature as mary carry and an heiress too would not long escap the attentions of young people of the other sex aind such we indeed and too unhappily the case mary austin had many lovers too early they began to pursue her and earnestly did they keep up the pursuit whenever she returned from school some gay young fellow from the city was sure to appear in the village f mattawan soon after avowedly for the purpose of hunting or fishing in the neighborhood but soon it would be found that he was  acquainted with the lovely inmate of the parsonage as her fathers house was called and the game he eoughlwaa not that which abounds iv woods and streams        the young girl received all these attentions with the most perfect good nature without coquetry and without disdain she seemed to enjoy the life which had opened before her with thegreatest zest and often gave way to fits of gushinghumor and laughing sport which some construed into evidences of a loose and vicious character to say the truth her father watched her with a jealous eye and was much alarmed by her  mixed and wayward nature rev mraustin had very lofty and ambitious feelings himself and he wished his daughter to form some great alliance he was therefore fear ful that she might make some misstep in early life or form an attachment for some one below her in rank and fortune he was therefore much disturbed when he found that his daughter appeared much pleased with the person and manners of a young man the son of a neighboring far mer named edgar worthngton who had grown up along with mary austin and had known her from early childhoodand who like the beau tiful maryhad been sent away to school and had now returned after seeing something of life a tall handsomie fellow with a figure like a graceful young hercules a brilliant complexion bold piercing eyes splendid white teeth a delicate silken moustache and a hand and foot as beautiful as a womans but edgar worthington was the son of a common farmeran honest worthy man it is true but not distinguishedly birth education or wealth he had been educated partly by the aid of a kind old uncle in new york who took a fancy to the boy and assisted his father to send him to college which he left before completing his education and went into a store in new york he also left the store for what reason was not known at home andby the aid ofmoney given him by his uncle was now living without employment often while at school and college edgar worthington came home during vacations and afterwards yhile at new york and always spent much of his time in the society of the lovely mary who it was easy to see favored his attentions more decidedly than those of her more wealthy suitors edgar was a constant attendant at church and en assistant in the sabbath school where he was sure to see the object of his desires and after as they walked home together towards her fathers the people could not help admiring the pair and reflecting what a measureless de gree of hope and love and poetry and passion there was in those two noble hearts now throbbing so ardently and yearning so fondly towards each other little dreaming what an awful fate awaited them the good old father good though distorted as he was in his ideas of the world saw the growing regard for young worthington with anything but pleasure he did not consider it a match sufficiently elevated for his daughter and he had a kind of fear that there was something secret and sinister in the character of the young man concealed under that manly but somewhat too voluptuous form that masculine gnd yet effeminate face and he urged his daughter not to permit him to visit her or wait upon her so freely but he was too late with his precaution the young people were already lovers fond devoted passionate lovers they had told their loves  hundred times they had embraced and sworn eternal constancy and kissed thevery essence of their hearts out upon each others lipsthe long long kiss of youth and lovethat kiss which thrills the human soul with ecstacy never to be exceeded in intensity of bliss by any other earthly sensation mary knew very well that her father disapproved of her regard for young worthington long ere he spoke to her on the subject  and knowing his proud and imperious character she did not dare to tell him what had occurred between them mary said mr austin one day some two or three months before      and edgar wrtuhwtton            the opening of this narrative mary my dear you are a good child you have always kept your word with me and i wish to ask a promise of you what is it father said the girl going up to him and parting his silver hair while she turned red and pale by flasheseidently excited by his serious manner      you consider a solemn promise the most sacred of obligations do you not so i have taught you continued he i do indeed exclaimed the girl earnestly no doubt thinking of her promises of love and devotion exchanged with her favorite edgar wellthen added mr austin  you are soon to be your own mis tress and i shall lose my legal control over you but as you are my only hope i beg you to grant me one favor in returnrfor my years of devotion to your interests and that is and he looked at her with a piercing glance that seemed to penetrateher very heart and that isa promise that you will never marry without my knowledge or conaentat least not he added with trembling voice while i live will you promise me this   the poor girl with all her spirit and daring was stricken as it were to the very earth by the suddenness of this appeal she was not pre pared for it if he had asked her if she loved eidgar worthington she would have confessed the truth if he had asked her to promise uot to marry edgar worthington she was too pure hearted to practise decep tion and she would have refused the promise but the question took her by surprise it was ingeniously put and the fatal promise was given she answered  yes father i promise it  solemnly and with god to witness your plighted word he added i do i do  exclaimed the almost frantic girl excited by the singu larity of her fathers conduct and beginningto fear that she had done wrong to give such a promise the old man then raised his daughter from the floor where she had fallen and impressed a kiss upon her forehead his lips were icy coldshe noticed and blessed her no other words were spoken a few days after this scene with her father mary austin met her lover by accident at the hlouse of a friend and learned xthat her father had called upon him ina formal manner and requested himto abstain from visiting his daughter and informed him that he would never sanction a      mary carinf austin mary caroline austin   union between them andthat his daughter was pledged by a sacred vow never to marry without his consent mary said he is this true have you given such a promise to your father i have o fatalerror if exclaimed the fond passionate girl hiding her face against the broad chest of her lover as if she wished to shut out some fearful vision from her sight he embraced her tenderly and ardently speechless a  trembling with indignation and strange fear of the future from this hour the lovers hastened rapidly and madly to theirfate the very impediment which had sprung up in their path served but to excite the flame of love which burned in their bosoms they met clan destinely and embraced each othermore passionately than ever miss austin was evidently in a  perfect  chaos of iove religion poetry filial affection pride passion fear and  almost revenge edgar was equally excited that he loved the beautiful and accomplished girl there can be no doubt perhaps as truly as any other man has ever loved though some have suspected that the wealth of the   lovely heiress was by  no means lightly regarded   and now  that the  precious treasure of love if not of gold was  denied him he became wrought up to a  pitch of feeling which seemed almost like insanity e   could not sleep he could hot content himself for an  hour during the day but was  forever seeking like a mier to watch over his treasure as if he feared some bold and sudden rob bery  he was the more excited by the presence in the village of some young gentlemen from baltimore wh  o knew miss austin and spent some days  there calling upon hey frequently and boasting of the favor with whch they were received by the old parson as her father was often styled  edgar resolved to suffer this life of  agony no longer but to bring mat ters to a crisis in  some way or  other and  end the terrible heartache which all parties suffered with this viewa he sent a note to mary and proposed to m eet her in a  little grove near her fathers house on s abbath morning before the hour for church a portion of what follows we know only from the statement afterwards made by edgar himself   and edgar worthngton      we now return to the opening of our narrative u it was that calm and beautiful sabbath morning described in the first page of this melancholy history the air was still and heavy with the odors of wild flowers and fragrant leaves and buds and eloquent with the songs of happy birds the music of the sabbath bells from bhurches far and near fell gently and sweetly upon the ear as if mellowed by the very stillness and richness of the atmosphere  and now stepped forth with hurried feet and beating heart from that fine old parsonage the beautiful mary austin dresse a in white like a bride and swinging her bonnet in one hand she walked rapidlytowards the grove where she had passed many a happy hour with her lover edgar worthington was already at the grove pacing back and forth with hasty strides and waiting the arrival of the illfated girl they met edgars wild looks and disordered apparel alarmed the young woman but she soox began to ymipathise with his feelings so he after wards said a piercing shriekthe wild cry of a female voicenow rent the still air the sound evidently proceeded from the grove where mary and edgar met                       rev mr austin was aroused by this cry and came to the door of his mansion hie saw a large number of persons who were passing along the road on their way to church leaving the public path and crossing his field to the grove a fearful thought flashed upon his mind  a crowd soon collected at the grove o horror i what a spectacle was there the lovely and accomplished mary austin with her throat cue and gashed the blood bursting forth at every pulsation of the heart over her long white robes was lying upon the earth loclked in the embrace of her lover edgar worthington whose throat was also cut and who was bleeding profusely i the blood of the dying losers mingled ia one stream as it flowed between them and over the lips of each which were still glued together in passionate bloody kisses the rev mr austin was among the first who reached the spotati witl the rest fell back aghast far an instant befoire the awful sight then without saying a word he reached forward and with almost superhuman power seized the body of his daughter and wrenching her from the grasp of the dying man raised her up and bord her off rapidly towards his house crying call a surgeon call a surgeon i     mary caroline austin some of the imediate friends of the clergyman followed him some ran for a surgeon and others of the party remained with the bleeding edgar who by thistime was insensible on anexiamination of the ground two razors were found only one of  them however bloody the grass also it was noticed showed some evidence that a struggle had taken place as it was much trampled and disordered miss austin fainted while her father was bearing her home but revived for a moment after she was placed upon a couch it was evident that she would die  the wound was a wide and ghastly one and had so far pene trated the great arteries that all hope of saving her life was vain her father saw this at a glance and with admirable presence of mind ques tioned her as to the manner in which she received the wound tell me  tell me by some sign if you cannod or press my hand for yes or push my hand away for no dj edgar worthington do this deed v  the poor dying girl choking and gurgling with blood and in the ago nies of parting from  body pushe body pushed the hand of her father convulsively away which the people interpreted into an answer  no was this your own act my dearest daughter  was it was it again inquired the agonized parent      the dying girl looked up with great intelligence in her eyes smiled sweetly upon the spectators grasped her fathers hand with an iron grasp which never again relaxed its hold nodded once for alland died a sensible man in the crowd which bent over the body of edgar wor thington made a compress with his handkerchief and binding it upon the bleeding arteries and veins checked the flow of blood until a shrgeon ar rived when it was found that the wounds were not immediately fatal and by skilful treatment the young man was brought back from a state of seeming death unto life he was much reducedin strength by the hemor rhage and lingered for many days in a very doubtful condition but finally recovered  it is no part of our design in writing this narrative to picture the va rious scenes which followed the tragical death of mary austinthe heart rending agony of the grayhaired father strong as he was in mind at first yet a child in feeling when di was overthe appalling gloom which spread over the little village of mattawanthe alarm which pervaded the    and edgar worthngton            hearts of the village maidens the awful sense of insecurity which filled the minds of parents who had sons and daughters brave and lovely like those who had fallen the various stories which were toldk about the de parted fair one and her noble lover  the dreadful notdei f preparation made by the officers of justice with a view to unravel the myitery of this extraordinary suicide or murdeir who could fathom it as soon as edgar recovered his snses and his ttrength sfficiently to speak he was questioned by the coronerh ansd  jusie t le peace re specting the awful tragedy he declared most somemil ihat it was a double suicidethat mary and himself had agreed  they could not be happy in life they would die together and seek anothel world that she inflicted the wound upon her throat with her own hand with one razor and that he cut his throat with the other and then they embraced and laid down to die together  but it was observed that only one razor was bloodyi and mary had a gash made by some sharp instrument on the back of heri iel which she could not easily have made with her own hlnd to this edgar replied that he was not sure that they used different razsrs though they had two but that he might have seized the razor which she had used after she had rdropped it and that perhaps the cut on the neck was made by soe sharp stones as she fell but no such stones ere foundon the spot where she lay and hence the idea of suicide on her art was received with much doubting by many persons two strong parties the friends of rev mr austin and of edgar worthington tow spoung up in the village the first declaring that it was a pure and undoubted murder inithe afist degree and the otherthat it was an attempted double suicide the last asserted firmly that mary austin had declared is plainly as he could while dy ing that she came to her death by her own act aid not by the hands of edgar worthington but the others denied this and affirimd that the poor girl was too far gone when questioneda upon the subject to speak or to make any reliable signs even if she had her senses sufficiently clear to do so among the party opposed to the idea of suicide rev mr austin was the most violent and vindictive and sought the life of edgar with a degree of earnestness which it was painful to behold  the coroners jury held an inquest upon e dbody of the deceased the remains of the beautiful girl were laid tim p  a coarse table in her bloodstained dress just as she fell with ler blody lips parted with a mary cfaroline austin    sweet yet awful expression her eyes as dark and brilliant as in life open and starting her hair dishevelled and matted with clots of blood and her pure breast so white and delicate streaked and dabbled with the crimson current which had gushed from her fond and passionate heart o it was a sight to make a pirate weep to behold that lovely body thus rent and desecrated and all for lose the sweetest dearest noblest feeling of the human soul and when the old man her father came in to give his testimony and the body was carefully covered out of respect to his feelings he rushed forward tore off thecovering and falling upon the body kissed her cold cheeks with terrible eagerness and wept tears almost bloody and groaned as if his soul would burst its confines and leave this world of sorrow to join his daughters spirit in another sphere of existence the jury after a long consultation returned a verdict that in their opinion mary caroline austin came to her death by the hands of edgar worthingtona result very generally anticipated the evidence was then passed over to the grand juiy an indictment was framed and the accused was put in irons and securely held for trial in the meantime the remains of mary austin were consigned to the tomb the ceremonies were deeply affecting and were attended by a vast concourse of people from the neighboring towns and villages a fu neral sermon was preached by a young clergyman from baltimore rev francis young ao minister who had known the parties could summon t ourage to perform that painful duty the sermon was extremely elo quent and touching after the discourse a simple hymn was sung by the young ladies of the sabbath school where mary had been a teacher the singers were all dressbd in white with a wreath of white flowers upon their heads the hymn was a simple one appropriate to the occa sion beginning          sister thou wast mild and lovely gentle as the summer breeze it was sung to a plaintive air and drew tears from many eyes unused to weep rev mr austin seemed utterly brokenhearted and went through the ceremonies as if almost unconscious of existence and when the grave closed over the remains of his daughter sunk down cold and insensible and had to belifted into his carriage his son richard aus tin then about sixteen years of age attended his father with watchful    and edgar worthogton              care and it was noticed that he indulged feelings even more vindictive and revengeful than his father towards the person who caused his sisters death  the trial of edgar worthington at lengthtook place and resulted ia  verdict of guilty of mtuder in the first degree after much difficulty nla a general expectation that the jury wouldst agree t   e lim its of lhis work will not permit us to give a detailed acount of the tial tose who desire to do so can get a full report of the case as published at the time by order of the court edgar conducted himself in a very modest and commendable manner during the trial and his fine frank noble countenance and elegant manners won him many friends he appeared deeply affected at times by the evidence and the remarks of the counsel and set for hours with his face buried in his hands he bore the verdict and the sentence like a man with blanched face and qulvering lip evi denty struggling with deep emotloiibut still like a man who could brave death as soon as the trialwas over ana edgarhad been condemned to deat the public feeling which had pursued him to this point began to relax and then came a reaction there was a doubt hanging over the question of murder edgar still protested his innoenceofthe rime and it began to be felt that ie had been persecuted rev mr austin and his eon richard had been so violent that their conduct had excited some illfeel ing against them besides revmr austin was looked upon as an eng lish aristocrat with ill concealed feelings of dislike by many persons edgar worthington was a handsome nobleheartedyoung american and his father was an honest worthy american farame natinal prejudies began to beexcited was not old mr worthington as much an object of sympathy as mr austin this question was asked and answered in the affirmative by a large party  a plan was soon formed which it was suspeeted the sheriff of the county favored to gain the pardon of the condemned young man or a  commutation of his punishment from the governor petitions were cir culated and numerouly signed and taken to the executive by able oun e ed and n um r                mary caroline austin sel the people anxiously awaited the answer it came at last the petition was rejectedthe young man mast die upon the scaffold and that speedily an awful atillness seemed to pervade the town the evening on which that answer was returned very few words were uttered either of regret or revenge but many strange glances were exchanged and secret whispers were breathed and men were seqn busily moving to and fro in the village as if some great and appalling danger was near at midnight near the county prison not far from mattawan might be seen d collcation of people silently moving towards the grim edifice the nighwas dark and the prison was wrapped in the deepest gloom no sound was heard save the light tread of men slowly and stealthily up proaching the prison walls now all at once ladders were raised against the wall in different places and the forms of men might be dimly seen scaling the enclosure one after another they dropped down into the yard the keepers of the prison were no doubt wrapped in sleep pre sently a violent crash was heard inside the yard as of a door suddenly burst open at thesame instant the great gate was rent and forced asunder by a strong force outside who had fastened a firehook to it with a hundred men at the rope the crowd outside now rushed in with shouts the keepers house was open the keepers were seized and held in durance by a strong guard of men all disguised the prison keys were seized the cell in which edgar wdrthington lay confined was opened and he was brought forth by friendly hands placed in a carriage and hurried rapidly away it was thought by some that the keepers were in the plot and the sheriff too but this was mere suspicion though it was a little singular that they could never identify any one of the persons who com mitted this daring deed edgar worthington however was safely off and no one knew whither he had gone or at any rate no one would tell great was the excitement in the village and neighborhood produced by this event and loud the talk as soon as it was known to the governor he offered a large reward for the arrest of the fugitive and several of the friends of rev mr austin with some officers set off in pursuit it was scarcely thirty days before news was reeeived that he had been taken prisoner no one could believe it it wasi thought impossible that an escape so well planned culd be frustrated after so long a starte ahad l               and edgoair v lthtngton           of the officers bat so it was  dgar was carried to an obscure place on the allegheny mountains where it was designed to keep himn till the pur suit should be over and then send him off to europe in some vessel in disguise it is supposed that the plotleaked out or some hint of it from some ofthe party concerned or the plan was guessed at sufficeit to say that he was followed to the place of concealment discovered avnd pounced upon by the officers he fought bravely and resolutely and again escaped but was fired at by the officers and twice brought down by shot wounds in his legs before he was finally recaptured in heavy chains and handcuffs the prisonor was conducted back to prison and a force of military was detailed by the authorities to prevent any further attempt at rescue on the part of his friends the day appointed for the execution was rapidly drawing near there seemed to be no hope of escape edgar still maintained a stout heart thoughl by no means defying death or dishonor and protested his inno cence of the crime of murder to all who conversed with him his father visited him and besought him ot to go to the scaffold with a lie upon his lips if he was really guilty but to confess the truth and make his peace with heaven ere it was too late edgar assured him that he was no mur derer and that he should die with courage even the ignominious dea th before himi  but the authorities feared that he would escape the saffold in some way or other if not by rescue at least by suicide all weapons and means of selfdestruction were therefore removed from his cell and his clothing and bed were searched for hidden poison he was also so chained that he could not suspend himself with a rope or blanket and thus anticipate the office of the gallows       the friends of the unfortunate youth were however by no means idle theydevised all sorts of plans to save his life for the public sympathy in his behalf was great it was doubtful if he had committeda murder and he had been sufficiently punished for his indiscretions already and deserved his life for his gallant conduct in this distressing affair a young surgeon frpih new york who had known edgar in that city came to mattawan quite by accident as he said and hearing of the situ ationi of his friend asked permission of the sheriff to visit him which was granted the interview was quiteprivate and lasted for along time the surgeon told the people that edgar had desired him to rem nin near b     w           imary caroline austin him till the last awful scene was over and to take charge of his body and see it properly disposed and interred and this he had agreed to do under this arrangement the young surgeon was admitted daily to visit edgar and indeed became his chief counsellor and friend and received all his commissions and last requests only one day now remained and one night before the execution must talre place edgar was still alive contrary to the confident predictions of his enemiesfor enemies he had earnest and malignant who longed to seehimsuspended between heaven and earth such is human nature but edgar was still alive brave in heart and almost cheerful in aspect many wondered at this and many condemned hip for his coldness and want of feeling and said he was a hardened villain others charitably attributed his calmness to a sense of innocence and christian resignation and admired him and wept for him all the more the women and the girls pronounced him an angel of goodness and a monster of iniquity by turns half a dozen times a day as the popular breezes seemed to blow the fatal mornting dawned and found edgar still firm and calm though pale and serious and ready for his awful fate as he parted with his friends he could scarcely speak and the tears would now and then start into his eyes but hedid not weep his father was too much distressed to see him his mother was not living and he had no brothers or sisters at home  finally the last words were spoken the last hand was grasped and the sheriff came into the cell tolead forth the prisoner the young surgeon was still his faithful attendant and remained near his person to the last the gallows was erected inthe prison yard an awful old la chine which had lain idle for many years and seemed almost unfit for the military guarded the passage from the prison to the scaffoid marching iii solid double columns on either side of the civil force a limited number of persons were admitted into the yard and the gate and grounds of the prison were watched by a force of special police selected for the occasion it was noticed however that the policemen were nearly all edgars friends and it was believed that the sheriff favored his in terests   and eigar worthngton     edgar ascended the scaffold with a firm step but with an airofilhe deepest dejection and distress religious ceremonies were then peformed in the usual manner during which the prisoner exhibited the utmost calmness and knelt down while the prayer was uttered in the most rever ential manner the sheriff then asked the prisoner if he had anything to say before the last act of juatice was perfornmed he replied that he had and coming forward addressed the people we copy upon the following page the report of the baltimore papers           mary caroline austin dying speech of edoar worthngton edgar worthington with a tremulous voice said  i feel it a duty which i owe to the many kind friends who have hon ored me with their regard to declare in this public manner my innocence of the crime for which i now stand condemned i should feel myself unworthy of that regard unworthy to live unfit to die if i had permitted myself to indulge in falsehood upon this point with my friends no i have spoken truth and i now speak truth in reference to this matter when i say that i am innocent of the crime with which i am charged i did not murder mary austin with all the passion which burned in my soul with all the madness which racked my brain i was not mad or wicked enough to take that precious life with my own hands the at tempt to commit suicide was mutualit was an agreement fairly entered into by both of us it was talked over long before and often and the time was mutually decided upon we met for that very purpose o would to heaven we had been successful the fatal act was committed by boeti at the same moment mary austin screamed as she struck the blow and failed to effect her purpose completely i supposed that i haddone the deed for myself effectually we both felland mary again applied the razor to her throat and begged me to aid her frantic as i was and wild with excitement i seized her hand what i did h know not but i feel in my heart absolved of the crime of murder but i do not say i am guiltless of any offence i now feel thati was guilty of a fearful offence when i permitted myself to indulge the idea of suicide and more guilty aye darkly and deeply guilty when i united with her who has gone before me to the spirit land to plan that awful death but o my friends pardon me as i hope heaven has pardoned mfe in response to my prayers for this dreadful deed i was mad i was frantic i was beside myself i knew not what i did in those hours of suffering  i was in love with an angela love so deep so ardent so absorbing no words can de scribe it my love was returned deeply fondly fully our hearts were united too firmly to beseparated while life should last the consumma tion of that love was denied by one who should have been a friend to both life seemed to us no longer desirable to me all the world was a blank void the sun no longer shonethe very heavens seemed hung    and edocar vobthngton            with black marymy now sainted marydeclared that to die would be a happiness i sympathised with this feeling and rashy agreed to seeli with her relief from our woes in death her fatal vow hich you know so well was the cause of all i wish to utter no reproaches now but o you fathers beware how you in your coldblooded age seek to decide affairs of love for the warm and ardenthearts of your children beware how you thwart their young affections and seek to bind them with even chains of gold to your ambitious purposes and o you young men and you maidens you now see one who is the victim of unregulated feel iugs and unrestrained passion though that passion was the sacred one of love beware o beware how you rashy indulge the idea of selfdestruc tion as a means of escaping from the ills of life i but rather seek by wise control of your feelings and the aid of religion to bear the illsayou have instead of rushing upon greater ills as i have done ending perhaps in a felons death i but now i must meet my doom and i wish to do so at peace with all the world and at peace with heaven whose forgiveness i have sought with a devout and penitent heart those who have injured me i freely and fully forgive and of those whom i have injured i beg forgiveness to those who have been kidcl and charitable towards me i offer the heartfelt thanks of a dying man i have but one request to make whiph is that when i am dead my body may not be laid in a felons grave or given up to rude hands for dese oration o i can brave death but my soul shrinks with horror from the idea of having my remains made the subject of unfeeling  here his utterance was choked by his rising emotions and he bent his ead and hastily wiped away his tears while the tears of the spectators flowed freely in sympathy  he then proceeded i beg that no unknown or rude hands may get possession of my remains i b ge that my body may not be laid in a felons grave for o i feel that i am no murdereri am no felon i am guiltyi am unfortunatebut i am no murderer i call on heaven to witness that i am not i ask for no monuinenti ask for no epitaph i only ask permission for my body to lie quietly in the bosom of the earth unmarked by signs of infamy i ask that my friend dr kelly may have possession of my body and to his care i implicitly confide my remains the sheriff here nodded assent with these words i now bid you all a long an affectionate farewell  the prisoner then shook hands with the sheriff dr kelly and other friends his arms were tied behind him the black cap was drawn over his mary caroline austin face the rope was adjusted upon his neck the drop fell and edgar wor thington hung suspended by the neck according to thedread sentence of the law le struggled but little and all seemed overof the spectators in the prisn yard and the immense oncourse of people who had climbed upon the prison walls and upon the buildings and house tops in the neighborhood now began to disperse many of them with tear ful eyes all with sad hearts and melancholy faces the women clinging closer to their husbands and lovers as if fearful that they too might meet with some awful fate ere they had got beyond the view of this dismal scene  when the body had hung w the time required y law it was cut down and passed intoathe hands of dr kelly who had it put into a carriage and removed to the house of a friend near by th next dy a quiet u neral was held attended by the sheriff and a few friends and the body of the unfortunate young mn was buried by the village sexton in the public burial ground agreeably to the last wish of the deceased and a watch was kept over he grave for several weeks by order of dr kelly to prevent any chance of disinterment     the excitement which had so long existed in the neighborhood i o sequence of the appalling events herein narrated began to die away and quiet was once more restored tothe minds of the people now sprung up fresh and most unforeseen causes of excitement and wonder captain karsoll an old citizen of mattawan who had been in oregon for several years returned to his native town and immediately on his arrival having heard just before he reached home of the trial and execution of worthington declared that he met the young man on the california route just beyond st joseph missouri as he was coming into that place he said worthington was evidently disguised but the prac ticed eye of the old hunter was not to bedeceived  he had known hir i ryears and recognised him at once and spoke to him worthington  nicd his name and all knowledge of the captain but he was ready te ear he was not mistaken and would swear to it now although the peo          and edgar worthngton            ple assured him that the young man was beyond all question executed and buried according to law so positive was captain karsoll of the fact that he had seen worthing ton tn the plains that the people finally induced the sexton to open the grave and examine the coffin a great crowd assembled to witness the disinterment thegrave had evidently not been disturbed since it was made on reaching the bottom the coffn was still there and was as heavy as wheh lowered into the earth but on removing the lid lo there was no body in it but instead a log of wood shrouded in grave clothes with a masi of wax resembling the young man having so much the ap pearance of a realbody that many persons at first supposed it was the corpse itself there was material for a terrible excitement i how was all this done who had done it  was worthington really executed or was he not was he still alive if so by what miracle or what secret art had lie es caped from death  who could tell everybody said it was dr kellys ivork no one elsecould have done it but how could he do it there was the mystery if worthington was suffocated how could he bring him to life if his neck was broken how could dr kelly mend it or did he have an iron collar on with braces going under his arms so tlat he was not choked at all this last idea was declared to be totally un founded for the sheriff and half a dozen more persons saw his bare neck when the rope was adjusted and there was no collar or other protection upon it how then did he escape from death or had he escaped here was doubt and mystery enough to set the town wild with excitement the more they tallied about it and the more they reasoned upon the whole event the more fully did the people become convinced thiat wor thington was still alive  the next thing of consequence that was heard ofin connection with this matter was that richard austin the brother of the deceased girl had started for california with a party of friends who were going to that land of gold from new york mr austin had sanctioned his going and given him ample imeans for the journey he said nothing of his designs before leaving but from the sudden resolution which he had taken on hearing captain karsolls story and seeing the disinterment of worthingtons coefin the object of his journey was thought to be not the desire for wealth or adventuie but revenge if worthington were really alive dick austin as he was called was at this time quite a youth in age           mary caroline austin but he was of large size for one of his years and a fierce highspirited fellow partaking largely of his fathers character and feelings he was notorious for his quarrels and fights and was considered lrather a rough and headstrong boy no one was surprised that he had gone off to cali fornia to seek the murderer of his sister as he invariably called the unfortunate worthington  time passed on and nearly a year had expired before anything of in terest to the reader was heard from richard austin who was still in cal ifornia when at last a letter was received from him which sent a thrill of horror and astonishment through the hearts of the people of mattawan as soon as its contents were made known rev mr austin could not conceal the satisfaction and pride which this letter gave him and he showed it freely to his friends and copies of it were taken and handed about and a portion of it soon got into the newspapers and excited the greatest in terest by the singular nature of its details the extract of richard austins letter to his father which was published read as follows  dear father  i have a most extraordinary piece of intelligence to communicate to you the story which captain karsoll told us about seeing edgar worthington near st joseph was true he did escape from the gallows alive and calue out to california i could hear nothing of him here for many months but three days ago i tet him accidentally at the clifton diggins from which i now write he was in a drinking ailoon and was much intoxicated anddelirious from the effects of liquor i knewhim at once although hemhad evidently sought to disguise himself with heavy whiskers and moustache green spectacles c  his face ex hibited the most haggard and ghastly appearance the effects no doubt of bardship intemperance and disease i knew him at a glance but he did  not appear to recognize me i thenspoke to him saying how are you edgar  the sound of my voice calling that name appeared to rouse him from his delirious condition and he looked up wild and trembling and exclaimed who are you who are you talking to  using foul and edgar worthngton            and profane epithets which i will not repeat i replied coolly i am richard austin whose sister you murdered and you are edgar wor thington a fugitive from the gallows there was a crowd of people in the saloon and they all started back with surprise and fear at this an nouncement edgar sprung into an attitude of defence uttering a wild demoniac yell pulled off his slouched hat and a wig of false hair reveal ing himself more fully to my view and drawing a long hunting knife exclaimed yes villain i am edgar worthington i did murder your sister and ill murder you for a song i and he rushed fiercely towards me but ere he had moved two feet i discharged my revolver which i had  drawn as soon as i saw him and planted a bullet deeply in his chest he fell uttering the most horrible yells and imprecations convulsions ens sued then delirium and finally he sunk insensible on the floor of the saloon  he was placed upon a bed and lingered in a state of great suffering with short intervals of ease till this morning when he expired i sur rendered myself to the dffieers and after abrief examination was released on the ground that i had fired upon the maniac in selfdefence which was true for if i had failed in my aim he would have plunged his dagger to my heart unless providentially prevented by the crowd in the saloon but the most singular tart of my story is yet to come during the  intervals of quiet before hisideath edgar made p confession of the man ner in which he escaped from thegallows and also acknowledged that he was idore guilty of my sisters death than he had before confessed hle stid that he induced her to consent to a suicideprovided the razors annd brought them to the place of meeting without her knowledge directed her hand after she had failed to do the deed and was in fact as much her murderer as if he had done the whole work himself the manner of his escape from the gallows was truly extraordinary he said that dr kelly the surgeon was sent for by his friends to aid his escape dr kelly told him that if he could sd fall as not to dislocate his neck or spine he oould save his life and as worthington was a strong muscular fellow he thought he might do it the neck the surgeon said was seldombroken in athletic subjects by hangingbut they died by suf focation by the air being shut out from the lungs dr kelly said that he had frequently opened the windpipe in cases of inflammation of the throat and in croup and cases of suffocation by getting hard substances lodged in the air passage and that the patient could easily live and           mary caroline austin breathe through a tube inserted in the windpipe below the seat of the difficulty he thought he could operate upon the windpipe of the pris oner and adjusta tube to the aperture below the place where the rope would choke himso that he could continue to breathe after he had fallen if his spine should not be broken until he was cut down especially if the rope did not happen to obstruct the circulation of the blood in the great arteries and veins on both sides of the neck as it rarely ever does dr kelly said he had studied this subject with great care as one of the ouri ositiesof science and had tried many experiments on animals to see if the thing could be done and he was satisfied by his course of study and experiment that it was perfectly feasible and afforded a good chance of escape worthington said he consented to try the experiment and the opera tion was performed in the most skilful and ingenious manner a small aperture was made in the windpipe very far downbelow the upper line of the cravat and a silver tube was introduced so contrived that it could be covered enabling him still to breathe through his mouth or uncovered and thus breathe through the tube alone it was by no means a painful operation and was worn with much ease and comfort he said he had much more difficulty in removing it and healing the wound than he had while the tube remained there and he exhibited the wound which was not yet thoroughly healed everything worked as dr kelly had predicted the rope pressed only upon the right arteries and veins and left the circulation of the other side somewhat free although he was rendered almost insensible by the pressure of blood upon the brain his neck was not broken by the fall which you will recollect was an unusually short one and hesuffered very little injury from the attempt at execution he was cut down by the kindness of the sheriff before the usual time had elapsed and passed into the custody of dr kelly who immediately removed the body applied stimulants internally and externally and inflated his lungs artificially and used other means of relief such as bleeding galvanism c c and in two hours he was nearly as well as ever a sham funeral was had a watch set over the grave and you know the rest worthington was got off in the night and travelled by private carriage to missouri whence he started for california with a rough party and suffered all sorts of hardships and much difficulty with his throat having lot the dressings which dr kelly had given him to heal it   and edgar wo rtbhngton          when he related these things he was very quiet and rational and there is no doubt of the truth of the story i have even the silver tube which was worn in his throat he thanked me a thousand times for being the cause of his death in the way that i was in selfdefence and thus saving him from the guilt of another murder he said he had often wished that he had died upon the scaffold instead of taking so much pains to preserve a life which was useless to him worse than useless a torture and an agony forever while he lived he said he had tried to lose his life repeatedly on the plains and mountains and in the diggings by the most reckless adventure but he could not succeed he seemed fated to livewhich to him was the worst of all punishments he hated life but he could not summon courage to rid himself of the burthen by suicide for the very idea of it conjured up such a crowd of images that he was too insane even to do it he had sought relief from his horrible mental sufferings he said in the unlimited use of alcohol and of opium when he could get it and the use of these deadlypoisons only increased his tor tures when he was not completely under the influence of one or both he said he had worked in the mines but not to get gold for the sake of gold but to get rum and opium and he had indulged himself iu their use with out restraint with no hope no desire but to die  we were compelled to give him laucanum and liquor to keep his ner vous system sufficiently quiet to obtain this confession for it was only when he was partially under the influence of opiates or spirits that he wasreally in his senses at other times the pains in his chest and the delirium tremens rendered his condition truly horrible to beholdand none but the boldest hearts could remain in the room and witness the awful spectacle which he presented or listen to his ravings without the most intense and painful feeling of terror and disgust  at last however he got more quiet and died peacefully and rational with words of deep contrition and penitence upon his lips thus wrote richard austin the letter created a deep sensation in mattawan and indeed throughout the country where the incidents were known richard austin soon after returned from california but he soon perceived that mattawan would no longer be an agreeable residence for  him and he induced his father to sell their property and remoye to some other part of the country where they have settled we do not know    mary caroline austin and edga     iortsiington and thus ends this strange eventful awful narrative of love and crime a narrative replete with interest of the most startling character and cal culated to teach a lesson of moral wisdom to every reader who has sense to see the truths it teaches or a heart to feel the force of the impressive the end lunarius  lunarius a visitor from the moon new york national temperance society and publication house  william street  entered according to act of congress in the year  by j n stearns in the clerks office of the district court for the southern district of new york rockwell  churchll printers and stereotypers  washington st boston   the investigations of lunarius of late years there has been much specu lation among philosophers relative to the plurality of worlds and whether other planets and orbs are like our own teeming with sentient rational intelligent beings and if so what is this physical structure have they bodies like ours what is their char acter have death and woe ever entered their abodes or have they kept their first estate and are they like our first parents in paradise in primeval innocence holding constant delightful converse with  th investigations god  scanning his works and glorying in his perfections if they are fallen beings has the same stupendous display of mercy the same magnificent scheme for their res toration to the divine favor been published among them and shall we eventually if saved mingle with the virtuous and good of those distant and distinct worlds after all the machinery for our material existence having become useless shall be demol ished together with the great globe itself on which we dwell these and questions of similar import have often agitated the minds of men but whatever may be the truth in regard to these imaginings and leaving philosophers and speculatists to pursue their inquiries i beg leave here to relate an occurrence that has for some days past occupied more or   xi     of lunarius  less of my thoughts and in which i confess i have become a good deal interested hav ing perhaps presumptuously consented to deliver a temperance lecture to the good people of this town and claiming to be in one respect at least not unlike the great jew ish lawgiver slow of speech i turned aside into a retired grove to try to study out some form of sound words wherewith to deliver myself of the message night had overshadowed the earth and busy mortals had retired to rest while deeply musing and not a little perplexed as to what the matter of my speech should be my attention was suddenly arrested by a singular phenomenon casting my eyes towards the full moon  which was then just about midway toward the zenith  i discovered poised on easy pinions about the investigations midway in the heavens in reality or imagi nation which i need not tell  it matters not  i saw or imagined i saw a being of unearthly make lofty erect majestic benignant in all his movements graceful and heavenly it was lunarius he had come from that bright orb which was then reflecting with such mildness its soft lustre upon the earth the philosophers of his native planet it seems like those of our own had long in quired and tried but tried in vain to solve the problem whether the earth which to them was the most proximate and next to the sun by far the most glorious object in the heavens was inhabited and if so what were the character condition employments and prospects of the beings that dwelt upon it lunarius having obtained permission   of lunarius       from the lord of his sphere had in behalf of his species undertaken this first voyage of observation and discovery arriving in the vicinity of our earth and having stationed himself in the position above described he had unobserved hitherto spent much time in surveying our world and looking into the affairs of men it did not take him long to discover that he had come to a rebellious province of gods dominions while some things seemed to indicate that this revolted world was still to some ex tent under the government of the great creator many most revolting scenes passed under his observation he discovered with the deepest grief that the races of man had given themselves up to violence and the indulgence of passions almost unrestrained and that the greatest enemy of mankind is      the investigations man but amid these scenes of universal wretchedness and woe there was one de partment of human pursuit and suffering that particularly attracted his attention and deeply affected him what it could image much he searched to know and still he stood and gazed and wondered long and the longer he gazed and stood the more he wondered till all his thoughts and passions seemed engrossed by what he saw and led him perhaps unconsciously to break the silence stranger inhabitant of the earth said he  what mean those dark unsightly dens which i see scattered so frequently in the dells and corners of the earth that send forth vapor and fire and smoke and stench i see the busy multitude wending their way   of lunarius       thither from every point laden with the fruits of the earth which were evidently designed by the beneficent creator for the sustenance of man and casting their bur dens unhesitatingly into the fiery crater again i have looked to see if anything was borne away from these receptacles from which i might infer that the fruits of the earth had been worked over and better adapted to the wants of man but though long ive looked with painful eye ive looked in vain but i see issuing from every one of them through dark leaden pipes certain fiery streams these flow out into numerous reservoirs and then in innumerable smaller streams they are con veyed to your cities and towns and villages and all over your vast prairies over your hills and through your valleys to almost     the investigations every habitation of man i see the multi tude everywhere eager for its approach and opening their houses and their mouths even to receive the fiery fluid i see the aged and the young the decrepit and the healthy the male and the female the high and the low the rich and the poor plung ing with desperate strides into the stream and goging themselves therefrom i see parents laving their children with it and ever and anon pouring it down their necks and the delicate female even receiwing it to her lips but continued he  the effects which i perceive inevitably to follow upon coming in contact with these streams perplex and trouble me much here lunarius went into an enumeration at length of the dreadful effects which   of lunarius       from his aerial seat he had himself witnessed with a particularity and in a strain of eloquence that would have done credit to a modern temperance agent or a washing tonian who had lived all his life in the midst of these fiery streams and been himself deeply affected thereby but time would fail me to follow him in this painful enu meration suffice it to say that so far as his observation had gone the effects were only evil his heart had not yet been re lieved by the discovery of any good the minutest  intermingled with the evil des olation and woe seemed to characterize the progress of these streams wherever they went o man inhabitant of the earth and better skilled than a stranger from a distant planet in the economy of man will you relieve this aching heart he     the investigations kindly asked by informing me now what good accrues to mankind from the operation of this vast machinery as an offset for the multitude of evils which it brings upon your speciesi replied i cannot tell what continued lunarius dost thou know of no good derived from it to thine unhappy race to compensate for all the anguish and blood and death which it pro ducesi said i know of none  wilt thou not then o mortal man he asked again in tones of the deepest earnestness wilt thou not assemble the wise men of your earth your philosophers and sages and physiologists your moralists and good menthat i may diligently inquire of them that i may understand this great mystery that this enigma may be solved before i return to my native spherei   of lunarius       said i will try thereupon i jmmedi ately called the trumnpeter and told him to sound the trumpet shrill and long by the time it had done sounding i saw before me or imagined i saw before me i need not tell which it matters not a vast assemblage of the wise men of the earth venerable for age and learning and wisdom among whom i discovered presidents and governors and senators and kings and emperors and jurists and physicians and divines and apostles and prophets and farmers and mechanics in deed all classes of our race were repre sented in the vast assembly they had come to aid lunarius in his investigations and furnish him if in their power with a solution of the painful difficulty he had en countered in his inquiries into the condition of man     hrne investigations lunarius from his aerial seat with an air of majesty benignity and grace and in tones of deep earnestness and solemnity immediately addressed himself to his dis tinguished auditors who listened with the most respectful attention to the celestial visitant time would fail me to recapitulate his exordium or indeed anything more than the numerous questions propounded by lu narius and the substance merely of the re plies made by his learned and distinguished catechumens expressed in the briefest man ner possible should i have written it all down it would have made a library as large as the encyclopaedia after a suitable address lunarius thus began his inquiries o men  inhabitants of this terrestrial   ei     of lunarius       globe can you tell me wherein is the good that men propose to themselves by this vast enginery and apparatus with which almost all your race seem to be more or less con nected and which so far as i am yet able to discover is productive of evil only bear with me while i inquire in detail  are these streams on which so many seem to feed productive of any nourishment to the body the response was distinct and universal that chemical analysis and universal ex perience have demonstrated that there is no more nourishment in a draught of these waters than there is in a flash of light ning   well do they not prevent disease dr john james late of upper alton in behalf of his profession arose and replied     thnl investigations emphatically that these waters have an in jurious influence in all the diseases that affect the human system they originate many and aggravate and add to the pain and danger of all  i perceive said lunarius that when a man first comes in contact with them he seems to be stronger do they not increase permanently a mans strength the venerable dr rush replied they impair strength  well my good doctor continued lunarius let me ask do they not improve the appetite dr rush again in behalf of the whole profession replied they occasion a decay of appetite  do they not allay thirst many voices answered the oftener and   of lunarrus       more a man drinks of them the oftener and more thirsty will he be  do they not promote digestion dr sewell who has investigated this point thoroughly and published to the world a picture of the living stomach of one who had taken frequent draughts at these streams stepped forward and declared that the use of these waters deranges the func tions of the stomach and if persisted in seldom fails to change its organic struct ure  do they not fortify the body against the effects of cold weather this is far from being true promptly answered dr rush  the temporary warmth it produces is always succeded by a greater disposition in the body to be affected by the cold      the investigations  doctor are they not necessary in warm weather as well replied the doctor  might we throw oil into a house the roof of which was on fire in order to prevent the flames from extending to its inside as pour these in flammable waters into the stomach to lessen the effects of a hot sun upon the skin  i observe said lunarius  that these waters are much used by the husbandmen while gathering in the produce of the soil pray be so good as to inform me are they not necessary in time of haying and har vest a farmer instantly replied ever since i banished them from my farm i have had my crops got into my barns in better order and in better season and with less trouble than before   of lunarius        are they not necessary for firemen on board of steamboats asked lunarius captain holcomb known to many western travellers replied i have run a steam boat the whole length of the western waters for a whole season together without losing a trip or suffering an accident and not a drop was allowed to the hands on board  are they not necessary for seamen in the coldest latitudes an english sailor replied that a danish crew of sixty men well supplied with provisions and thesefiery waters attempted to winter in hudsons bay but fiftyeight of them died before spring an english crew of twentytwo men destitute of these waters and obliged to be almost constantly exposed to the cold wintered in the same bay and only two of them died     the investigations  i perceive said lunarius they temporarily increase strength and agility is that increased activity and strength usually expended in useful purposes several voices instantly replied if run ning jumping wrestling fighting and act ing like a bear a tiger or a monkey be useful then we might answer this question in the affirmative  do they not make a mail more in telligent and wise a venerable patriarch in behalf of the whole assembly gravely replied that the experience of thousands of the race and the observations of millions more go to show that although they make a man wise in his own conceit they make him a fool in the estimation of everybody else that although they give a wild and mad   i of lunarius       dening impulse to the brain for a short interval they eventually impair and waste its energies and our holy oracles affirm that whoso is deceived thereby is not wise  do they not strengthen the mem ory dr sewell replied the memory is enfeebled and sometimes quite obliterated by their use  well doctor do they not strength en the judgment doctor sewell replied the judgment becomes clouded and impaired in its strength under their influence and dr warren a distinguished surgeon added that no surgeon having an important operation to perform could safely take even one glass of wine  the weakest     the investigations form of these waters for it would dis turb his judgment in a greater or less degree  twill they not make a mechanic more skilful a mechanic replied by exclaiming sar castically whoever heard of a man being better qualified to put a watch together or some other intricate machinery byfirst getting drunk  i have noticed said lunarius that they temporarily excite mens intel lects to greater action is not that in creased action usually judicious and use ful the moral and intellectual philosophers responded we often hear of men being better fitted to serve the devil but who ever heard of a mans devising better plans   of lunarius       for serving god and his country when drunk than when sober  will they not raise a man in his own sober estimation a washingtonian replied after i had recovered from their influence i loathed and despised myself more heartily than i did the very reptiles that crawled on the ground  does not the business upon the whole promote in men habits of cleanliness and decency a voice promptly responded for an answer to this question o lunarius turn your head into the door of one of the common taprooms whence these burning waters ooze out and if you can withstand the column of noxious vapors that is ever oozing from them stand in your tracks     theit investigations long enough to witness the degraded miserable remnants of men entangled in the meshes of satan staggering loung ing spewing foaming and wallowing in their own filth and shame or for another example you may see one literally lying with a dozen hogs in the mud and filth  a spectacle which is not unfrequently wit nessed  will they not enable a man to make better bargains a farmer replied that he had known a man to barter away even the rails that enclosed his cornfield and turn it into the commons after drinking a glass or two of these waters when only an hour or two before the very proposition was treated with the utmost scorn  but continued lunarius will they   of lunarius       not make a man more careful in contracting debts a sherif present replied that he had in the performance of official duty sold many valuable estates to pay debts fool ishy contracted under the influence of the insanity occasioned by these waters  but do they not insure greater punctuality in the payment of debts all the merchants present responded that nearly all their bad debts were against intemperate men  do they not promote a mans cred it a sagacious merchant replied that he had recently refused a man credit for no other reason than because his breath smelled of the liquors from these pestilen tial streams    ithe investigations  will they not protect a man from insult and violence asked lunarius to this the whole congregation re sponded there is no class of men on this terrestrial globe so often abused and laughed at and maimed and robbed and stripped of everything as the poor drunk ard  will they not make a man more re spectchle  the congregationagain replied there is no man more shunned as a companion than the drunkard  but do they not increase his useful ness  asked lunarius a philosopher replied a mans useful ness depends upon the action of his body or his mind or both how can his usefulness then be promoted by that which destroys   of lunarius       both as well talk of increasing the strength of a horse by cutting his ham strings  will they not make a man a kinder and better and more provident husband and father asked the celestial visitant a philanthropist who had been much in the habit of visiting the abodes of wretched ness immediately arose and said permit me as an appropriate answer to this ques tion to relate something i recently heard in a wretched  cabin that i visited mother said a little palefaced sickly looking boy  mother this bread is very hard why dont we have cake and nice things as we used to when we lived in the great house oh that was such a pretty house mamma and such a pleasant garden all filled with flowers and you made such     the investigations sweet music with your fingers and pa would sing pa used to laugh then and tell me pretty stories and take me on his knee and say i was his own dear boy  mamma what makes pa so sick and look so bad it makes me afraid when he stamps on the floor and says so loud george go off to bed mamma will he get well again and take me on his knee again and sing me a sweet song and love me as he used to do mamma what makes you cry did i make you cry it makes me sorry to see you so sad and unhappy wont you wipe away your tears and smile again  my son o my george my child your father is a drunkard  but do they not make a woman a better wife or more kind and faithful mother   of lunarius       the whole congregation in horror ex claimed a drunken wife a  drunken mother spareus spare us o lunarius  well then do they not promote the respectability of a mans family the whole vast assembly responded as with the voice of one man we have never heard of a family being more respected by the virtuous and good in consequence of using these liquors we can point to thou sands of families whose reputation has been ruined but not to one whose respectability has been increased by them  do not these waters promote the interest eventually of the dealers them selves here rev dr edwards who had spent much time in investigating this point arose and stated many facts only one of which i     the investigations can here repeat in a single county in the state of new york said he of two hundred and seventeen dealers one hundred and fiftyfive failed in their business and seventynine are known to have died drunk ards  well does not the drinking or dealing in these liquors promote peace of mind  oh the indescribable horrors of mind i have suffered exclaimed a washingtonian i have felt at times such a sinking it seemed to me i could not live i could compare my feelings to nothing but a burning fire  we were compelled to quit the business exclaimed several voices because we could have no peace of mind while we remained in it well may they tremble added chief justice daggett lest the blood of   of lunarius       murdered bodies and souls should be re quired at their hands  are they not favorable to the virtue of a mans family if you will cast your eye o lunarius over the whole surface of this globe re sponded the great congregation  you will find no class of children so vicious and so destitute of all moral culture as those of the drunkard and especially the children of the drunkardmaker  will they not prevent men from committing suicide  a reformed drunkard exclaimed i was strongly tempted to put an end to myself another said many a time have i felt life to be really a burden and but for the fear of plunging into still deeper woes it would have cost me but little effort to terminate in     the investigations the most summary manner my existence a coroner also testified that threefourths of all the suicides are instigated by these liquors   well do they not silence the tongue of slander rev dr beecher an eminent divine re plied if the tongue ever sets on firb the whole course of nature and is itself set on fire of hell it is when stimulated by these fiery potations  but said lunarius let me inquire again will they not add to the comforts of a mans house keep its windows whole the roof from leaks his garden clean of weeds his fences whole his gates locked his bars put up his hogs yoked or his cattle and hbrses fat if you have yet cast your eye upon the   of lunarius       field or house of the drunkard o lunarius you have an answer was the reply  do they not render the dealer him self more kind and benevolent in his dis position a former mayor of the city of alton arose and said emphatically i have often thought if there was any class of men under the heavens of the lord entirely destitute of sympathy it is the rumseller he il lustrated it by a variety of facts  do they not promote purity of thought and action a philanthopist replied that those dens of infamy in our large cities would scarcely be sustained but for the influence of stim ulating drinks an eminent jurist added that nearly every man in our country pun ished for criminality in that direction ha      tiie investigations confessed that he was excited by these liquors when he committed the crime  do they not promote a mans liberty asked lunarius the multitude answered they are the greatest incentives to slavery that exist on the globe they make the man a slave of his appetites and passions they trip up his feet without violence and bind him hand and foot in the gutter without chains  do they not diminish the tenants of your penitentiaries rev louis dwighlt secretary of the american prison discipline society an swered fourfifths of all the inmates com mitted their crimes under the influence of these liquors  well said lunarius do they not empty your poorhouses   of lunarius       several overseers of the poor replied that of one thousand nine hundred and sixtyfour paupers in different almshouses one thou sand seven hundred and ninety were made paupers by partaking of these intoxicating liquors  do they not deter from deeds of violence and murder a judge replied of eleven murders committed all except one were committed by intemperance another judge said of twenty cases of murder examined by me all were occasioned by these spirituous liquors another said of more than two hundred murders which were committed in the uni ted states in one year nearly all were said to have their origin in drinking from these streams  let me ask is drunkenness ever     the investigations produced by these milder forms of these waters called wine cider beer etc here the duke of orleans then heirap parent to the throne of franc stepped for ward and said the drunkenness of ifrance is on wine moses the great jewish lawgiver who ruled a greater nation than france testified of noah that he i began to be an husband man and planted a vineyard and he drank of the wine and was drunk king solomon also testified that wine is a mocker and strong drink is raging and he knew of no stronger drink than wine he also ex dlaimed with manifest emotion who hath woe who hath sorrow who hath con tentions who hath babblings who hath wounds without cause who hath redness of eyes they that tarry long at the wine   of lunarius      they that go to seek mixed wine for the rest of his testimony reference was made to the twentythird chapter of proverbs the prophet joel next lifted up his voice and exclaimed weep and howl all ye drink ers of wine and finally the injunction of the apostle paul was quoted be not drunk with wine wherein is excess etc  well let me ask said lunarius does the drunkenness produced by these milder forms ever lead to murder and sui cide  the coroner of madison county ill re sponded that some years ago he held an inquest over the dead body of mrs legin  in the little village of madison who had been shot dead at noonday by her husband while getting him a warm dinner he hav ing come home intoxicated and his pas     the investigations sions inflamed by hard cider it was testi fied that he had drank nothing stronger that day when he got sober and realized what he had done his remorse and anguish were so great he committed suicide in the jail at edwardsville  ye men of the healing art while ye are up allow me to ask you a question of some importance are they necessary as a medicine dr chapman in behalf of his profession replied that  so far from it it is the duty of physicians to discountenance the popular notion of their remedial eicacy and dr mussey added so i  a h  long as these liquors re tain a place among sick patients so long there will be drunkcenness ay and patients too to these sentiments all the physicians   of lunarius       present assented among whom were more than seven hundred from the british me tropolis alone and to show their sincerity every one of the seven hundred signed the certificate with his own hand an aged man also testified that he had used these ardent waters as an invalid for many years he gave them up and got well it was the remedy that kept up the disease and when he renounced the one he got well of the other  well doctors let me ask again do they not prolong life dr hossack replied that the amount of human life gained by temperance to the society of friends is more than the differ ence between thirtythree and fortyseven an average of fourteen years gained in every life which is equal to fortytwo per cent     the investigations doctor james also said they coincide with the causes aggravate the form and increase the danger of every disease that affects the human body or mind they shorten the term of human life even when used temperately all the physicians pres ent many thousands in numberarose and said this testimony is true  do they not secure for men the watchful care and soothing attentions of kind and sympathizing friends on a bed of sickness and death and a respectful and decent burial well said lunarius i perceive that the cholera that terrible scourge is just now making its ravages among your hapless race will not the free use of these waters destroy its venom and arrest its prog ress x    of lunarius       a host of the best physicians from all parts of the world are immediately upon their feet in india a native physician declares that people who do not take spirits or opium do not catch the disease even when they are with those who have it as the pestilence swept over india years ago it was stated that in the army consisting of eighteen thousand men more than half of the men died in the first twelve days the free use of intoxicating liquors was as signed as the cause mr hubor who saw two thousand one hundred and sixty perish in twentyfive days in one town in russia says it is a most remarkable circumstance that persons given to drinking have been swept away like flies in triflis containing twenty thousand  vvv   iiujl     ttie investigations inhabitants every drunkard has fallen  all are dead not one remains  in paris of the thirty thousand de stroyed by cholera a few years ago  it is said that a greatproportion were intemperate and profligate it is also stated by com putation that fivesixths of all who have fallen by this disease in england were taken from the ranks of the intemperate and disso lute a physician whovisited montreal during the prevalence of cholera in the summer of  says the victims of the disease are the intemperate it invaria bly cuts them off in that city after there had been one thousand two hundred cases of the malady a montreal journal states that not a drunkard who has been attacked has recovered and almost all the victims to it have been at least moderate drinkes    of lunarius      a reliable gentleman of new york city says of that period when the scourge visited that city facts abundantly authorize the conclusion that had it not been for the sale and use of spirits there had not been cholera enough in the city of new york to have caused the cessation of business for a single day a gentleman residing in the city at the time has thus marked the connection be tween rum and cholera a quantity of spirits was taken from a certain store in the morning and distributed to a number of grogshops in the evening the workmen assembled and received their accustomed quantity the next morning one and another and another were carried by my door to the hospital and in the afternoon were taken to the potters field     the investigations the coroner of madison county illinois furnished the following answer to this in quiry on the th day of august  he was called to hold an inquest over the body of edward glennon found in the field of mr debow it was shown that on wednesday th previous he had got drunk at burretts grocery and had filled his bottle at the taproom aud on his way home had tumbled over the fence into the field aforesaid which was the last that was seen of him till the th when found his head was severed from his body and lay several yards from it with the flesh mostly gnawed off by the dogs one arm was found a few yards from the body in another direction also mangled and partly devoured the body having been for three days ex posed to the intense heat of the sun pre   of lunarius       sented a most loathsome mass of putrefac tion after the coroners inquest a hole was dug close by and with the aid of their spades the remnant of his putrefied carcass was tumbled into the ground the verdict of the jury was that these waters had brought him to his death  do they not asked lunarius  make bread that upon which your species mainly subsist more abundant the editor of the new york american here arose and said that he had ascer tained that more grain was consumed in the distilleries in the city of new york than is consumed by all the inhabitants of the city  well do these waters increase the value of property several political economists replied that      the investigations in those towns and villages where these streams had been excluded property was worth from twentyfive to one hundred per cent more than where they were permitted still to flow  but do they not prevent shipwrecks and steamboat disasters one who escaped the wreck of the ben sherod in  arose and testified that just before that fearful disaster by which one hundred and fifty human beings were hur ried into eternity a barrel of whiskey was placed on deck for the use of the hands who drank to excess and became intoxi cated others testified ithat the no less dis astrous fates of the steamboats home the lexington and the erie were owing to the same cause  is not the dealing in these waters   of lunarius       regarded as a safe business to the commu nity to this inquiry the magistrates replied that the tapsters are required by the laws of all the states to give bonds to keep the peace in a large sum of money which req uisition is made of no other class of busi ness men and would not of course be made of these were it considered a per fectly safe business  do not these streams promote quiet ness along the streets  the magistrates again replied that nearly all the quarrelling and cowhiding and fight ing and pistolling and drinking are excited by these  do they not promote subordination to the laws asked lunarius a lawyer here arose and said by your     the investigations leave lunarius i will read from the papers some account of their influence in exciting the lawless and violent proceedings in alton on the th november  when blood stained its streets and the man of god was slain leave being granted the following items were read soon after dark there were unwonted gatherings in certain coffeehouses here the spirit of vengeance which had been rankling in their hearts was excited to desperation by spirit behind the counter in about an hour after when the mob had had time to revive their spirits and recruit their courage in the aforesaid coffeehouses they returned with increased numbers armed with guns muskets etc and re commenced the attack with renewed vio ence whiskey was brought and distrib   of lunarius       uted freely among them occasionally one of the mob was heard to sing out if any more guns or whiskey is wanted away to the french coffeehouse  do they not promote the ends of justice a judge arose and said i will tell you lunarius how this operates a man was indicted by the municipal court of alton for a heinous crime  while the jury were retired contrary to law a stream of these waters was let into the room sev eral of them drank of it one in particular who was infdvor of convicting the prisoner after he had drank swore he would go in for clearing him the jury were unable to agree and they returned into court without any decision from this one case you may learn the rest      xtih investigations  do they not promote the purity of elections to this a reformed drunkard replied that he had controlled at a single elec tion more than one hundred votes by whis key and added he i cal do it again  well then do they not add dig nity wisdom and efficiency to your legis lative councils henry a wise then a distinguished and loyal member of congress from vir ginia arose and said i will answer that question i state the fact to the nation said he that some of the higher execu tive officers at washington are and have been notorious drunkards and i further state that i have often heard the reason assigned and believe it was a valid one for the house of representatives of the   of lunarius       congress of the united states not sitting in the evening after dinner when the business required it that many of the members were so much in the habit of intoxication that they were not only unfit themselves for public duty after a certain hour in the day but were likely to pre vent others from discharging their duty by interrupting the order of business extracts were also read from the rec ord of congress as recent as the th and th of april  to the ef fect that in the senate a resolution was offered to prohibit the sale of spirituous liquors in the capitol building the reason assigned was that there should be something done pronptly to prevent such disgraceful scenes as had recently been witnessed about the capitol not only     the investigations were members in the habit of getting drunk themselves but even the little boys emplyed by them as pages had been sent home drunk at nightpassed the senate by a vote of thirtythree to two in the house a distinguished member from illinois moved that the white house presidential mansion  be included in the resolution which with his amendment was adopted  well then let me ask continued lunarius are they not necessary for men in public oqfce to this question the illustrious thomas jefferson the framer of the declaration of independence replied and surely no man could answer better than hethat the habit of using ardent spirits by men in public life has occasioned more injury to the public service and more trouble   of lunarius       to me than any other circumstance which has occurred in the internal concerns of the country during my administration and were i to commence my administration again with the knowledge which from experience i have acquired the first ques tion which i would ask with regard to every candidate for public office should be is he addicted to the use of ardent spir its   w ell are they not necessary in our armies  a numerous corps of the officers of the army were at once upon their feet and testified that the gill of whiskey allowed to men on fatigue duty by the act of con gress passed march d  not only failed to answer the end for which it was granted but contributed in a great de     thtij investigations gree to form and keep alive habits of intemperance the legitimate result of which are insubordination disease and crime majorgeneral mcclellan of the army of the potomac said no one evil so much obstructs this army in its progress to that condition which will enable it to accomplish all that true soldiers can as the degrading vice of drunkenness  it is the cause of by far the greater part of the disorders which are tried by courts martial it is impossible to estimate the benefits that would accrue to the service from the adoption of a resolution on the part of the officers to set their men an example of total abstinence from intoxicat ing drinks it would be worth fifty thou sand men to the army of the united states   of lunarius        do they not perpetuate estates and families  asked lunarius rev dr edwards replied to this that in one town containing less than nine hun dred inhabitants and about one hundred farms it has been ascertained that thirty farms within thirty years have been lost by intemperance in another tow n of thir teen hundred inhabitants thirtyseven farms changed owners from the same cause in the same time in another of some fifteen hundred inhabitants eighty estates had been squandered away by intemperate own ers in about fifty years  do they not secure a more hardy race of children the sons of aesculapius promptly re plied that the diseases produced by drunkenness are many of them hereditary     thx investigations and that it tends to deteriorate the human race in a work from the pen of m jules simon entitled le travail which has just appeared in paris appear the follow ing statements of the condition of the chil dren of workingmen in some parts of france  even in france there are towns where women rival men in habits of intoxication at lille at rouen there are some so satu rated with it that their infants refuse to take the breast of a sober woman in the mountains of the vosges infants drink eau de vie on sunday in the churches the air is literally infected with the smell of eau de vie made from potatoes in those mountains there are no more frequent causes of idiocy and imbecility for in   of lunarius       general the dwellings are healthy and the water is excellent the great misfortune is that the children of habitual drunkards are idiots so that the punishment follows from generation to generation from the guilty and degraded father to the innocent children in the manufacturing towns the mayors are obliged to take measures against the cabarets that supply eau de vie to chil dren for there are drunkards of fifteen as there are laborers at eight and morally and physically they present a melancholy spectacle  but does not the drinking of these liquors after allprevent drunkenness the washingtonian replied when a man may run into the fire t f to escape being burned or into the water to escape drown ingthen and not till then o lunarius          titij investigations may one drink of these waters to prevent his becoming drunk  but let me ask some of your politi cal economists do not these waters dimin ish your taxes they all replied that the greatest por tion of all the taxes in the respective coun ties in which we dwell is expended di rectly or indirectly on the victims of these waters           i  do they not promote the sanctifica tion of the sabbath a worthy citizen of alton replied that on a sabbath in augustjust upon the eve of an election he had seen as nearly as he could judge about seventyfive men and youth in one drinking establishment engaged in drinking electioneering etc an innumerable multitude of men dressed   of lunarius       in black exclaimed these taprooms are the greatest nurseries of sabbath desecra tion in our fallen world  but let me ask  do not these wa ters nevertheless all together and in one way and another promote a greater amount of happiness to the human family here again thirteen venerable presidents sent up their card to lunarius which he read aloud as follows namely  we are satisfied from observation and experience as well as from medical testi mony that ardent spirits as a drink is not only needless but hurtful and that the entire disuse of it would tend to promote the health the virtue and the happiness of the community we hereby express our convic tion that should the citizens of the united states and especially the young men     the investigations discontinue entirely the use of it they would not only promote their own personal benefit but the good of our country and the world james madison   andrew jackson john q adams   m van buren john tyteer    z tayor m fillmore    james k polk franklint pierce james buchanan abraham lincoln  andrew johnson u s grant after a slight pause lunarius turned to the ministers of the gospel  ye men of god  ye ambassadors from the prince of peace to this rebellious race said he allow me to ask you a few more questions do not these waters tend to prepare men for the reception of the gospel   of lunarius       rev james gallaghera distinguished preachersaid in reply that  he had often remarked that when a man takes a glass of these waters in the morning he is utterly lost to the influence of the gospel for that day the other ambassadors all added no man ever lays down his arms which he has taken up against the god of heaven while under the influence of these waters  but do they not promote devotion if devils are the objects of worship replied the divines it may promote devo tion but what is to be thought of the presumptuous wretch who attempts to send up to heaven an offering on the breath of rum    will it not aid missionaries in their great work of evangelizing the hea then i     thise investigations rev jonathan brainerd a distingruished missionary among the north american in dians replied to this inquiry that the propensity of the indians to strong drink is a great obstacle in the way of their being brought to christianity the sin of drunk enness and the effects of it have given me inexpressible trouble and anxiety of soul since i have been in this business although i have done my utmost to represent the evil of it yet with some it is still prevalent and our neighbors  the white people  are not a little accessory to it there is scarcely one of them that has strong drink to sell but will sell it to the indians although i have set the evil before them and ear nestly besought them not to do it and some will even buy liquor in public houses and give them to see if they cannot make chris   of lunarius       tia indians drink as well as others  life p   do they not strengthen the power of motives to do right the men of god unanimously replied that all the motives which usually operate to promote virtuous action utterlyfail when a man is under the influence of these intoxi cating waters  but do they not weaken the power of motives to do wrong a man who had spent several years in the penitentiary for the murder of his own child arose aud with tremulous voice and tearful eye said i loved my boy when i was sober as tenderly as ever a parent loved his child but under the influence of mad ness occasioned by these accursed streams i killed mychild my darling boy while     the investigations he was exclaiming o my father i you will kill me you will kill me all the men on earth and devils from the pit could not have induced me to kill my boy but these fiery waters induced me to do it  will they not prepare a man for a dying hour as an answer to this question a para graph from a paper printed in alton in august  was sent up to lunarius which he was requested to read as follows a rumseller died a few weeks since in u alton the disease of which he died was occasioned by the use of the drug which he had so freely administered to others just before he died he seemed to wake up to a sense of his awful condition and still more awful prospects he was then in an agony which could not be expressed by words or   of lunarius       actions and began to call upon god o m god he exclaimed icannot die imus not die yet you know i am not ready t die i dont want to die i am not ready he asked to be raised up in the bed anm kept repeating these and similar expres sions he then clinched his fists an stretched himself up as it were to brac himself against the almighty and ex claimed o my god i wont die and in mediately fell back and expired a venei able man of god here exclaimed with heavy groan oh at the last it biteth lit a serpent and stingeth like an adder  will it not prepare a man for tl judgment and eternity again inquired l narins the apostle paul here arose and d dared in the name of the great king hii j     the investigations self that the drunkard shall not inherit the kingdom of god a drunkard or a drunkardmaker in heaven exclaimed a hoaryheaded man of god the very thought if i deemed it possible would make me shudder why the music of that celestial world would cease the loudswelling chorus would at once be hushed to silence consternation would fill every face the saints would drop their golden harps and flee away in terror all heaven would be in an uproar anarchy and desolation would pervade the universe of god and the last hope of fallen man would be supplanted by disappoint ment and eternal despair but the veracity of god is pledged that in heaven the wicked will cease from troubling   i understand said lunarius that   of lunarius       sixty thousand drunkards die annually in the united states and as many more in great britain would this vast multitude be added every year to the congregation of the damned and swell the wailings of eter naldespair if these waters should cease to flow and mankind were to cease selling and drinking them if there were no evil tree replied the   man of god  there would be no bitter fruits  but will not the use of these waters hasten the millennium asked lunarius there will be no drunkards or drunkard makers in the millennium nothing to hurt or destroy in all gods holy mountain re plied the man of god  and will drunkenness neve cease under the whole heaven so long as men  continue to drink of these streams     hia investigations as well may we expect the ocean to dry up while the rivers continue to run or the heavens to drop dew responded the whole vast assembly   without one  discordant sound  would the total extinction from the face of your earth of all these intoxicating streams together with the art of producino them be a calamity to the human race dr paris in behalf of his profession re plied with great solemnity that the art of extracting alcoholic liquors by distillation must be regarded as the greatest curse in flicted on human nature  let me ask but one more question said lunarius  which i wish you all duly to consider and i will relieve your patience do   the use of these waters then produce no conceivable benefit to the estate body or   of lunarius       soul of mzan either inl this world or that which is to come no response was sent up from the vast congregation to this inquiry a pause  a deathlike silence  ensued then i looked and behold lunarius turned aside and wept he gave vent to his feel ings in a flood of tears at length he re turned and said respected and worthy friends excuse the emotion i havebetrayed it was excited by the painful results of these investigations i have propounded more than seventy inquiries covering as e arly as i can judge the whole ground that should be embraced withtin the compass of hlumuct pur suit and humzan anzbition  these questions have all been answered with great intelli gence frankness and candor by the assem bled wisdom and experience and virtue of tias investigations this whole world and the conclusion forces itself with irresistible power upon my mind that these horrible  smoky dens these innumerable black spots upon the sur face of a dark world with their multitudinous streams and endless ramifications which occupy so much of the attention the capital and time and energies of your species are not only of no use whatever but a perfectly szperfjuous mischief a gratuitous evil with out one ofset or redeeming quality     i have surveyed the mighty ruin and though tears are unknown in the bright orb from whence i came i could not but weep to see men made in the image of god and but a little lower than the angels thus de graded below even the reptiles that crawl beneath their feet i could not repress my feelings of commiseration of horror and de   of lunarius              testation  what foe to god and man has been thus engaged to spoil the noblest work manship of the creator what imp of dark ness has invented this vast apparatus to work up immortal men to make such dis gusting beasts  theres sure no man so hates his fellowmen  it is the work of hell none but the devil eer thought of such a plan so demonlike so fell yesit is the work of the devil  satans greatest masterpiece his metamorphosis by which brutes are made of the best mate rials by means of which more than any other instrumentality he keeps up his dark dominion over men  those dark dens therefore were characteristically and truly denominated by one of your most distin   investigations of lunarius guished preachers of righteousness th breathingholes of hell o desperate frenzy madness of the will and drunkenness of the heart that naught can quenoh but floods of woe i bless my god that there are no rail ways or steampower by which these fata streams can be conducted or electromag netic telegraph by which the art of making them can be conveyed to my own beautiful and hitherto happy world lunarius could add no more over whelmed and disgusted and his very hearts blood chilled within him at the informatiou he had received and the scenes he had wit nessed he suddenly spread his broad silver pinions and swifter than the eagles flight soared away toward his native orb   i miss jane clark the buried alive or the confessions of a suicide the buried

incidents which have occurred in the course of my life in the sincere hpe that it may operate as a saltary r fuard to all persons to avoid the evils of vice and the retributive horrors consequent upon it               i was born in baltimore my father had been a grocer aniafl made some money thereby and was just comfortably fixing him self to enjoy his ecarings when he was suddenly taken ill apd died in a very rapid asnd mysterious manner his funeral was hur ried over and my mother removed to another part of the town  where she buried herself as it were in hergrief arid a kind gen tleman by the name of richards took upon hintself to fend me to st marys college a catholic institution in the adjoining county after passing through the usual course of studies i returned home and began to attend the medical lectures in baltimore in this i continued for three entire sessions boarding at the suggestion of mr richards near the medical college and visiting my mother about once a week during this time i formed evil habits which first broke the barrier of virtue which had so far protected me against the temptations of vice the students were many of them young men of fortune from the south whose object for attending the college was merely to acquire the title of a physician without caring whether they were qualified to practice medicine or not they were openhanded roystering young fellows whose only envy was to outvie each other in extravagance which they called libmity  he was the best fellow who could chew most tobacco fkelmtt igars and drink the greatest quantity of wine or liquotrsi witahouf ibecoming beastly drunk a thing which so grew upon me that i became al most unwittingly a mere sot with aeaving taste fr strong drinks which could not be satisfied short of insesiable intoxication the joy of these nightly revels was new and exhilarathing to me and created in me a vivacity of spirits in th earlier stages of my ine briety which made me the prince of foe sw witth imyom panionsit grew at last to blunt all the finer feelings withiiitet          bupird alive or and it became my pride to be known as the most reckless and dis solute of mvy class we did not confine our revels to mere intoxi catioi but there was not a brothel upon fells point in which we were not well known from our habitual visits houses of assignation we also frequented and at one of these one night an incident occurred to me which i have felt blasted me for life we had protracted our usual debauch at a coffeehouse until after midnight and halfadozen of us reeled tipsily off to ward a house of assignation which one of our party had recently discovered he tapped upon the windowshutter and an old woman cane to the door he whispered something to the old crone and we all staggered into a wellfurnished parlor which was well lighted and had a large fire burning in it we threw ourselves negligently around upon the sofas and rockingchairs when we heard the sounds of riotous revelry in the adjoining room the clink of glasses ringing shouts of laughter blows upon the ta hf   everything jingle and a general uproar the old lady selinto the other room through the foldingdoors when a voice cried bring em inlet the boys comedamd good el lowsi know em with this a large corpulent redfaced man in a very drunken state pushed the foldingdoors apart when a sight burst upon me which startled me to sobriety drunk as i was a large table occupied the center of the floor and on it were the frag ments of a feast of oysters lobsters fowls and such things and covered with bottles of champagne brandy and like drinks with and without necks broken wineglasses and unbrokenand the whole of the plates glasses and dishes in utter confusion around this table were halfadozen men holding in their embrace and upon their laps as many women the forms of the females being halfnaked their hair disheveled and their bosoms bare and ex posed their arms clinging about the necks of the men in mpudlin fondness oh god how my gorge and disgust arnose to lehold there my guardian and protector richards and in his arms in lascivious wanton nakedness whomy heart now sickens at the thouightmy mother she was drunk great god how was i sicked and horrified she whom i had deemed an angel in virtuous purity sunk to that low state of degradation she did     confessions ofa suicide       not know me and i made my escape from the house completety sobered the next day i drew from the bank  the money whib had been deposited there for my use during the time ishoulds  attending the lectures which amounted in ail to about four hundred dollars with this small sum i embarked for and arrived in new york purposing to pursue my studies in mndicine it that colleger  here i changed my name and adopted the one by which i have been known ever since this was in some degree to hide a guilt mothers shame and partly for my individual secrecy that i adopts ed the name of henry wiliing   was soon installed as a student and found a young gentleman by the name of rufus case taking the matriculation ticket about the same time with him i agreed to take lodings and board at small brick house directly opposite the collegewhere he said there was a very pleasant chatty widow who had a most beautifil girl living with her as an adopted daughter we went over and saw the widow mrs thompson and concluded a bargain for the two front rooms upstairs in the house which was a suiall one when we came again down stairs i was introduced to the young lady it miss jane thompson her actual name

together and would leave me  iilorinein the ho ue to my studies at length one evening she re  ired homei almost wild with anxiety jane could nowhere be iond nothing could lbe heard of her in any direction i hurried wverally to her few female acquaintances in the vicinity hut no trace of her could be had night passed and day came again with noa better esult  case pretended to mrs thompson to be deeply distressed but i could see a hidden demon in his eye that made me half suspect that all was not right s night and day passed again and still no tidings my solicitude became intense mrs thompson and i made search for her together mrs thompson being almost crazy tih excitement wandered about like a maniac trying to find her ealling upon every acquaintance she had in the townbutno one had seen or heard of jane after hunting fruitlessly for several days i went totheollege one night under a mistake or misappre hension respecting a meeting that was to have been held in the dissectingroom to hear a lecture and see the practical application by our demonstrator of anatomy i had made an error it was tuesday evening and i thought it wednesday the night was a blustering one and at  p m we were to assemble i started for the college the high wind drove the long skimming clouds over tie moon and mottled the pavements with the shadows i descend ed into the long hall beneath the college all was dark as a dun geon i groped my wayback toward the dissectingroom which was at the fartler endof the building i thought it strange that i could neither hiearnor see any one hollow and sepulchral came back the echoesas i baced the marblepaved subterranean hall and then i trod upon the great iron cover or top which fitted over the vast vat or vault where the dead flesh was thrown after it had been dissected i  passed on expecting in a minute to open the door and see the clear lighted room and the professor with the students cracking their usual jests over the frail wrecks of mor tality but when i reached tie door and opened the deadlatch which closed only on the outside not a soul was there all was        confessions of a suicidxe  dark as the grave i thought i must be too early and i ow i wait for the class so i entered and groped about in the gloom to find a box of matches which i remembered as being upon thei  windowsill i put out my hand to reach them when it came uplt   the cold face of a mans head which lay there i ishuddered with horror at the touchit chilled me like icei however found the matches and struck a light after which i lighted the candle and kindled the fire in the stove at that moment a gust of wind from without bllew the door to and i was closed in  i haen for the first time looked up and about me  great god what a sight it presentedall around the walls of the room were hung upon hooks legs arms heads hands and feet beside me a great tub  of intestines and on thetable lay fragments of livers and half a human heartwhile in the farther end of the room to accumu late the horrors some twenty or thirty dead bodies were piled up promiscuously upon each othera livid anddecaying mass from which as soon as the fire began to burn a intolerable stench arose but i was compelled to submit to it there was no means whereby i could open the deadlatch of the door i waited anxiously for the class to come but they came not i tried to force the door but the effort was futile i tried the windowpanels but theywere solid wood without i could hear the wild wind slamming the shutters and creaking the gates within was a combi nation of horrors from which i recoiled then came the thought  upon me that they would not come and then the ideathat if somed of the relatives of those who lay dead in this fetid charnelhouse should chance to come in search of their bodiesri find me alone with them i should be torn to pieces the like hadjust occurred  in st louis where a body had been found ithi coilege and an infuriatedmob of citizens had torn the houseiopen and destroyed the museum in self defense i took out my case of instruments and dissected for some time but i sickened at length so i washed my bloody knives and put them up again and paced back and forth across the room while theiastly white and blue faces of the piledup dead bodies seemedlli tiurned upotn me and i could fancy lhat i could see those horny spectral eyes move nintheir hollow  sockets and pursue me with their stony gae wherever i trod t  ja        burned alivt ob eipard the great townclock peal twelve and the dead were alone fy comrnpanionsi it struck one two and three but still i was atone the long whistling moan of the wind swept round the iouse and tg noises of running carriages and hacks had ceased pot one rntled by the silence was awfully solemn and in this frightful prisonhouse of mine i was growing painfully nervous i had no fear of ghosts spirits or apparitions but there was somne thing horrifying in the feeling of remaining as the companion of corpses i sat like a ghoul in a sepulcher at one time t nearly sank to the floor as i accidentally caught a glimpse of my own countenance in a lookingglass which hung in one corner of the room  i was appalled at the deathly pallor which this terrific vigil had spread over my visage and i dropped into a chair and covered my eyes with both hands to exclude the frightful vision of the dead from my sight but even with my eyes closed i could see the glazed orbs of the dead sightlessly glaring upon me while in this position i heard a footstep upon the pavement at the farther end of the hark hall i listened breathlessly the person approached the dissectingroombut a moment i hesitated and then closed the door of the stove and blew the stump of a candle out then stepping into one corner of the room i awaited with a beating heart the issue the stranger came to the door and open ed it but all was dark as gloom could make it the person stepped in apparently dragging something and then i heard a heavy sub stance fa ll upon the floor with a peculiar kind of sound then all was silent the next minute a scratch was heard and i beheld a nlan lighting a match and taking a candle from his pocket he lit the same placed it on the table and i beheld the face and per son of case i moved and was about to step toward him when he discovered me and instantly drew a pistol and cocking it he pointed it at me hold casei exclaimed do you not know me it is i henry willing what in hells name brought you here this time of night said he fiercely i explained tohim whv i was in that situation and then asked him what he had in that bag which he had thrown upon the floor   cowfessons or a roictg       f  he told me with a demoniac grin which almost startledi me fromnt its hideousness into palsyto look i did open the bag and turned down the mouth of it and beheld a sight which appalletd me curdled my blood in the veins and seemed to make my werr marrow turn to ice i started back aghast cold drops of sweat in a second stood like beads upon my face and i beheld to my petrified amazenment a colorless corpse and oh my go mjr god it wore the heavenly countenance of jane clark i in the name of heaven exclaimed  who can have done this why i said he  and utter a breath of what you now see and shall hear and i will blow you to hell in a minute i know you henry willing you loved this

hastening down toward the docks wholly eluded hkem  b the first faint glimmering rays of dawn were whitening the past when i saw a small grogshop open into which i entered and pr nk an enormous draught of brandy and sat before the fireplace fpiich had a small flame as the air was somewhat damp from wirnt another small drinkinghouse i strolled until the sun had irty risen when i returned to the house of mrs thompson here all was emotion the body had been taken in and a number of the neighbors were assembled offering various conjectures upon ite mysterious circumstance i joined in the general astonish rent and was solicited to aid in attending to giving it a proper in  rment in the afternoon she was buried after a coroners inquest ad rendered a verdict of  came to her death from causes un luowa  i aw the grave close over her form and as the heavy clods fell po the coffin lid their echoes almost broke my heart i went biode  to mrs thompsons my brain confounded by the recent enes which i had witnessed and enacted and remained there  dtit evening when as a relief to my increasing burthen of thought went to the dissecting roon where i had spent the terrible night previous the demonstrator lectured tong and ably and requested  the class to remain until a late hour as he expected a fine subjec t near midnight it came it was laid upon the table i could not speak my faculties and senses were paralyzed hosts of heaven it was jane the knife was applied the blood flowed red and fastthe professor ceased in astonishment still the blood came freely forth and suddenly the limbs were stretched out as if awak ening from a deep trance and a sudden flush went over the fate of snow and to the unspeakable and overwhelming amazement of altt the eyes opened bright and blue and the corse sprang from the table upright andgave a scream which made the building ring tie class ted one and all promiscuously in every directiontil preeswor and myself alone remained with great calmneass he proteaor picked up his cloak laid it over her naked figure and confessions ora s uicide       i   bound up the incision made by his knife the first word that she ji uttered was my name  you know her said the professor pulling out his pocket book  take that  there are a couple of hundred dollarsfly with her until the matter blows over i will make it a thousand in the morning my carriage is at the door get in order my coachman to drive you to three hundred and nine lower avenue i answered not but lifting jane in my arms i bore her to the carriage and the driver hurried to the place of destination alight ing he passed a small wicketgate and going in the back way he soon appeared with an old woman who opened the front door she recei  jane and placed her upon a sofathe coachman left and drove hastily away the old lady prepared a small fire placed pillows under janes head and made all as comfortable as possible in due time a letter came by mail inclosing a draft from the professor upon the merchants and mechanics bank for the round sum of one thousand dollars this i soon cashed and a favorable letter of introduction gained me a partnership in business with dr honfleur who was in high standing in boston to whiich place i had gone by the earliest opportunity and where in a few days after my arrival i was united in the bonds of mmtrimony with jane dr honfleur was a man past the prime of life well versed in his profession to which he was deeply devoted he had a wife who was young beautiful and voluptuous scarcely indeed beyond girlhood and full of the passionfires of youthwholly unfit in every respect for the cold staid habits of the doctor i was not long in the house with jane my wife before i could perceive ad vances upon the part of mrs honfleur toward me which were unequivocal at first the deep pure honest love i bore for jane caused me to avoid if not repel the attentions which daily grew more apparent upon the part of the doctors wife i was aften compelled to attend parties and the theater with he r when the pressure of the doctors business precluded his going with her my being her cavalier so far from arousing any suspicions upon his part seemed rather to endear ne to the doctor as he looked upon my familiarity as the result of gratitude for his uacoiolli tiff         buried alive or kindness and his confidence upon my integrity scened perfectly implicit at length after we had been practicing together some months in which i made a very favorable impression as a young physician the doctor had occasion to make a professional visit as faras the town of andover and left me in charge of all his busi ness in boston ann his household affairs when he was gone i went around regularly in his buggy visiting our patients and upon one of these rounds i took mrs honfleur with me during this ride i became convinced of the correctness of my suspicions for the amative propensities of the woman became strongly manifest she turned the conversation adroitly upon the tyranny of a young wife being married to an old husband and sighed softly in my ear that it was a pity that her fate was not lipked with some young and ardent lover like myself she grew romantically enthtiastic and poured forth her passion for me in words of poesy and then as if wishing to recall what she had said continued that she meant of course all to be purely platonic with this she laid her hand upon mine and looked affectionately into my eyes and asked me if i could betray the rash confidence of love with which she had intrusted me i clasped her hand my arm stole round her waist and i printed upon her young red lips the kiss which like a judas betrayed her while with the same breath i vowed con stancy in confidence i went hone the gentle calm dovelike demeanor of jane no longer had a charm to my eyes her conver sation was cold and insipid compared with the ardent enthusiasm of my new conquest i now sought every opportunity of having an interview with mrs honfleur and became daily more and more fascinated with her and although she was far inferior to jane in point of beauty i found her charms growing upon me which heightened by her many blandishments and coquettish little arts completely entangled me in a feverish and exciting state of passion one evening jane had retired early and mrshonfleur and my self were leftalone in the parlor reading she picked up byron from the centertable and came with it to the shfa where i was half reclining with my book in hand every now and then she would laugh heartily over some passagewhich i insisted upon seeing which she resisted until i forned the book from her aqd   confessions of a suicide        found it to be dudus dream in don juan isuggested that her own beauty had always reminded me rather of donna julia she said she felt it to be too truethat she was alike in respect to hee lord for that the doctor was even more unbearable than don al phonso himself we read alternate passages throughout the poem at length she pretended that the room was cold so she arose and closed the door and at the same time i marked that she had taken occasion to bolt it she returned to the sofa leaned herself back against my arm half carelessly and began to talk of some indif ferent subject by this my own coolness had worn offall reserve which i had preserved melted away as the warm pressure of her  body came upon my arm i thought of jane for an instant but again that the doctpl was old and that everything would remain  profound secret but it was no time for reason her soft warm cheek reclined upon my shoulder and in the next instant my lips were upon that cheek and her rosy mouth while she partly yield ing and partly withdrawing rested her round figure against my form wyhile as i encircled her with my arm i could feel her leap ing heart beat rapidly beneath my hand why detail this treacherous intrigue farther she was ruined with her own full consent and i a villain had wronged my own jane betrayed my best friend and stolen the jewel of his wife a honlor the unseen and irresistible chain of fate forever draws on all who pursue the path of vice this villainous intrigue was now regularly carried onbetween us neither the doctor nor jane sus pecting mrs honfleur of illicit intercourse with myself and thus for months we carried on our shameless communications meeting abroad in the city by special assignations one day we were strolling in the farther end of the city from where we lived jane  unknown to us had begun to suspect treachery and secretly fol lorwed us until she was satisfied by her own sight of our criminal conduct when i returned home at pight i saw a change in her countenance and she frankly told me what she had been a witness to and that so directlyand unequivocally that i could hot dehyit to my astonishment however she did not express hersef in ps  sionbut calmly alid sorrowfully the meek humility withwhicoj           uftribfie aivll or she mourned at having ouflived my love cut me to the core and the silent uncomplaining tear which coursed down her cheek touched me more nearly than all the reproaches that could have been uttered she said she knew that she was humble and poor but that she had hoped by fondness and fidelity to have been worthy of my love but that as it was gone from her she herself would seek a home in the broad open otterworld where we look for no sympathy and are not disappointed if we meet unfeeling souls   i begged her forgiveness and swore upon my souls hope of sal vation never again to deceive her and not to desert her while life lasted she meekly acquiesced and said no more oh villain hat i wasa week had scarce passed before my vow was violated  the doctor was again absent and once more our illicit amours began night after night had i quietly crept from the bed of my own wife and stolen into the chamber of mrs honfleur one night my wife rose and proceeded stealthily out of our chamber into the wicked womans apartment who lay quietly waiting for me jane stole quietly up to the bedside and spoke gently to mrs honfleur upon the matters between us telling her that she had marked our intercours and prayed her to unloose the toils which she had woven round my heart and restore the husband to his wifes arms she said this soft and sobbingly with such a plain five tone that tears started to my eyes as i stood listeningat the door snd mrs honfleur seeing that denial was useless subtilely asked her forgiveness and prayed that silence should seal all the past promising that for the future she would never intervene be tween jane adndhberthusband for some time mrs honfleur avoided me and iew beams of gladness sprang up in the eyes of my own dear jane  it has been the curse of my existence to break every vow which bhave most ardently desired to perform and my firmest resolves ver seen the fist to fail  i what ausidtid i now havegfor contentment with a lucrative practice an excellent reputation in my profession with health good standing in society anda dear devoted woman as a wife who almost worshiped mewhose existence seemed only bright            i                 o   i r                 in my presence and whose sole study wasto give the object of her affection every means of pleasure which she could minister her  love grew daily deeper and the fond fidelity of womans gentle heart never displayed itself with more modest yet ardentattach l ment she anticipated my wishes and provided for thetn she soothed my melancholy hours and never murmured a sigle sor row of her own oh that heaven should have wasted the gift of soirich a treasure so priceless a jewel upon a wreteh like met restless and exciting passion upon my part lured by the syre who had caught me with her crafty snares led me again into temp tation oh the power of that beautiful passage in the only true prayerlead us not into temptation my unsuspecting friend dr honfleur was gone to attend the medical convention of philadelphia when the wiles of his wife wooed me again from my honest purposes jane discovered if the hitherto restrained fires of her heart now burst their bound and jealousy drove her to frenzy it was long past midnight and i had just come from thea armn of my mistress with her hot kisses yet burning upon my lips and stealing like a thief into my wifes bed i soonifell into asleelp then jane arose without disturbing me andiifter procuring a dag ger crept quietly into mrs honfleurs room and lifting up the light curtains of her bed stabbed her as she slept jane returned to my couch and said with a fierce but tremulous voice henry willing the deed is accomplishedi have now pierced the heart which has broken minei forgive you i forgive you farewell god bless you farewell      i sprang from my bed and rushed to mrs honfleurs room  gory crimson flood stained over the whiteness of the sheets and the guilty but unfortunate creature was struggling to rise upon one arm i aided her and staunched the wound in her side with a pil low i called for the servant but none came i ran to look for my wife but she had fled and could nowhlre be found with a louder shout i roused a servant who soo aalarmed the mieighbors who came in and by the first gray streaks of the dawning day beheld the blanched face of mrs honfieur and the bloody spots which dyed the bed the commotion became intense and in a short i            i     sp           bulrid aliv e or period the house was filled with a dcrious and inqruisitive mob search was instituted forthwith for jane but the whole day passed without any discovery of her whereabouts in the meantime physicians examined the wounds in mrs honfleurs body arid found they wxere not mortal althoughl very severe in a day or two doctor honfleur returned and fourid his wife in this critical and precarious condition he for the first time now began to suspect me of being at the bottom of this dark act and he divined at once that it could be no other passion than jealousy which could prompt the commission of such a crime he forced from his wife who was in dreadful apprehension of death a full confession of our criminal intercourse which at once came full arid convincingly upon him whereupon the doctor without hesi tation rushed into his private medical library and in another in stant rushed back into the room where i sat with two or three gentlemen and elevating a pistol to his eye he deliberately fired at my head the ball however took effect only in my left arm just below the shoulder and was but a flesh wound he then rushed at me with a huge bowieknife whereupon i hastily retreated to the fireplace where i grasped the heavy iron poker and as he came forward i anticipated his blow struck the sharp weapon from his hand and following up the stroke i dealt him a terrific sweep with the ponderous iron upon the crown to my horror i heard the skull crack and saw the doctor sink a lifeless man upon the floor my head reeledmy brain became dark i fainted and fell also for many days i knew not what my condition was at length i came to myself and found that i was being examined before the ipayor of the cityei the persons who had witnessed the doctors assault came foragrd and testified and i was discharged upon the groundof selfdefense in the meantime mrs honfleur had be come convalescent jane had been found wandering upon the out skirts of the city was arrested imprisoned and in a short time was brought totrial before the court but a small examination was necessary to convince every one of the painful fact that she was insane upon the jury finding her in this state of mind she was sent to the lunatic asylum and its gloomy doors closed upon my beautiful but unfortunate wife i        v via j isr i u in is v r k is u i  v sm ink gatlhering all the money which was due to me and bidding adieu to mrs honfleur who was now fully recovered i hastened to leave boston where i felt that i should be known and shunned i proceeded to albany where i rented retired rooms ina secluded  part of the town here i gave myself up for some time to a hermit like solitude but its loneliness became unbearable and i was com pelled to mix with the outward world that its images might with draw my mind from the terrors of its own inward fancies one day as i was strolling i saw mrs honfleur in the streets of albany and i felt that she was in search of me i used no delay but instantly determined to avoid her and shortly after started for this city of philadelphia where i again secreted myself in an outoftheway street and flattered miyself that i had eluded my pursuer but what was my astonishment to find that instead of escaping from her she was scarcely a week finding out my locality she came to me in tears and besought me to have pity upon her and allow her to remain with me she pleaded that her character and friends were all gone in boston that she had no one to whom she could turn on earth but myself that but for me she would never have been reduced to this strait and a multitude of other matters notwithstanding the disgust which at first i felt for this woman as the source of the greatest calamities of my lifethe murder of her husband and the madness of my wifeyet such ap peared the wretchedness of her situation aiid such the irresistible fascination of her beauty that i could but commiserate with her in her weakness and at last yielded to her solicitations to let her become my mistress it has ever been the case during my life that one erroneous step has ended in precipitating me into irremediable difficulties and trouble the crushing nature of my crimes had by their very terror sobered my habits but i now again rushed rapidly into a whirl pool of dissipation and as i went round and round deeper and deeper in vice i felt that resistance was uselessand gave way to it as the sailor who in the storm finding all hope is lost seeks to drown hissenses in liquor before his frame is swallowed up in the waves so i in this desperate condition of life sought refuge s                                    brvi ed altve or from the bitter chidings ofconscience in the temporary delirium of intoxication and in a short time i grew reckless of life i plunged yet deeper in dissipation and added to it the vice of gam ing in this matter fortune never favored me once but still the hope of luck taking a turn or change induced me to continue not this alone but gaming afforded me a species of excitement which withdrew as it were my own soul from feeding on itself and al thpugh my means gradually decreased my sensibility was too much blunted by drunkenness to have any prudence or caution respecting the preservation of my means  among my potcompanions was one who was a very handsome dashilydressed fellow a gambler to whom i in my cups had boastingly given a glowing description of mrs honfleur and in vited hiil down to my rooms he was possessed of accomplished and most insinuating manners and frequently came down to take a cup of tea with us or aioystersuppera gay noisy bacchanalian who to serve his purposes had occasionally loaned me money at the gainingtabe i went to the theater with him one night and while we were sitting in the box conversing i observed an uncom monly welldressed genteel young man sitting on the other side iof me presently this elegant person slipped his hand into my coat pocket and extracted with great adroitness my pocketbook containing all the money i was master of being some two or three thousand dollars i detected the knave in his white kid gloves and de manded mye pocketbook he appeared thunderstruck but in an instant whisijingly implored me to spare him from public expo sition as his imily connections were of the highest character in the city foisespectai iity saying that sudden gaming losses had driven him to this desperate act and begging me for gods sake simply to put my hand in his pocket and take mny pocketbook back again and say nothing about it  here was such a look of piteous sincerity upon his fine countenance that i reached out my hand to recover my property butv no sooner was it in his pocket than he seized tyarm with a grasp of iron and held it in spite of me in his pocket calling all the time for the officers who arriving in the box in a moment bore me forcibly off in defiance of allmy attempts at explanation hurrying me to jail and leaving all my l                  confebsions f  juoide    s money in the hands of the ingenious scoundrel whom i never saw afterward the next day my friend who had gone to the theater with me came and bailed me out of prison and when the trial came on gave evidence of my innocence and i was discharged but my money was all gone and in this dilemma i knew not what to do there was no one to whom i could state my distresses but my friend and potcompanion the handsome gambler whose name by the way was murphy he rhade light of my misfortune and laughed it off as a very good joke then kindly offered me any amount of money which i wished to borrow i accepted some two hundred dollars in a few days he called upon me saying that he had a secret to comniunicate so we went to a coffeehouse took a few oysters in a stall and began to drink freely of brandyfi he then confessed to me that he had been engaged to the daughter of a poor but respectable mechanic citizen had imposed upon her confidence with a promise of marriage and under this cloak had seduced her that her father was not aware fitbut that the girl was far gone in pregnancy that something must be done and that immediately as he could not think of marrying her as she had no money and he had never indeed designed to make her other than the victim of his passion he promised me to cancel my indebt edness to him and furnish me a couple of hundred dollars in ad dition to procure this abortion i assented the act wasjtformed but not the death of the child alone was accomplished for the potency of the drug given and the severity of the operation proved fatal to the unfortunate girl i felt this double m urde deeply but it was too late i could not retrace my steps each one of my crimes proved father to another i now sought for my ftward but my good friend murphy had flown and thus i was foiled of my bloodmoney under this disappointment i plunged deeper into dissipation than ever notwithstanding my reduced circumstances my mistress mrs honfleur t learned had been playing me false with my pretended friend miarphy and my being seized in  the theater and put in jail was ialatrick of his oi to get me out  of the way and his assumed friendship a disguisef ateomnpliih ing his intrigue with my mistress this i learned fibrm a uiii i questionable source and i doubted not that the woman whiid   i           f     buried alive or been false to her husband would be false to her paramour but i was silent upon this subject and suffered it to pass on as if nothing had occurred and we lived together as before i scarce conscious half the time of existence from drunkenness for day after day was one scene of debauch and beastlyinebriety one night i was staggering home long after midnight so blindly intoxicated that i could scarce make my way although there was a brilliant and beautiful moonlit sky overhead as i plunged along first running against a treebox and then stumbling over a cellardoor a woman in a cloak overtook me and putting her arm around me walked along and steadied my course or rather her own for i went more by her direction than any idea of mine slfe tlked continually and although i could not comprehend what it v about i fancied the voice was familiar after walking a greatwhile i insisted upon sitting down as i was becoming tired froin my walk and stupidly sick from my liquor suddenly the woman called me i enry with such ani accent as shot a light across my brain instantaneously and printed upon my lips a kiss she then exclaimed in the most incoherent rhapsody i knew they could not keep me they had bolts iron rings chains and locks she died once yes i killed her once i saw the snowwhite bed wherein she lay drenched with red bloodher hearts blood she stole my henrys heart but oh she broke mine but they could not keep me i saw her ghost it mocked me it mouthed at me it squeaked and jabbered but i outran itk and i have capught henry yes this is he do you not know me  with this i gazed upon the white face of the woman by the pallid blaze of the moon and the film of drunkenness fell from my eyes the countenance was beautiful but the expression terrific the eyes were madwildly fearfully glaringly mad she burst into a hollow fiendish laugh  the laugh of the maniac it rings in my ears at this instantthen suddenly wheel ing she flew with a speed like a bird from me before it occurred to me to follow the moment i recovered my thoughts i found myself sitting upon the slab of a tomb in the city churchyard and saw her flying form passing by the white monuments of death i   jane hold mrs honfleur like a victim for sacrifice her dark cycparld an noarthly luster as she stoqd in the center of the crackling

fled from my eyelids but i had seen her my own poor dear jane clark a mad woman an escaped maniac pursuing me and then that laughthat she should laugh and flee from me like a phantom oh god the

succeeding i prolbed street lane and alley making diligent search and constant inquiry for her for more than a week unsuccessfully at the end of this time i had protracted my walk one day until late at night when returning worn out with labor and almost hopeless i heard the cry of fire i walked on slowly round the corner feeling i had no interest at stake when suddenly i beheld through the darkness that it was my own house i forgot my weariness in an instant and flew to the spot i found the crimson tongues of flame licking out at every window and a dense volume of inky smoke rolling in a fiery sheet around it i made my way through an alley to the little backyard and essayed in vain to mount the small porch and reach the window of the chamber where mrs honheur usually slept but the heat was so intense i could not approach it in front of the house in the street was heard the loud rattle of hee es the envoeiferous shouts of the firemen and the roar and confiiion consequent upon conflagration  presently i heard a shriek and casting up my eyes baeld with petrifying amazement the tall figure of jane eitergingifronr the  chamber window her long black hair flying in disheveled

length of time while the sale has rapidly increased every yeari other medicines have been pqpular for a few months or years but their lack of intrinsic value has con signed them to comparative oblivion in justice to downs elixir be it said that it is a duty the people owe to themselves that they continue to use the article that has always cured them of their coughs and colds rather than to

of the medicine half the quantity only in the morning will be re quired to have the same effect as it does at night when the body is at rest if the pa tieartshould be quite sick on taking an over dose by taking teaspoonful of medicine clear or without shaking up the bottle it till make   him vomit gently or entirely remove the sickness if the patient should vomit as soon as you can give another tea

dowwn j m iiury  sos jossn  hxnt  co and henay  co    brakeman  tory   r have been a railroad man yl for a great many yearshave as the expression goes grown grey in the service i am certain how ever in all my experience i never saw a road that was the equal of the valley air line upon which i was at the time of the incident about to be related a brakeman the valley air line was one of those roads that spring up sud denly out of the imaginations of a few men one cannot say that it sprung from their purses for if they had the seed in them to grow anything it was never put in the valley there was as nearly as i can now remember a capital stock which was never paid up a little town and village credit and a large amount of preferred stock first and second mortgages etc as a result the road was built in a bung ling manner grades were bad road bed was poor bridges and culverts were thrown together in the worst possible manner because the worst was the cheapest the iron was a light and frail mass manufactured especially  for  the american market while the rolling stock had been worn out in services on other roads and sold to the valley air line on credit and long time the reader will see from this truthful statement that the valley was not the safest road for travel lers in the country it was not innumerable were the accidents we had and it is a wonder to me that none of them were serious while we had many narrow es   capes we still managed through sheer good luck slow time and great care to get on without breaking bones but i positively assure you that time did not ac custom us to the road and we never ran into the depot at night without feeling thankful that we were alive when i say we i mean the conductor engineer baggageman fireman and myself how the passengers felt i donot know but i do know that they ought to have felt as thankful as the roadmen that their bones were in good condition to allow them to walk from the depot to their homes ignorance may have been perfect bliss to them however the engineer of our trainthe lightning expresswas one of the most sober careful thoughtful and industrious men that ever handled a throttle he possessed more than the ordinary share of thoughtful prudence of his class and it was owing to this fact that so great a degree of good fortune came to us a few moments before the train was to start one morning gardi ner the

 for the speedy cure of coughs colds consumption awhoop ing coufh croup asthma and all diseases of the thr  ta ch est es d l un gs   ths valuable medicine is purely vegetable the discovery of which has been the result of many years close study while suffering under those for midable diseases which prey upon the organs of the chest in order to discov er the causes the symptoms and the cure viz consumption asthma ca tarrh colds coughs pleurisy influ enza hoarseness spitting of blood bronchitis and every species of op pression ot the chest and lungs in all cases where this elixir has been duly administered its effiacy has been inva riably manifested convincing the most incredulous that even consumption is not incurable if properly attended to as consumption at its commencement is but a slight irritation on the mem brane which covers the lungs then an inflammation when the cough is a little more observable but rather dry then becomes local fever and the pulse more frequent the cheeks are flushed and chills are more common in its next stage the external parts of the lungs themselves begin to participate in the fever the strength fails the flesh wastes and perspiration is common as debility and emaciation increase small ulcerations or white hard specks appear the bowels become irregular the sleep is disturbed in the last stages violent coughing profuse cold sweats and constant diarrhoea with hiccoughs close the scene this elixir in curing the above complaints operates so as to remove all morbid irritation and in flammation from the lungs to the sur face and finally expel them from the   system by perspiration and otherwise it facilitates expectoration and thus relieves the patient from a load of tough phlegm which cannot otherwise be wholly removed from the system it heals the ulcerated surfaces and re lieves the cough and makes breathing easy it supports the strength and at the same time reduces the fever it has at least one peculiar advantage over other articles in common use for the same purposes it is free from strong opiate and astringent articles which are of so drying a nature as to be in great danger of destroying the patient whereas this medicine never dries or stops the cough but by removing the cause generally destroys the hectic before the cough is entirely gone con sequently when the cough is cured the patient is well it may be relied on as perfectly safe in all cases of cough and irritation of the lungs the ery best medicine for coughs in every fever from commencement to end it will cure a slight hoarseness and cough when occasioned by a cold in a few hours and generally when severe and obstinate in a few days it almost in variably cures children of croup and has in many instances when eminent physicians considered them past hope

and went rattling on over the iron passengers looked at each other in surprise and won dered what under the sun was the matter with the valleyif it had suddenly awakened from its long sleep and now proposed to be a railroad in earnest when the conductor came through the train and came along by me i asked what is the matter with gard iner this morning oh was the reply he and the old man have had a blowout this morning you see our train never makes connectionspassen gers always lay over and of course they growl this morning the old man called us into the office and the wholething was out gardiner talked like a father to them and as he grew excited he said that it was criminal running the road in the condition it was he told them the timetable as made up was fast even for a first   class road and if we undertook to run it a frightful accident could not be avoided when gardiner said it was criminal to run the road as it was supt brown was very hot he fairly boiled over he declared that there was no better road in the country and that gcardiner was a coward who ought to go on to a gravel train and if lie didnt make time hed have him there too the road was losing its business and there had got to be a chance brown also said that in valley creek where he lived he had noticed that the train always slowed and lost time enough there to lose the connections gardiner replied to this that at the creek there was a down grade the bridge was unsafe and he was obliged to slack up for safety more than this the track passed through the playground of the creek school was not fenced in and they could not go through at a rapid speed without danger to the children then brown burst out with an oath that if parents did not want their children run over they must keep them oft the track it would be a good thing to run over one or two of them as it would teach them alesson of course he didnt mean this but he was  hot you see and did not know what he did say he added that gardiners family lived near the track and that gardiners sole reason for slowing was to have a chance to chat with them as he went through this set gardiners anger on fire and he then and there declared that he would make time let the consequences be what they might and if disaster happened brown must assume the responsibility you see he is keeping his word but the old fellow feels bad

ere i closed  eyes to shut out the horrible sight the poor fellow had not been idle plainly seeing that he could not drive the child from the track and that its companion was helpless he left his cab and climbed forward on his engine to the extreme end of the cowcatcher leaned over and while clinging with one hand reached out with the other there did not seem one chance in a mill ion to save the childnot one but anxiety overcame horror and i looked and shuddered as i looked how my heart leaped into my very throat ats i saw the train dash on but saw that as it did so gard iner with almost superhuman ef fort raised the child by its arm from the track and clasped it to his bosom then he sank down on the cowcatcher faint and pow erless his fireman clambered out to his side and you may rest as sured i was not long in getting to their assistance the unusual noise of the steam had brought every person in the village out to witness the sight and as they realized it they shouted their joy until their throats must have been hoarse the fireman and i clung to gardiner there was no need to hold the child for although rigid and helpless gardi ner held the little one to his breast with an iron grasp very soon we crossed the bridge and struck the up  grade where the train slowed and flirally came to a full stop nearly in front of gardiners house with the help of some of the villagers

that there are many whose expe rience is not yet true to all she has said it is of those she has thought silver and gold have i none but such as i have give i thee i  the nightfall    the conflict i the vision  iv  the daysta r it was about an hour since they had told her and she was now lying quite still with her eyes closed and her hands tightly clenched on her breast in the darkened room her face looked gray and deathlike she seemed scarcely to breathe it is such a sudden blow her sister a song in the desert said in a whisper it was only this afternoon she got one of his letters oh amy it will kill her my poor child ruth darling her mother bent over the bed with her hot tears fall ing like rain on the girls dry cold cheeks ruth shall i pray yes the changed chilled voice it frightened them the mother thought words would freeze on her lips but as she knelt a  prayer came to herwas uttered for her perhaps she prayed as her dead husband might have prayed with strong crying unto this sovereign god who had laid his hand heavily on her childher    the nightsfall eldestborn she pleaded with the christ who wept at bethany and who was no more here to bring back the dead whom he had taken utterly away would he not come near to this poor crushed heart which even her mother could not comfort now would he not tell her that the brave soldier had found rest with him where the shock of war and garments rolled in blood should never be  that all his pain had ended  that it was for love of him and her that the great captain had called him home he who tempers the wind to the shorn lamb would he not surely do as much for her child a song in the desert the voice which had tried to pray broke down in its faltering amen amys sobs fell heavily on the air but there came no moan nor cry from the pale lips which could yet frame no prayer of their own  poor quivering lips which no warm  kisses could ever mpre make glad   she unclosed her eyes at length and turned with a child like helpless movement toward her mother when was it  tell me about it it was day before yesterday the battle was in the morning dont ask me ruth darling dont  wait till you can bear it better    the nightfall ci can bear it now did he did he live long after it no his sufferings were very short can they  will he come home a long silence answered this question then  my  poor poor child he cannot come  a long shiver passed over her frame but her anguished eyes did not flinch from asking one more question there was no time for any message was the reply hearing this she turned away so that they could not see her face i would rather be alone she said  a song in the deser t so they went her mother stopping to give her a long lingering kiss to smooth her tangled hair to feel the chill of her white face to know that she could do nothing nothing for her she must leave her aloneher child her poor little ruth who had been all hers to love and help since she came to her a little wail ing baby so long ago now she must go away she could not comfort her she closed the door and in the silence which fell on the dim room ruth was left alone to stand face to face with god who had smitten her to feel sure of nothing in earth or heaven but his changeless       b   the ni gh tfall will and her own consciousness of agony this belongs to those things which are within the vail she was alone with him  what avails it to say more after a while her mother came softly in and drew back the shutter the green of the trees by the riverside the sparkle of the waters the shadows on the hills and the broad line of gold in the evening sky glowing and fading in its grand unrest the flickering light down in the valley where the village children were at play this was what ruth saw the same world was it did the light fall just so yesterday through the old familiar trees did the happy river          a song in the desert wind so among the meadows were those the voices and laughter of the little children whom she had known so long she closed her eyes with a long low moan and her mother hearing it drew the blinds again presently amy stole in with a cup of tea please ruth  holding it to her lips feeling its heat she pushed it away shiveringhe was so cold so cold now what had she to do with anything warm and lifegiving amy i   canti cant  mother you had better go now  both of you the night has come is           the nigh tfall the broken wail of her voice rang in her mothers ear for hours and amy sobbed herself to sleep ruth lay in her little room with her hands still crossed  on her breast holding up a great prayer in their clasping and her eyes wideopen to the darkness all night long they had been all to each othershe and frank he had come to her in her sunny girlhood making all her days a beautiful promise she had not thought it could be broken  had not god spoken it and now he had gone from her had gone away utterly you know how she loved him you need not words to tell you by your own          t a song in the desert heart too you will measure her loss she had been so happy how could she bear it to wake from her dream and know she should never more be glad hers had been such a trusting heart it had clung so closely to him and his love how could she stand alone with all that had been her help lying mute and still by that faroff southern river how could she come back to the wilderness of life in which she could find henceforth no voice to answer her how could she take up these weary hours and days which must make her future remembering what they might have been and how he would have blessed them and made them bright     the nightfall her mother going about the darkened home sorrowfully in the days when ruth would be alone in her still room thought and prayed much over this in her anx ious heart what should she ask for her child hown ould she her mother call her back to her desolate life she came among them at last but she was not of them wherever she went a shadow rested the children shrank away frightened at her black dress and white changed face amy cried in secret over the sisters he had lost and her mothers mute eyes followed tearfully her every motion after a time however ruth took        the conflict up bravely her daily household cares and ministrations of love interesting herself in the childrens little joys and troubles and teaching them all to find her warm kiss and helpful hand even more loving and more patient than before yet it was pitiful to see her with her slow sad step about the house all the bright girllook gone from her face her eyes grown so large and dark and full of pain her trembling lips trying to smilesuch a lonely smile it was it was hard to hear the hopeless patience of her voice to see how dully she looked out on the fields all bright with the green shadows she used to love so where           x a song in the desert the dash of glad waters the hush of pur ple hills and glowing sky and the tender ness of tremulous white clouds lay before her as of old and then to see her turn away from them all as if they hurt her to see how her face paled when the twi light fell and how she would steal quietly awayso quietly they would hardly miss her and to know that the burden of the day had grown so heavy she could no longer bear it the long months passed away and each one found her amore patient more mindful of all thoughtful deeds and words of love she had long since taught her lips to pray again she thought she was   the conflict trying to make them frame the abba father of a life of suffering she had taken hold of the hand of one who wept for her she knew he loved her she knew he would never leave her she knew he had given her a life with which to glorify himshe knew it but that was all if she had looked honestly into her heart she would have seen that she was not taking it up as lifenot even for himn who spent long years of toil and suffering for her she would have seen that she never once had lost the wish i had almost said the persistent wilto die her recalled smiles and gayer words c a song in the desert were only like perishing flowers which had root in the depth of this one cease less hope her friends looked on sorrow fully and felt that they were helpless yet watched her with ceaseless prayer they had all been together one even ing in the sittingroom the children play ing before the open fire and ruth and amy shelling corn for them  to parch their mother sat by listening to the laughter of the little boys and amys happy talk but her ear caught most quickly the lowest of ruths quiet words and her eyes fell oftenest and perhaps most lovingly on the little dark figure with its pale face and tender helpful   the conflict hands she saw how happy the childrenj were with her how their arms clung about her neck when it came time to say  goodnight how she returned their warm kisses with a smile and then when they had left her how her eyes sad dened looking dreamily into the fire some faint new pain seeming to creep into them ruth said amy after a pause sarah greyson asked me today why you didnt come to see her as you used to and if i didnt suppose you could do some dis trict visiting down town with her this year ruth  compressed her lips and her                   a song in the desert hands twitched nervously but she made no reply and ruth dear   well you have never come back to your old place in the sewingcircle and our readingclass ask me every week if we shant see you again soon ruth turned quickly her face full of pain i cannot amy it hurts me so to go about among people ill help the poor in a quiet way but a year is a long time to think about and as for the reading i do not care for that what use is it now   the conflict she turned her face again to the fire amy was silent and soon rose to go up stairs coming to kiss ruth before she went amy dear i didnt mean to scold you you understand  oh no you never are cross to me or anybody youre a perfect angel here at home  only somehow ruth i dont know  i wish  there was a puzzled look on her bright face ruth kissed it away with a laugh and amy left the room ruth said her mother after a long silence come up here and sit by me she came sitting at her feet her head a song in the desert resting on her hand as if she were tired ruth dearyou are doing everything you can for us at home and i wonder at your gentleness and patience every hour but dont think i am blaming you my child but dont you suppose you could take up some of the work you used to love so and mingle a little more with some of your old friends i cannot do it mother i cannot go back to any more of the old life it is all i can do to get along from day to day at home there was something sharp in her voice as she spoke v            the conflict but my child there is one to help you he will give you strength he doesnt do you really wish him to give it to you why yes i wish to work for him what else have i left i wish to work if it might be short you make no plans to do for hitm beyond a week or a month my daughter why is this  because mother its no use for us to talk about this it only troubles you      why is it ruth because i cannot cannot live c        a xsong in the desert the firelight fell full on her face so old and wan with the lines on her fore head it would not take much more of this her mother thought to give her the rest she longed for no hoineties could keep her the love of the dear christ himself only taught her to endure and no more what else remained  who could help her child in this weary way ruth what would frank wish she said at last this seemed almost cruel her lips quivered so her hands clasped her mothers so helplessly there was such a piteousentreaty in her stifled sobs her mothers arms gathered her as if r   the conflict she had been indeed a little child she could do nothing but love her she must leave the rest with god o mother mother do let me go and ruth crept up to her with a little low cry as if the wind were wailing after a while she went upstairs and sat down in her room by the window amy was asleep and it was quite still she looked out to see the winter wind tossing the branches of the gaunt leaf less trees and driving masses of cloud gloomily across the sky in relief against the darkness she could just see the out lines of the village church and the low stone wall which bounded the cemetery a song in the desert behind it there her eye rested long ingly there was quiet there was repose to sleep there would be to find frank she had no dearer love for all the bright world now than just that it held a little space in which she could lie some day and be at rest with the sweet breath of violets and daisies and the melody of singing birds above her how had she the strength to think that another year might find her still away from frank but  if this were the will of god she was startled at the answer her heart gave to this question she had thought herself submissive she had thought herself resigned to his care  h   thei conflict the truth came suddenly to her she saw how faint was her trust in his love how feeble her best endeavors to serve him in the lot he had appointed her how utterly she did in fact rebel against his will when that will decreed that she should live she saw in herself the nar rowed influence and dwarfed energies of a crushed thankless life taken only as a burden and borne as if she were a slave and not a child and why was this   because god had taken away her treasure  but should he not do as he pleased with his own had he no more claim upon her love because one of his golden gifts a song in the desert had been recalled and yetand yet how could she give it in the way he wished with the persistence of grief she came back to her old selfex cusing would not her master be satis fied if she did for him all she could from day to day how could he ask her to accept a future into which frank could never come   ooking out upon the clouds as  s if for an answer she thought at last they moved and bright ened and a glory of light shone through them turn ing the night to day as she gazed a form appeared therein and moved toward her a shining path growing before it till it came to where she was a sense of purity overwhelmed her but she felt no ct a song in the desert fear looking up into the bright face above her she saw why frank she waited breathlessly for his answer gazing into his eyes as if so she thought death might come to her he smiledhis old familiar smile it was yet changed into something so per fect in its joy that she wondered to see it he called her by name his voice like a strain of music that might wander forever about the throne yet tender still and full of human love she stretched out her hands to him pleadingly you have been sent to take me home frank a change came over his face a look   the visi on such as angels must wear in their speech less moments when but for this mystery of angelhood they might weep it is not willed he said you can not come to me yet she bowed her head with a bitter cry thei voice from the cloud called her again ruth i wish you to stay you wish it his will is call mine now i know no other i cannot cannot bear it it is so long she cried his face seemed to grow dim as she spoke his smile fading she tried to touch his hand but she could not       a song in the desert reach it he stood far away from her the golden light about him deepening and glowing as if it were the very whiteness of the throne and she seemed to know suddenly though it was not his voice which told her that so every hour of this hopeless murmuring placed more of dis tance between him and her that even he should expect her to stay without him this was hardest of all hearing her sharp cry he spoke again i cannot so look on it my poor ruth to us who have seen god the life which he gives even in its pain must be thankfully accepted i do not forget earths anguish or its love louder than   the vision all the music of our angel choirs i have heard your low moaning but to see you rebel against hm to see the love with whichi his hand has separated us and then to see how you let it crush you as if it were a harsh and cruel thing ruth all the pain that can enter heaven is in my heart for you oh frank what will you have me do she wailedc take this bitter gift from him this blessed gift be thazfutl that i suffer  that you suffer for him take up these weary years as if they were not filled with misery  a song in the desert take them  with rejoicing because there is something yet to do for him seeing the great prayer for help on her lips he drew near to herhis face brightening as if to bless her my work was not finished he said what i left undone on earth is given to you to bring to god for us both will you do this for him ruth  see  turning he pointed to an opening in the clouds where a long lonely path stretched out before her and looking she saw that it was hers to tread the way seemed to lead through a desert but as she ob served it more closely she saw that all along its sands homely duties and kindly   the vlsionx words and tender helps to the poor and lowly sprung and brightened like flowers and the joy of sad hearts whom nshe should cheer was like the lull of foun tains in the parched air ftar in the dis tance a soul crossed her path which but for her could not be saved and as she  listened to the dim sound of its blessings and loolked eagerly forward it might be perhaps there were others whom  god had chosen her to bring to himself she was not sure a voice broke the stillness of her long gazing your work  nd imine  we will do it togrether ruth and turning to answer hinm she saw by the deathless love in his a s ong in the desert eyes that he would not leave her to toil alone while she struggled with her tears for speech the pure bright face faded slowly from her sight she stretched out her hands imploringly she called his name but his smile was her only an swer she awoke with a start to find her dream had faded and she sat alone by her window amy still slept soundly and the room was cold and dark turn ing with a sick sense of disappointment to look out into the night she saw that the clouds were breaking away and in the bit of clear still sky above her head a single star shone like a smile the first whisper of possible peace she   the vision had heard since frank left her came as she bowed her head her lips moving as if in prayer cojt was only ruths clinging kiss on her mothers lips and a smile bright with deepened love turned on amy which told them that in the watches of the night god had spoken to her a promise of better things and sent frank to help her but they looked at her in wonder as every day she followed the voice which   the daystar led her on seeing how resolutely she tried to dispel the gloom that her grief had brought into their home and how she struggled to recall in its stead some of her old playful ways which were the charm of all their household memories the dearness of her sisterlove which they had sadly thought was gone as everthing else had gone which held her to the past came back to gladden them and they knew it truer tenderer than before the little boys felt no longer that they must hush their noisy plays before the shade on her face fora smile was there too and they thought only of that  a song in the desert ruth liked to play with them and see them happy and ruth was so patient with them ruth made all hard tasks so easy ruth had such a pleasant way of settling their troubles they had such talks with ruth at twilight after they had said their prayers when she came up and sat down on their little bed the buoyancy of amys girlhood was no longer checked because of her sisters loss she came at last to confide to her again all the joys and plans which had never seemed half hers unless ruth could share them and as for pother she would say why ruth i believe she lives by   the das ta r loving you and ruth turning with her cquiet smile would see in her mothers eyes that which made her go up very softly to hide her face on her shoulder and feel the caressing hand on her hair but it was not in her home alone that her patient heart drew the blessing of others to itself there were old friend ships to renew and almost forgotten oc cupations to take up again for their sake there were many too whom god had  smitten who knew him not as a com forter thesecalled to her and her own suffering made her eye quick to find them so she went down among those who a song in the desert were poor and despised of men as her master had gone before her seeking the sorrowful ones whom she might help at every step she met them she had not known before how much unaided miisery there was around her from their stifled factories and squalid homes they came to her she drew near to them to call them friends and that with humbled heart for grief had made desolate ways for them as for her and the same saviour who had been her helper loved them she could tell you of discourage ments which threatened to overcome her strength of ingratitude where she had a    the daystar labored most and hoped most surely of temptings to fall back into the selfish indolence of her grief of hours when her struggles with the wish for death were bitter of hours when the rod seemed sharper than she could bear but she would tell you too of a help that always waited for her of a strength that gave her courage of a love that never forgother she would tell you with a faint flush on her cheek and moistened eyes that it was very little she could do but per haps that would be accepted and some time she might see that her efforts had not been all unavailing some time  her a song in the desert fingers would turn her betrothal ring unconsciously as she spoke and you would know at once what she meant butshe was not to wait for this to see the results dof her work though we cannot know how brilliant the crown may be at last some of its jewels will fall in our path as we walk she thought of this thankfully one night when she had planned a festival for a crowd of little children whom she had taught in her patient way for many months they came from their dark unwholesome homes to frolic under the trees and in the garden  the same gar den where she and frank used to walk   the da s tar she thought with a smile how it would please him to see them there the little ones had brought their mothers and sisters with them shyly sometimes a whole family indeed for didnt the lady ask em all to come and molly and brother tom had a holi day and thought theyd walk along too and didnt she want to see the baby which couldnt come without mother nohow and could creep all round into everything since she saw itand the little thing would be sure to find its way over the soft grass to her knee and she would take it up to kiss it and play with it the proud mother standing by         a song in the desert one neatlydressed woman cast her keen eye over the lawn to single out three or four rosy children from the group and spoke suddenly to think she said putting her apron up awkwardly to her eyesto think how them little things was used to be left without a morsel to eat all day long in their miserable rags and me lying drunk on the floor or beatin of em and thrashin of em about  poor innocents till they didnt know what mother meant but a sort of devil and then to see em so clean and tisdy and me so happy and the rumcupboard all cleaned out and filled up with their little books    the da y s ta r and clothes and to think how you come to me when i was goin to shut the door in your face for i hated such like you who was rich and good and how you said in that soft voice o yourndidnt i want somebody to help me bringup the little creeturs decent and learn em how to love me and h i  god bless you i keep a chokin and tallcin both at once and make a fool of meself thinkin on it all while she stood there hiding her rough face in her babys neck another voice joined with hers a slight woman she was with a pale face and a mourn ing ribbon on her bonnet she looked  a s ong in thee df sert at the laughing baby with hungry eyes mine was so pretty she said in a sort of appealing tone to ruth just so warnt he and my heart was broke for him till i see you ruth took her hand very quietly with the quick tears in her eyes you told me said the woman   you told me where hed gone to and taught me the way to find him and told me hed wait for me and love me with his pretty ways in heaven just the same yes he was a winsome baby was my boy i was just thinkin how hed have looked with his red cheeks tumblin   the daystar round among them little things an comin up to kiss you along with em just then a gentle pull at her dres caused ruth to turn and see a pair oi very sad childish eyes fixed on her an to hear the story which had darkene them father had drank up all th money and mother was lying sick a home and they hadnt no dinner all day and would she mind her saving he supper when it came time to eat ae carrying it home she wouldnt let no body know and would hide it right ofl quick in her pocket she had scarcely comforted the child and brought back the light into its eyes i           g a sonig in the desert before amy called her to start some merry game under the trees with her smile ready for them in a moment she turned away and joined the childrens sport after that a happy mother came to her spelling out last weeks letter from her soldierboy that ruth might read and rejoice with her then it was a shy girl telling a story of her lovers long furlough and how brave and good he was and he wanted to see the lady would she mind dropping in wher she was down to say a bit to him or should she fetch him up to the house with her some time after millhours were over t                the da ys tar  close behind the blushing girl another stood waiting to speakso close that she heard the happy talk and turned  away with a sudden motion like one in pain it was not long before ruth stood by her looking into her face pale with its stamp of early widowhood what were ignorance and poverty that they should rise up between them now in their kindred loss ruth thought they met on common ground she drew the girls hand through her arm and wan dered down into the garden with her there was little to sayonly a few kind words and then to follow them by a silence in which the touch of the cool a song in the desert air and the light among the flowers might bring their own soothing to the tired heart so they came to her one by one these neglected ones into whose dark lives she had brought such brightness they came to bless her and go on their way rejoicing you would have wondered to see her passing among them with the sunlight on her quiet face and the smile on her lips so patient she was and full of tender ness for them so full of courage for their future so earnest in her sympathy with their joys so quick to divine where their troubles were and give them comfort    the days tar the children made happy by their plentiful supper had grown tired with their sports and gathered around her rubbing their eyes with their little brown fists to say goodnight and at last she was left alone she sat down under the trees where the birds were chirping sleepily over her head to watch the group in the road the women hushin their babies to sleep as they walked the happy children counting their store of apples and candy drowsily and treadi ng down the daisies the young    people stealing home two by two in the twi light and a solitary figure in a dark dress lingering behind them  all that bj      r        i a song in the desert figure would turn again and again to look at her as she sat there alone in the grey of the evening as if it longed to come back and tell her how the broken hearts for which she cared prayed god to speak to her the same promise of peace she had spoken to them she watched the girl till her form grew dim in the dusky light then bend ing her head listened for the last sound of the childrens laughter when that had died away she covered her face with her hands all these had blessed her had blessed her should she let their voices call to her in vain should she not thank god o tl   the da is tar  that she and frafik could so work to gether for him one upon earth indeed and one in heaven but never parted and both his who gave them each to the other she thought and raised her eyes to the west ern hills where ethe sky wa clear there was a prayer in their gaze that could not be uttered amy came up with the children to say goodnight and taking their little hands in hers she went slowly up to the house to find her mother with a fearless eye she looks now on her future for she knows who has de    a song in the desert creed its every moment in love what it may be  how long how short be longs not to her care she sees in all the kindliness of daily life a sweet incense which may rise to heaven like a prayer and make her strong all the thorns in her way she will press to her heavy heart and turn to flowers for his sake whose grief alone deserves such sharp crowning what if her steps do falter on this rough way she knows her saviour is there she only asks to hear his voice and she will go wherever it shall guide her he will not ask of her too long a journey he knows how she loves her    tse da ys tar soldier anorill in his own good time  bring her to the home in which he

when a boy of fourteen he had been sent from home to push his own fortunes in the great city alone and almost without help he had struggled up to his present position the old gentleman seems proud of the success of his son but never to any extent assisted him his name and family associations gave the boy even when engaged in humble services in enviable social position houses of high fashion and wealth were opened to him the boy resolutely turned stone after stone out of his pathway and when twentytwo years of age presented a  noble specimen of a young man of high moral   the curse of ta

ter was his only surviving child and the title with his estates pass ed to a distant branch of the family with whom he had not been on friendly terms he had had one son who died suddenly about three years beforeand now the lady adelaide was almost alone with what appeared to one accustomed to splendour and her style of living but a small fortune of fifteen thousand pounds sterling or about seventyfive thousand dollars st george de lisle seemed her nearest friend she consulted him about all her plans and if the thought of vhattshe should do when he was gone crossed her mind she banisheodjit without answering the question but the tithe came when return he must and reader perhaps you will not be so surprised as he was when i   the c  sb op t b fwboeb         tell you she consented to come with him not as the lady adelaide harriet mowhray but as mrs st george de lisle there was quite a furor of excitement among the upper circles of new york about the titled bride of young de lisle and although no large parties could be attended by the bridal pairon account of the recent death of her fatherthe select reunions which they graced with their presence though small as regarded numbers were exclusive in the extremesnd recherche in the highest degree still all things seemed to say happy st george de lisle i but the opera is over the people are going home carriages are rolling over the paved streets waking up or disturbing those who go to bed at proper hours and reader i will now close my first chapter and go to bed too ahapter ii it was late the morning after the opera when mr st george de lisle arrived at his counting room down town the day was one of harrassing perplexity and he shut himself up several times at inter vals of half an hour at a time as was his habit when business demanded unusual attention with instructions that were perempt ory on no account to be interrupted at length the days work was overand his carriage lad come to take him home he had an old and careworn look and ascended almost feebly for so young a man the carriage stepsbut there passed over his face an expres sion of relief as the vehicle rolled further away up town his home was a beautiful one and though the house  depot large its appointments were complete in all their detailand an impress of elegance pervaded the whole establishment the family numbered in all six children the oldest boy was away at school and the next was the girl who had been with them the preceding nightthe others of both sexes ranged down to a twoyearsold boy baby a lovelier family never blessed a mans hearth side they were to dine at home that day with a few invited friends and after dressing for dinner but a faew minutes elapsed when the guests began to arrive the dinner wa selegant well served and          st george de lisle or passed off without accident the hour for retiring from the table that is eight oclock p m was near and as all the guests were en gaged elsewhere for the evening mr and mrs st george de lile expected to spend this saturday night alone the company rose from the table and after a few brief adieus departed mrs de lisle had wanted for months one quiet evening at home with her husband she saw with a womans instinctive perception that there was some concealed source of anxiety upon his mind and she was determined if possible to know what it was and share it with him she was a true woman and a true wife she had laid awake at nights oftentimes wondering what it could be that was wearing upon him it was not that he was peevish or unkind but he was abstracted gloomy and melancholyeven when he smiled his face looked sader afterwards and those fitful lightings up to her imagining were like the gleamings of an unearthly light upon a whitened tomb now was her hour for knowing all and she was determined to do so she had with thig intent returned to the drawing room where mr de lisle was sitting alone with his eyes shut in a velvet chair and the careworn look was written so deep upon his face that she paused for a moment to disturb him her heart ached for her hus band but oh i why would he not tell her all his sorrow a loud ring at the door bell startled her she knew not why and he with an alarmed expression which was quickly chased away said i wonder who that can be and again closing his eyes sat silent until a footman entered with a note upon a silver waiter which he handed to his master mr de lisle opened and read it to the end his face turned white as marble and his lips trembled still he retained a com posure that was almost terrible and said to the attendant it tell the bearer there is no immediate answer the man bowed and retired de lisle clutching the paper in his handhis lips parting and teeth set firmly togetherthen sank back inhis seat the picture of anguish and despair his wife sprang to his side and fondly caressing him said st george by all that is sacred tell me what this means any thing is better than suspense tell me in mercy and at once i cannot oh i cannot replied the wretched man    i i i  i i a i the curse of the forger          but you must my dear i do not fear for me i can endure i am your wife if it is poverty you dreadthat does not appall me only tell me what it is it is worse than poverty it is disgrace and he covered his face with both his hands  the proud woman shuddered but one look towards the bowed down man before her enabled her to regain some portion of her self possession and she replied  even that st george i can share with you and be of some com fort but our children oh our children cannot they be saved tell me oh tell me what is itand she threw herself on her knees at his feet gin pity tell me there it isthat will tell you alland oh it is enough to sadden your heart forever wretch that i am i would that i never had been born she took the paper and read it through its contents alas i told her all it was a letter from one of the oldest and most respected of new yorks wealthy men and the president of a leading bank one with whose family they were upon terms of social intimacy and who had been oftentimes a friend to st george in his early strugts it stated that a note wlioh professed to have the signature of a wealthy firm drawn tohis order and which had been negotiated by himself was known tobea forgery a bank notice had been served by a mistake of one of the bank clerks upon the firm a whole month too early it had been disclaimed by them and with a desire to save him if possible from exposure he had now thus written to him how still that room was the ticking of the magnificent time piece on the mantle fell painfully loud upon the ear at last in a hloarse whisper she said and is this one note all no was the reply in a whispered tone so low that but for the excited nervous tension of the moment it couldnot have been heard this was thuns far the most crushing blow and the womans heart nearly sank beneath itbut againshe asked   in all to what amountthere was a pause oh how long and fearful it seemed i btiilnb answer  again the question came but now tin a determined slow and with that peculiarly clear enunciation for which she aisso remarkable her fate must be known i in all i think about thirty thousand dollars was the answer         st george de lisle or st george if that be all surely exposure may be saved hof the sin it is not a wifes province to speakall i have may cheerfully go to wipe the debt out  alas my wife that is all gone already there is not a dollar of your fortune left it is all all gone i  surely this house and furniture are worth something i sup posed they were mine was the calm replyno shade of anger but sorrow such as an angel might evince for the erring was expressed in her face adelaide i and the words came out one by one with intervals between of different lengths reproach me if you willi am i feel more wicked than you can think mebut i tried to keep up as long as i couldi could not bear that you should have to change your style of livinglosses came after lossesi tried to make them up and only made othersthe deed of the house was in my name alone and i mortgaged the property to its full value of the furniture i also gave a bill of sale and when all this money was gone i the  man could not utter the word that to his own wife confessed him a s tte was not a sign of irritation or impatience manifested as he proceeded and when he stopped she rose bent down her head kissedhis pale brow and said my poor poor husband how littledid you know me  oh i what could have been mere poverty compared tothis but now there is one thing must be done our children l they must be saved this disgrace oh ourchildren ii am thankful my dear parents are both dead and she left the room he heard her going up the nursery stairs and falling on his knees he prayed in agony to the almighty whose laws as well as those of man he had broken it is ever thus in the hour of wildest trouble even the criminal when headed in on all sides turns to his maker for succour mrs de lisle gazed in quiet grief upon the younger four of her little flock all sound asleepand scalding tears fell upon them her oldest little girl was on her knees at her evening prayers and a few words of murmured supplication for blessings on those she loved fell like balm upon her heart she lowered the already dim light so that the child might not when she arose perceive her face and then after kissing her good night she entered her dressing room   ths curse of the forge          rapidly changing her splendid dinner costume for a dress of plain material with bonnet on and shawl in hand she returned to the drawing room where still crouched in utter abjectness her misera ble husband  de lisle you must arouse yourselfevery moment is precious  if you havea spark of love for your children for me you must act i like a man this dreadful thing must be kept a secreti am going  to see mr duvalhe was once our friend and surely kindness caused him to write you that note he has experience and to take counsel with him now seems to me the wisest thing i can do and while i am gone write out a full description of all those notes and where they may be founddo not fail me in this she placed writing implements on the table beside him and left the house an half hour had scarcely passed when she returned there was still upon her face the same expression of calim determination and resolve she asked for the paper upon which he had been writing and upon being assured that it contained the whole account said i shall start to night for hudson you must watch tenderly over all our little ones while i am gone see that willie does not miss me i shall try and be back on monday morning mr duval thinks with me that i had best go and see your father and nbrothers it seems to me the only hope the last train leaves at ten oclock but as it is a way train i can reach it at its last stopping place in the city which is quite near this a quarter of an hour later i hane a cab now at the door and am all ready to start  she took his trembling hands within herownpressed them ten derly and said there is one thing more i askprayoh pray pray for help from on high the wheels of a carriage driving rapidly and growing fainter in the distance gave assurance that mrs st george de lisle had com menced her midnight journey towards the home of her fatherin law a          st george de lisle or chapter    iii what a fearful night ride was that alone and haunted withsuch sad forebodings the huge locomotive shrieked and moaned now vomiting forth sparks and then yelling like some reljoicing fiend drawing on to destruction its freight of h uman prey as it rushed on ward with the speed of the wind had an eternal nlight settled dowln upon the world shelonged to reach the end of her journey yet trembled with fear at the thought of the momentous results whichi hung upon the communications she had to make at lengthl the dawn brokefdr morning will succeed night no matter how wretched we may be it was still early when she reached the hotel at hudson and securing a private room she despatched a note asking an immediate interview to the younger of mr de lisles two brothers living in the citybut who htid because of marked success in life obtained an almost para mount influence over his father an age seemed to elapse before the return of her messenger but at length he arrived and with him mr charles de lisle he was a man of about fifty years of age one who lad grown rich and hardhearted money had been his idol and a system of econorm ical sayingexcept wherehis own individual comfort was concerned several successful operations in real estate and a continuous prac tice of note shavingthe security being ample and the rates enor mous had resulted in developing a character disposed to selfishness into one in which the predominating ideas of self and gold had swal  lowed up every other consideration he was gentlemanly in exterior and with a bland smile wished to know what could have induced his fair lady sister to come alone to hudson at such a timel and why she had not at once driven to his house instead of remaining at the hotel charles we are in trouble dreadful trouble and disgrace fear ful to think of is on my track the bland smite vanishedand the hard expression which always i foreboded evil to his solicitor stamped itself unmistakeably upon his i   the curse op tee forger          face this had the effect of recalling her faculties and she proceeded in as few words as possible to tell him all the circumstances of the case his face grew angry and flushed purple with excitementand when she had finished he hissed an imprecation through his teeth and it the extravagant scoundrel i he had better run for it re but remember his childrenw yourself and your children i we will all suffer immeasurably if the thing is not hushed up truehe said blast the villainl my own boys are of the same name and are now in new york just started in business it is dreadfully unfortunate i i will consult with edward and leaving the room he was seen quickly walking down the street towards the house of the oldest brother mrs de lisle took courage she knew edwards was a kind heart hoe felt for all in distress and surely for his brotherwhom as the njamin of the flock the little onel and whom their dying mother had charged him to be kind to and watch overhe would couns el tenderly she kneeled down and thanked god for the one ray of hope that was darting across the troubled waters of her soul edward had not half the influence with the father thiat charles possessedfor he himself had been one of the unfortunates in life that is had always been in straitened circumstancesbut through charles their father could be influenced to any things the two brothers soon returned the face of the eldest was full of sorrowand his head sunk down heavily upon his chest he walked with his hands folded up under his arms and approaching mm de lisle he said in a kind mournful voice sister adelaide from my soul i pity youl then after a short silence he resumedst george do this oh can it be i would as soon have thought the angel gabriel would have comlnitted a henious crime and turning to charles he said  brother we must save him st george has had but little from our father and although this sum will swallow up far anore than any single portion he could give to a childyet we must each be willing to lose a part to save him from disgrace butand the angry cloud again spread over the brothers face it is not fair or just that we shouldhave to suff r for his exyava gance and rascalityit is too baditis shameful         sr george de lisle or  true brotherbut exposure would hurt us all more than the de  crease of each share our father would leave us your boys for in stance would suffer disadvantage in their business were it known that the family blood was tainted with this crime far more in worth than the few thousands you would thus lose  edward saw he had touched the right cord to influence charles and after some further conversation it was at length resolved that they two should break the subject to their father and induce him if they could to advance the necessary money to redeem the whole of the forged paperand that if they were successful in thus influencing him charles do lisle should return with his sisterinlaw to new yorlk to attend to this business they then left her and wended their way sorrowfully to the pater nal mansion she prayved and hopedthen feared and prayed again how wearily oh how wearily did the time drag along the brothers broke the matter as well as they knew how to their  aged father it seemed at first to completely stun him his son a forgerl  his son the bright boy of whose success he had been so proud   no they surely had had  a nightmare dream and were dreaming still or maybe he himself had the nightmare oh would they not awake himand   the plaintive voice of the old man begged ha two sons for gods sake oto awake him from his horrible g dream  it was a piteous sight tears streamed down his withered cheeks and he trembled all over like an aspen leaf tihe three men wept togetler at length after they had in some degree pacified him they told him of their plan for saving st george and the credit of the family by recovering all the forged notes and their joint wil lingness to sacrifice a portion of their inheritance to effect the object his other childrenfor the family was largewere scattered over different parts of the union and time would not permit of their be ing consulted the exigency was imperative and what is done at all must be done at once he gave a stolid assent to all they said only asking now and then is it not a dreadful dream oh my sons cannot you awake me  it is killing meoh it is killing me he was passive in their hands as a little child signing with trem bling hands one after another papers giving the power of attorney to his son charles to sell various stocks that he owned the amount swept away nearly the whole of the personal estate of the old go the cure of tn forgeb         tlemanleaving however his real estate intact which was large and very valuable while thus engaged edward hastened to the hotel to relieve the anxiety of mrs de lisle she then for the first time since her arrival shed tears they flowed copiously and the kind brother administered all the consolation he could devisebut ah how little was thatthe frightful future loomed up dark and terrible they spent the day together it being sunday there would be no return train until after twelve oclock p m when the albany train would stop on its way down to new york a message was received from charles stating that he would be ready at that time to accom pany his sister home and desiring her to be ready it was thought best for her not to seek an interview at present with her fatherin law he was too much afflicted tole war it as twilight darkened around edward prevailed upon mrs de lisle to take a soothing opiate and to endeavor to obtain some rest as he left the room she clasped within both her hands his own and poured forth her gratitude to him in such a strain of touching pathos that he was deeply movedand he could only reply by a murmured prayer that their great allfather would guide and help them the miserable woman threw herself upon a sofa and worn out as she was sleep came to her relief for several hours she slum bered soundly as is oftentimes permitted to the extremely wretched the convict the night before his execution with the shadow of the gallows falling on him sometimes thus sleepsthen more un easily she breathedi dreams began to disturb her reposeat first indistinctand disconnected yet all distressing pale phantoms passl ed her and pointed menacingly onwardjeering demons laughed malignantly in her faceserpents glided along the path and hissing out their forked tongues lifted their snaky eyes and watched her as she moved along at last she seemed to have entered a dense forest the rocks and sharp stones over which she had walked had torn her shoes into shreds and with bleeding feetshe endeavored to make her way through thorns and briars urged on by an irresistible impulse weary and painful was the journey there was no light save that of the lightning as it fitfully gleameddisplaying horror upon hor ror it seemed hours that she thus wandered until at last there was revealed to her peacefully sleeping upon thei brink of a dread ful precipice her children they were all there and locked in each others arms another fitful flash land in a bush behind them s        st geobgee lisle or crouched an enormous tiger his eyes glaring fiercely and in the very act of springing upon them her heart ceased to beatyet in a wild agony she rushed forward and catching the fearful glance with her human eyes gazed steadily into those of the brute until cowed down hais huge form gradually relaxed and he slunk away into the darkness peal after peal of thunder now shook the earthandthe clouds suddenly rolling away there appeared winging his flight to wards her an angel form and with a smiling face he whispered as he passed mother thus hast thou saved thy children from the for gers curse she fixed her gaze upon his upward flight until his  brightness seemed a brilliant point in the sky and when she awoke the evening star was shining full in her face their journey back to new yorkas performed in almost total silence mr charles delislelat immersed in thought by his sisters sideand she with her lefden weight of grief thought of her child ren and her husband when they reached the depot he declined accompanying her home but told her to say to st george he would see him at his counting room at twelve oclock noon of that day he then bade her a cold adieu and was lost amid the crowd the grey light of morning was stealing over the city as she entered the chamber where her husband was lying but bot asleep and on throwing herself down by the bedside she exclaimed thank god st george we are savedwe are savedi the feelings of the poor wretch can be more easily imagined than described as she recited how she had succeeded in a faint but gentle voice he thanked her saying she  was the one that had saved him and it would ever be remembered then cowering down as if afraid of the approaching daylight he wrapped the bed clothes around and over hinm and groaned in utter and complete prostration a few minutes afterwards the mother was in the nursery with her children fondly caressing them the little thingstheir loving eyes full of wonder at their mothers absence and now this early visit never before seemed so dear to her in turns they threw their arms around her and covered her with kisses at last little willie eager to make some outoftheway demonstration of affection after dipping his tiny hands into a basin of water laid them upon her forehead saying  mamma dot a headacheme tool her head and as she gazed into his sweet face it seemed as though the lineaments of the angel in her dream were again before her i   te    curse f  o   f chaept

charles broke out lso st geore you have succeeded in dissipating the money of the family and stabbing into its reputation too ithink thedevil must have gotten possession of you i fear he has charles   was the reply in a mournful voice one question now st george i docs that paper contain a list of all those accursed notes it does  was the answer in c a tone that to gainsay its truth was impossible we must then get to work at once was the rejoinder down and write to each of the holders of those notes that having come unxpectedly into apossssion of funds you will esli the obliga tions if presented immediately there is a pressure in the money market as i know to my sorrow for i had to sariace terribly some of fathers stockand the greedy fellows will be glad enough to have letter after lette r was dispatched and note after note presented nd the sums paid mr duval himself brought the note upon which andthe discvery had been made and kindly advised with the hrothels he told them a but few knew of itand that they though shocked and grieved felt kindly towards st george and pitied him before the clock struck three the pile was complete lying on the desk before them charles stretched out his hand and taking the notes placed them in his pocketbook saying i must hand these over to father then buttoning up his coat he prepared to leave st george you had better give up your present business indeed it seemzto me you must father told me to say that under no circumstance will he ever assist you againe good bye  and the manof few words and hard heart walked steadily out intothhe street passing without notice the mystified a   st giobg de lse on clerks in the outer room who wondered in low tones to each other  what the deuce was up our governor seems mighty fush to day that night mr and mrs delis were again alone several of the children remained in the drawing room after tea and their playthings lay scattered about the flo both re silent neither wishing communicate the sad tho ghts that re uppermost in their mainds raising her eyes they fell ppo an old picture which was one that had been over a contury in her fathers family and which represented afl incident in its history it represented an interruption of a bridal ceremony the fair girl in bridal robes therepictured was hergreatgrandmother and the cos tume of the whole group was quaint and oldfashioned the lady  had been betrothed to her greatgrand father who at that time was an younger son with little in prospect a soldier and belonging to a regiment stationed in india a wealthyand titled suitor presented and she was led to the hymeneal altar compliantto her fathers wises a  bishop in full canonicals had proceeded some distance in the cere mony and had just repeated if any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together let him now speakwhen  from the hall a manly voice shouted it i can and willeven at the pint of my good sdard and in rushed the soldierlover and the bride  throwing herself into his arms was borne triumphantly away the thoughts of her own bridaland now she was far away from her father larndarose to her memory her luasbands famil all  estranged and he a  guilty disgraced manand she turned in the direction where he sat looking so forlorn and hearthroken that her eyes wateredr with tears just then the door of the room opened and old mr de lisle came tottering inf e isi trembling limbs could scarcely sustain him his thite hair fell over his shoulders and in q uivelring accents he asked where is st george where is my n st george could not answer and he looked towards where he sats st  eorge o and a flush of anger rose in his face is this all true miserable boy  how could you thus act you havekilled your old father but from this moment i  consider you no longer my son and turning round he slowly left theroomand hoduse r     the cursk of the forger          as a train arrived suddenly resolved to go himself to new york immediately after his arlival he drove to st georges house anda  ill an hours time was now again on his way back to hudson  the next day he tookto his bed and in a few weeks more he losed his eyes in death before h

the drown ing man makes who cannot swimand the five days wonder of new york was that the rich de lisle had failed l former friends shrugged their shoulders and said no wonder they lived too high  and when the list of invitations for their next party ids made out the de lisles were forgotten to be included it does not take the fashionable world long to forget a family whose steps are treading down into the valley of humilityand if they quietly let them pats without assisting their descent by abuse it is rather the exception than the rule the mortgage on the house was foreclosed the bill of sale of the furniture entered up and almost penniless with an aching heart ide lisle sought refuge with his family on the second floor of a smallhouse in an obscure street lying in a part of the city of whichthe family had scarcely known the existence thus they lived mr de lisle seeking employment day after day without finding any i hope grew faint within him he now feared every one knew his fatal seciret and as day closedin after day and he could get nothing to dohis brow lowered and face paled with suffering and anguish he would mutter words to himself as he walked through the stieets asking for any kind of workthe wreck of the once envied st george de lisle the curse of the forger was on hiin  his wife did all she couldshe worked hard and saved all she knew how to do but the little they had grew daily less article after article of dress and furniture was sold and now the demonihunger began to stare them in the face matters were at this dismal pass when one night just as it was grow ing dark their little girl camein saying her father had given her at the door four dollars to hand to mamma and to say that he would not  be home that night as he was going to hudson to see uncle edward de lisle had met an old clerk of his whom he had prevailed upon to lend him five dollars four of which e ttus appropriated aikd          st gegrge de lisle with part of the fifth he bought a secondclassticket to hudson the day had been hot and sultry but rain was falling when he arrived and as it was so unseasonable an hour he hesitated now that he was a poor man to wake up his brothers family he walked for along time about the streetsthose streets where he had played wie an ocent boy oh little did he then dream that he should eer b  what he now wasa man branded like cain with a sense of ink his whole life passed in review efore himand he wandered on and on until he found himself far on the road to the grave yard where his dear mother lay buried and by her side that father whose last look upon him had been so stern and unfor giving he climbed the enclosure and approached where they lay in an elevated portion of the ground he then crawled all dripping and wet close to the side where his mother lay and rested himself upon the mound oh how he longed as he used when la boy to lay his tired aching head upon her bosom and be soothed by her gentle hand but the storm which he had scarcely noticed gathering thicker and blacker now broke in surly vengeance overhead the heavens are all aflamne and peal after peal of thunder shakes the earth oh what a blinding flash

her busbands relatives sealed with black containing a hundred dollar note and the sad infor mation of his death and burial in the family lot at hudson reached mrs de lisle she was now alone with her

according to act of congress in the year  by leon c weld in the clerks office of the district court of the southern district of new york press of sutton bowne  co the birthday gifts the birthday gifts a story for wives chapter i o julia i never saw anything so beautiful may clayton exclaimed as her dear friend julia waring opened a tiny jewel case and brought to light from its soft nest of white velvet a magnificent solitaire diamond ring and held it up for mutual admiration yes isnt it elegant and such a surprise too for yesterday  when i modestly hinted that i would be twentyone today charley looked unconcerned and said something silly about stamps thereby giving me to understand that i might as well give up all idea of a present this year though to tell the truth mamie mia in my wildest dreams i did not go beyond  that coral set we both admired in tiffanys window the other day  but is it not beautiful and mrs waring slipped the glittering circlet on her wedding ring finger and as it caught the rays of light and held them lovingly in its heart golden and azure and red the jewel was truly magnificent yes indeed julia it is a gift worthy of a princess and therefore of your own right royal self but dont put on airs please because you have such a splendid gift and despise my humble offering said mrs clayton as she placed in her friends hand a pair of beautifully embroidered satin slippers tiny enough for cinderella in the fairy story you precious old darling mamie clayton you must have made these in a fit of inspiration merry jule waring exclaimed  as she caught her friend around the neck and kissed her affectionately  theres a kiss for every bead and a squeeze for every loving stitch and a thousand thanks besides isnt it rather a singular coincidence that our birthdays should occur on the same day yes we are twin sisters only that we have two mothers and i have been busy a whole week trying to get this little trifle ready for your ladyships acceptance and mrs waring drew from her pocket a handkerchief heavily trimmed with valenciennes with the initials m c daintily embroidered in its tiny cambric centre but it isnt half so pretty as these slippers so i shall have to pale my ineffectual fires after all there dont say another word please but tell me how russell did honour to the occasion what was his gift guess a new piano no what then a florence sewing machine o no i have one already well let me think a silver tea set no again dear and as i know you would not guess in a month ill show you and so pretty mrs clayton stepped to her bureau opened a drawer and took therefrom a document enclosed in a long buff envelope and placed it quietly in the hand of her friend good gracious may what is this a college diploma a deed of a brown stone house or a last will and testament it looks dreadful enough for anything say mollie what does it mean it means dear julia that russell has assured his life with the equitable life assurance society of the united states for the sum of ten thousand dollars for my benefit and that is the policy julia waring drew a long breath and opened her big blue eyes wide with amazement  well of all birthday gifts that strikes me as little the most peculiar and one that i shouldnt at all fancy one of those agents was boring charley only the other day with his platitudes about the benefits  of life assurance and actually i believe that charley would have been influenced by his arguments if it hadnt been for me you see he left two or three little books for him to read and digest at his leisure but i gave them to bridget to kindle the fire with and so i trust the subject is quite at rest it must have been a disappointment to you may to get a life assurance  policy for your birthday gift i wouldnt have believed that russell could be such a goose own up now mamie dear didnt you feel disappointed on the contrary my dear friend i cannot tell you how dearly i prize this most tender expression of my husbands love life is uncertain at best and it touches me to my hearts core to know that if my noble husband should be taken from me and her beautiful eyes grew brighter with tears at the thought he has laid up in this policy a fund that would save little maud and i from pecuniary suffering at least o julia how could we bear that already crushed to the earth beneath the cross of orphanage and widowhood and the tones had grown so low and tremulous that the last word was a whisper there is a deal of sentiment in your view of the subject according to my way of thinking mamie dear excuse me but as a symbol of affection i infinitely prefer my beautiful diamond de gustibus non disputandum est you know but really i must run for bridget will be sure to let the birthday cake bake itself and i should be sadly mortified if it should have a heavy streak in the middle of course you and russell will come over this evening you will meet only a few mutual friends so you neednt get up a very elaborate toilet au reservoir as charley would say chapter ii o nonsense charley every body knows that in a few years you will be one of the firm of chase  co then surely you are on the high road to fortune so in about ten years i shall expect to see charley waring our name you know on the door plate of one of those elegant brown stone houses in montgomery place and i shall drive the very handsomest pair of bays in the park and as my taste is not at all extravagant i shall not think of wearing anything more expensive than black velvet and diamonds so cant you possess your soul in patience for a little while but julia foolish child suppose i should die within these ten years what then would become of my poor ewe lamb you know i am living on a salary a large one it is true but if i should die the only source of income for yourself and little florence would cease at once i have been talking the matter over seriously with rush clayton this morning and he urges me to assure at once says he has known no peace like that which has dwelt in his heart since he placed in his wifes hands the policy securing her a competence beyond any possible  contingency why julia our pastor mr beecher says that it is the plain duty of every christian man to assure his life he is your oracle on most subjects i wish you didnt feel so about this matter it seems to me really important charley you freeze my heart with your gloomy forebodings  mr beecher isnt infallible any more than any body else and i dont thank rush clayton for putting such absurd ideas in your head and tears almost angry sprang to her eyes as she exclaimed and as for that life assurance agent who has followed you like a fate all these weeks harpingharpingharpingon that one everlasting string i wish he was in guinea and furthermore i will take this occasion to say that i believe the whole business of life assurance to be a humbug and all this sentiment about philanthropy and these societies providing the widows and orphans of the land with an unknown quantity of bread and butter for the rest of their mortal lives well it is all stranded on a drowsy ear in this case at all events for i havnt a scintilla of faith in any such rhapsodical twaddle so please dont say another word about it thats a good boy and ill play this lovely new mazourka for you mrs waring sat down to the elegant decker piano and the diamond ring flashed on her white hand along the keys which rang out silver harmonies her husband thoughtfully lighted a segar and gave himself up to the full comfort of home but still the small voice would not be hushed but deeper than the music could fathom far down in the adyta of his heart the utterance would make itself heard if any man provide not for his own he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel chapter iii reader will you go with me to the home of russell clayton the dark angel azrael has shadowed that threshold with his sable wings for many days doctorit is the broken voice of his wifeis there hope god alone knows my child trust him your husband has a powerful constitution or he could not have resisted  this fever so long when it leaves him if there are no business cares to disturb and harass him if his mind as well as his body may have perfect rest he may be spared otherwise it is better to tell you the truth there is no hope tenderly as a young mother watches the slumber of her firstborn faithfully and anxiously as she realized the full danger  of her husbands situation did mary clayton watch almost without food or rest until that terrible fever drunk with the rich purple wine of her husbands life left him stranded back upon the shore of time with scarcely a breath stirring the linen that covered his bosom how each hour dragged its slow length along ah how would it be when day came knocking  at the eastern gates would he have already borne hopes tender blossoms into the silent land the thin hand lay passive in the clasp of his wife and once again she asked doctor is there hope he will rally if there is no care on his mind do you know about his business he may worry about the time lost on this sick bed perhaps his income ceases for the time and worse than all if he believes that he will not recover and distresses  his mind with fears concerning the support of yourself and child when he is gone any of these may occasion disquietude  enough to bring on a return of fever do you know dear child how it is sadly poor mary bowed her head and she could hardly speak for the tears alas i do not know he is conscious now but too weak to speak give him the whey one teaspoonful at a time keep the room dark and quiet and if possible let his first conscious impressions be cheerful but what is the matter child for a light had dawned in marys eyes and a blessed inspiration  flew into her heart as without stopping to answer the good doctor she glided noiselessly past him down the basement stairs and into the dining room where hanging over the mantel and looking her honestly in the face from its pretty rosewood frame was the life policy her precious birthday gift taking it carefully down she carried it to the sick room and selecting a position hung it where the sick man would see it as soon as he opened his eyes and when he had strength enough to speak the kind old physician heard him say mary that policy has saved my life by assuring me that you and our daring little daughter would be safe from want even if it should please god to call me out from your presence forever there is no need for worry now heart and brain may rest and i know i shall get well and if ever there was a hymn of true thanksgiving it went up from that household as mary clayton knelt by her husbands  bedside and with his thin hand pressed close to her heart thanked god for life assurance chapter iv only two years had passed fortune had dealt kindly with russell clayton and he was traveling with his wife in europe it was a lovely september morning and even in london the day was bright and clear and as our friends sat in their cosy private breakfast room at the morley house mary asked quietly have you the herald russell no the american steamer had just arrived but the waiter said he would bring up the paper as soon as it came in o dear i feel as blue as one of homers ships this morning and i shall be glad to see a newspaper from home i think even the advertisements in a new york journal will be intensely interesting well you must indeed be hungry for home newsanother cup of coffee pleaseah here comes the waiter now as that functionary entered bearing a goodly package of letters besides  one or two of the new york dailies well have a right jolly morning with these eh mary yes indeed im all through breakfast so do hurry up and see dear rush if there is a letter for me from jule waring her majestic silence is appalling for i wrote her from paris giving our address here several weeks ago mr clayton shuffled over the package of letters but the coveted missive was not among them indeed the letters were nearly all business communications and so of little interest to mrs clayton who exclaimed impatiently well i really think she might have written and i hope the ghost of that broken promise will haunt her for a week please give me the herald russell perhaps i can solace myself with some account of the brilliant proceedings in our american congress good gracious how it would make these parliamentary gentlemen stare if they could realize how we rush things at washington i wonder what distinguished members of that most august conclave are at swords points now i hope somebodys quarreling for i should enjoy it in my present frame of mind mrs clayton said this with a pretty affectation of crossness and as her husband looked up and smiled she continued a desultory conversation as she carefully looked over the columns of the print in her hand o russell this is a saturdays paper two weeks old and mr beecher was to preach at dear old plymouth on the sunday following o wont it be pleasant to get back home again and sit in our own pew and have the bread of life broken by our beloved pastors hands once more i think i can hear the solemn swell of the organ now as that great congregation rises to sing shining shore you may talk as much as you please about the solemn worship in the cathedrals of the old world butwhatwhat is this heavenly father have mercy russell look here and mary clayton burst into tears as she thrust the paper into her husbands hands and he read we regret to announce that mr charles waring who was thrown from a carriage while driving with a friend in central park yesterday died this morning from exhaustion produced by internal hemorrhage mary threw her arms around her husbands neck o russellrussell darlingwhat will poor julia do charley killed o is it not too dreadful mr clayton knit his brows with an expression of pain yes it is a sudden blow and a dreadful one my old chum has gone to his rest before me at last poor fellow i had hoped to see his kind face first on the other side of the water and to take his honest hand in friendly greeting once more sad news little mary he was a very prince of a friend and one who bore without abuse the grand old name of gentleman and only to think that i have just been reproaching my poor jule for not writing when if i had only known that god had laid his hand upon her so heavily that she was left in this sad world without husband father or mother alone save baby florence to drift about in this life and be driven by every storm o russell what can the poor child do did you not tell me sometime ago that they took a furnished house last spring yes and at an enormous rent too jule said they would not buy furniture until charley was able to have a house of his own i do not think they owned anything but the piano of course then she will have to give up her home indeed i think she must have done so already however i will telegraph  immediately and see how matters stand the telegram was sent and the answer came that mrs waring was dangerously ill mr and mrs clayton were among the passengers on the next steamer homeward bound chapter v it was saturday morning and mrs clayton was down stairs as all good housekeepers should be and with bridget as aiddecuisine was deep in the mysteries of baking robed in a pretty calico dress with a white apron tied neatly before it and sleeves rolled up above the elbows of her plump white arms she was deftly putting the finishing touches to her first apple pie when her husband literally rushed in and taking her by the waist whirled her round the room in an impromptu and dizzy galop why russell what is the matter are you crazy there youve dropped your glove in the butter and your cigar in the pudding dish well never mind the butter or the pudding dish well throw them into the ash barrel and get new i say may well dear how long will it take you to get on your waterfall and button boots and other traps eh i want you to go out with me right away o i can be ready in just two minutes but mercy russell it is saturday morning and only think of the baking never mind the baking bridget can finish that well enough so come right along im in a desperate hurry well ill go of course but i must insist on thinking it a very peculiar circumstance for you to come home this time of day and take me off on a wild goose chase in this style and mrs clayton ran up stairs and in a few minutes descended neatly arrayed in walking dress and awaited with tolerably good patience further developments come along sis im going round to jule warings this morning to kick up a bit of a bobbery and i want you to be there to enjoy the latest dramatic sensation in the way of a little domestic tragedy improvised for the occasion and seizing a rectangular package which had been patiently waiting in the hall mr clayton accompanied by his wife sallied forth into the street walking a considerable distance from the quiet genteel street where they lived our friends stopped at last before a shabby genteel two story brick house in an obscure neighborhood  where living on the second floor julia waring received music pupils at ten dollars a quarter ugh how this first floor smells of onions only think of charley warings wife perched up on the second floor of such a tenement as this it is a burning shame but the independent little witch would slave herself to death before she would accept  aid or comfort from any son of adam living even if it were her own brother i want you to listen while i make her confess that she pawned her diamond ring less than a month ago rather than accept a loan from me ringing the cracked bell which returned anything but a silvery peal for the desperate pull rush clayton gave it julia waring sadly thin and pale since we saw her last appeared at the door and welcomed her friends good morning my dear julia i know you are wondering what ill wind blew us both round here this morning but rush invited me to come and has neglected to vouchsafe me his confidence as regards the why and wherefore dont you think it a very singular proceeding for a business man to be making calls at this time of day well im very glad to see you both for to acknowledge the truth i feel a little tired this morning and it will rest me to look at you well the fact of the business is mrs waring that vacant space on the wall just over your piano there has always been a sort of eyesore to me so i have taken the liberty of having a little engraving that i chanced to find in my safe this morning framed for its especial adornment it is a nice little bit of art proceeding to open the packagerepresents two very beautiful female figures one that holiest of all subjects mother and child sacred since the madonna and the other the good genius of some benevolent institution hurrah little woman i feel like a boiler about to explode the long and short of it all is that this morning in looking through my safe i found a package of papers that charley had placed there while we were abroad may you know i left the key with him and among them i found this policy dont you see may it is just like yours and it assures julia in case of charleys death ten thousand dollars and ive been up to the office and the money is all ready ten thousand dollars my dear ten thousand in the equitable hurrah for the equitable little woman long may it wave but ill be hanged if julia hasnt fainted you are crying like all possessed and so am i hurry up make her come to and get on your traps for i feel like the boy in the black crook i want to go home look up you poor little widow god bless you i hope charley can see this from the other side o my poor dead darling o charley charley to think your precious love has followed me and watches over me from beyond the grave o how can i be thankful enough and she buried her white face on her dear friends bosom and mary hugged and kissed her over and over again and there never was such a time no reader not within the memory of the oldest inhabitant and now let me ask one question and then im off and may you may stay and help pack up for im going right off to take that nice new house for julia just next ours and you two women will be in paradise come mrs waring be kind enough to give me the name and address of that cursed old scamp to whom you pledged your diamond ring you see ive found you out it must sparkle on your finger again before night good morning i must hurry home and see how bridget gets along with the baking eh mary the next morning while the dew was yet fresh upon the flowers at greenwood julia waring knelt beside poor charleys grave and gave thanks that some of the tears of the widow may be wiped away and some of the cries of the fatherless  be hushed price ten cents the chronicles of the great peace jubilo let us have peace boston new england news company  court street sole agents

congress in the year  by j brown in the clerks office of the district court of massachusetts rockwell  churchill printers  washington st the chronicles of the great peace jubilo chronicles of the peace jubilo chapter i it came to pass in the first year of the reign of ulysses son of jesse that one gil more chief musician and leader of the band of hubites conceived the idea of holding an immense peace festival a great war between the north and south had long caused streams of blood to flow throughout the land but union being restored the noble heart of gil more was wellnigh bursting with grateful enthusiasm so he said let all the nation including new jersey and connecticut hold carnival let the chief singers and playersall fifers and fiddlers and blowersall bands throughout columbiajoin their glad strains for thought he ought not every creature from the isles of the sea to the connecticut valley and from dixies land to the north pole to blend their hands and voices in one mammoth jubilee whereupon this one gil more did launch his ideal barque upon the ocean of public opinion and after the seasickness of first disappointments and the tempesttossings of rebuke from unappreciative and unfeeling mortals the noble vessel finally returned to him with victorious results and many a hearty godspeed chapter ii the seeming wise men of gotham rich in lands and stores and merchandise listened to the project of a jubilee but turned their deaf ears to any plea for its being rendered within the limits of their glorious city then thought gil more i will return to the land of the hubites there are wealth culture refinement artistic and musical taste such as no other country can boast of there the strong the brave the noble the enterprising the poor in spirit but proud in name will help forward this gigantic and soulinspiring festival of peace now the gothamites being a mighty race with long heads but longer purses thought all wonderful things to merit worldwide reputation must originate in their brain and be set forth within their boundaries but it was not so to be this time the men of athens moved to the very depths of their beings and to the depths of their pockets did gather round gil more and voted that he should blow his trumpet from their historic heights and that the athenians should have all the glory of instrument and song they looked with most benignant expression one upon another saying with characteristic istic complacency is not our dominion the very hub of the universe besides did not we and the brethren upon our borders go forth first to battle and did not our brave men who survived musket and sword return bearing the sheaves of peace with them old plymouth rock and bunker hill towered more loftily than ever in the minds of patriotic athenians and the oldest families of beacon hill and state house highlands said let us have peaceand the peace jubilee upon our broad common chapter iii and it came to pass when certain men among the hubites found out that gil more and his friends were planning to build their structure upon the common they became exceedingly wroth and they said loudly we will not allow our beautiful green sacred in the hearts of modern pilgrims and beautiful to the eyes of our entire commonwealth to be thus sacrileged and injured by building committees and so much tramping upon the grass others cried out no our children and grandchildren with their posterity inherit this promised land they shall possess it for their huntingground they shall fish in its ponds and drink in its fountains we will have no immense tabernacle with surrounding shanties for the vending of refreshments and small wares to cover our beautiful and majestic green therefore the councilmen and aldermen and musicmen and followers of gil more turned away from the frogpond and the croakers and lifting their eyes upward said we will possess the new land and saint james park shall be the beloved spot where peace and song shall be proclaimed then the architects and builders were summoned and the lumber made ready then the singers and players were invited and they became merry then said gil more the many thousand voices forming a stupendous chorus shall be kept in tune by our worthy tour jay and all players upon the viol shall be led by o lee bull the great organ shall have  pipes and be acted upon by billy cox besides our queen of song shall be pay rep perr and addie fill lips shall give the minor solos now while the voices of the multitude were being put in tune and all the stringed and wind instruments were being waxed and oiled and prepared for the great blowing and bowing and fingering the builders and masterworkmen were busy at st james park erecting the spacious structure wherein thousands from the ends of the earth and chicago should assemble to hail the year of jubilee the athenians being a classic race well versed in poetry and public libraries and having many savans and men skilled  in arts sciences and musicbesides as the selections to be rendered during the festival were from the old mastersit was thought fitting that the classic name of coliseum should be given to the famous building and it came to pass after many days that the coliseum neared its completion and after the space of two months and fifteen days it was ready for the actors and for the lookerson chapter iv the coliseum being completed and the preparation days having ended all things were ready and all the tribes were eager to enter upon the glorious fete gil more proudly led the entire musical forces into the ark of peace then did tour jay and ice berg and sir rann take to their choruses while dodworth of the gothamites led his band and thousands of performers upon all known and some unknown instruments from the north south east and west filled up the spaces now the first day of this grand jubilee was to the minds of all hubites a perfect success such an influx of people from all parts of the globe surprised even the oldest inhabitant races and tribes of all colors and sizes including many carpetbaggers and babycarriers came to athens some with doughnuts in hand others with dough faces as soon as the day dawned saying let us have peace in one little alley it was said forty thieves were congregated and several of the race known as pickpockets had their attention arrested by the near view of tombs and stationhouses this with the exception of a few rogues for the hubites were a goodly race objecting to immoral pursuits and always punishing the guilty is all we have to chronicle as disturbing the public peace many brethren from chelsea dorchester heights and all the surrounding villages besides the natives of the sunny south african tribes hoosiers and californians did gather at the coliseum and drink their fill from the apollonian fountains and it came to pass when all the men and women were seated in the building which the hubites had erected they were hailed by the chaplain of the house and afterward treated to rice then did the full chorus burst upon the ears of an astonished multitude then followed many soulstirring strains from soloists and instrumentalists until hours had fled and the performances were no more thus did end the first day of the carnival val of peace and all proclaimed it a grand success chapter v the second day was like unto the first only more so the chief ruler over the entire land was expected to enliven the scene this man ulysses the son of jesse  had been mighty in battle and had won  many laurels therefore the voice of the  land had called him to be king and bade him dwell under the shadow of the capitol all the chiefs and patriarchs of the athenian republic escorted in triumphal procession from the borders of their domain ulysses first to the banqueting house of st james then did they bring him to the hall of the lawgivers and present him to the sanhedrim after the usual salutations and handshakings this great warrior and ruler of the people did make as is his custom a lengthy oration in praise of the purity and incorruptibility of the legislators and detectives of this noble branch of the republic after imbibing a glass of cochituate water and feeling refreshed he left the jewell of the house and was drawn by six horses to the point where he was to inspect the chief butler and six thousand of his copatriots in arms now permission had been granted to this ulysses son of jesse to be one at the jubilee for he had said let us have peace therefore upon the second day of this memorable occasion did the chief ruler appear music was in his sole but he had little ear so he sat unmoved until the heavy tones of the anvil chorus compelled him to beat a retreat then did ulysses retire to his tent enjoying the calumet of peace surrounded by his worshipful subjects thus did the second days performance end in smoke chapter vi the sun rose most gloriously on the morning of the third days performance such crowds did press against the coliseum that had it been built of ordinary  stuff the house would have fallen in fragments no standing up or outside seats could  be procured though some of the hubites and representatives of other tribes did offer their gold and silver in large sums for the great privilege of entering within the musical arena new bedfordites were compelled to  return to their whales for the elephant they could not see though some more brave than their brethren did wait over for the next days chance multitudes went away sorrowing because they could not hear the chorus with anvils while others wept profoundly because they couldnt get hail columbia truly was this a great day among the hubites and to the inhabitants of pigville more so for bunker hill with its battle memories did cause many troops to shoulder their muskets and many fifers and drummers to turn out their toes the dwellers of pigville and the coasts thereof the men women and children of the commonwealth besides the incomers from foreign ports all that could not squeeze into the coliseum did gather to make festive the scene and celebrate an anniversary of the battle of bunker hill the big organ the peculiar pride of the hubites did peal forth its strains of patriotism and almost deafened the rural sightseers who sat within old music hall with eyes and ears wide open to catch their moneys worth the booming of cannon the ringing of bells the parade of troops the exhibition of doubleheaded woman and fivefooted cattle the baby show the grinding of handorgans and monkeys the display of humpty dumpty and lingard added to the effective performances of the third days jubilee but the ball did not fully open until the shades of night were falling fast i at midnight in st james park merrily sped the hours round the colseum all was dark within how bright the flowrs in crowds they came the brave the fair eager to dance and sing eager to drive away dull care so light upon the wing ii they danced the gay ones long and well until the dawn of day they flirted much but dared not tell the love that would hold sway gil more the hero of queen hearts did gain so much encore if others failed he played his parts so all could him adore iii all hailed the glorious jubilee of peace throughout the land all cheered the noble gil more and his most perfect band from all glad hearts and voices went forth one hymn of praise which swelled the mighty choruses all through the festal days chapter vii many poor unfortunates who were unable to gain access to the coliseum on the third day tossed restlessly upon their couches and in their midnight visions rising to secure their longedfor standing seats found their hopes dashed themselves selves floored and their chorus a miserere how gladly did the hubites who had failed as yet to get any of the jubilee and the remnant of other tribes greet the first rays of the fourth days morning light how quickly did they clothe themselves and with what energy and enthusiasm did they rush to the breakfast rooms for baked beans and brown bread after hours of waiting being too full for utterance they went forth to st joachims to spend a dollar while strangers and foreigners were tramping about the hub feasting their eyes upon faneuil hall the old state hose joys building the brewer fountain ether monument saloms bazaar and houghtons all the choristers of country towns who had so faithfully drilled their little bands to the classical airs of captain jinks up in our balloon and on the beach at long branch gathered at the coliseum to rehearse unitedly the grand symphonies of beat hoven meddle some and hand well and it came to pass that forty thousand souls were crowded in the great audienceroom that day at the third hour to see and to be seen to hear and to be heard in the midst of the vast assembly were many of the nations lawgivers and capitolmen upon the luxurious sofas of green sat the defiant sumner the conscientious wilson banks the general claflin the governor and peabody the banker now upon this day gil more refused to give the people the great chorus with anvils notwithstanding many voices from the balconies above and the parquette below did vehemently insist upon having this striking music now the performances being ended with the hallelujah chorus the people walked to and fro examining the numerous paintings devices mottoes and general eral decorations and as they passed through the corridors of the audienceroom into the outer saloons they did all cast one last fond look behind at the angel of peace all the wealthy races having spare change did invest in blackwalnut medallions purchasing those with such faces carved thereon as would bring vividly to mind the head singers and players chapter viii now it was a wellestablished fact all through the universe that the hubites had the best institutions of learning pro bono publico that could be found in the heavens above the earth beneath or the waters under the earth this fifth day of jubilee was to furnish practical proof to the amusementseekers that the little sons and daughters of athens trudging up the hill of science could turn aside and make such melody within the coliseum as the heathen from new jersey had never heard so it came to pass that ten thousand little dears gathered at st james park and with merry voices did shout hail columbia most affectingly let it be here recorded that the fond fathers and mothers were not backward in coming forward to listen to the bold voices of their little toms dicks and harrys and to see the effect of white dresses and roman sashes upon minnie jessie and clara who were to occupy the front seats moreover let it be said that the juvenile world had never experienced such crimping curling and frizzing of albino locks and those children who evinced no such barberous treatment had met with hairbreadth escapes the fifth day waxed warmer than the preceding ones and the little hubites singing their melting lays would have grown beautifully less had not an ice berg been before them the oldest and most aristocratic families of athens enjoyed the music as well as the learning of the schools and were compelled to admit that public institutions could bring forth as much knowledge as much poetry and song as their favorite chester park park street or hall of chauncey schools the wealthy the proud the royalborn natives did say let us join hands with our brethren poorer more humble but of respectable parentage and cause our realm to be more democratic let one important fact be here chronicled namely that on of the most distinguished athenian dames renowned for her patriotism and philanthropy her good words and works was invited to the entire weeks jubilee without paying a cent also one venerable mason free in deed if not in name was requested to be present on the same terms let the names of lowell mason and mrs harrison gray otis with those of washington and lincoln long live in the hearts of our countrymen finis the chronicles of st jubilo are ended if facts have been omitted which should have been recorded let other saints take up their quills and complete these imperfect chapters as for the hub may its shadow never be less nor its handorgans and monkeys more numerous the last words of jubilo are let us have peace the haunted schoolhouse at newburyport mass haunted schoolhouse  loring publisher cor washngton and bromfield streets boston     entered according to act of congress in the year  by a k loring in the office of the librarian of congress at washington   rockwell  churchill printers and stereotyper  washington street boston   the haunted schoolhouse   there have occurred in the last decade few things that have created more surprise and curiosity than the strange phenomena now in existence in newhuryport mass we propose to detail them giving the sifted and investigated testimony of those most concerned without heightening or lowering the colors of the stories there are few matters relating to supernatural appearances of which one can write tem perately or fairly so strongly does the love of the marvellous or the hatred of sham enter into the composition of the mind it is hard to preserve an equable tone and to keep a pen in the proper course but the present writer feels that extraordinary care is necessary in this case for the matter has become so widely known that to depart into the regions of romance would ensure instant detection while to write reservedly would be doing a clear injustice to the  astonishing facts it would seem then that at last we have c a veritable ghost  a pure and unquestion  able visitor of semispiritual material it  has appeared at various times in a small a schoolhouse in charles street in new a burypert and the evidence regarding it is too lucid and consistent to be passed by o perhaps the history of these manifesta b tions would be more intelligible if we be s gan at the beginning and detailed the first tl of the troubles and carefully described the o premises where they occurred    ef   the locality e  the schoolhouse in question is situated a on charles street in this fine old city and  is an ordinary onestory building raised a upon a threefoot underpinning it has a e pitch roof four windows upon each side r and its entrance door looks upon the street it stands nearly east and west it is drab  in color with green blinds and it is not in the very best condition outwardly the doorposts are soiled the weatherboards are covered with all sorts of scratches and cuts similar to those that every other schoolhouse is marked with and about the bare yard and the broken fences and the homely building itself there is a sombre dreariness that oppresses the beholder and makes him more willing to listen to the j strange tales that are told of the place the cut that is herewith given of the schoolhouse is accurate though no artists hand could represent the weird and un canny appearance of the structure that the eye perceives after the ear has been fed with the halfscared stories of the teacher and her pupils of the things they have seen and heard the neighborhood is a neat and quiet one the surrounding houses are well built generally white and mostly of good style a little further down the street is the james cotton mill the perpetual whir of whose thirty thousand spindles keeps up an eternal monotone that penetrates even     to the schoolroom and perhaps is a pleas ant conpanionship for the distressed young pupils within it as one goes up the halfadozen stone steps and enters the battered and sun cracked door he comes upon an entry marked  in the plan it is close and stuffy and has that old familiar scent of southern pine that haunts the nostrils of those who have ever attended a public school directly opposite the door is a partition window which looks in upon the school room  in the plan its panes are    x  inches in size and twenty in num ber the sash is stationary the mouldings are light the glass is of medium thickness and there is nothing peculiar whatever about this very important feature in the building it is at this bare commonplace and uninteresting window that some of the most startling appearances have taken place to the right hand are two pairs of stairs one leading to the cellar below   where the coal is stored and the other to the garret above they are both encased with sheathing and both have doors fastened with latches and the cellardoor has in addition a strong bolt which may be thrown threequarters of an inch at either end of the entry is another window similar to the one described and at either end of the partition is a door of light deal painted brown and which leads into the schoolroom around the entry are two rows of stout iron hooks used by the pupils to hang their outer garments upon   we now look into the schoolroom it is sixty feet long forty feet wide and perhaps twenty feet high it is one of the most dispiriting and unhappy apartments that children ever got into its furniture is oldfashioned uncomfortable and in bad condition the walls are old dusty and cracked the windows are grimmy and the floor is chipped and ingrained with dust everything the chairs desks wainscot ings and all have become so permeated   with the bad air that arises in an over crowded school that even when the pupils have been dismissed and the room is open to the outer atmosphere the halfstfling scent troubles the breath the apartment is lighted by three win dows on either side and by two at the rear end upon the walls are three or four coltons maps torn at the edges soiled wkth dust and with a general decrepitude in all of their parts there are seats for about sixty scholars and absurd and ridicu lous seats they are from the front of one boys desk there projects a narrow ledge which forms the seat for the lad in front of hiff and so on these seats are arranged as is usual  in longitudinal rows  and they face the window in the partition the teacher sits beside a door leading to the entry and her desk and a few chairs for visitors are designated by the number g there is nothing at all pecu liar about the room there are no niches to give echoes there are no mirrors to refract the light there are no closets where one could be secreted and there are no objects near enough to the windows outside to cast shadows within all is plain even to meanness and bare to a fault it is nearly the last place in the world that one would point out as being a spot where a ghostwould walk or where spirits would take up their abode it has no particular history it was built for a schoolhouse originally and it was moved to the present spot from another place but the site had always been bare there has never been a man sion here that has had legends and old horrors connected with it no tragedy has ever been perpetrated as far as known in   i this vicinity affairs have gone peacefully on and all attempts to connect the  haunt ing with some oldtime event have been unsuccessful to be sure several rumors of a violent death have gone the rounds of the excited community but there is hardly any ground for belief that those circum stances have anything in common with these many people tell the story that a poor boy of thirteen years was flogged so savagely by a brutal schoolmaster in this very building fifteen years ago that his death ensued in several days after the beating this is not well authenticated though one is tempted to believe it even on the imperfect evidence when the true ghost is described here is the boy the picture of death in his face the evident preparation for burial and the motive for his reappearance who would not try to think that there might be some connection between those old terrible facts and these present terrible ones tie school the school is a primary one for boys those who attend it are the children of people of the humbler sort they being sons of milloperators or of fishermen or of tradesmen the smallest of them is very small being so brief in stature that his white head does not rise far above the level of his liliputian desk while the largest is a strong intelligent and wideawake boy of thirteen or fourteen years of age under different circumstances there could be nothing more amusing than the appearance of these boys at study their dresses are made up of all sorts of colors and patterns and are eked out with patches and strings the childrens features ale rather homnely     though a certain ruggedness of health is apparent in them when they study they study furiously rubbing their fat hands up and down their knees bending their bodies backwards and forwards and nodding their dishevelled heads up and down when they recite they tramp noisily out and stand in an uneven row and cry out their answers with a fierceness and shrillness that enable one to hear them at the further end of the street the assemblage of anxious and furtive faces that has now replaced the assemblage of childlike and happy ones impresses the  observer very painfully there is a certain air of watchfulness a certain habit of starting and turning quickly a disposition to shrink and to cry out that touches the heart of those who are permitted to go into the schoolroom it is curious to see them try to fix their attention on their stained and dogeared books after some of the disturbances have taken place and have been calmed for a while they bend down their heads and put up their hands to their temples and seem  to try to shut out the sights and sounds and to hide away from the scene some of the larger boys have been ques tioned by the writer and he found an almost perfect consistency in their stories and this i quite remarkable in a case where imagination may be made to play so impor tant a part it has been argued that such children cannot be competent witnesses because of their youth and immaturity but it is reasonable to insist that they are more reliable from this very fact in cases like the present one a child who sees some thing strange receives a quick and vivid impression on his fresh mind which cannot be easily disturbed and he only shows his   childishness in attempting to account for it he will stray out of all sense and prob ability in describing the why and where fore but he will detail the evidence of his eyes and ears with an exactness that is astonishing it is in this place then and among these children that there has occurred the remark able and to a certain extent frightful mani festations that are now described the writer attempts no explanation simply for the reason that he has none to give the matter is not explainable it takes its place on the long list of proved but myste rious phenomena and it demands a respect and consideration second to none a recital of the facts arouses a strange sense of fear that pursues the hearer at all hours and in all places until constant attrition with the hard features of the world grad ually wears away his dread there is implanted in every human being an in stinctive attraction towards the super natural and the unknown and if there is in these troubles anything that may renew a general interest in matters of this kind and awaken fresh inquiry then it will not be regretted that this uncanny tale has been told early troubles as long ago as  it is now remem bered a few people became cognizant of disturbances in the charlesstreet school it was reported in a narrow  circle that various unaccountable sounds and acts had taken place from time to time within the building but the matter attained no prom inence in the community partly on account of the rather common character of the troubles and partly because the teachers   ilo s  m    a d a and the school committee were interested for plain reasons in keeping the affairs secret or in making light of them it is now known that the two teachers who were there previous t j the present incumbent were forced to throw up their charge for the real reason that their lives were made miserable by the constant intrusion and doings of a power that they could not see nor feel but of which they had a nervous dread it was not something that they could  mark or scold or whip it did not come at stated times it could not be expected it could not be met or hunted down or destroyed it was something in the air something malignant yet in tangible it rushed in at prayers it was present at recitations it came while the school was busy and while it was silent and it beset it with so many plagues and annoyances that the teachers one after the other retired from thelunwholesome place and finally a oraver and a more enduring woman stepped into the breach end there she yet remains in spite of all and this l all is a great del there is hardly a phase of spiritual mani festations that has not been exhibited in this lacklcss spotand some of theme have been startlingly novel in their character there are two or three that arouse as great a sense of fear and awe in the mind as the ghost itself and so wild are they that one asks in reading of them what awful mean ing lies behind all this let us begin with some of the simplest troubles and trace them up gradually to their highest forms they are not startling they consist of the ordinary knocking and pounding that every oneis familiar with but which alas   for human ignorance are yet perfectly mysterious their cause is unknown no one can tell why in response to a question a resounding blow is delivered close to ones person or why in response to another question two blows are delivered this is the a b c of such things it is said well that is true but are you not wholly powerless to account for these trifles these coarse incidents you must say yes for a very long time this schoolhouse has been alive with a strange power that made these knocks now in the silence of the morning hou when the faithful teacher and her little brood of children are uttering their morning prayers and there is nothing to be heard save the low murmur of their voices there comes upon the floor a thun dering blow that causes every anxious head to fly up and every ear to listen for another and yet another now it comes upon the wall now it comes upon the teachers desk now it beats upon the wainscoting how upon the windows and now upon the ceiling sometimes the blows are sharp and quick and sometimes they are dull and slow they do not wait upon time they come at all hours at all minutes they cannot be evaded they attack the place at any point or at all points at once on one occasion these sounds were so rapid and powerful that the teacher could not hear her boys recite their lessons one lad was spelling the word cannot he pronounced the letters can but the noise which had been going on for a long while suddenly increased and his voice was completely drowned the teacher saw his lips move but she heard nothing his thin tones were overcome by this uproar he was outshouted by this incompre     hensible influence these raps come upon the stairs that lead to the garret and upon the walls of the entry sometimes they are soft as if made with the palm of a light hand and again they are so heavy as to resemble the blows of a sledgehammer these are the simplest and most com mon of these famous troubles and yet who can say where the cause lies the present teacher to calm her children and to quiet their fears cried rats frost  wind at first but she has long since quitted that expedient and is obliged to acknowledge herself at fault a little while ago a series of raps was administerede in the middle of the after noon upon the outer door a the teacher deceived by their naturalness went to admit the expected visitor there was no one there she closed the door and locked it the raps were instantly repeated she made haste and looked out again but she found no one she again closed the door and pretended to throw the bolt by rattling the key again the knocks came im perative and commanding close to her ear she pulled the door open instantly for the third time no one there she looked out she saw a boy at a pump forty yards off she demanded angrily why have you been knocking at the door he denied having done so but he said that he had heard the blows three times and he had stopped to listen he was innocent of any hand in them and the teacher retired perplexed and nervous another ftuitful cause of annoyance is the inability to keep the pupils garments on the hooks in the entry a mischievous hand throws them  down upon the floor   the corridor is often paved with the caps and mufflers and the little patched coats of the children they are hung carefully up again but again they are dashed down with spiteful energy and they are permitted to lie there in the stairway leading to the garret it is customary to hang the dustpans and brushes but it is also customary for this influence to unhang them they are thrown down against the door with a noisy clatter this happens over and over again not ten days agro a visitor to the schoolhouse made a special test of this trifling matter he replaced the brushes and pans securely upon their hooks but they were instantly dashed down about his feet and all subsequent attempts to keep things in order were as fruitless as the first in the schoolroom in the open space in front of the pupils desks is a tubular stove of small size which has a cover which may be raised by a wire handle this handle is at times seized as if by in visible fingers and raised upright and the cover is lifted bodily several inches above the burning coals and after keeping its midair position for some minutes it is lowered again and restored to its place the janitor of the building a man ordi narily courageous  has lately declined going  into the schoolhouse unaccom panied to build his fires in the morning he says that the noises and disturbances are too much for him au i he vraits until some one comes along who will keep him company he often finds the stove moved from its position the utensils scattered in various places and the fuel disarranged in the schoolhouse the  long funnel   which overhangs the desks of the pupils often shakes to and fro as if it were about to fall it grates and creaks upon its wire hooks and so violently has it swayed at times that the teacher has caused the chil dren to leave their seats for fear that it would fall upon their heads upon the teachers desk there are two bells one smaller than the other fre quently the lighter is seized by the unseen power raised from the ledge where it usually rests and violently rung before the astonished eyes of the scholars one day  last october this bell played a part in whicht a certain amount of humor was dis played early in the morning that is at a quarter to nine the boys who were playing soldier with sticks in the yard heard this bell ring they ran to the door of the building but they found it locked there was no one within the janitor had built his fire and had long since gone away still the bell rang sharply and loudly they looked up the street and they beheld the teacher coming down she had just arrived they entered the schoolroom in a breathless and timid body nothing was disturbed everything was in its place the fire was burning brightly and both of the bells were on the desk presently the city clocks struck nine and then the school formally assembled it is said that this imitation of the familiar jangle of the bell aroused the pupils fears more than any of the more noisy manifestations and an appearancesof being cowed haunted them for a long time after the schoolroom is ventilated by means of a circular hole in the ceiling which is closed with a wooden valve which may be j raised or lowered at will by means of a   cord which descends from the garret  it is a trick of the brogue to shut this valve when it is required to be open and to open it when it is shut it is found that it takes a weight of six pounds to lift the cover when the room is too close and the air too impure the teacher seizes the cord and pulls it down by this means the ventila tor is opened now there comes this con trary spirit and endeavors to press it back again it pulls and jerks the cord until it seems on the point of breaking on sev eral occasions the string  has become loosened and the valve has closed with great violence at other times it flies up and down with great persistency creating much annoyance one day the teacher knotted the cord to prevent it from slip ping and the efforts made to free it by the  influence were vigorous the cord snapped and strained but it was too strong to give and the attempts presently ceased another phase of these troubles is the mysterious opening and closing of doors any door in the building is likely to swing noiselessly open with more or less rapidity and in some cases to resist all available power to close it again many times has the teacher summoned some of the largest of her pupils to help her shut a door that has just opened silently of its own accord and many times has the power proved too strong for them they would push and pull with all their might against a door apparently swinging on  its hinges but without the slightest effect when the door got ready to shut it would do it of its own accord and not in consequence of force it will be seen on looking atthe plan that five doors open upon the corri     dor one day in november the teacher heard the door leading to the garret swing back she passed out into the entry to close it no sooner had she done so than two more doors opened she closed the first and the second when all of them opened she shut one after the other but her efforts were fruitless her work was undone before she had hardly performed it she hastened with all possible speed from one to the other but in vain the mysterious power trickily followed behind her and mocked her she struggled for ten minutes it will be remembered that the door leading to the cellar has a bolt upon it on shutting this door finally the plucky teacher tired and out of breath pushed the bolt into its socket and turned it around so that its handle fell into the slot now mark  this handle was seized the bolt righted and pulled back with a visible effort and the door was thrown angrily against a hathook behind it and a deep indentation was made in the soft pine to quote a remark made on this incident in a recent publication this act seems very clearly to involve an intelligence plus the force  and it is deemed that here is a plain combination of something analogous to a human brain with something analo gous to human power hgiier orders of troubles all the incidents that have been de scribed are  not perhaps uncommon they are of a low grade in the classes of spiritual manifestations and perhaps in themselves would attract little more tlan local attention but we have yet to chroni cle the real disturbances and to describe a series of manifeystatioun that are not infe    rior to the highest that have ever been known effect upon the pupils it is natural to ask how it is that the school has been held together through so much that is frightful the best reply is because the teacher has by remaining at her hard post  which must be a very pil lory  set an example that her pupils can but follow she invented excuses to calm them until their wits persuaded them that rats and  frost and  wind  had but little to do with all their scares and then when they began to recognize that they were encompassed by a mysterious and aggressive power they looked to her for a pattern of fortitude and courage and they found it she stood by the school and so did they the teacher now that we are compelled to bring the teacher prominently upon the stage it is necessary that she should be described her name is lucy a perkins she is twentythree years of age strongly framed and full of vigor and strength she is of medium height and has pleasant features her hair is black her skin brown her mouth small and somewhat sensitiveand her eyes dark and liquid she impresses one as being a decided materialist and not a person to be impressed with conceits and imaginings  her evidence in all these matters is singularly lucid and consistent she declares that she is not a spiritualist and that she is not a medium she pro fesses an entire ignorance of the methods and literature of this class of believers she properly considers herself an historian   and not a cause or an expositor of the scenes which she witnesses perhaps a close observer might detect a certain weariness and lassitude in her manner but her  staying  power must really be strong to enable her to encounter day after day the distressing peculiarities of her posi tion she has taught in this building for two years and it is hard to fancy how a woman could pass through such an ordeal and still preserve so much of her elasticity and strength miss perkins has not yielded to the conviction that she was surrounded by mysterious powers without a hard struggle she has tried all means to con vince herself as well as her pupils that some ingenious human trichkery undeic es all this agitation but it is hardly necessary to say that she signally failed upon reading what is written hereafter one cannot wonder that she did fail for more weird singular and alarming man ifestations never haunted the most favored of german castles than have shown them selves in this simple and homely american schoolhouse we   now detail one or two of the higher order of appearances the light at times the whole schoolroom has been illuminated while the school has been in session by a strong yellow glow which on dark days has proceeded from the entry and entered through the partition win dow in the midst of storms when the sky is heavily overcast and the school is almost lost in gloom and obscurity a soft and equal radiance has stolen over the scene and lighted up the furthest corner of the j   apartment this is nothingthat can be ignored and treated with brave indiffer ence over the fices of the pupils who have put aside their books on account of the darkness there suddenly begins to creep this terrible light it has no cen tral point there is no flame anywhere there is no brilliant burning focus it is an illuminated exhalation arising from no one knows what and shedding its rays into the petrified and astonished visages of the children outside all is tempestu ous black and howling within all is cahnlm vivid and silent an examination of the entry reveals nothing the light springs from nowhere in particular but from everywhere one can see the most distant corners all is revealed and brought out plainly after half an hour perhaps this light begins to fade away it withdraws gradually and slowly it is extinguished withthe same tardiness that marked its coming and the honest daylight  or rather the honest gloom resumes its sway what does this mean where is the natural cause or the unnatural cause what does it portend or what does it hinge upon is it a sequence of anything or is it forerunner of something that strange thing that comes with a roar and a clatter one may endure with comparative courage   the tumult dis tracts him from the real contemplation of the milracle but it is when a mystery dawns slowly and silently upon the senses that fear has time to develop and to possess the tremendous awfulness of silence helps the infliction and the heart flutters and the flesh trembles and the hair rises before its time       but there is still another manifesta tion for want of a better word that is equal with this one in its boldness the wind the schoolhouse is often attacked by powerful currents of air that arise sud denly at times even when the atmosphere is entirely at rest this phenomenon is in this respect a complete contrast to the one just described in that calmness and light are placed in distinct opposition to the state of nature while in this tempest and agitation take place while the outside is calm and plea sant on various occasions the pupils have declared themselves unable to study be cause something was going round and round over their heads an examination has revealed the fact that a current of air was circling about the room with great ra pidity while there was no apparent motive for the agitation these circles of air seemed to gather slowly in towards the open ventilator and then to be swallowed up in it as in a  vortex an act which was no sooner accomplished than the vor tex belched the air out again when it recommenced its rotary motions though with a reverse tendency that is the circles grew  larger and larger until they encompassed the entire  ceiling this motion is accompanied with a loud whir ring noise which resembles that of a flight of birds there is often seen in the ven tilator or just below it a black ball ten or twelve inches in diameter which is tossed up and down and whirled about like a boys top a   more dramatic feature of the wind   a trouble is this at times there seems to arise a great storm outside vast billows of air appear to rush upon the building and to sweep about it with all the vigor of a tempest the blinds creak the joists rack the eaves moan the chimney becomes an organpipe and there are all the sounds of a hurricane cold fans of wind shoot in at all the crevices and there is an undertone of rustling beneath the coarser sounds at such hours as these there is nothing to be done study cannot go forward classes cannot be heard wonder begets wonder and the threescore of children pause and gaze at each other in helpless astonishment sometimes miss perkins bids them sing to drive away their disturbing fancies and they break out with their highpitched unmusical voices into here we stand hand in hand a or the  farmers boy  and shrink into the air with a scared vigor that con tains not a little that is pathetic what could be more striking than the picture of this school of infants surrounded and ter rifled by something they cannot under stand trying to drive away their dread by shouting their childish rhymes at the tops of their voices they throw  back their heads open their lips wide and look hastily from one side to the other mean while emitting a shrill discordant treble that contains but the faintest semblance of a tune and what a use to put a tune to i cromwells songs or the piping at luck now or the pilgrims hymn provokes in us when we hear of them much the same sensations that we feel when we hear of this extraordinary music it is theatrical   and sad at the same moment and yet it is not without a small touch of humor amid ones surprise and distress at the spectacle there lurks a sense of amuse ment but it is quickly banished never to be revived this song is a song to the point it has a right to be but it awakes in one a sense of anger that it need ever be sung that the urchins are permitted to enter a place where they are driven to such expedients to preserve their courage now one half of the incidents of the less important sorts that have taken place in this singular arena have not been hinted at they comprise nearly the whole list as it has once been said but they so closely resemble manifestations that are very familiar to every one it is not thought necessary to take time and space to enu merate them the present writer has selected a few of the simpler and a few of the rarer phases and detailed them for the purpose of leading up properly to what now follows the remainder of the paper will pe almost entirely devoted to a descrip tion of the apparitions that have presented themselves to the schoolhouse up to the i first of november of the present year the i disturbances had steadily increased in num ber and significance until they had attained  such magnitude that the public began to be f aroused  to the consideration of the t case the school at this time was nearly full i it having an average attendance of fifty o five pupils though two or three of the b children had been withdrawn temporarily  on account of the troubles      a the hand about three weeks before this date the   is first intimation of ghostly appearances was v had on one afternoon at about three e oclock a boy named lydston a lad of i thirteen years of age suddenly saw pressed o flat against a pane of the second row in e the partition window a childs hand s  it was yellowishwhite in color entirely e bloodless and its fingers were spread wide  apart below the hand was to be seen a h portion of the wrist receding into the backgrpund as though its possessor had e leaned forward e  before lydston had time to make an  outcry two or three of his companions had  seen it and all together they called to miss k perkins she at once hastened into the t entry an act that consumed but two or  three seconds and found no one there the doors were all closed and the outer one was locked securely no one had been r in the entry and no one had gone out of it this simple appearance created but little stir in the school for it was so entirely fresh a manifestation that all were quite willing to believe that it might possibly have resulted from natural causes or been in some indefinite way a deception let it be remarked here that it is the easiest thing in the world to exclaim it was   something or other that youw thought you saw it or  it was some boy playing a trick upon you but it is far more reasonable to believe in ghosts at once than to attempt to quench testimony by such means it would be more miracu  lous for a person to produce these appear   ances and to escape undetected than it  would be for the most evanescent spirit to   lend its presence upon the earth after the first appearance others of the     same ilk followed rapidly the hand re appeared and it was again seen it took the same position nearly always it be came familiar to the pupils eyes but it by no means became familiar to their hearts they always shrank when they saw it they scream today theres the hand theres the hand with as much ter ror and emphasis as they did on its first appearance there was now a ghost the eye now realized something and this sense is the chief vehicle of dread when there was something to be seen then there was some thing to be afraid of the evidence of the ear was a great deal but the evidence of the eye was proof a week previous to the st of november matters took another step on that day one of the children exclaimed with up raised hand theres a boy looking in at the win dow  the teacher came there was no mis take the children all saw it the face was pale and it was that of a young boy it was pressed sideways against the sash and its eyes were turned inwards towards the schoolroom its right hand was raised to its temples as if to shut out the refracted light its position was natural and easy it was plain distinct and un equivocal the teacher ran at her utmost speed into the entry there were the same bare walls the same  damp musty air but nothing more there was no shadow no i figure no presence of any kind as  before the doors were closed tightly and t all was silent and quiet miss perkins was naturally led from the t   i character of the apparition to make an extraordinary search for some interloper she took especial care to leave no places unexamined she ascended for the twenti eth time into the garret sehe hunted for the twentieth time in the cellar nothing that could throw the least light upon the matter was found the school turned out en masse and penetrated every nook and cranny and then reassembled empty handed but filled with consternation it is to be supposed that each child car ried at once to his home accounts more or less exaggerated of this appearance but even partially aroused as the commnunity was this fresh contribution to the stock f wonders created but little new excitement there was a disposition to doubt to wait a while to look further and so the school went on when it should have been closed at once                 on nearly every day between this date and the beginning of the next month the hand or the face appeared at the window at times a portion of the arm would also be visible it was thin shrunken and of the same deathlike hue that characterized the face the noises continued meanwhile there was hardly any cessation to the knocks upon the walls or of the dis turbauce of  the furniture the old troubles continued with the new and there seemed to be a slow accumulation going on the school the pupils and the teacher were now in a perturbed condition they were keenly alive to all that passed though they did their utmost to continue their tasks all were alert and sensitive such was the condition of matters on that day when the disturbance came to a   climax or if not to a climax at least to a point far above anyyet attained a few of the younger pupils had been withdrawn by their parents but the older and larger ones yet remained miss perkins was in her usual health and also as fully possessed of courage as ever the weather on the first of november was unpleasant the at mosphere was full of moisture the clouds were lowering and the temperature was low the thermometer sinking to  fahrenheit i   what took place on that day will now be described with the utmost care and accuracy and with as much minuteness as possible the ghost at a few minutes before three oclock on   that afternoon a class in geography was called upon the floor to give its recitation it took its place on the southern side of the room in such a way that it stood at a right angle to the partitionwindow the teach ers desk was opposite it it was com posed of eight or ten lads of various ages comprising some of the oldest iil the school the recitation began and it had proceeded five minutes when the boy who was at the head of the class and who was standing beside the southern door which   led into the entry and which was pen suddenly cried out with a startled voice theres a boy out there miss perkins left her place instantly hurried across the room to the open door passed through it and emerged upon the     corridor at the further end of it she indeed beheld an intruder she addressed some hasty and impatient expression to it and hastened towards it with the intent of ejecting it from the building she received no reply it retreated to the corner opposite the foot of the garret stairs and there it stood quietly miss perkins approached it stood facing her with its arms loosely held together and the left hand partially extended miss perkins approached within four feet of the apparition when a realization of its true character rushed upon her she stopped overwhelmed with fear and gazed into its face the figure was that of a boy of thirteen the visage was remarkably pale the eyes were blue the mouth sad and the whole effect was that of extreme melancholy the general picture s that of a child prepared for burial and prepared more over in a poor and makeshift way the clothing was brown and somewhat faded and rubbed the trowsers were black and they seemed to have belonged to a taller person for they were much wrinkled and creased and they rested about the feet in such a way that miss perkins was almost unable to see the extremities about his neck was a wide stocklike band such as is used to keep the lower jaw of deceased persons in their places his hair was of a yellowish tint and it was thrown back in some disorder over the head and was clipped behind in such a way that the neck was left bare the fgure was very slight and it was easily and even beautifully posed there was no excitement or perturbation visible in   its behavior it seemed entirely calm and tranquil miss perkins was able to look through this figure and tc perceive the wainscoting and the sash on the other side it was transparent yet it was entirely visible its outline was perfect its surfaces retained all their integrity yet the film was so scant that it seemed that a breath could disperse it miss perkins transfixed with horror and about to faint grasped at the wall to sup port herself at this instant the figure moved it passed before the teacher and with its eyes still fixed upon her glided to the garret door which opened apparently of its own accord it then began to ascend the stairs the teacher aroused herself and followed it it preceded her halfadozen steps and it looked back over its shoulder apparently watching her its countenance began to grow even more sad than ever and the color of its clothing began to give way to a  whitish tinge midway up the ascent miss perkins stumbled over some brushes which lay upon the stairs and when she recovered her footing the apparition had gained the top of the flight and was pausing and look ing down at her it required a pretty high order of cour age in the teacher to pursue this figure into the gloomy and solitary garret she was now sure that it was not a thing of sub stance and there could be few more terrify ing trials than to enter iato personal con tact with the unknown yet she might be mistaken she thought she might have been so influenced in some subtile way by the previous appearances that she had mls   judged this one she went on the fig ure waited for her with its immovable eyes she saw it even more plainly against the shadowy background and its true character became proved yet she did not pause with a resolution and bravery that can hardly be surpassed she advlanced with outstretched arms she   closed upon it she endeavored to grasp it her fingers encountered nothing her hands involved themselves in the very cen tre of its chest but they seized air and air alone the figure then began to disappear t sank down it did not retire further or fade out but it melted and fell away the face descended with its eyes fixed perpet ually upon the trembling teacher with an indescribable pathos   in a moment it had vanished entirely there was nothing of it left but its picture in the girls mind she returned half failt ing to her expectant charge the evidence upon this vital point in the long list of supernatural troubles is dis tinct and satisfactory each and all of the children agree with the teacher upon a   technicalities their testimony is strictly uniform for instance the appearance of death in the fiures face its white stock the color of its clothing its semitranspar ency the noiselessness of its movements the expression of its countenance andits attitude are each and all described identi cally there is no fault no discrepancy no hesitation  so far as human testimony may be valuable this is to converse with     the lookerson at this singular spectacle is to be convinced it cannot be a part of this paper to re open the vast field of discussion of spirit nal matters it is designed merely to exhibit in the plainest and most honest light a series of new facts without com ment or judgment it is enough to indi cate that another strange thing has swept upon the stage  the lessons of this thing are yet to be taught and learned on the friday succeeding this most eventful one the apparition made another appearance it was precisely he same as before there was the sad look the mournful appeal the silent motion the wavering dissolution this time it van ished when midway up the stairs whither the teacher had followed it in the interval of this week there had arisen a new feature the garret over head had apparently been peopled with three persons each with a distinct voice and a distinct step the pupils heard tones resembling those of a human being pro ceeding from above them  only now and  then were they distinct one was harsh  and deep another thin and shrill and the  third small and querulous besides the  voices there were numerous sounds  some of them were loud and some soft  some resembled the rolling of cannon balls some the tread of heavy feet some the e loud and repeated blows of a hammer c one day the sounds represented to the s people below this sequence a box was t set heavily upon the floor two persons s hovered over it talking together in low s voices a cover was seized and fitted on s then a voice said         d dn it wheres my hammer   i   s  it was apparently found for the adjust ment of the cover was proceeded with  nail after nail was driven in with great  vigor and presently the hammer was put  down then the box was seized by the t two persons one before and the other behind and it was partially lifted and partially pushed across the floor the per s son in front took decided steps the person behind shuffled as if his motions were im peded all who heard these sounds recognized r the acts they represented nothing could surpass their fidelity on one occasion more recently a voice addressed by name a child in the schoolroom below and asked him if he had got his lesson the sound was distinct and unequivocal on the third friday after the first appear ance of the spectre the school was dis turbed by a sound that aroused afresh all the blase emotions of the inmates this time it was a long low and disagreeable laugh that seemed to come from beside the teachers desk it echoed against the opposite wall and then reechoed there was that in it that petrified all who heard it every motion was suspended the busy hum was stopped every ear was touched and the school seemed to have been stricken with a spell after the noise had ceased the teacher even more afraid of this than the apparition called out to ask who would volunteer to search the garret and the cellar once more the boy lydston promised to go provided she the teacher would accompany him she assented at once and each took a stout stick and for the hundredth time an expe dition was undertaken against the ghosts there was nothing strange in the cellar   there were the coalheap the piles of dusty refuse and the damp and mouldy wallsbut nothing more they ascended into the garret here they walked cau tiously for they felt that they were in the   stronghold of the disturbers no sooner had they gained the floor than they were saluted with a laugh similar to the one they had heard a few minutes before it had the same qualities the same significant im port and the same resonance it appalled them now it came from the right hand now from the left handnow from behind and now from before they turned here and there confused and astounded lydston begant to waver suddenly the teacher perceived the tranquil figure of the   ghostly boy contrasted with the dark background of the wall he was standing in his old position with one hand extended as if asking for something and with the same halferect position of the head this   sight in connection with those sounds sur passed all other effects it aroused all that was sensitive in the spirits of the tw beholders the teacher frenzied with ter ror struck repeatedly at the spectre but it remained intact the cudgel met the brick wall and rebounded harmless at each like attempt the laugh arose with renewed force and the sound reechoed from one wall to another until the attic was alive with the awful sounds it was not in nature that human beings     could face this lydston fled the teacher followed and as they disappeared the laugh ing was renewed and increased as if in jubilation at a victory it is in this last scene that we find com bined most that is earthly and most that is unearthly there were two senses that were fully satisfied two others smelling and tasting are rarely required for proofs therefore only one the sense of touch remained unrewarded by testimony is it possible that we must reject the evidence of two because of the default of one subsequent to the date of the manifesta tion last described the schoolhouse has been the scene of almost continual agita tion it exists this very day as emphati cally as it did three months ago a screen of newspapers which has been tacked against the partitionwindow to hide from the pupils the apparition of the face and hands has been repeatedly rolled down without fracture and there has beaten against the sash a strong hand that seems to threaten destruction to the gluss voices arise mysteriously every day twentyfour hours do not go by without a tumult of some sort or other now the entry seems to be in flames the teacher runs out only to find that all is safe and whole there has been a stout trapdoor placed at the head of the garretstairs and the key is kept by the teacher yet some thing descends them   nearly every day emerges upon the corridor crosses it goes out at the front door then after a short absence it returns reascends the stairs and re enters the attic and then becomes quiet it is the vainest of all vain things to say that there is trickery here it is absolutely   impossible for it to exist hundreds of watches have been set hundredd of skep tics hve interposed their contrary spirits but there is no discovery madeno expos ure consummated no one has undergone a more thorough and rigid crossexamination than miss perkins and no children have been subs jected to more bribes and promises and threats than the urchins of this luckless school it is said that mr oliver wendell holmes has tried his hand at teasing a con fession of trickery from a boy named cur rier with the aid of a dollarbill but he failed mrs southworth and mr william t adams have been  speering round and so has the venerable robert dale owen the phenomena have excited the widest and most curious comment miss perkins has received letters of inquiry from the re motest parts of the country and to admit that one is from newhuryport is to invite an endless series of questions relating to the ghoat the direct effect of the agitation upon the school in question has of course been bad many pupils have now been withdrawn and many others threaten to leave such has been the character of the disturbances that the school committee have been reluc tant to give color to the case by taking notice of it but it is clear that they have delayed too long when it was evident six months ago that the little community was being disturbed by an uncontrollable influ ence the building should have at once been closed and a strict investigation ordered the investigators would have discovered the true state of the case and a remedy could have been easily applied that is the school would have been removed   we shall be much surprised if this ex traordinary case does not at once bring to light the halfobscured spiritual theories that have laid dormant so long the mat ter is distinct and isolated and it is en tirely free from special influences that is there is no deluding romance about it that would make spiritual manifestations seem proper and congenial no one connected with it has mediumistic qualities and it does not seem reasonable that the disciples of any of the dark arts should want to proselyte in a dusty ward schoolroom in closing this brief and faulty paper we feel that we have completed one of the strangest stories that has ever been writ ten it is easy to see what opportunities there have been for dramatic descriptions   and startling elucidations and we compli ment ourselves that we have repressed the natural tendency to make effect it is not often that one is permitted to adopt a sub ject so full of chances to write hard and fine but we are conscious one has scant right to do so where clear and unvarnished evidence is so plainly demanded there are many people to be aroused by ithe reports of incidents like these and each time such an arousal is made just so much further on the oad towards truth have we travielled  the scientists the materialists the i theologues the spiritualists and the comimon people all have an interest here and it is hoped that this printers echo may not be ineffectual to stimulate an inquiry the history of a sewingmachine the hstory sewingmachne the are persons i suppose who think that a sew  ingmachine has neither thoughts feelings desires nor emotions but they are very much mistaken i  for instance remember perfectly my sensations one bright october morning when i was placed for the  first time in a conspicuous position in a long elegant salesroom on broadway i had been finished with great care placed in a hand some case and now stood waiting with palpitating heart for a purchaser to come in and buy me to be sure there were others of mycompanions even hand somer than i dressed in rosewood with silver mount ings and beautful inlaid work while i was only or  rayed in plain black walnut but then i had the  anity to think that i had an appearance of perfect  greatness and great solidity and i knew from the in         spiration within me that all my springs of action were bright and strong and that in the hands of a loving and skilful owner i could accomplish wonders it was about eleven oclock in the forenoon that a lady and gentleman enpercd the store and the moment i saw her i wished that she might become my owner she was young not more than twentytwo or three and had a charming face fair with tender grey eyes and light rippling hair i knew very little difference then between eyes never having seen many but i know that out of hers looked a true gentle womanly squl they looked about at many different machines and his choice would have evidently fallen on one of the more showy ones but at length her eye fell upon me here george said she heres the one i want i like it better than those that are more highly or namented  o nonsense replied her husband for such he afterwards proved to be you know i promised you as nice a one as could be got and i should like you to have one with all the fancy fixings silver and things yes but george you know i dont care for all that ornamental work and i have taken a great fancy to this machinme it looks so nice and good that i feel as if we were friends already how my pulses did throb to hear her sweet lips   say those words i felt that i loved her and could willingly devote my life to her all right puss said mr george sotto voce  have that if you choose i want you to be pleased and sat isfied  that is all but i am making this part of my story too long to my great joy i was bought and that same after noon transferred from my position in the salesroom to a space between the two windows of a cosy sitting room which served also for diningroom and which was the middle one of a neat floor  occupied by my new master and mistress the home was a wellkept substantial brick one in a good but not fashionable street and the family con sisted besides ourselves of a tidy servantgirl whose quarters were where i hoped mine would never bee up in the attic my master was cashier in a bank downtown and his name was harrington so i found dut afterwards of course i did not know it at the time the day after my arrival my mistress or mrs har rington as i may as well call her after dusting me all off carefully with her own hands unlocked my doors and called nora the tidy servant to admire the fin ishing of my interior and all the cunning little fix tures which accompanied me and which the lady de clared with a merry laugh she was sure she shoutd never understand the use of she sat down however     r at once and after several ineffectual attempts suc ceeded in remembering how to threadthe needle and put me in working order she sighed two or three times while doing this and i was afraidbegon al ready to feel weary of her task oh i how longed to be able to tell her of the mistakes she was making and which she had slowly and laboriously to find out and explain to her that a little practice would soon make the work of preparation easy and simple and that then i would spare her delicate fingers all the pain of the interminable stitch stitch stitch and make garments grow under her hands beautiful and perfect as if executed by fairy skill five oclock found her still busily engaged in trying to understand and master the first principles of that curious and beautiful motive power embodied in my self and my associates which has already done so much and is destined to do so much more to relieve the burdens and the weight of drudgery from the shoulders of the fairer portion of creation five oclock was the dinner hour and with it came her husband   what i working away already mary said heo dear mel what a smart wife i have got   no you havent george replied his wife almost tearfully i think i must be excessively stupid for here i have been at work all the afternoon and i dont beginto understand it yet   poor puss i so you expected to learn all that it has  taken six thousand years to find out in one afternoon did you and you have forgotten the motto have patience withyself but never mind it will all come right by and by only you must not try to do too much at a time  be content with learning little by little and  practice will do the rest but do you think you will like your machine  oh i know i shall answered the young wife enthusiastically  with all my want of knowl edge i can see that the fault whatever it is is not  in the machine but in myself and that as soon as i  am thoroughly acquainted with it i shall enjoy it very much indeed  all right youre a brave girl said her husband kissing her now i will tell you what i have done that will please you i have bought tickets for the  opera so hurry norah with the dinner while you i change your dress for the carriage will be here at halfpast seven  oh i you dear good thoughtful darling said b mary throwing a pair of white arms about his neck  tie and bringing her lips intofuspicious proximity with his mustache  the dinner and i will be ready in five minutes  from this time for many months my lifewas a very easy and pleasant one i became verynihsat tached to my mistress and she to me jisehol       cares occupied only a very small portion of her time acd nearly all the rest was divided between attention to her flowers books birds and myself evonings she devoted to her husband to music which pleased him and to the friends who sometimes dropped in upon them  fond of society she yet loved her home and was in all respects the best and most conscientious of young wives three months from the day i first became installed  in the house mary presented her husband with an elegant pair of slippers which she had exquisitely em broidered with my assistance she had now become expert in executing all kinds of sewing and for my part i felt a pleasure in the possession of those qualities which enabled me to be always bright and ready always quick to respond to the deft and graceful movements of her delicate fin gers it was on the occasion of his birthday that the slip pers were presented the breakfasttable was adorned with flowers and fruit and mary had playfully made a garlandand hung it over where i stood in honor of my achievement in the afternoon there was company to see her and several ladies were present who were brought into the sittingroom to see me and the wonders i had per formed well said one of them sewingmachines have           not been of much use to me i have got one i never let my husband have a moments peace till he bought me one and now i dont use it i dont dare to tell him but upon my word it stands there month in and month out and i never touch it  why what is the excuse mrs crawford asked several of the ladies in a breath well it was so much trouble answered the lady there was so much fastening ol threads and ussing at the commencement and  ose of every little seam the ends had to be fastened tand finished it was almost as much trouble as sewing it right straight along then the winding of thread on bob bins every little while and there was always some little thing or other out of order and that had to be fixed before it would work smoothly i must confess i got heartily tired of it how do you manage to make yours work so nicely she said addressing mary my mistress replied that after the frst effort she had had no difficulty  that she considered herself for tunate in the choice of a grover  baker machine which required no winding of thread and which left no ends of thread to fasten but sewed direct from the spools and comp eted each seam itself thus saving not only time trouble and vexation but waste of thread a pretty stylishlooking lady here interposed with      the remark that she had nothing to say against her machine except that it made a very tight inelastic seam which would break when stretched in washing but could not be induced to come out in any other way and that it was a real detriment in making up childrens clothes never to be able to take out tucks or scams without actually cutting the cloth all to pieces to be sure she concluded she did not know much about it herself as her seamstress always oper ated buttshe knew these as two serious faults my mistress proudly exhibited my superiority in these respects by stitching on a piece of cloth show ing the strength elasticity and beauty of the seam the clean secure fastening at the ends without waste and the singular mechanism of the stitch which per mits the seams to be taken out by one who knows the secret but resists all the offorts of one who does not eveh though it were cut in a hundred places this evidence and the beautiful sewing and embroid ery exhibited made all the ladies enthusiastic in my favorand the two before mentioned mrs crawford and pretty mrs lawton announced their intention of   exchanging their machines without delay about this time there was a secret existing in the breast of my mistress of which i alone was the de pository and many were the happy hours we spent together the moment her husband was out of the house she flew to me and i was really afraid she l                               would impair her strength by her untiring attention and assiduity           one after another the daintiest of little garments were completed and laid aside tucked and stitched with the most delicate nicety sacs shawls and a little pair of white mering boots had been embroid ered satisfactorily but the crowning glory of all was to be a white mering cloak embroidered with white silk and lined and quilted as handsomely as if it cost seventyfive dollars in a store the material was bought the pattern selected and i must say i shared the anxiety of my mistress that this should be a chefdcuvre we both put our best effobrts upon it and succeeded splendidly the cloak was equal to the finest that could be procured  and mary was so delighted with the result that she hugged and kissed it and seemed never tired of looking at it   it was this enthusiasm however that betrayed our secret her husband came in before she had time to hide it andsaid why mary what is thisand then a sudden light breaking in upon him he caught her in his arms and said  my dear dear wife why did i not know of this before after that mary was not allowed to occupy herself so steadily as she had done her husband insisted on her taking outdoor exercise he took her out him self procured her all the pleasures possible and every day brought her home fruit and flowers         a few months afterward and a  baby tender  was added to the furniture of the sittingroom and a fat rosy little infant boy with wonderful lungs revolu tionized the quiet habits of the household norah fortunately was very fond of children and took a great deal of care of the baby this relieved my mis tress and allowed her still to devote part of her time to me who during her illness had missed her sadly thus passed a happy year at the end of which time master harry had begun to run alone and showed signs of remarkable intelligence in the eyes of his de lighted father and mother one day mr harrington came home at an earlier hour than usual and gave evidence by his deathly paleness and agitation of intense mental anxiety his wife entreated to know the cause and with somereluc tance he at last told her that an enormous deficit had been discovered in the bank accounts of which he had no knowledge and could not by any means under stand that the matter was undergoing investigation and in the mean time a certain amount of suspicion rested upon him as the responsible person and the one through whose hands all notes passed this occurrence did not trouble mary so much as it did her husband she had such unbounded confidence in his judgment and integrity that she was quite sure the mistake would be rectified and the nus of it transferred to the proper shoulders overwhelming i       therefore were her first feelings of shame disappoint ment and distress when one week afterward her hus band came home dismissed and in disgrace not that any thing had been proved against him but thetrans action could not be cleared up and under the circum stances the company did not feel justified in retaining him in their confidence x and mary said he as he closed the sorrowful story what do you think the sewingmachine is partly to blame for this trouble one of the directors thought appearances were strengthened against me by the elegant clothes that my child was  paraded  in he said no fifteen hundred dollars per year would allow the purchase of magnificently embroidered cloaks ia these times oh i what a shame cried mary indignantly did you not tell him george that h embroidered it all myself on my sewingmachine  no i did not replied her husband i felt too angry too much discouraged at the thought thatall my labors and my efforts had been thrown away and that  i must commence anew or fight for subsistence with a stigma upon my name  x          for many days the unfortunate young man strugglei against the misfortune that had fallen upon him early and late he traversed the city in search of em j ployment but all to no purpose everywhere he was  met by the story which had preceded him of the miss           ing funds and no one was willing to place him in a posi tion of trust on the strength of his previous good character at last under these repeatsd failures under the pressure of anxiety of mind and fatigue of body his health broke down and hewas tconfined to his bed with a disorder which soon developed the worst form of brain fever now all the woman in her nature came out strong in the devoted wife constantly and tenderly she nursed her husband through the danger ous crisis of his illness and then set to work seriously to consider what she should do to assist in tiding over this trying portion of their lives she could not somehow despairof his innocence some time being made apparent and she determined not to succumb without an effort to relieve their adverse circumstan ces withbut consulting her husband who was still very weak and unable to leave his bed she took the beau tiful but obnoxious cloak and went straight to the wife of the director who had made use of it to strengthen the doubts of mr harringtons honesty the lady proved to be a kindhearted intelligent woman who had thoughtlessly repeated to her hus band words which she had heard another person say she immediately becameoextremely interested in the story of the young wife her graceful modest and ladylike manners charmed her and she promised    faithfully to do all she could to forward her object  this was neither more nor less than to obtain fine sew ing and embroidery which she could execute with my aid and in this way with such rapidity as to make it a valuable sourceof revenue the lady alsointimated to her that affairs at the bank were not yet in a satis factory condition that other smaller defalcations had taken place since her husbands dismissal that de tectives were at work and it was not impossible that such discoveries would be made as would exonerate her husband and restore him to his former position mary came home with a heavier bundle but with a lighter heart mrs burgess which was the ladys name had given her at once a blue cashmere morn ing dress and a table and a pianocoverto embroider a package of plainer work was to be sent by a servant but mary was so eager to begin to earn money that she insisted on bringing them home herself how thankful now was i that i could be of use to her what a pleasure it was to send my bright arms and steel fingers up and down and in and out like light ning at her bidding work poured in upon us and our praises were sounded everywhere the beautiful sewing that we accomplished brought high prices com paratively though it was done for less than it could possibly have been done by hand and our receipts supplied the house with all necessaries and paid norahs wages which had been in arrears   the invalid who was now able to walk out for a short distance would sometimes complain of the time spent at the sewingmachine i but mary was sobright and cheerful took such thoughtful care of the comfort of both her husband and child that he could not but let her have her way where do you get all these nice things from mary he would say as he sat down to the tender chop and tempting dish of asparagus she had prepared for him it is a long while since we had any in come and the little money we had must

and the next day h came down stairs evidently determined to know who the goodnatured ravens were that fed him on broileda chops and asparagus mary managed to parry his ques tions for some time but at last his sternness and per sistency overcame her resolution and she burst into tears telling him between her sobs that it was her sewingmachine that had been their good angel that had supplied them with food and all else that was      needed and that she had not told him before fearing thathe would be angry he was not angrybut it was evident that theknowl   edge that his wife had felt obliged to resort to any means to earn money stung him to the quick and the knowledge that came back upon him in full force of the struggle that must be renewed reduced him to a state of despondency that alarmed his wife more than any thing else had done i will tell you said heoone day to her we must emigrate  i can not stay here making ineffec tual attempts to gain employment and be looked upon suspiciously

sported on the village green he possessed those qualities in childhood which endeared him to his companions and as he grew in years his fine sensibilities and amiable feelings secured to him the affections of kindred hearts the smile was on his face and every feature of his countenance bespoke a virtuous and undissembled mind but the first step in the downward progress of intemperance is sometimes taken under circumstances replete with the most promising hopes and the vulture often lights on his prey when least suspected the intoxicating cup allures the idol of the household from the innocent and purifying pleasures of the domestic circle the enemy will take the advantage of unsuspicious minds and watch the opportunity to select his victims for whom he would weave the winding sheet and at his pleasure lay them in turn of death the parents of wendall acted under a true sense of their moral obligations and pressed home upon the attention of their children every lesson of wisdom and virtue under the paternal roof he first heard the wise counsels of a father and felt the influence of a mothers caution and advice all young men are not thus favored and having no parental restraint upon them they have rushed on in the path of ruin at the sacrifice of personal social and domestic blessings until they arc brought to see the result of their course and painfully to reflect that their own misery is selfinflicted it is said and that in truth that among the victims of the fatal bowl are found men possessing warm generous and brave hearts if so then we may write for thousands the melancholy epitaph how are the mighty fallen but there are young men and of the number was our friend w who had the example and the advice of parents relatives and friends which failed to rescue him from the hands of the destroyer there was nothing wanting to render his home pleasant he was nurtured under the sweet and sacred influences of domestic life which bind the members of a family in close and lasting friendship but there are influences withoutand sometimes within the hallowed walls of home which imperceptibly allure the unsuspecting youth and in time blast the most fondly cherished expectations yes the customs of society both among the rich and the poorthe king and the peasant the fashionable and the gaythe young and the old have engendered the most destructive habits to the peace and comfort of manto nil that is noble generous and pure in the bosom of humanity perhaps the parent has put the poisonous chalice to the lips of her lovely boy without the least suspicion that she was forging a dagger for her own bosom and in future years with a heart corroded with grief would be compelled to see her son the sport of the thoughtless and herself the occasion of the bitter lamentation o absalom my sonmy son absalom would god i had died for thee but the mother of w had no cause for reflecting upon herself i have said she was kind and affectionate and sooner than have indulged herself or her family in the use of intoxicating drinks either at home or abroad she would have sacrificed her right hand and yet she lived when the feelings and usages of society were in fellowship with the social glass and indispensable to the life and interest of social gatherings she was a devoted advocate of total abstinence when the people and ministers used a little wine as the sign and seal of friendship the test of hospitalitythe bond of union and a charm from which social meetings was supposed to derive their zest her son received ever and anon her timely advice and in his most miserable hours he never lost sight of the mother he loved the mother loved him he heard her warning voice and heard it too in the admonitions of conscience which the greatest revelings could not stifle but her warnings were given when temperance was not a household word when the wretched enchantment of the bowl was felt m almost every dwelling and the cup of joy went merrily round among a band of brothers when there was no man redeemed from the miserable bondage of drinking that was ready to stand in the midst of the overflowing tide of pollution or breast the force of example in high places and with a heart full of sympathy speak a kind word to an erring brother the mighty river was rolling on and rising higher and threatening desolation to every smiling village and sweeping before it the fairest flowers in community and yet to the praise of a few there was heard in the midst of the whirlwind and the storm the still small voice of womana faithful talisman powerful in its tones which was not uttered in vain she saw what was the inevitable result of regular and fashionable drinkingwhat has been the deathknell of the fondest hopes which a parents bosom could possibly cherish but we must pass on to chapter ii long long be my heart with such memories filled like the vase in which roses have once been distilled you may break you may ruin the vase it you will but the scent of the roses will hang round it still moore when young men arrive to the age of w when he began to acquire habits of intemperance they gradually lose their relish for the pleasures of home they expect to find higher enjoyments from other sources than those under which they have been trained and educated the quiet pastimes of home are forgotten when the young man seeks to gratify his ambition and lofty spirit among the scenes of folly and fashion the young man seeks for enjoyment the goal is before him and on that he fixes his eyeon that his hopes centre but disappointment comes at last and the error of his way is seen in tearsheard in sighs and painfully felt in a broken heart the home of w was still dear to him and his mothers tender care for his welfare was indelibly impressed upon his memory to her he will attribute his first ideas of moral obligationhis sense of what constitutes true excellence in character these were moments in the worst part of ws career when he would commune with himself on childhood days and think over what he once wasand what he then enjoyed when he listened so eagerly to his kind parent as she related some pleasing anecdote or read some useful book alcohol may prepare tenants for the almshouse and the hospital reduce families to the extremity of human misery and urge the young man forward to an early sacrifice of health and life but it cannot take from the poor inebriate the power of reflection when in his sober moments nor quench the flame of filial affection and gratitude which kindles up in his boson at the thought of maternal kindness the ligament of true affection was never surrendered in reality yet the most affectionate son has ventured to trespass on parental wishes and to indulge his own musings and romantic project w was accustomed to spend his evenings at homehappy seasons in his earliest years the family were a family of singers w was a good musician having a natural taste for music he acquired in early life sufficient knowledge of the claronet to play familiar tunes such as were sung by the family circle his presence was indispensable he was the key note on which every voice depended for harmony and correct music but w soon had other engagements and employed his evenings in company whose influence was directly opposite to that under which he had been educated from his infancy the first step was now taken in his wayward course which proved almost fatal to the brightest hopes which ever a parental heart cherished it was easy to forget for a time the tender and faithful advice of parentsthe reproof and warnings of friends when among the companions of an alehouse and at places where the treat was a sign of friendship the temperance revival had not commenced and there were none to rally around him at those places of resort where young men congregate to rescue him from the devouring flames of alcohol the demon was then triumphing over brokenhearted wives and the tears of famishing babes the distiller and the vender were rolling in their illgotten gains and the mass of society were drinking their flagons of wine careing not for the afflictions of joseph but how is it that one who had the greatest reason to be grateful for a kind mother could possibly requite that kindness or forget those filial duties which a parent claims from her son by what means are the dearest ties sundered one of the happiest homes made sad and the cheerful hearts of devoted brothers and sisters caused to weep and lament who would be the cause of separating the family ligament and for the paltry sum of a few dollars tear from the mothers arms her darling boy the ruffian in the fury of his passion will do it and the voice of justice and of injured humanity cries loudly against him and who is he that does no less a violent act though not intentionally only with longer process that supplies the fuel for the selfimmolation of his victim the rumseller knows too well the process by which the young man can be allured from homealienated from the heart which beats with the tenderest feelings for a child and also by what means love virtue friendship and fortune

the thorny way along this vale of sorrow the flowers that shed their leaves today shall droop and dio tomorrow many have learned from painful experience that wine is a mocker and that it cannot be indulged in without creating an appetite for stronger liquor and among the young the virtuous and the fair developing the evil consequences it was there says w i began to wander and it is there the enemy beguiles his prey the temptation is sometimes presented in its most flattering light robed in its most brilliant colors i have seen the spacious saloon lighted up with a multitude of brilliant lampsits walls lined with large and costly mirrors the floor covered with the soft thick velvet carpet and on one side of the room a row of cushioned seats sofas and chairs while the other side is furnished with every sort of intoxicating drinks from the most palatable cordial up to the strongest proof brandy every customer may be suited to his own taste in the rear of the drinking apartment are the large marble tables here the card is shuffledthe dice rattledwhile others have the privilege of passing the evening at the chequerboard here says the young man to his acquaintances as he peeps into the windows or puts his hand upon the knob of the door here is a fine place for amusement every thing is so genteelcome let us go in they enter not suspecting they are entering the road to ruin they are now surrounded by every temptation and the gentility of the circumstances under which the temptation is presented forms a perfect apology for them and an opiate to smother every monition of conscience while looking at the beautiful things around them charmed with the order and beauty and comfort of the room two gentlemen call for something to drink they are business men of respectable standing in societyonly call there never tarry longbusiness of more importance to attend to they drink and pass out why says charles to his companions this is a very fashionable place mr d and mr f have just gone out and they never visit any place which is not respectable come let us take a glass of wine they were now perfectly at home every restraint was broken when they perceived that the place was patronized by respectable winedrinkers the ice was now broken and the principles of total abstinence under which w was educated were now violated gambling was the next step come says a stout welldressed man as he taps the young stranger upon the shoulder come we are just making up a small party at whist suppose you take a seat with us we shall soon be ready just take a seat in the back room and amuse yourself with the papers for a few minutes we have a bottle of excellent madeira supposing you taste of itthis way gentlemen a very polite invitation says w and he appears to be a gentleman says his companion let us go and join the company i never played whist says w i am perfectly ignorant of cards and dice but i have no objections to taking a seat they began to playbut not for money only for amusement it was a sufficient introduction for our young friends who from that time learned to shuffle cards and to throw skillfully the dice the circumstances under which our friend w entered the saloon and sat around the card table and drank of the social bowl are the same under which many other young men have commenced a dishonorable life the potent draught by degrees becomes more pleasant and though not conscious of any evil results at the beginning of drinking yet every draught increase the danger until he young and unsuspecting passes the line of safety and ultimately unless reclaimed falls a captive to misery and crime ah says the slow the moderate drinker i ve not yet reached the fatal point of danger confident of his own strength and exulting in his own liberty and liking the reviving stimulus of a little wine as a beverage he continues to drink until to his utter surprise he reaches the fatal point of danger and yet he drinks again sure that he can stop when he pleases and feels himself insulted when told by a friend that he will come to a drunkards grave o that first glass which passed so freely around among that virtuous and happy band of young menas happy as the enjoyments of a pleasant home or the devotion of fond parents could make them they were bound to each other by the ties of friendship and loved with strong parental affection a change has occurred in their habits and their fortunes the circle is broken they meet by accident or at random their habits are irregular the charms of friendship is broken and in that once bright and intellectual countenance is discovered only the mind of the fooland to those in whose affections he confidingly trusted becomes a loathsome object the young man who reads these lines will remember the first glass may lead him on to the fatal point of danger when in future he will look back on the pastto his early daysand perchance recollect the very place where he was introduced to a train of evils which terminated in blasted hopes and ruined innocence chapter iv the mournful tale that tells why he comes not will make thy heart to bleed thy cheek turn pale rum finds no tie too strong to break the relationship of w brought him into the company of intelligent young people agreeable in his manners kind and affectionate in his disposition and possessing a heart glowing with generous feelings was always a welcome visiter an attachment was formed between him and one of the young ladies of his acquaintances which resulted in an engagement to be united at some future day in the nearest and dearest relation in life she was the daughter of respectable parents amiable intelligent and every way worthy of his confidence and affections they were regarded by all who knew them as a couple fairly mated and with as bright prospects as ever a young heart could desire as time passed on they continued to enjoy each others society and share in each others affections he would occasionally drink but not to excess it was however discovered by his friends that the habit of social drinking was increasing upon him it was hoped almost to a prediction that the influence of her to whom he had pledged his affections and whom he cherished with a true heart would save him from pursuing the course he had commenced there was every reason to expect it she appealed to him by all the circumstances with which he was connectedhis honor his reputationhis all was at stake with all fidelity and tenderness she appealed to his youthful days when life glided on like the placid river whose waters were undisturbed to his mothers tears which flowed in his behalf from a heart that felt for him with unceasing and unchanging love she was unrivalled in tenderness and devotedness to him and with all the forbearance of a devoted lover she would forgive him seventy times seven he regarded her with much affection and when he neglected her it was not that he loved her less but that he loved wine more she possessed a decision of character which she felt herself bound to maintain both for his good and her own long long did she forbear his follies and forgive his often violated promise in hopes that her expectations would be realized by yet seeing him decidedly temperate those fond hopes were blasted and yet it was not until she had employed every argument and placed before him every motive to induce him to abandon the cup that she separated herself from him that step was taken when her heart experienced the most painful sympathy and swelled to almost bursting with emotions of pity as she saw him rushing on to the full extent of intemperance it is not our province to decide on the effect of this separation as to the influence it had over the subsequent history of w it was hoped that a reformation would immediately follow and that he would again regain the confidence of her whom be regarded in his sober moments as his best friend on this factthat she was to him all and more than he could expectand that he loved herwas the probability of his reformation founded by his friends but he was now left with less restraint than ever and with more time to devote to the circle of his old acquaintances with a generous heart and a social temper of mind he secured the attention of kindred spirits there was in him a want of moral courage to resist temptation this disposition was not so much to gratify himself as to oblige and make himself agreeable to others it is often said of the victim of intemperance he was a noble youth a generous soul this was true of w his social feelings and generous disposition led him to express hospitality to others who loved the flowing bowl even to the sacrifice of the last farthing chapter v vice oer him holds its sway and from his dark career the mother try to win him and her eye her dimmd eye drops a tear a few months had scarcely elapsed before a very visible change was discovered in the habits and conduct of w every thing which seemed once so agreeable in his general deportment and so pleasing in his manners appeared now to have vanished as though some vile enchanter had robbed him of his good name and stripped him of every amiable virtue in his character parental hopes were blasted and the kind and affectionate heart of s under the pressure of this calamity began to droop and languish like the blooming rose under the heat of the noonday sun the tavern and the alehouse were the places of his resort the mother of w was usually the last of the family that retired to rest on her devolved the superintendence of the affairs of the family but the heart of that mother was often pained by the late returns of her son the clock has struck ten eleven twelve at night while she anxiously waited his arrival one right in particular he returned home very late under circumstances which led to the following conversation mother it is very late my son where have you been at this hour of the night w you are mistaken mother the clock has just struck ten has father returned mother you know your father is never form home at this hour and why do you say it is only ten oclock when it is nearer midnighttell me where have you been w i am not well mother dont ask me where i have been you know i keep good company j and i took a walk out of town this afternoon i suppose it is rather later than usual is father at home mother your father feels very unhappy about you w what did he say because i left the shop this afternoon mother i never saw him appear so restless about you as he has appeared to be this evening i am fearful you are not in good company w mother i am not well i must go to bed ill make it all right in the morning i did not expect to find you up dont be troubled about me let me have a light the mother saw that he was evidently not himself and before the interview of that night closed w acknowledged the cause of his aberration from duty and ere he retires to his chamber he exclaims o my head my head the reader can form a faint idea of the feelings of ws parents on seeing their son under circumstances of this character which to them was a painful evidence that he was fast progressing towards the drunkards miserable destiny w would not knowingly deceive his friends his conscientious heart would not allow him to conceal the truth when he felt himself convicted of his guilt under the blessing of god he was indebted to his parents for the faithful lessons of wisdom and virtue in which he was early taught his deep sense of responsibility to them and his tenderness of conscience as to right and wrong it was impossible not to admire the several members of the family never lost sight of w they loved him with a pure affection and he felt that he not only injured himself but violated the sacred and mutual duties of brothers and sisters they were more closely united than casual friends they shared each others joys and sympathized in each others sorrows and were alike interested in all the pleasant scenes which clustered around the happy circle of which w was a member surrounded as he was by these sacred influences the reader can judge of the painful feelings which he experienced whenever he occasioned any afflictions among those whom he loved and esteemed and who had the highest claims next to his creator upon his confidence and affection but alas there were charms in the wine cup and in the company of those who loved the excitements of the flowing bowl there it was the bond of unionand there in the midst of merry scenes and glee songs he lost sight of his obligations and increased a thirst for drinking which brought upon him at intervals delirium tremens burning fever and almost death to relate all the painful passages or ws experience and history from this period up to his reformation would occupy more room than our limits will admit we shall refer to a few scenes in his life which are connected with a mothers solicitude for her son and also with his timely escape from an early and dishonorable grave w was in the habit of visiting a certain place in s street where doubtless many a youth may trace the first step of a miserable existence his mother after waiting with painful suspense form his return home wrapped her cloak around her for it was a cold chilly night and made her way towards the place where she had some suspicions that he might be found on her way she stopped to inquire of the watchmen not what of the night but if they had seen her son receiving no information from them she hastens on resolved not to return until she had found him who was at this period more especially the object of her deepest solicitude she arrived at the place and looking through the window she saw among the crowd of rumdrinkers the form of her well known boy she enters and with all the feelings which such circumstances would naturally induce she addressed the owner of the establishment she appealed to him by the condition of her sonlook at him and see what you are doing by your vile traffic she appealed to him by the long and dismal catalogue of crime and woe and deathto the fair the young and the beautiful who had been sacrificed by the rumsellers wicked vocation she appealed to him by the tears of the widow and the orphan which flowed as freely as from her own eyes while she stood by the side of her son insensible to the affections of his mother and insensible sible to what was passing and what was the result of this appeal just what may be expected from men who invite and tempt the young to drink for filthy lucres sakei shall sell my rum to any who will buy the mother turned away as she took her son by the arm to return to her home leaving the rumseller to his own reflection with a prediction that he would have to repent of his deadly traffic chapter vi revelries in banquet halls such scenes a blight impart to cloud the brain and rend the heart to crush the brightest hopes of youth to quench the light of moral truth in the midst of the deepest afflictions the human heart is not left without consolation the mother of w never ceased to cherish hope that at some day she would witness to the joy of her heart the complete reformation of her son but that time had not yet arrived her tears were not all shed not her tender and faithful pleadings all made in behalf of him who was the subject of her morning and evening prayers w continued his habits of drinking and would continue to share his last shilling with the band of revelers who never ceased to take advantage of his weakness when under the excitement of alcohol to obtain the means from him to satisfy their own thirst for intoxicating drink w was a workman in his business and whatever he began to make he finished in a manner that was unsurpassed by any man of his trade his money was well earned but it was rapidly and foolishly expended with but few exceptions he had now arrived to that age when young men begin to act for themselves and lay their plans for future prosperity and eminence in the world it was at that time when high inducements were hold out for men in almost every profession to locate in the west that w projected for himself the plan by which he vainly imagined rising prosperity to himself his fondly indulged hopes might all have been realized had he left his native city under the redeeming influence of the pledge but it was otherwise while he was anticipating success and preparing to leave the paternal roof he continued to quaff deeper and deeper at the bowl and as often as ever was he borne to his chamber in a state of intoxication the tears of parents the advice of sorrowing brothers and sisters and the remonstrance of friends were ineffectual in persuading him to relinquish the cup his promises to amend were as often broken as they were made at length the day for his departure arrived he bade his acquaintances and relatives an affectionate farewell who gave him the strongest assurance of their deep interest in his welfare and their unceasing solicitude for his prosperity the conduct of w aside from his habits of occasional excessive drinking was always marked with integrity and honesty of purpose this in connection with his reputation as a workman secured to him friends and in the young and green city to which he was destined he obtained a situation worthy of his acceptance and in connection with a respectable and an esteemed citizen this circumstance gilded the scene which otherwise would have been dismal indeed to parental hearts with the cheering hope that the change of location might favorably affect his habits and character but there was the miserable fashion of drinkingthe delights of winethe social meetingsthe delights of winethe social meetingsthe convivial board and in a short time w formed new acquaintances on whom the growing custom had fastened its chains and with whom he could had fastened its chains and with whom he could drink freely or sparingly as the occasion required his employer acted towards him like a father and with tears besought him to abandon the intoxicating cup w had secured his affection respect and confidence and he could not cherish the thought of ever seeing him sacrificed on the altar of bacchus or having him spend his hard earned wages for that which had ruined thousands and ravished all health all comfort of a happy life but w had not gone so far as to lose his sense of moral obligation or to forget the home of his childhoodhis early daysdays of innocence and joy and the promise which his friends made to him on the day of his departure from home was faithfully kept letter after letter came to him written and signed in the wellknown hand the thought of homeof parentsof brothers and sisterswould steal upon him and tears would involuntarily start from his eyes as he read those precious letters in which his father and mother space words of tenderness and love the influence of those letters was for a season visible in his correct habits and sober life and had there been at that time the same estimate made of the pledge which has been in later years the result of a mothers appeals might have been visible in the earlier reformation of her son but his love of strong drink rather increased than diminished and under the influence of his long indulged habits he continued the occasional victim of intemperance in that city w had an elder brother whose residence there at the same time with him for a few years was a source of relief to the anxious parent as she well knew that the influence of the elder over the younger brother would be salutary at length a letter was received informing the parents that there elder son was languishing under a disease which it was feared might prove fatal that letter contained the request of the son that if possible their mother might come on immediately as it was not convenient for both parents to leave home at the same time it was decided that in view of al the circumstances it would be most convenient for the mother to go it was a journey of more than a thousand miles and she had been unaccustomed to travel alone but there were her two eldest sons one on the sick bed and the other exposed to the temptations of the city in a few hours she was prepared for the journey and started alone for the far westtravelling by night and by dayby railroad steamboat and stage until she reached the home of her eldest son the joy which her children felt on seeing their mother can be expressed only by the meeting itself of parent and children the elder son b who had for weeks been confined to his room began to recover and w spent most of his leisure time in the company of his affectionate parent endeavoring to interest her by the passing scenes of life and managing to conceal from her the extent of his indulgence at the social glass in a few weeks the duties of her household called upon the mother to return those few weeks were faithfully improved in ministering to the comfort of her sick son while at the same time she was imparting the best advice to w on leaving for home she commended them to the care of her heavenly father gave them her parting benediction and as they hung upon her neck bade them adieu we must pass over the interim of a few successive months to the period of ws history when he resolved to return to his native city he returned almost pennyless a young man without a family receiving regular wages at the rate of fifty dollars per month might be expected to have accumulated a small capital with which to establish himself in business but not so with young men who tamper with the cup of intoxication and who squander their earnings to gratify an unnatural passion this sad lesson our friend w had to learn from sad experience chapter vii the deed is done point to his nameas tears flow fast while he the pledged one stands redeemed at last after w had returned to his fathers house he found himself under the same influences as before his absence there was still the restraining power of maternal affection together with timely cautions and tender admonition of affectionate sisters and sincere friends but there was also the same thirst for drinking burning in his bosom this together with old associates who were ever lingering in his pathway inviting him to pledge at the glass his safe return baffled every effort made for his reform and sent despair into the yet bleeding and lacerated hearts of his parents his narrow escapes from a sudden and awful death when under the influence of liquor his fiery imaginations and awful deliriums are still fresh in the memories of those who knew him we must spare our feelings in the description it was the first glassherald of misery on which our malediction rests for its undoing all that god a mother and his best friends had done it was that which stripped him of all moral loveliness when in the vigor and prime of youth and when in the days of innocence and beauty he secured the love and esteem of her who anticipated being his honored bride led on from one step to another he was shorn of a clear and active mind until by the foolishness of his course he returns like the prodigal to his fathers house without a penny he could call his own it is said if it were not for hope the heart would break the mother of w was almost brokenhearted years of incessant toil passed over her head when she hoped to see the fruit of that seed so early planted by her own hand ripening into harvest but alas her expectations when they should have been realized were awfully blighted and hope long long deferred began to expire like the glimmering wick in the socket there was her sonthe child next to her first born whose presence once lit up her countenance with joy and whose music gave an in inspiring charm to the family circle who was blessed with a heart once glowing with tender and pure emotions now standing before her the pitiable victim of intemperance we have said that hope had almost departed from the mother of w yes it had well nigh gone when an unexpected event occurred in his history a change began to be visible in his habits and hope again revived in the hearts of many who were ready at his return to sobriety and virtue to greet him with a cordial welcome to clothe him with the best robe and to rejoice in his salvation from the drunkards destiny the change was not radical or final but it was enough to kindle up that hope which had now nearly expired in a mothers bosom and which was never clean gone even in the darkest passages of his life he appeared at this time to be as it sometimes is said on the mending hand he was earlier at home than usualmore steady to his business and more trim in his general appearance about this time he became acquainted with a young lady who proved to be to him a suitable companion the former young person of his acquaintance had during his absence from home married a gentleman of virtuous habits and of respectable standing in society w was now determined in his choice and in a short time was united in marriage to e his young and amiable wife endeavored to keep every thing agreeable and pleasant about home if he returned late she spake kindly to him and in all his delinquencies in duty as a husband she murmured not but patiently hoped for the best a few weeks after his marriage he relapsed again into his former habits home was neglected his forbearing and patient wife forgotten and the affairs of the household assumed a chilling aspect w promised better things as the tears rolled down his cheeks when recollections of the past crowded upon his mind and he thought of his mothers prayers and tears and counsels and when he looked upon his patient wife whom he had promised to love protect and cherish the mother of w still cherished the hope of his reformation by what means it would be accomplished she could not foresee but there was the impression indelibly fixed in her heart that he would at some future day abandon the habit of drinking and by a sober and industrious life reward her for all her anxieties and neverceasing solicitude for his welfare the reformation which began at baltimore reached her ears about this time and every one was talking about the washingtonians and the influence they were exerting by the power of the pledge in connection with the thrilling tales of their own experience the mother of w eagerly watched the movements of these men as they were chronicled in every paper and borne on every breeze ascertaining for the first time where they assembled she goes to her son and kindly invites him to accompany her to the meeting w loved his mother but on that night he excused himself for not complying with her request she goes alone and after hearing the reformed men speak of the blessings of the pledge and tell the unvarnished history of their own experience she resolved to leave no means untried to bring her son under the influence of these men she felt this to be the last resort for the reformation of w and knowing that his heart was not insensible to the melting appeals of kindness and love and that the voice of these reformers could not plead in vain she brought before her son every motive and every argument to induce him to accompany her to the washingtonian meetings at last w gave his mother his consent not that he would sign the pledge but that he would oblige her by attending the meetings the mother could hardly wait for the evening to arrivesuch was her anxiety to have her son come under the influence of the living voice of a reformed man that evening mr hs was to address the audience the mother watched the timepiece which was suspended on the wall of the parlor that they might be at the meeting in good season to secure a seat where w might hear every word that fell from the lips of the speaker the hour for meeting arrived and taking the arm of w with hasty steps they both joined the multitude of villagers who were now thronging to the meeting in a short time the house was filled to overflowing many were there who were still held fast by the strong bands of alcohol and others who had been free from the bondage for a short time only there were the old tipplers and the companions of w looking at each other as if they were about to be taken by storm the speaker aroseevery eye was fastened upon him and as he gave the details of his own sad experience every eye was suffused with tears a chord was touched which vibrated in every heart no man could have spoken more tenderly more effectually than did the speaker more on that memorable night which witnessed the triumph of moral powerkind words persuasive eloquence over minds which had became spellbound to intemperance as the speaker closed his address he invited the unpledged part of his audience to come forward and give their signatures w arose from his seat and pressing through the crowd made his way to the desk and in the presence of these who had long known him and in sight of his weeping but rejoicing mother wrote out his name in full with the solemn declaration that he would never again use intoxicating drinks that pledge remains unbroken to this day from that moment w was in all respects a new man and from that period he has maintained a virtuous and sober life his parents are now honored and rewarded for their unceasing solicitude in his behalf his wife beloved and esteemed by her husband wipes out the past and shares in the peace and comfort of domestic life her three little boys like olive plants around her table welcome the presence of a kind and intelligent father and by temperance joys all round his dwellingplace grow succeeding dark storms like heavens bright bow the cup of cold water by t s arthur henry green had been a most abandoned drunkard and in the years of his sad decadence had shamefully wronged and abused his family but in a lucid moment he perceived with startling distinctness the upon the very brink of which he was standing and started back therefrom it was early in the fall of the year when green took the pledge through the winter he had worked industriously and as he could earn good wages his income had given his family very many comforts he had not been much tempted of his old appetite during the cold weather but with the fervent heat of summer the slumbering desire awoke green was a carpenter early in the spring a gentleman offered him a good contract for putting up two or three frame buildings which he gladly accepted and as the lot upon which his house stood was large he erected a shop thereon about eleven oclock one dayit was a hotter day than usualgreens thoughts were dwelling as was now too often the case upon the refreshing glass once so keenly enjoyed a little way from his shop though not in view was a tavern the barroom of which memory was picturing to the eyes of his mind with tempting distinctness he had often been there in times pastoften drank there until thought and feeling were lost he saw in imagination the rows of alluring decanters with their many colored contents he heard the cold ice as it rattled in the glasses he almost felt the cold beverage upon his lips so absorbed did he at length become that he paused in his work and leaned over his bench his eyes half closed like one in a dreamy reverie it was a moment upon which his future for good or for evil hung trembling in an even balance that a hair might turn for as long as five minutes did henry green stand leaning over his workbench a picture of the neighboring barroom distinctly before his mind while he was conscious of an intense thirstthat it seemed as if nothing but a glass of mixed ice and liquor could possibly assuage with a deep drawn breath he at length raised himself the straggle that was going on in his mind more than half decided in favor of selfindulgence papa spoke a low familiar voice by his side green started and turned suddenly a child not over four years old stood by hima fair child with a countenance full of innocence and affection she held a tin cup in both her little hands have a drink of cold water papa yes dear replied the father in a low voice that was unsteady from the rush of sudden emotion and he caught the cup from the childs hands and raising it to his lips drank it eagerly instantly the picture of the barroom with all its allurements fled from the mind of green he was a man again in the integrity of a firm purpose his child led to him by the hand of providence had saved him the cup of cold water had fully quenched the violence of his burning thirst and he was no longer under temptation thank you dear he murmured as he lifted his child up in his arms and kissed her tenderly shall i bring you another cool drink after awhile asked the little one as she pressed her fathers checks with both her hands did any one tell you to bring me the cup of water asked mr green no sir but i thought you would like a cup of cool drink innocently replied the child yes dear bring me another drink after awhile then kissing the little angel who had been the means of saving him when about to fall into temptation he replaced her upon the ground once more turned to his work and as he bent his body in labor mused thus i did not think of the water when i felt that intense desire for a glass of liquorit did not seem to be what i wanted but the cooling draught sent me by heaven i might say so opportunely has quenched the morbid appetite and i feel it no longer water pure healthgiving water you are all i need to give entire strength to my good resolutions when the old desire comes again i will drown it in clear cold water i feel safer now there is a medicine for the inebriates craving appetite and it is water freely will i use it thank god for water yes water is the medicine that cures the sickly craving for strong drink let the reformed man keep this ever in his thoughts and the moment he feels the old desire drown it as did henry green in pure cold water let him do this and he is safe he should watch the beginnings of thirst and be quick to allay the uneasy sensation lest he all unawares be led into danger temperance anecdote rev thomas p hunt once sent a notice to a place where he was not personally known that he would lecture on a particular evening on arriving he put up at a tavern at the supper table he asked the landlord if there was any thing new going on at which a stranger would be amused no nothing in particular was the reply unless it be a rascally temperance lecturer named hunt is to hold forth on that subject tonight ah you intend to go of coursedont you landlord you are the very one to expose the falsehoods of hunts statements i am no public speaker but if i was nothing would be easier than to refute him well then come along and let us hear what he what he has to say if you dont feel able to give hunt a tug ill try him myself i shall like the fun of such an entertainment for the evening the landlord had conceived a great admiration for his guests tongue and readily embraced the proposition to go to the temperance meeting with his companion the temperance men were in great trepidation at the nonappearance of mr hunt no one suspecting the diminutive stranger in the least at last the president of the society arose and apologizing for the disappointment made a speech the edge of which no doubt was a little sharpened by the known presence of the landlord after this he gave out an invitation to any one in the house to advocate or oppose temperance now is your time whispered the landlord giving his humpbacked friend a jog give it to them roundly forthwith he rose and every body looked at him with surprise and painful expectations he said in the blandest tones that this friend the landlord had invited him over to hear hunt and had expressed that he should say a word or two on the question he hoped the audience would indulge him although a stranger and introduced by a liquorseller the very way in which he pronounced the word liquorseller a very favorite phrase with him made both the landlord and all the rest start as if a red hot bolt had dropped among them this was settled however by his quiet way of setting forth the advantage a rumdealer confers on the community this calm was a very delusive one for our poor landlord as his advocates tones deepened into the sharpest irony and set forth a multitude of horrid acts issuing from the barroom the effect was increased by his peculiar intonations in repeating the word liquorseller in which the seemed to concentrate more contempt and horror than any man living all this time the was ostensibly pleading the landlords cause but in a very amusing way since every one present was convulsed with laughter scenes from his own barroom were repeated by his advocate in such a way as to present him in a most unamiable light long before his speech was finished people began to surmise that the landlords lawyer must be their expected lecture as for the tavernkeeper he left the house in a great hurry when the meeting was over and the next morning when mr hunt went for his horse he found him in the road and the landlord holding him you old sinner said he take your horse i wont charge you any thing only dont come back again and ill forgive you the princess of the moon

princess of the moon dear little southern readers  when we wish to amuse children we create in our imagination a race of beings called  fairies and cause them to accomplish as many wonderful things as possible this was my ocupation for the pleasure and happiness of my little ones when sitting before a cheerful hickory fire one chilly november evening it was a few months after the clove of the war and i was it guest at mecca a beautiful virginia home the in warrenton  war had deprived me of my owns and on that evening my feelings were particularly sad from brooding over the sufferings of our dear southern people when my reveries were interrupted by a bevy of dear barefooted little rebels w ho without ceremony surrounded me and begged for a fairy story of course i could not resist their entreaties so after assuring them that in reality there exist no such creatures as fairies i drew upon my fancy for the following story dear children we hlave not a fairy to watch over us but a father in heaven who pities our sunny land and mani fests himself to us in our afflictions he places us in a a palace of purification much more beautiful than the one inhabited by randolph for ours is this bright world filled with furniture more dazzling than any made by the hands of man the flowers the birds the hills and vales the silvery streams blue sky and glorious sun the stars and that lus trous silver lamp the moonwhat palace ever possessed such heavenly ornaments as these but let us remember    that with all its beauty our world like randolphs prison is only one of probation to prepare and purify us for the eternal mansion where the flowers will not fade nor all that is bright and beautiful perish here we are to learn and practice virtuewhich like the fairys violets will become jewels to adorn our crowns in heaven  and when our father wills that we should suffer through the wickedness of others we must remember all the time that it is he who afflicts us and then we shall feel less

how bitter the torture that bound thlee hand and foot whilst thy sisters were insulted and thy mother weeping thou canst not yet think that heaven willed this i see thee shake thy head thy tears of indignation return and thou feellst in thy heart a desire for revenge ah it was a cruel shock to thy young nature trained to chivalry from thy cradle let me point thee to the only comfort left us turn thy gaze above when recalling that sorrow of the past ever look up to him who permitted thy grief and he will yet pour the balm of consolation into thy wounded soul but i will tire my little readers

angels who watched over our brave land during the unequal striuggle may have borne your tears and prayers to heaven where you will find them changed into bright crowns is the heartfelt prayer offered for each one of you the authoress princess of thie moon chapter i it was after the dreadful struggle between north and south that a poor confede rate soldier wandered in a wood near the ruins of his once splendid home he had been indulging his grief at the graves of his fond parents recalling the proud day when he had buckled on his sword in defense of his native land his mothers last embrace his aged fathers blessing and his own promise to return and brighten their declining years with the laurels of victory and liberty but alas how different from his sanguine anticipation was the reality and now as he thought of his bitter disappointment and gazed upon the blackened ruins of his once beautiful home deep anguish filled his heart raising his tearful eyes heavenward the moons pensive rays fell upon his face with unusual brilliancy causing him to exclaim ah had i wings how gladly would i seek shelter on your distant peaceful shores sweet moon instantly a shadowy mist surrounded him and through this cloud he beheld a female of exquisite beauty a crescent of precious stones rested upon her head from which fell a long veil of silver gauze fro rc      ilyv f ivr   i o so completely enveloping her that he could only catch a glimpse of her robe beneath  this seemed to be of dark blue velvet embroidered in jewels to represent stars i am the fairy of the moon said she and having witnessed your grief i desire to serve you what would you have the soldier fell upon his knees and promised to be her most faithful servant until death if she would only transport him to her dominions as life in a conquered land had become to hi m a burden the gentle fairy smiled and stamping her foot upon a rock a beautiful white horse magnificently caparisoned immediately sprang forth you will find every thing there for a long y  journey she said pointing to the horse make good use of the powers i give you and you shall have my protection but i warn you not to fail to return to this rock on the first day of every month to express your gratitude for my munifi cence the name of your horse is hope and whenever you wish to ascend descend or stop on your journey you have only to call hope should you however forget me or neglect to visit me at this spot you will in turn forget the name of your horse and be unable to control his movements in this i require the implicit obedience of those i serve and now farewell mount and leave this land which i have watched over in its prosperity and now mourn over in its desolation yes young man i saw the torch    applied to your home and witnessed your noble fathers last moments on the night he was turned sick and suffering from his own roof i alone heard the blessings and last words he left for you the next morning when his body was found by his neighbors they wondered that the dew upon his face and hair emitted the odor of violets they knew not that i had wept over him and the perfume of my tears never departs thus i became your fathers mourner and your friendand if you prove worthy i have many favors in store for you depart in peace saying this she disappeared in the same shadowy mist which at first surrounded her randolph for this was the soldiers name inspected his noble steed finding a pair of snow white wings under his flowing mane and pro visions and clothing stored in golden cases under the saddle he immediately mounted and ex claimed hope when to his delight the wings gracefully spread themselves and he found himself flying rapidly through the air and what was most remarkable he possessed the power of seeing through space into the interior of the houses and cities he passed day was now breaking and he frequently called hope to stop that he might enjoy the views of the differ ent countries and beautiful cities over which he hovered and sometimes he descended to take a closer view of the interior his own desolate land he could not gaze upon without tears for he beheld misery and want in all directions     he saw the twenty thousand that had been driven from one fair city living in stables barns c c and some even without this poor shlelter another twenty thousand dwellings among the blackened ruins of their once beaute ous townthe eden of carolina f then he viewed the homes of the conquerors abounding in plenty and decked in the spoils they had so cruelly acquired the sight had such a sickening effect particularly as in one place he found his own old family plate adorning a festive board that his senses became confused and but for the outstretched wings of hope he would have fallen on recovering himself he determined to continue his upward course atlanta   tcolumbia   without further delayand he commanded hope to bear him at once to his destination and in a short time he arrived safely in the moon he then alighted and commenced to survey his new home the air surrounding this new world had upon him a most transporting effectit being soft and yet exhilarating the zephyrs made the most delightful music as they fanned the luxu riant foliage while gentle showers imparting the odor of attarofroses constantly moistened the earth the flowers were the rarest and the birds the brightest he had ever seen there was no night in this sublime region he soon discovered signs of habitation and the unpre tending cottage as well as the palatial residence gave evidence of a happiness and peace which was remarkable    after wandering many days he approached a magnificent palace which from its size and grandeur he knew must be inhabited by the king for he had learned on conversing with the people that a king reigned over them who was both wise and good the castle excelled anything he had ever seen it was of singular and graceful architect ure particularly the innumerable towers that surrounded it and from whose lofty summits floated the silvery banner of the moon know ing he could not enter without a special invita tion from the king he did not seek admittance into the palace but making use of hopes wings he alighted in a secluded grotto within the walls surrounding the royal grounds he spent several hours in examining this wonderful spot filled with beautiful ponds lakes woods and meadows verdant groves were traced by silver streams over which floated enchanted gon dolas of every form and description the aged and children formed the pleasure parties of these happy excursions and once a week they were permitted this privilege randolph was struck with their kind and pleasing manners and on conversing discovered that such was the peace and content of these people that they had never heard of war and knew nothing of its meaning his satisfaction was unbounded at the thought that he was at last in a country which would never be con quered or even invadedthat the people were i   free and happytheir good king seeming like a loving father he was also informed of the existence of the kings daughtera princess of marvelous beauty and an intense longing and determination to see her possessed him as the grounds were many miles in extent he had no difficulty in concealing hope and keeping at a distance from the castle at last he became tired and was just about to throw himself upon the soft bright turf when he caught a glimpse of what seemed an angels dreamit was too  beautiful for reality and he was so transfixed with admiration that he had no power to move tmd consequently was unable to avoid being seen by the lovely creature who approached him on beholding him her face became suf  fused with blushes and she was about to retreat but turning towards him as with a sudden thought she exclaimed should you be seen here your death is inevitable such must be the fate of any of your sex who look upon me before my marriage except the one destined by my grandmother to be my husband  he is to appear on my eighteenth birthday but until then i am as one dead to the world lovely princess randolph replied i am a wanderer from a distant world and a stranger here but a good fairy watches over and protects me so you need not fear i beg that you will let me have the happiness of sometimes beholding you she assured him it would be impossible and urged his instant flight as they were at that b     moment in the greatest danger of being seen by her grandmother however he persisted that his friend who had sent him to the moon would guard them both from harm and he implored her not to banish himn from her charming society then to touch her heart he told her the history of his lifedescribing the once happy and pros perous land of his birth then the misery and ruin brought upon his beloved people by a dreadful war last of all his own despoiled home and his meeting with the good fairy who had taken pity on him but he did not tell how she had transported him to this place for he felt he ought not to divulge this secret without first consulting his benefactress on concluding the sad narrative he discovered  the cheeks of the princess were wet with tears whereupon he again entreated to see her occa sionally but she only shook her head illn disap proval and replied that as it would certainly endanger his life it was best for them to part she only wished they had never met as she fearedeven now it might occasion his ruin in token of farewell she gave him her hand which he fervently kissed and then glided away in the direction she had come leaving randolph in distress and despair he was now alone with hope who gazed at him in mute sympathy and then this trusty friend outstretched his wings as if inviting his master to mount and on his doing so carried him far out of sight of the castle of rest as the kings palace was called   chapter ii he gentle motions of his horse lulled our hero into a peaceful sleep and on awaking he found himself approaching i gate of surpassing beauty and apparently of massive silver feeling curious to know what lay beyond he ordered hope to halt while he tried to gain admittance he could not open the gate but through a small crevice he per ceived an angel with a drawn sword on which was inscribed in letters of fire the word par adise the slight glimpse he had of the inte  rior of this exquisite spot and the remembrance of the misfortunes that had been brought upon him and the world by the disobedience of those first parents for whose happiness so much beauty had been created filled him with sadness but reminded him of his good benefactress who required him to return to express his gratitude at the beginning of each month he suddenly remembered that he had scarcely time to make the contemplated journey and for the first time he felt glad that the princess had not permitted him  to remain longer in her presence as he might have forgotten the good fairys injunction until it was too late he now commanded hope to bear him in all haste to the appointed rendezvous    many beautiful countries and enticing scenes attracted his gaze but he resisted the temptation to stop and admire lest in the enjoyment of his own pleasures he should forget the fairys command finally the picture of his own sad land was again in sight but he dared not linger as he had only a few moments left in which to reach the enchanted rock as he drew near he beheld his kind friend awaiting him    she greeted him joyfully for her delight that he had come in time was very great i would rather bless than afflict you she exclaimed therefore in future do not risk my displeasure partake of the pleasures i allow you in modera tion and you will never forget to return on the appointed day  saying this she motioned him to a rustic seat near by and threw back her silver veil when a pair of lustrous mistful dark eyes benaied iupi him with gentle kindness my object in sum moning you here she said is not only to ex act obedience but also to bestow upon you still greater favors randolph gazed fondly upon his benefactress and promised to return in future a day or two before the appointed time and thus avoid all risk of delay the fairy then raised her wand and immediately a beautiful clear lake sprang forth at their feet its waters like a mirror reflected the enchanted boweir of the moon in which randolph had met the princess he now beheld her again standing near the spot where they had parted her face was pale and   j sad she approached the tree against which he had leaned when talking to her and to his delight he saw her imprint a kiss upon the rough bark by this lie cnew she was thinking of hini but what was his astonishment to behold at the same moment the part her sweet lips had touched fall from the tree and in its place a golden case appear containing a likeness of him self and now he knew how he was beloved by witnessing the joy of his adored princess unconscious that his gaze was upon her she poured forth her feelings in tears of joy pressed the picture to her lips and then placed it near her heart this sight filled him with such hap piness that he was on the point of mounting hope and flying to the moon when the fairys  sweet voice again arrested his attention be cautious she said how you intrude upon the solitude to which her grandmother has con demned her had any other young nmn pre self in te      chnted bower as you have done he would have been punished with instant death but i watched over and saved you that lovely creature is destined for a husband of her grandmothers choice it is my desire that you should be selected and i will assist you on condition you continue to obey my order by returning at the appointed time to this place to express your thanks but remember that punishment awaits those who disobey me transported with delight at the idea of again    meeting the princess and of being able to assure her of the protection of the fairy he fell at the feet of his friend and whilst he was pouring forth his gratitude in the most affectionate terms she disappeared mounting his faithful steed randolph was in an incredibly short time car ried to a thick wood near the enchanted bower of the palace of rest   concealing hope he proceeded on foot to find the princess un conscious of his presence she was sighing and grieving as she sadly gazed upon the likeness clasped in her hands but when she saw her lover in person at her feet her whole counte nance became transformed it was like the sun breaking through the clouds on a rainy day her golden curls fell in graceful profusion oyer  her neck and shoulders her soft brown eyes a moment before so mournful now beamed upon him  with bewitching light her ruby  lips wreathed in enchanting smiles around teeth that rivaled the rarest pearl while her pale cheeks became instantly suffused with the tint of the rarest rose randolph unable to resist such charms im mediately gave expression to the devotion he felt and declared he could not survive separa tion from her he then told her of his visit to the good fairy and of the protection she had promised them and begged the princess to return his love without fear it was impossible to resist such entreaties and the princess by her drooping eyes and blushing cheeks confessed    what her timid lips could scarcely utter and now this happy pair passed several hours of each day in sweet communion with each other rambling through the groves and shades of the palace of rest but randolph became impatient to have his fate decided so he determined on an expedient he learned that the king had a great passion for music and that aged musicians were permitted to enter the palace when all others of the sex were excluded now randolph was a proficient in this accomplishment so he procured a white wig and having completely disguised his face presented himself at the palace and was without difficulty admitted into the presence of the king  this imposing monarch sat on a throne of gold inlaid with  precious stones and though pride was marked upon his noble countenance it was softened by an expression of kindness and benevolence the queen and their daughter were also present and when randolph gazed upon his adored princess the effect of her resplendent charms was almost too great for his presence of mind he dared not trust himself to look a second time lest he should be unable to exer cise his musical powers for the pleasure of the king he commenced at once and having finished his first efforts he noticed that the king seemed much gratified and to the great delight of our disguised troubadour desired to speak with him he made many inquiries of his name country destination c and seeming much interested        randolph determined to give him a portion of his history concealing of course the means used by the fairy to transport him to the moon the king was very just and when he had heard from randolph of the terrible war in which his countrymen had been engaged of the many sufferings they had endured before being overpowered by countless hordes of a meddling peddling  race called  yankees his face darkened with indignation remain in my palace said he to randolph i should like to know  more of your poor stricken land you shall become one of my household and teach the princess your beautiful accomplish ment in which you excel any one i have ever heard in my own land randolph was almost  overcome with delight and the agitation of his feelings added much to the pathos and tender ness of his next songthe conquered banner when he had finished it the eyes of even the stem old king were glistening with tears and the princess was obliged to leave the room pb   chapter iii nd now randolph was established at the castle as one of the household and when not engaged with the king or teaching and making love to the princess he amused himself inspecting the interior of this grand and wonderful structure it excelled his most brilliant expectations being a little world within itself and evidently not built by the hands of man discoveringthat all this gran deur was the work of a powerful fairy who presided over the destiny of his household he  understood why it was that the king obeyed so implicitly the grandmothers injunctions regard ing the princess in his moments of solitude his heart failed lest he should be discovered and banished from the society of his beloved but the remembrance of his own good fairys promise encouraged and reassured him it is impossible to imagine the magnificence taste and comfort presented to randolph as he wandered through this grand old castle the entrance hall was a mile in circumference and in its centre a fountain sent forth with sparkling jets of water delightful musicwhich on the arrival of guests would be gay and rejoicing but sad and mournful on their de jarture statues made of rare and wonderful   stone and metal were arranged   in graceful groups and represented the virtues most admired by the king in this hall the walls were of azure bespangled with stars of silver and the ceiling was a magnificent picture of the joys of heaven  delicious perfumes were constantly sprinkled by invisible hands and the floors seemed to reflect as a mirror exquisite flowers of every shape and hue doors around the hall opened into the various apartments too numer ous and beautiful to describe on one side a     balcony overlooked the grotto of silence  whose refreshing shades were never disturbed by   any one but the king himself  as it would fill volumes to give an accurate    description of this enchanted palace which sur           i passed anything ever seen or heard of i will now continue my story and relate how our friend randolph in the enjoyment of his pleasures lost all recollection of his kind bene factress the day arrived for their meeting but the fairy waited in vain at the appointed spot until unable to restrain her impatience she touched the rock with her wand and the lake again appeared in which was reflected the castle of rest seated by the side of the princess randolph was apparently forgetful of everything save his own happiness he was at that moment singing one of his sweetest songs and the princess was gazing sadly upon him for she knew that the time was fast approaching when they must part forever as her grand o    mothers favorite was to appear on her eighteenth birthday which was close at hand notwith standing the apparent difficulties our hero had determined to act the honorable part of informing the king of his true age and circumstances trusting to his good fairys promises and the affection he knew the king entertained for him sadly the genie fairy surveyed the picture in the crystal lake and commenced to weep for she well knew that randolphs forgetfulness of herself would bring trouble upon the happy pair in spite of her affection for them ah thought she if he would only come to me all would yet be right and my poor granddaughter saved muchsorrow the reader has no doubt surmised that randolphs good fairy and the princess grandmother were one and the same she mourned and grieved in vain for randolph was oblivious of everything but the princess at last day dawned and she departed leaving the ground wet with her tears from which srang a bed of fragrant violets in the meanwhile randolph opened his heart to the good old king told his unbounded love for his daughter and the deception it had driven him to practice and how the promises of the fairy had encouraged lir to hope for success but as dearly as the king loved him he dared not disobey the wishes of the grandmother and with sad heart he gave orders that his favorite musician should die at sunset and for the first time sorrow and distress reigned throughout the castle of best   the grief offthe poor princess was so great that her life was despaired of randolph pre ferred death to separation from her and there fore came forth with seeming cheerfulness at the appointed hour to the place of execution i as chapter iv randoldphs only request was to bid farewell to hope and as no one knew the secret connected with the horse his desire was gratified he embraced his faithful steed and speaking to him as to a friend he begged him to remain with his beloved princess and to be to her the trusty friend he had always been to him the scene was so touching that there was a murmur of sympathy through the crowd  suddenly randolph perceived a gleam of encouragement in hopes eyes and he ex               claimed imploringly to the king permit me sire to take a farewell ride on my beloved horse in your presence in front of the castle the king consented and when randolph had mounted he called in a loud voice hope when to the amazement of all present white wings appeared and he was borne with the swiftness of an arrow high into the air his cloak and wig fell at the same instant at the feet of the king who in wonder and astonish ment gazed at the handsome youth and then with a  joyful countenance exclaimed my good people i have just discovered that our friend is the youth intended by the fairy as the husband of my daughter fool that i was not to make him  cast aside his disguise before i passed sentence upon him for the fairy gave mne a picture to enable me to recognize my in tended soninlaw alas i fear my oversight will bring upon all of us her indignation then he ordered his people to call out to randolph  that he should not die but to return and marry  the princess though randolph heard their cries and seemed to understand  them he continued to rise higher and higher until he altogether disappeared by this the king  knew that his want of discretion had offended the fairy and he mournfully repaired to the  grotto of silence where no one dared follow it awas in this place that the grandmother always met him when she wished to communi cate her wishes and on this occasion he found   her with displeasure marked upon her counte nance i deserve your condemnation for my unjust sentence he exclaimed but let my desire of implicit obedience to your command plead my cause   oh king she replied let this sa lesson teach you never to be hasty in your judgments as appearances too often deceive even the wisest and best  you should have sought assistance and light from me to guide you in this important matter  so say ing she left him to reflect on the sad occur rences of the day to return to randolph i have said that he heard and understood the cries of the people and knew that the king had relented and deter mined to allow him to marry his daughter so  he resolved to descend at once but to his amazement he could not think of much less call the name of his horse suddenly the fairys command and threat flashed across his mind and knowing that the time for their meeting had passed he felt that he must suffer the fatal con sequences of his neglect grief and remorse at his forgetfulness of so good a friend overcame him to such a degree that he fell into a swoon which lasted two days on recovering he found himself still swiftly ascending and passing by innumerable beautiful worlds without even the comfort of enjoying the pictures they presentedfor the power of calling hope was still denied him at last he saw in the distance a magnificent gate resting on i    clouds of azure tipped with gold above this gate in glittering letters formed of precious stones appeared the word heaven around which bright angels were hovering and making music with their wings hope could proceed no further and randolphs grief was only increased at thus finding himself just outside of the gate of heaven with no power to enter soon an angel of surpassing   beauty ap proached bearing in its arms the soul of an infant many other angelic spirits followed in quick succession in company with bright puri fied souls about to enter heaven  randolph could read in their faces the joy of the guardian angels that the precious souls entrusted to their  care had been by them safely conducted through  a world of snares and were now going to enjoy the delights of eternal happiness the jeweled gate soon opened to receive the numerous throng and there issued forth music so exquisite and a light so brilliant that ran dolph was thrown into an ecstasy which ren dered him insensible in this state he would have fallen into space but for the outstretched wings of hope ever ready to sustain him when he became conscious heavens delicious melody still resounded in his ears but the gate being half closed the full light no longer blinded him and he was able to catch a glimpse of the angel who guarded the entrance of this blessed abode this bright spirit seemed arrayed in rainbows and a halo of glory surrounded its   head it bore a crown in its hand as if waiting to bestow it upon an expected soul across its breast was a sash of sunbeams on which was      inscribed in golden letters the word hope      at this sight randolph was transported with  joy and calling on hope with all the strength of his voice he immediately began to descend after traveling through the air for many days he perceived the welcome glimmer of the moons silver beams but he dared not stop without having first visited the enchanted rock for    though he had of course lost all reckoning of  time still he determined to atone as much as possible for his former neglect by hastening  immediately to th appointed place he hovered    i for an instant over the castle of rest and his  resolution not to delay nearly forsook him as he beheld reclining in the enchanted bower his adored princes apparently dying he lingered one instant and was just about to risk every thing and fly to her side when he saw an entreating tear in the eye of his faithful hope by this sgn he knew that if he stopped even for a short space of time he would be too late for his appointment with the fairy so with an aching heart he commanded hope to fly with him from temptation at the same moment the good fairy was watching his movements in the lake of reflec tion during his struggle between inclination and duty she closed her eyes as if unwilling either to gaze upon his sufferings or to witness   his unfaithfulness to her commandsknowing well that a second disregard of her wishes would cause him forever to lose her care and protec tion in a few moments he appeared in her presence and unable longer to endure his suf ferings he fell fainting at her feet plucking the violets which her tears at his former neglect had occasioned she sprinkled them  over his prostrate form and immediately a blush and smile overspread his pale features but before he opened his eyes she mounted hope and flew  away leaving him  alone beside the lake of reflection  on awakening as if from   a horrid  dream he recognized  the fairys rendezvous and   realized at once the full extent of his misfortunes finding     himself covered with fragrant violets which he knew   were the tears of his benefactress he gathered and kissing them placed these tokens of her love near his heart determining never to part with them at that moment he beheld the lake of reflection in which was pictured the castle of rest and to his surprise saw the fairy borne within its enclosure on his beloved hope now that his faithful horse was gone he had nothing left to remind him of his good fairy but the violets and the lake gazing into the crystal waters he beheld with astonishment the fairy seated by the side of the princess uttering words which seemed at once to restore the latter to life and happiness then there seemed great rejoicing in the moon the great   doors of the castle were opened and throngs came forth to do honor to the fairywho to randolphs amazement was welcomed and em braced by the king with the utmost affection at this moment the lake disappeared and there stood in its place a beautiful house and grounds which randolph found on exarmina tion to be provided with every comfort and luxury but he himself was deprived of allsense of enjoyment as soon as he possessed himself of what he desired to have it assumed the shape of something distasteful to hm flowers when gathered by him turned into thorns wine into water and every delicacy when touched be came bread thus forcing him to become satisfied with this simple diet the house was inhabited pede         a by people who appeared from a distance to be most charming and agreeable but whenever randolph approached them they became so hideous and disgusting that he shrank away into a solitude which forced him to gaze upon all that was delightful witliout the privilege of en joying anything in this place he spent his time until the day again approached for his meeting with the fairy in the meanwhile the bouquet of violet grew less and less each day one would disap pear and he would find in its place inscribed in letters of diamonds  a golden scroll the name of some virtuefirst patience then char ity humility perseverance c until there was but one violet left on the eve of the day     he was to meet the fairy that also disappeared and in its place he found a miniature of his kind friend under which was written    gratitude touching a spring in the golden case a picture of the lovely princess was disclosed under which was inscribed the word love he now felt convinced that his troubles were coming to an end and that his beloved princess would be the reward of the virtues lie had learned to practice in this singular place of banishment chapter v at last the long looked for day arrived and he hastened to meet the fairy who soon appeared and embracing him with joyful affection commanded him to mount hope and ascend to the moon where the king and his daughter and all the inhabitants were awaiting him with impatience in fact she exclaimed i am the grandmother of the princess and long ago destined you for her husband this happiness would have been yours on her eighteenth birthday had you not disobeyed my    wishes thus forcing me to condemn you to the castle of purification now you are worthy to become a subject of our sinless dominion having been purified from all stains of earth a touch of her wand changed the sombre apparel he had worn during the days of his probation into a magnificent confederate uniform he then mounted hope and in a wonderfully short time found himself in the moon the instant he appeared he was greeted with the most melodious music and crowds followed him to the palace of rest randolphs heart beat with rapture when the gates were opened and the king came forth to meet him come my son thy bride awaits thee in the festal hall stood the princess radiantly  beautiful a veil of snowy gossamer spangled with tiny diamonds enveloped but did not con ceal her lovely face upon her brow rested a wreath of pearls set in the form of lilies and her dress of richest satin fell in flowing folds around lher graceful form n lovinglylthlough timidly she stepped forward to meet himbut language fails me in portraying joy like theirs after receiving the blessing of the king and queen they were proclaimed man and wife thousands of trumpets sounded forth the joyful event in the midst of which they were led to the throne prepared for them as they were receiving the congratulations of the people the festivities were suddenly sus pended by an unexpected event which struck   uj i terror into the hearts of all beholders hovering over the castle were several most singular look ing objects which in a short time descended to the ground  from  these curiously shaped affairs floated banners of red and white stripes and in a few minutes a number of individuals issued forth carrying carpetbags and traps of all descriptions congratulating themselves upon their good luck in discovering a new country which they guessed was going to surpass the best government the world ever saw they set to work at once and commenced a survey of the place the newcomers seemed not the least discpncerted by the crowd of peacefullooking pegple who gazed so wonder ingly and calmly upon them indeed they made  themselves so much at home that to a casual observer they would have appeared to be the owners of this fair country and the natives seemed the intruders the sudden cessation of the music and rejoicing reached the hall where randolph and his bride unconscious of what was taking place outside were receiving the congratulations and toasts of his friends as the honored confederate the adopted prince and the future king of the moon in a few minutes the deathlike stillness outside was explained as the uninvited guests appeared in the festal hall but when they saw a handsome confederate soldier seated on a throne by the side of his  beautiful bride and the magnificence and pomp surrounding him for the first time they halted and even looked a little abashed    at this moment one of the party whose grimaces and contortions had occasioned general terror especially among the children rushed forward exclaiming god bless me if here aint massa at last live and wrell arter allthis individual was of entirely a different appearance from the rest of the partyhis skin being black and his head woollyand as he rushed franti cally towards randolph whom he seized in his arms the poor princess became so alarmed that she fell into a swoon causing for awhile great confusion and dismay meantime the guests whose presence had caused such consternation made themselves perfectly at home but the people perceiving that the woolly head appeared to be a friend of their new prince restrained their impatience until he should explain the meaning of what they saw he rose from his throne and addressed them thus my illustrious king and father my beloved adopted citizens this singular individual pointing to tke grinning darkey was an old and trusty servant belonging to my fathers household and one to whom i am greatly attached he heard that an expedi tion was forming to survey the moon and having dreamed that he should find me here he was induced to join the party in hopes of realizing his wishes after setting out he discovered that the adventurers were the very persons who had burned down and driven from my home my aged parents at this moment the exploring party commenced to run dropping in their haste   their     etba      from  whh fell nuerou  their carpetbags from which fell numerous valuable articlesspoons predominating the good old darkey clapped his hands delightedly crying hurrah massa dems yourn     i seed um steal uln but darnt say a word poor old massa god bress himwas a dying and no one but me to take him out of the flames the surveyors reached their balloons their means of conveyance without molestation for as i have before said the people of the moon were a peaceful race and the fairy alone exer cised the prerogative of justice  she stood there awaiting them her face glowing with indigna tion as she exclaimed ah i have caught you in selma during the late war an old man was burned to death in his own house by yankee soldiers no faithful darkey being near to rescue him from the flames at last demons of cruelty and i have now the power to punish you which i had not outside of my own domirnions touching the balloons with her wand they were instantly transformed into hideous dragons which at once surrounded their unhappy victims then she summoned randolph to appear and pronounce sentence upon them but this noble youth who had learned in the palace of purification to know and love virtue begged her in honor of his wedding day to release them saying beloved benefactress did you not forgive me my base ingratitude permit me then to restrain my vengeance even though these enemies have driven me from my home and deprived me of every earthly consolation through the sorrow    they  have brought on me i have learned charity whose sublime lessons are only taught in the school of adversity it is there we learn that life would become insupportable if fellow creatures do not assist and encourage each other behold he continued his face beaming with love my mothers gentle spirit pleads for these sinners and he held up to their view a minia ture under the lovely face of which formed in letters of precious stones were these words blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy this is a valued tribute presented my father by the citizens of my native town in gratitude for his charity during a terrible pesti lence when he and my pious mother opened their doors their hearts and their purses t the  suffering i found this priceless relic just now among the illgotten goods dropped so hurriedly by the intruders it is prized above all treasures and comes to bless my weddingday and give the poor confederate soldier a suitable offering for his bride turning towards her and throwing the chain around her neck he softly whispered accept beloved one this my only possession but it is worthy even of aprincess for it is my mothers face come to bless our union the radiance of a rainbow surrounded  them and seemed to have the effect of softening the hearts of all within reach of its raysfor not only did the face of the fairy assume its wonted gentleness but repentant tears bedewed the             cheeks even of the intruders then randolph fell at the fairys feet to intercede for these creatures in which prayer he was joined by the princess at the same moment the dragons were transformed into a flock of doves the fairys sign of truce she then opened her arms to randolph and tenderly embraced him son of my heart said she nobly hast thou withstood this last temptation for it was intended only as another trial of your virtue had you taken advantage of my offer to wreak vengeance upon your enemies you would have been again stained with sin live hereafter in peace and happiness and know that your fallen country will yet arise from her ashes in greater glory iv than ever she has suffered but she is purified and thus prepared for greater blessings than before and you said she looking severely at the uninvited guests you may well rejoice that your captor being a confederate soldier spurns to trample on fallen foes even though they be the pillagers and plunderers of his own house hold repent your ways while you have time a respite of punishment has been granted to enable you to return and warn your people against nemesis whose uplifted hand is ready to strike the blow that will carry destruction in its wake tell them to unshackle the race of heroes they have enslaved that their temple of liberty may not be shattered and sow terror in   their midst  tell them   to restore illgotten goods and bring content to the sad hearts and plenty to the scanty boards of those whom they have ruined retributions sword sharper than that of mars is suspended over them go avert the evil before it is too late  gracefully waving her wand a number of gorgeous and magnificent balloons appeared in which the explorers gladly departed in the midst of the acclamations and rejoicings of the inhabitants of the moon when last heard from   the party had landed at the central park but instead of trying to convert their erring people were making large fortunes by carrying lovers beyond the clouds   to be united in the bonds of matrimony they  the writer is a witness to the fact that a bridal party in new york the summer of  had their marriage celebrated in a baloon during its ascent have never again undertaken to invade the moon but there is no knowing what may yet take place as they are a very indefatigable people finis i rushed up stairs and at the door of his room met the farmer armed and about to fire in a second i dashed the gun from his hand and with one blow laid him lifeless his wife alarmed by the fall of her husband had risen from the bed and was rushing to his aid when i served her in the same mannerp  the startling and thrilling narrative of the dark and terribledeeds of henry madison and his associate

dark and terrible deeds of henry madison startling and thrilling extracts from the journal of henry madison when i think on the pastcontemplate the futurethe excited blood of imagination boils through my veins my mind becomes excited to a pitch of desperation unknown to those who have not suffered as i have done those who have not seen the world go against them those who have been smiled and favored on whilst i have been trampled spat upon kicked on one side as if i were a very monster i am that i have done alldriven by contempt and desperation i am worse but i must complete my tale and think not of my misfortunes i was born in walnut street philadelphia above tenth my father was a wealthy merchant keeping his office on the wharf prosperous and rich he gave freely to the needy educated myself and my sisters i was an only son in a manner princely at the same time substantial my sisters had italian french and dancing masters i hebrew greek and latin drawing and paintingeverything that would fit us to move in the highest circles in this or more aristocratic countries with all this he did not neglect to have my sisters instructed in sewing embroidery and other useful household arts at the age of sixteen he took me into his countinghouse i was there till i became twentyone years of age when the progress i had made in becoming fully acquainted with mercantile transactions and the inclination which my disposition shewed to follow such pursuits induced him to admit me a junior partner this was in the year  at that time great exportations of corn and flour were taking place from philadelphia new york new orleans baltimore and other ports to faminestricken ireland we were extensively engaged in this shipping trade and during the first year made great profits our connections became enormous the year  came the tide of affairs took a different turn our correspondents in europe failed in their engagements and the house of g r l  co stopped payment my father who had been in a delicate state of health for some months past through over excitement from the speculative business he was engaged in soon gave way to the disease which had firmly seized upon him on his death bed he charged me to give up all to his creditors pay every cent he owed as far as his assets would admit of and trust to god and our own industry for the maintainance of my sisters and myself what a change from wealth to poverty we who have been accustomed to every luxury and want that the former supplied reduced to what the latter scantily afforded however the good education that both i and my sisters had received now saved us they took in sewing etc i got a situation as salesman or clerk in a large drygoods store in market street there it was i became first acquainted with miss allworth one day a gentleman from baltimore walked into our store accompanied by miss allworth he was her uncle and a good customer to the house i was immediately struck by her handsome appearance for she was indeed a lovely girl during their stay in the store i became quite enamored of her and hearing from the conversation that passed between her uncle and my employer whereabouts they stopped in town i resolved at all hazards to call at the united states hotel where they stopped and endeavor to become acquainted with her fortune favored me during her stay in the store i succeeded in getting into conversation with her she had known one of my sisters who had been on a visit to a friend in baltimore i called accordingly saw her spoke and on the third visit found to my joy that i had made some impressioni imagined a sure one her uncle left her at a friends in chesnut street to spend a few weeks while he returned to baltimore daily my suit progressed i was her accepted lover woman how deceitful is thy sex we had settled between ourselves that we should be married in about three months if her uncle consented as he was her guardian i had informed my sisters of our engagement and they were delighted at my happiness as great affection existed between us one evening i called and as i entered the house a handsome looking frenchman left iti was received by rose with a degree of coldness never before experienced in two or three days i found to my mortification that the wily frenchman had ingratiated himself into roses affections in vain i pleaded to the heartless coquette she was sorry that we had become so intimate as she found our tastes did not suit i would be happy with some one else i left the haughty beauty with rage and mortification i resolved to be revenged having heard that an old woman who told fortunes cured all sorts of diseases with herbs lived in an alley at the corner of christian and third streets i went thither and by the aid of gold obtained a deadly poison but at the same time that it killed it left no traces of itself in the human frame whereby it could be detected my object now was to get this administered to my intended victim she had a maid who had been in our secret and who had professed a great liking for me she had been very much hurt at her mistresss treatment of me i pretended to her that it was a love potion capable of restoring the affection of her mistress to myself and that together with a bribe succeeded in obtaining her consent to administer the powder a week nearly a month passed by the object of my revenge still lived apparently in all her former health and beauty i doubted her maid but she assured me that miss allworth had taken the powder and condoled with me on its apparent want of success in restoring the lost affections of my former mistress another week and rose was to become the bride of my rival daily as i passed the house in which she stopped i saw numerous deliverings of goods of all descriptions taking place they were preparing for a happy wedding i was passing one evening three days before the bridal a carriage drove by me and stopped in it sat rose and her affianced a frown passed over his countenance as he recognized me she looked coldly at me as if she merely gazing on a stone my bosom swelled ready to burst with anger mortification and revenge i hurried away my brain on fire every sense maddened and excited i directed my steps to the residence of the old hag from whom i had bought the poison she recognized me at once i upbraided her in no measured terms for her deceit she listened to me patiently and when i had exhausted my abusive vocabulary she quietly remarked how long since the potion had been given i replied twentyseven days it is well she replied wait patiently three more and your object is accomplished i have never known it fail i could get no more information the bridalday has come at last she has been marriedthere is a grand entertainment her gratified husband leads her to the dance and as she passes through the crowded rooms words of admiration of her beauty and accomplishments fall quick upon her ear the musicians struck up she advances in the dance and falls a lifeless corpse hurrah my revenge is accomplished i read from the morning ledger horrible occurrencewe have to record a most melancholy and heartrending occurrence last night as the friends of miss allworth long known in this city as a reigning belle were enjoying the wedding festivities the young lady advanced with her newlymarried husband to take part in a quadrille she had not taken above two steps when she suddenly fell and on being raised was found a corpse truly in life we are in the midst of death my revenge is complete but now the remorse of a guilty conscience attacks me i have drank of the cup of crime and i must now like the drunkard constantly renew the cup time flew by no suspicion as to the cause of miss allworths death was excited as the coroner and jury gave it as their opinion that she died of apoplexy my revenge was complete but my mind was not at ease i could not rest i resolved to leave philadelphia an aunt had lately died leaving money sufficient to keep my sisters comfortably i left and went to san francisco one of the many crimes that i committed there i will relate disgusted at the duplicity of woman i resolved to trust none again i had not been many months in california when i became acquainted with a beautiful accomplished and affectionate young lady though i had forsworn the fair sex her charms soon affected me i found in her that which i had began to fear no woman possessed but i like many others who have been disappointed in the first love was deceived there does exist among woman the most pure and devoted love for i found it to my joy in miss wilson we both loved with strong fervor would those happy days had never past that the demon of jealousy had never seized upon me we were married and pleasantly passed the first three years of our married life one lovely child was born to us the horrid memories of the past were nearly obliterated from my mind amid the domestic happiness that i enjoyedthe bitter thoughts of my past crimes gradually gave way to the more soothing influence of the former my wife though had seen by my manner that something preyed upon my mind and never attempted by undue curiosity to find out what it was that weighed upon my thoughts gentle kind and loving she endeavored to the best of her power to soothe my troubled mind she succeeded and i may say i was comparatively at rest but it turned out that events of the past had taken too deep a hold on my nature returning one evening from my store on the south wharf i found my ellen gloomy and sad i could discover no cause and though i questioned her she merely pleaded a little fatigue my conscience she lay asleep with our infant in her arms how beautiful she lookedso innocentso happy and so lovely had i not the heart of a monster i would have fallen upon my knees and embraced her praying god to forgive me for the crimes i had committed and the thoughts i had entertainedpage  smote me attracted by the features of a new actress who had just made her first appearance on the boards of san francisco whom my wife and self had been to see i had visited her lured on by her fatal attractions i became fearful that the latter had discovered some clue to my passion i became fearful that the latter had discovered some clue to my transgressions on returning to our chamber i questioned her still more closely as to the cause of her indisposition and at length after immense persuasion and with scalding tears in her eyes she informed me of the following that morning about eleven oclock she was surprised by the visit of her brother from philadelphia who came to inform her of the crime of which i had been guilty thunderstruck at my duplicity and crime he had hurried to san francisco accompanied by the proofs of my guilt to inform his father and relations and at once to take proceedings against me ellen told me all and added that she did not believe it i soothed her agonized feelings assured her that it was all a conspiracy her brother was deceived by some designing villain calmed by my asseverations she slept soundly on my bosom the morning came i rose early as was always my habit for with my brain clear and unclouded i felt better able to decide on the best course of action in this trying embarrassment i resolved to see her brother at once our morning meal over i kissed ellen and started for his hotel now it was that i indeed repented of my former guilt and revenge yet i felt that it was a just punishment for my unfaithfulness to my loving and devoted wife i found him at home and at once demanded what was the meaning of the false accusations that he had made against me he answered by requesting me to be seated and stated as follows you are aware mr madison that shortly after your marriage with my sister i went to philadelphia where i had got an engagement in a large wholesale general store in a large city a young man unaccompanied or restrained by those who have an interest in his welfare is likely to mix with company who may lead him into the paths that he ought not to follow i situated as i describe have mixed in improper society and it was among that society that i heard first of what you have called a false accusation i started with indignation from my chair listen said he pointing to the chair when i have done you shall be heard and i hope for your sake as well as my sisters that your assertions may be true about two months ago walking up chesnut street one afternoon i passed a rather pretty young woman i fancied cied her glance peculiar and turning i repassed her quickly and when i had proceeded about a square again turned round and met her she gave a kind of halfsmile it was just at the crossing of fifth street i turned and walked into the square at the back of the statehouse i looked back two or three times and found that she was following as soon as she entered the square i walked by her side and soon became well acquainted i met her that evening by appointment at a house of rather suspicious character we became intimately acquainted and i must say i felt drawn toward this girlellen stevens i started again the very person i had employed to kill rose allworth was here brought against me i trembled to hear the rest are you ill inquired wilson in a tone of alarm merely a spasm i repeated it was over and i managed to control my emotions he continued i met her frequently for several months one day she abruptly asked me what i intended to doas she informed me that she was pregnantand did i intend to fulfill a promise once made of marrying her i evaded the latter portion of her question by stating that i would see the child properly cared for and allow her a maintainance sufficient to live upon this meeting occured about three months since she grew furious at my reply called me the worst of names and upbraided now by tears then by the most violent passion unable to calm her and unwilling to yield to her demands knowing that she was a guilty creature previous to my meeting her i left her to her own thoughts in hopes that my absence would soothe her ruffled and violent temper it had the desired effect for the following morning i received a note from her requesting me to come to her that day and that she would forgive all if i kept the promise i had made the day previous namely provide a suitable maintainance for her and the offspring that she expected i went and found her calm and reasonable i left and returned in the afternoon with a friend who witnessed the agreement i had had drawn up by an attorney she was perfectly satisfied or at least seemed to be three days afterward i visited her again and found her in a state of beastly intoxication though i had often seen her drunk i never saw her in that state before she flew at me the moment i entered the room called me a monster and a villain declared i should marry her or she would expose me in her maddened frenzy she gave utterance to the following you are as great a monster as henry madison who poisoned miss allworth and afterward went to california what i replied thunderstruck with amazement and married my sister ha ha she replied with a brutal laugh if you ruined me i have revenge in knowing that your sister is as bad as i am monster i exclaimed and maddened by her taunt i rushed from the room for some hours my senses seemed gone astray could her accusations of you be true i inquired of myself if they were what ruin and disgrace had you brought upon me and mine i resolved to sift the matter out i accordingly went to a friend who though not known to you personally had often seen you in philadephia from him i learned of your former love for miss allworth of her slighting you and marrying another and of her awful and sudden death on her bridal night there seemed a degree of mystery about the matter which we both felt bound and determined to penetrate he inquired the name of the woman with whom i associated i replied ellen stevens why he replied that is the very girl who was maid to miss allworth at the time of her engagement to madison there may be some truth in it we had better proceed at once and inquire further of her we started for her residence and found her somewhat more sober than before she rushed to me on my entrance and besought me not to mind what she had said in her passion that it was not the truth and that it might get her into trouble i replied that it was now too late asking her to state the full particulars and assuring her that no harm should come to her for so doing for some time she obstinately refused stating that she knew not what she said at length on my informing her that if she did not voluntarily inform us we would be obliged to bring her before a magistrate and convinced by our manner that we were serious she said be it so all i know is that henry madison bought the poison of an old hag living in an alley near the corner of christian and third streets who sold herb medicine etc you can easy find her by inquiring for madge faust he endeavored to persuade me to administer it to miss rose stating that it was a love powder i refused he afterward informed me he had succeeded in doing so himself at the same time saying that her affections would soon return to him a month was nearly passed and full arrangements had been made for miss allworths marriage with mons silvester when one day i accidently met madison in the street i said your love potion does not seem to take much effect wait a little he replied i will be revenged on her bridal night you know the restfear kept me silent from her who sold him the powder i heard of its being poison when she had concluded we rose informing her that i would soon be back and that she would have to appear as witness against you if we found her statement correct we hastened to the poison sellers habitation on our way thither it was resolved between us that i only should go in and endeavor to procure some of this poison from her after a little search we found her residence out i entered and found her sitting by the dying embers of a pitiful fire she turned on her stool as i entered and in a squeaking and angry tone demanded my business after a few preliminary remarks i stated that i required a love powder to restore me the affections of my mistress ha ha said she in a hoarse and feeble laugh such powders as tell no tales leave no trace behind whereby the hangman is defrauded of his duties do you know my price she demanded staring me full in the face and reading with her searching and catlike eye every feature and movement of my countenance i replied not but i supposed five dollars would pay her five dollars she screamed in reply nor ten times five out with you all some silly fool has sent you here out with you leave me she exclaimed pointing to the door i remained resolving to parley with her and endeavor to obtain the information i required money i am willing to givewhatever you demandname your price four hundred dollars she abruptly replied agreed said i who told you to come here she inquired there is but one that i have lately sold to one madison his lady love was miss allworth a haughty beauty her affections returned to him in the graveha ha she continued with a wild and brutal laugh she went to a corner of the room and from out a cupboard took a small bottle containing some white mixture or powder she put about five grains in a paper and folded it up whilst doing this she kept half addressing me and half to herself oh this is beautiful in its effects it does the deed so calm and quietly it has been handed down from generation to generation of our family since my ancestress gunnora poisoned the good king edward by base northumberlands order ay in the land i came from it is often used by the nobles of the land i have known one fair girl the daughter of a peer who sacrificed her honor to love her father indignant at the stain that was likely to appear upon his name and too proud to allow her though her lover longed to marry her administered a small portion of this every week for a month and in three more she was a corpse by a slow and torturing death one half this will have its effect in a month and now the money she continued drawing her stool close to the chair on which i sat depositing the paper of poison in her pocket she watched with eager eyes while i drew forth my pocketbook and counted to her the money which i had intended to have given ellen stevens and for which purpose i had it murder of mrs master near niagara falls about me her looks kindled with a wild and hellish animation as she gazed upon the gold and when i gave her a twentydollar bill to make up the required sum her eyes flashed with rage give me gold she said i want not your flimsy paper i like the gold the bright and beautiful gold that sparkles with love and happiness and as she spoke she grasped the coin with a violence that made the blood swell up her withered veins i have no more gold i replied but will bring you more tomorrow and will add the like sum to it on your informing me who administered the powder to miss allworthas i would like to engage that person to do the same for me bring me the gold she replied and i will tell you tell me now i answered and i will double the sum how am i to know that you will keep your promise said she however i will trust youone ellen stevens an ungrateful hussy she handed me the powder and i rose from my seat and said now monster in womans shape i go to get those who will punish you for your crimes she made a rush at me but she was too feeble to proceed far she stopped and shaking her withered arm at me said go i defy them to punish methey can not swear that powder killsthey can find no trace of poison in itit defies all their skill i waited to hear no more but joining my friend we returned to ellens and told her that what she had stated was true not saying anything about our having ascertained that she administered the poison we then proceeded to the mayors and procured a warrant for their arrest they are both in the city there is a warrant from the chief magistrate of this city to arrest you i wish to give you time to collect evidence to defend this charge as i as well as my father am concerned that you may prove yourself guiltless and i have therefore delayed the execution of the warrant he stopped and waited for me to reply there was yet a chance of escape delay was all i required i knew and felt my guilt i replied firmly and calmly that i was not guilty of the deed attributed to me that it was a gross conspiracy and that if he would get bail for my appearance to answer the charge i was confident i could procure two material witnesses from philadelphia who would prove that it was all a gotup conspiracya pack of most flagrant lies as well as of imposition the very idea of thinking for a moment that poison would show no effects of its existence in the human frame for the space of a month and that there it left no inward trace behind was perfectly preposterous convinced by my arguments and anxious to prove me guiltless he consented to my proposal we went at once to a magistrate i delivered livered myself up bail was entered for my appearance and i was again free by the advice of the lawyer engaged to defend me a trusty messenger was dispatched to philadelphia to procure the two witnesses i required or rather professed to require as i knew of none it was merely a scheme to gain time to develop a plan i had made in my own mind by blood i had fallen into trouble by blood i should escape there was no other means by which to get two months to complete my plans for before that time nothing further could be heard from philadelphia ellen stevens and the old hag remained in custody though treated kindly and well i attended to my business as formerly five years had passed since the death of my father when i looked back upon it what a short space it appeared yet through what a variety of changes had i gone then i was innocent happy and free from guilt now i was a selfcondemned wretch deserving the punishment which others less guilty have often received ellen my loving doting wife was fonder more devoted than ever she believed firmly that my accusers were base and their asseverations false and daily as i received her kind attentions how i repented my former hastiness of temper that had brought me into such trouble and utter ruin both of body and soul there seems to hang over some in this world a fate which guides them to that which their conscience dictates to be wrong i am one of those a month had passed i found there was no longer time for delay so i collected all the ready money i could possible call together and engaged a passage in a vessel bound for liverpool on board of which i had sent a quantity of goods the agent of the vessel knew nothing about me save that i was an extensive merchant the vessel was to sail on the th of july  this was the th i had determined and agreed to join a party going by an overland route to new york via st louis on the same day they knew nothing of me the crime i have contemplated i was resolved on committing first to gratify my revenge on ellens brother secondly for jealousy lest another might hereafter enjoy her affections my reason for engaging the two routes will be shown hereafter the evening of the th came i left my office my pockets well lined with cash on my way home i met the two marauders whom i had employed to execute my purpose they followed me and after entering the house i admitted them privately by a gate into a small garden at the rear of the house where they were enabled to conceal themselves i had told them when they heard a pistolshot to commence operations by entering the kitchen binding the servants and after rifling the house to make off as fast as they could the house was situated in a lonely part of the town well fitted for the purpose we were engaged in i went up stairs unnoticed by the servants as i had a latchkey to admit myself not finding my wife in the sittingroom i entered our chamber she lay asleep with our infant in her arms how beautiful she lookedso innocentso happyand so lovely had i not the heart of a monster i would have fallen upon my knees and embraced her praying god to forgive me for the crimes i had committed and the thoughts i entertained as it was i walked to the bedside stooped and softly gave her a kiss and as i did so a happy smile seemed to cross her countenance tears burst involuntarily from my eyes and i was on the point of relinquishing my foul ideas whenrevenge love of life selfishnessname it what you willan evil thought predominatedthe tempter succeeded i had previously quietly bolted the door ascending from the kitchen to the other apartments i drew a pistol from my breast fired and lodged the contents in ellens body i rushed from the room and as i reached the halldoor i heard the stifled screams of the servants as the two burglars secured them warned for the time of action by the report of the pistol all was not yet complete i hurried to meet ellens brother with whom i had made an appointment that evening on meeting him i pleaded in excuse for not going to the place we had appointed that i wished to go on board the vessel bound for liverpool as i understood she was to sail early in the morning and i wished to know whether all my goods had been put on board i asked him to accompany me he consented a boatman whom i had previously engaged and who belonged to the party that stopped and plundered my house as we went upon the wharf immediately hailed us with want a boat sirs we were rowed to the vessel inquired of the mate if the goods were aboard were answered satisfactorily and we left on our way back when midway between the shore and the vessel all calm dark and still naught to guide us but the lights on shore i suddenly clapped my hand to my victims mouth while with the other i seized him firmly by the collar my partner in guilt pulling in his oars caught hold of his legs and lifted them in spite of his struggles over the side of the boat we then both shoved him in under the water in spite of his most desperate struggles gradually he became weaker and weaker we let go our hold and he sank to rise no more and as he sank what a look he gave meso horrible that it would haunt my dreams aye my waking senses were i to live for ever from the time our crime was committed we neither spoke a wordsilently but swiftly my partner in guilt rowed us ashore he let the boat go loose i handed him the price nominated for his guilt he was satisfied and we parted nine months have gone by i am still freewandering about and knowing not where to lay my head i gambled away my money in st louisjoined in every scene of debauchery in the hope of drowning the burning thoughts within my breast bowl after bowl i quaffed but in vainit maddens but it does not soothe i am in new yorki have yet a few hundred dollars left in an old paper which i took up accidentally my eye was caught by the following san franciscothe whole of our city has been thrown into greater excitement save by the revolutionary cities of europe than we have ever heard or read of the circumstances as near as we can gather are as follows on thursday last the bark mary was to sail for liverpool a large portion of the cargo belonged to mr henry madison well known to the mercantile world on wednesday evening rather late mr madison accompanied by his brotherinlaw mr wilson came along side of the vessel rowed by a single man mr madison inquired of the mate whether all his goods were aboard and was answered in the affirmative wishing the mate goodnight the boat pulled toward the shore in the morning when inquiry was made for mr madison as a sad occurrence had taken place at his residence which we shall presently relate he was nowhere to be found neither were his companions mr wilson or the boatman strict inquiries were made and the vessel alluded to was boarded the mate stated what we have already placed before our readers on the return of the boat from the vessel they discovered the head of a man above water they rowed quickly toward it and were horrified in finding it to be the body of one of those for whom they were searching mr wilson they took the body in and came ashore in the course of the day the boat in which the drowned man and mr madison were known to have been in was found driven by the tide beating against one of the south wharves no sign or trace of the boatman has been discovered as each incident of this most extraordinary occurrence has only reached us piece by piece our readers must pardon us for not giving it in a more regular form we now give a few more particulars regarding this mysterious transaction and hope in our second edition to place before our readers full particulars in a condensed form of the whole story on wednesday evening about halfpast seven oclock the report of a pistol proceeding from their mistresss chamber was heard by the servants of mr madison who lives in the outlets of the city they with one accord rushed up stairs but found the door which led from the kitchen to the apartments above fastened on the other side on their descending again to obtain some weapon whereby to burst the door in two men with their faces blackened and well armed rushed into the kitchen and before the servants were able to make any resistance firmly secured them they then proceeded to rifle the house they first went to the butlers pantry where the plate was kept and finding sufficient there to satisfy their fastidious taste they decamped leaving the unfortunate servants in durance vile they remained in this unpleasant situation till the morning when the milkman who came in by the rear of the house relieved their excitement and suspense notice was immediately dispatched to the city and the mayor accompanied by three officers proceeded to the spot what was their horror on arriving there to find the body of mrs madison weltering in blood and her infant child smothered by her side from the blood that flowed from the pistol shot that killed her we can inform our readers no further but hope in our second edition to be able to announce the arrest of the villains and perpetrators of this most murderous outrage let me pen the rest quickly i have one crime more to relate ere i extinguish that life which has been a curse to the world and a burden to myself i left new york and went to boston i had not been more than three months there when one day i met ellen stevens she was little altered we both started on recognizing one another i felt that i was in her power that she if no other one truly devised the san francisco affair i thought it best to curry favor with her secure her friendship and then take my own time and place to get rid of her love of life now predominated over all other feelings either of revenge hatred or elfish gratification i feared the punishment from man due for my crimes and therefore dreaded to meet my god ellen stevens received my overtures and we became more closely bound than ever however as we were both fond of pleasure our funds which were already scanty began quickly to disappear she proposed for us to go to her fathers in the village of cambridge near boston who had often written to her to come and visit him and her mother both understanding her to be married as she stated they had some money which we might be able to secure and as i had become a gambler and a drunkard in addition to my other heinous villanies i neither heeded nor cared whither i went or what became of me we accordingly started for the old couples i passed as ellens husband they received us affectionately little did they imagine the viper they were receiving into the bosom of their friendship we stopped for four weeks getting tired of the monotonous course of life which they pursued i inquired of stevens what she meant to do she replied stop with her father and mother repent the past and endeavor to behave better for the futureand she hoped i would leave as if on businessa few days after my absence she would break all to her parents pledging her most solemn oath that she would never tell aught concerning my past life i agreed to this and left the house resolving to be avenged and to make sure of her death who held my life in her hands i repaired to the village inn and on entering the barroom i rejoiced to see the boatman of san francisco his appearance there at the very time i needed such service as he could render seemed almost as if the evil one had specially sent him there to help to plunge me into more crime our arrangements were quickly made we were to attack the farmers house that night i promised mcgee the boatman a rich booty night came we reached the family yard no lights burned in the house when we were within forty yards of the house a dog began to bark furiously a window was raised and a voice which i recognized to be the old mans demanded who is there we still advanced the question was again asked no reply from us was given a gun shotand mcgee fell a corpse i rushed to the hall door and with a small crowbar which i had taken from mcgee as he fell burst it open i rushed up stairs and at the door of his room met the farmer armed and about to fire in a second i dashed the gun from his hand and with one blow laid him lifeless his wife alarmed by the fall of her husband had risen from the bed and was rushing to his aid when i served her in the same manner footsteps coming up the stairs now warned me to depart i leaped from the window and narrowly escaped being caught by two laborers that had come from the rear of the house i fled i reached the village waited till the earliest dawn and then hiring a horse from a party who knew me started for boston arrived there i put up the horse at a stable saying i would call again and started by train for new jersey i arrived at camden stayed a day theremy mind in a state of madness it must be solife is no longer endurablei will diethe river flows swiftly byno eye is upon methis rock suits well my purposethe pistol firedand i drop into the stream to be hurled into the oceans depth farewell then to lifewhich to some has been a blessing but to me a curse one gratification bears me throughi am revenged on those who did me harm appendix the body of madison was found lying on the rock on which he was seated when he committed the act of suicide he had apparently fallen backward on the discharge of the pistol the top of the skull was blown off a portion of the brain was scattered on the rock and the weapon with which he committed the act lay by his side the journal from which the foregoing extracts were taken was found on his person the curiosity of the reader will undoubtedly be excited and indeed he will be anxious to know the subsequent fate of ellen stevens who according to the tenor of the journal was left at cambridge on the discovery of the body and papers of madison an inquest was held on the body and the papers were placed at the disposal of the police of camden a telegraphic communication was sent to cambridge the premises of ellens father were searched but it appears that she had decamped from the fact that she was not to be found the police of boston and the neighboring towns were then put on the alert but their vigilance failed in the apprehension of the criminal she was then advertised in the public prints but with no better success no intelligence could be obtained of her until about a year after the discovery of the body of madison a girl calling herself adeline myers was at that time arrested and executed in california at the instance of the vigilance committee on a charge of murder adeline on being convicted of the charge on which she was arraigned confessed herself as the original ellen stevens and made disclosures which led to the following information it appears that with the death of her parents vanished all her resolution with regard to reformation the assassination of her parents at that particular time naturally led her to suppose that madison was in some way connected with the act and that he had some ultimate design with regard to herself she therefore availed herself of the opportunity to get possession of such money and valuables as were then in her fathers house and made her way to the city of new york assuming the name of harriet frame she there succeeded in obtaining a situation as waitingmaid to an elderly lady who chanced to be married to a young man of good appearance and address and who it appears had married the lady on account of her fortune the age of the lady was fortynine that of the gentleman only twentytwo the family name was master whether or not the gentleman had been addicted to profligacy previous to his marriage we have no account the disparity of the ages however of the married pair would lead us to suppose that there could be but little of affection existing between the couple the health of mrs master being delicate she spent most of her time in travel that mode of living having been recommended by her physicians at the time of the engagement made with ellen mrs master and her husband were preparing for a tour through the northern part of the states by way of niagara and detroit and thence to st louis the preceding extracts have said but little of the comparative beauty of ellen we may safely say however that compared with that of mrs master the preponderance was decidedly in her favor ellen also being considerably the younger of the two her health being unaffected and vivacity being somewhat a feature in her composition it is scarcely to be wondered at that she should receive a share of attention from mr master all things being in readiness mr and mrs master accompanied by ellen set out on their journey nothing of importance occurred until they reached niagara at that place the visible dislike of mr master for his consort was first made manifest in fact it was at that place he formed the resolution of ridding himself of her by some means many induced her on account of her infirmities to give him full power as to the management of her estate c he could lay his plans with perfect security so far as the loss of property was concerned ellen was not tardy in observing the dislike of the husband for the wife and she determined to profit by it as far as circumstances would admit she therefore spared no pains nor neglected any artifice to ingratiate herself into the favor of mr master as matters were progressing from one step to another mrs master could not help noticing the preference which her husband entertained for her maid and at length began to take measures for her dismissal but a trial soon proved that her efforts were altogether futile having become satisfied of her impotence she was under the necessity of bearing the insult of her position with as good grace as the nature of woman could admit when about to leave niagara a plan was devised by mr master and ellen to rid themselves of mrs master before their departure and journey without her accordingly when all things were arranged for their departure they induced mrs master one evening after the shades of night had settled to walk with them in the neighborhood of the falls they managed to induce her to walk near the precipice then they gently and in a very apparently proudly manner raised her over the precipicewhen accidently letting go their hold they let her drop and left her playing with the bubbles of water below having thus dispatched his wife on her final journey mr master and his paramour hastened to a conveyance which they had prepared for the occasion and drove immediately to chippewa thence they crossed to buffalo and took passage for detroit arrived at detroit master disguised himself with a wig mustachios c and assumed the name of fenton ellen of course became mrs fenton being now possessed of unbounded wealth and fenton also being somewhat accomplished in music and those little et ceters which are calculated to make one agreeable they found no difficulty of mingling in the best society and of allaying suspicion of any kind detroit however was not the kind of a place to detain them long it being more in accordance with their disposition to seek some larger city in which places of amusement were conducted on a larger and more magnificent scale they therefore took a formal farewell of the acquaintances which they had formed during their stay at the bidela house of that city and started in a private conveyance through the southern part of michigan traveling in the direction of toledo in the northern part of ohio there being nothing in toledo of sufficient moment to detain them they drove immediately to the island house discharged their conveyance took some little refreshments and immediately engaged a passage to cincinnati at toledo a circumstance occurred which liked to have proved fatal to the further progress of the guilty pair toledo it should be observed is situated at the head of navigation or near the western extremity of lake erie is the great thoroughfare of the tide of emigration which is flowing west via the lake shore railroad it is also the starting point for trains to different parts of the states of ohio michigan and indiana whilst waiting the time of the train for cincinnati ellen in the temporary absence of fenton turned her attention to her personal appearancebeing in perfect accordance with human nature in such cases anxious to stand as high in the affections of her pretended husband as neatness in the dress and other matters connected with the person could please him the accommodations in the ladies parlor of that house offering such superior facilities for adjustment ellen did not fail to avail herself of the opportunity to scan herself before the extensive mirror she accordingly unveiled herself and while in the act of contemplation a laborer formerly a resident of cambridge mass who knew ellen when she resided at that place and who was now emigrating to indiana chanced to pass through the hall on his way to the ticket office the door entering the ladies parlor was open at the time and by chance he caught a glimpse of ellen as she was standing before the mirror he at once thought he recognized her features but was at a loss to account for her superb and costly dress his suspicions however were excited and he determined to watch he therefore seated himself in one of the accomodation chairs in the hall and opposite the do or entering the parlor presently fenton made his appearance and escorted his lady to the cars the laborer then enquired of the landlord who it appears by some means had learned the name of fenton although his name was not entered on the book on hearing that the name was fenton the laborer concluded there must be some mistake and let the matter drop mr and mrs fenton were now snugly escorted in the cars for cincinnati with no other object in view than the pursuit of pleasure and the abundant means which they now had at their disposal rendered it possible for them to gratify their desires so far as desire can be gratified by any earthly enjoyment arrived at cincinnati they put up at the burnet house at which place they remained for a time and occupied themselves in visiting the theaters and such other places of amusement as the city at that time afforded variety is the spice of life is an old adage and experience taught mr and mrs fenton its truth having remained in cincinnati until they had become cloyed with the amusements afforded by that place they concluded to set forward in quest of other objects of enjoyment in pursuance of this design they embarked for st louis at which place they arrived in safety here again ellen was recognized by some person and as she was promenading one evening in company with fenton she was accosted as miss stevens the address of the person alarmed her but as the person who addressed her disappeared immediately in the crowd and was obscured by the shades of the night she lost sight of him and consequently had no means of ascertaining by whom she was recognized guilt is always cowardly and fear immediately took possession of the bosom of ellen she determined immediately to take further measures against recognition and possible apprehension concealing her real object from fenton she proposed to him as a sort of novelty that she should dress herself in male attire that they should provide themselves each with a mule and that they should take an overland route to california fenton whose affection for ellen was as yet unalloyed without much hesitation assented to the proposal accordingly they made arrangements for the journey and embarked in company with a caravan then about to start for santa fe nothing extraordinary occurred on the route they saw the usual number of indians and buffaloes slept on the prairie killed rattlesnakes forded rivers crossed mountains arrived safe at santa fe and ultimately at san francisco here however affairs took a change whether the appearance of ellen in her male attire was too masculine or whether it was from some other cause yet it is certain that the affection of fenton for his paramour began to decline subsequently he fell in with what in common parlance is called a flashy piece from new orleans ellen now became altogether supplanted and finally was cast off entirely she at this time took the name of adeline myers destitution created a desire for revenge and revenge she was determined to have accordingly she provided herself with a dirk and watching her opportunity as fenton on one occasion was walking with his new mistress she stabbed him to the heart a mob was the natural consequence and some of the vigilance committee happening to be on the ground ellen was immediately arrested she protested against the legality of her arrest imprisonment and the subsequent trial which was granted her in accordance with the forms adopted by the committee she was constrained however to succumb to the principle that might makes right and was ordered to prepare for execution a clergyman was provided for her at the instance of the committee when on the scaffold she was asked if she had any thing to say or any thing to disclose she then avowed herself as the original ellen stevens stated the circumstances attendant upon her brief career and died protesting against the legality of the acts of the vigilance committee the tables turned  tile   i tabless turned v being an interflsting incident fl th lvr ot iak small and ills companions  riciimoni ind lntia b and t committhiof friends  ii          the

been a good man and a good husband but mum ruined all his man hood aiil made a brute of him i can remember how cold and chaeeless was the first winter of my lit to which nay memory leads nay mind we md ito tire no food no clothes no joy no noth big nothing but misery and woe my poor another used to clasp inc to her bosom to keep me warm and once once i remember vlmemm her very tears froze on my check  how my mother prayed to god for her husband and i who could            th mats turnd btitjutsli iflattle learned to pray too and i nst m tia husband nd father etuih to i home ani i remember how my poor hiothe cued aiel trenbld  when i grew older  had to go out airl be ftr biead all od and shivering i ndvd througthe deep snow vith my clothes in tatttr and rhy freezing feet almost bare and i snw thr children dressed warm atul corn thrthie and i knew they vere happy for they laughedruid sang as they bounded along toward geijool those ys had sober fathers i knew that their fathets were no better than mine had been otwe for rn mother had told me how noble my own father could be if the accursed demon llzw were not in his ray but the fatal power was upon him and though he otten promised and though he often tried he could not escape time passel on mid i was eight years old and those eight years had been years of such sor sov and suffering as i pray god i may never sec inother experience at length one cold morning lii the dead of winter my father was not at horne he had not been at home through the night my mother gent me to th tavern to see it i could tind him i had gone half the way when i saw sonic thing in the snow by the side of the road i stop ped and a shudder ran through me for it ood like a hnman form i went up to it and turned tieiu tbic  rn          w the

own breast she loved her hus band through all his errors and her love was all powerful now the two men went away anti let the body still on the floor my mother vished m to come and kneel by her side i

horsemanship gymnastics and sword exercise at a school in philadelphia where these branches of a gentleman s educa tion were taught at this school i made the acquaintance of a young man named percy elmore who distinguished himself among the scholars by the most amiable qualities to the charms of a face at the same time handsome and noble he joined a cultivated mind the uncommon address which he displayed in our games the modesty with which he strove to conceal his own and to exalt the merits of his companions the urbanity of his manners the sereneness of his temper fixed the attention commanded the esteem and rendered him dear to that brilliant circle of youth who shared our labors and our pastime to say that it as a resemblance of clhracter that brought about a friendship between young elmore and myself would be praising myself very much but however that may hlave been it is certain that eve soon became very intimate how happy is that stage of existencebut oh how swiftly does it pass awaywhen we are yet ignorant both of lthe ambition which sacrifices everything to the pursuit of fortune and of glory and of that love which absorbs all our faculties and centres them upon one only object that are of innocent pleasures and of confiding cre dulity when the heart yet new follows freely the impulses of id      adventures of charles marsiat y rising sensibility and gives itself without division to the object of its disinterested affection then friendship is not merely a name the confidant of all the secrets of mr elmore i concealed on my part nothing from him his counsels ruled my conduct mine infu enced his and thus our school days had no pleasures which were not divided no cares which were not lightened by that pleasing reciproci ty of feeling with what grief i saw the fatal moment arrive when young elmore forced by paternal orders to quit philadelphia bade mne farewell we promised to preserve through all timethat strong attachment which had been the happiness of our youth and i boldly swore that the passions of a more advanced age should never adlter my feelings what a void was left in my heart by the absence of my friend at first it seemed to me that nothing could remunerate me for his loss the tenderness of a father the affection of my sisters when i too returned to my native town but slightly consoled me per ceiving that there was no other way to divert my mind from its grief than to occupy it with some useful labor i learned the french language and applied myself earnestly to the study of the politics of the country and the law several years were employed in these studies until at length they occupied me entirely percy elmore wrote to me often but received in return short and dull answers our correspondence languished more and more until at length love triumphed over friendship  my father had been for a long time an intimate friend of captain dunnin ton a  gentleman of great wealth renowned in our neigh borhood for his austerity of manner and for the inflexibility of his attachment to the political principles he espoused mr dunnington might well be called a brave manias a politician for he had signa lized himself by freely expending his money in more than one campaign like those ancient heroes of whom we read captain dunnington would have sacrificed all his wealth to the prosperity and success of his party he would have shed the last drop of his blood in defence of the platform of his principles he would even have sacrificed his only daughterhis dear cornelia cornelia how beautiful she was how much i loved her  her lear name is ever upon my lipsher adored image in my heart  when i had seen her ithenceforth saw nothinghut her iabandon ed mystudies my friendship was entirely forgotten i consecrated all my moments to cornelia it was impossible that my father or rs should long remnain ignorant of my attachment but they spoke   and hs lost bride cornelia duntinglton     not of it and therefore i supposed approved it i accordingly en joyed without inquietude my new and blissful emotion i contrived to see her almost every day either at her own home or at that of my sisters whom she loved very much thus two years passed away during which time i paid no particularattention to political matters        at length captain dunnington called me aside one day and said to me your father and myself charles have hitherto founded great hopes upon you which your conduct at first seemed to justify for  we saw you during a long time employ yourself in labors as honora ble as they are useful now he saw that i was abeut to interrupt him and prevented me what would you say to me do you suppose that you can tell mne anything of which i am ignorant is it necessary for me to be every day a witness of your transports to know how much cor nelia merits to be loved it is because i know as well as you what she deserves that you shall never obtain her except by meriting her young man know that it is not enough that weaknesses are legitimate to make them excusable those of a good citizen fought all to turn to the profit of his country for even love itself would be like the viler passions contemptible and dangerous if it did not offer to generous hearts one motive the more to excite them to honor listen the strength of our party in this congressional district is failing and i wish to be its candidate for congress this has awakened the ambition of my personal opponents and they are preparing themselves without doubt to sow dissension among us they design by forcing the suffrages of  the people to give us a nomination of their choice already a number of active young men have started out canvassing votes for me go at once to the citythis very dayand join yourself to that patriotic band which i have had secretly organized there show yourself by your actions during the campaign to be worthy of my daughter here is a letter of instructions follow them      i took the letter and did not hesitate a moment my father ap proved my decisionhe belonging to the same partybut it was with reluctance that he consented to my precipitate departure that day captain dunnington was present when i bade cornelia farewell it was a sad moving scene for she had read so much about the dangers attendant upon an election campaign in a city which con tained its secret bands of organized politicians that she greatly feared for my safety she wept freely adventures of charles marsbbhal       ad dry your tears child he said to her toically or keep them until after you are wedded it is not fitting for my daughter to weep over a brief separation from her lover cornelia turned pale sighed glanced blushingly at her father and assured me with a trembling voice that her prayers should hasten my return and that her happiness was in my hands thus encouraged what danger could appal me i departed and attached myself to one of the political clubs of the city but noth ing occurred in the course of that campaign for nominating a can didate for congress worthy to be recorded except that by general consent captain dunnington was laid aside in order to give room for a new aspirant with the distinct understanding however that the former should receivethe nomination for governor by the con vention for selecting the candidate for that office which wouldeet in a few months hence i returned home full of impatience and joy not doubting but that i might immediately claim the hand of cornelia horrible news awaited me i hadno longer a father for i learned that he had died four days previously of ppoplexy  he was already buried thus i  had not even the sad consolation of receiving the last blessing of the most tender of parents i could only go tohia tomb which i watered with my tears on returning from the graveyard i  met captain dunnington who seemed but little moved at my grief it is not with useless tears said he to me that the i memory of a  father like yours should be honored our party mourns in him a herocitizen who would have usofullyserved it in the ap proaching crisis he was formerly a member of assembly from this district and doubtlesswould have been selected as a delegate to the gubernatorial convention and on the choice of the delegate to that body from this district depends my nomination of all the rights your father has transmitted to you that of representing this district in the forthcoming convention if you are selected is with out doubt the most important it is in such positions that he ought tolive again in you if you are appointed as the delegate which i  doubt not you will be you will have to exhibit a courage far grieater than that which onsists only in braving death upon the battle field the valor of the soldier is only a common virtue but they are no ordinary men who preserving a tranquil courage n   the greatest emergencies of state discover the projects of pow ryrful conspirators defeat dangerous plots affront hardy factions       adajsntures of charles marsiali who ahays firm incorruftible and just give their suffrages to him only whom they deem most worthy who consider nothing but the welfare of their country  whom neither gold nor golden promises can seduce whom prayers cannot move nor menaces alarm these arevirtues which distinguishedyour father this is the truly pre cious meritage you ought to receive from him  the day when a candidatefor the next governor is nominated will be the certain epoch in which will be manifested the pretensions of several citizens who are more occupied with their personal in terests than watchful of the prosperity of their country and their party and of the pernicious designs of our opponents whose policy would destroy the strength of our land by dividing it charles i much deceive myself or the time is at hand which will forever fix the destiny of my future political life my enemies are conspmiring my political ruin they have prepared in secret conclave a plan to again thwart my ambition wthich if i can help it they shall never consummate i wish you to second my efforts i cannot now give you my daughter because i consider the organization of our party is in danger but i promise you that whenfyoue bring me the news that i hae receiveqd the nomination for governor you ishall have her  cap etain dunnington w as a monomaniac in politics and as i knew his nature i listened to him calmly i was well aware i should have many important duties to perform in order to secures him the nomination for he was not very popular r ith the younger members of the party to which he belonged but i undertook them the more freely because they would in some degree divert my mind from its harrowing grief caused by my fathers demise i avow it with shame that the sadness and compassionate grief of my sisters was banished by tme more reserved but not the less valued caresses of cornelia i saw that she was affected at my irreparable loss and as much afflicted as myself at the cruel events which deferred our marriage my grief thus shared became sensibly lessened in the meantime the convention was called i had been appointed a delegate and made my way to the county town the day on which it was to open and at the moment i was about to repair to the courthouse wherein it was held an unknown person presented himself in my room at the hotel and requested to see me privately when the servant who conducted him to my apartment retired the stranger threw himself into my arms and embraced me it was percy elinore the four years which had ragsed since our separia      a       and hs

ssistance whilst the other with all mty aid stood no chance f ol er inr t i passed the entire night in that uncertainty  and whteerfo i    asse te n tons determined to effect some sort of a reconciliations i found neither him nor his daughter one of the men cpmloyed on the alntation informed me that the captain had departed the previous pevening with cornelia i inquired whether themn hald gone teiam ignoranf of that rpi te man all i can t   that ou had scarcely gone from here yesterday evening when  noise was heard in the apartment of his daughter being near the chamber door atthe time i ventured to listen miss crnelia wept whilst ierfather furious withswrath swore and iheard him say she whi able to love iirator is able to be one ungrateful girl i hal place you in a safe retreat where you will hereafter be shielded frcm seduction  s   adventures op charles marshall how great now was my misery i went home and mounted a hlors e determined to search the country over until i found her while in this frame of mind and undecided what course to take in order tolearn the whereabouts of my betrothed i received a letter from galveston texas in which it was stated that i would find it to mi advantage to come to that city as those i sought were then there i immediately set out for galveston and after a jour ney of five weeks reached my destination i could find no one however who had seen or heard tell of them i concluded i was thus led astray and duped by captain dunningtons cunning in or derthat i might be cured of any future attempt at finding his daughter i i was about returning and had just settled my bill at the hotel when on going to the reading room i was accosted by a rather rakishlooking person who told me that for a hundred dollar in cash he would put me in possession of the lady in whom i appeared to be so much interested surprised at the fellows unex pected appearance as well as curious proposition i questioned hm as to the lady s name  to my astonishment he mentioned it and said she was imprisoned in a small farm house about nine miles distant to this place towards evening he conducted me after i had paid him his price however instead of finding her i  so anxiously sought the moment i entered the door of the hut for it was nothing else i was roughly seized by a couple of branny fel lows who commenced robbing me of everything i possessed on pain of being instantly shot i gave up my watch breastpin and money without making any show of resistance one of them then took possession of my coat placing on me his ragged one for a substitute after noting me for a love sickfool the pair of villains together with my rascaliy conductor started off in high glee with three cheers for captain dunnington  prior to their leaving me i was bound hand and foot and tightly fastened with my back to the wall i  struggled in vain to undo the cords that confined me by the wrists and was about giving up in despair when to my horror and astonishment i found the villains had fired the cabin on the outside in a  few minutes the clapboard roof was in a blaze and the room i   was in became instantly filled with smoke soon the flames were crackling over my head and large pieces of the blazing roof were falling upon me  the idea of being burnt alive was shocking and i  renewed my exertions to free myself from my bonds the fire was becoming hotter ai hotter and i was on the point of being roasted alive when fortunately a piece of burning board fell and lodged directly on my two wrists which were tied to and hs lost bride cornelia dunnington    gether the cuffs of the old coat were quickly on fire as was also the rope which confined me the pain was excruciating but i suffjred the awful torment until the rope burnt sufficiently to allow me to break it which i did by a superhuman effort the moment my wrists were free i began untying the cord which bound me to the wall scarcely having done which the entire room was in a blaze i darted out the door with all speed and itwas lucky idid for at that moment the roof fell in with a terrible crash  i was now in a miserable plight and regretted having allowed myself to be decoyed into so foul a snare but there was no help for it so i wended my way back to galveston resolved on the next day to wreak my vengeance on the foul villains who had thus misused me and i further determined that in case i met captain dunnington he should answer to me personally for the vile acts of his hired emmissaries it was midnight when i reached galveston and the streets were deserted i made my way to the hotel where my appearance excited the sympathy of the landlord and several of the guests who had not yet retired all were loud in their condemnation of the villain ous outrage which had been perpetrated upon me and a company was made up to go in search of the authors of the deed the next morning my wrists were but slightly injured by the fire and i agreed to accompany the party who one and all made up their minds to hang the rascals without mercy should we catch them at seven in the morning the body of mounted men who were to accompany were all in readiness and we made directly for the cabin to which i had been decoyed we found a mass of smouldering embers a division of the force was then agreed upon somegoing north and the others west  the party which i accompanied soon came upon the trail of the desparadoes who had taken a short cut through a freshy ploughed field after half an hours hard riding we sudden ly came in view of them as they were sitting round a liquor bottle busily engaged in a game of cards we rode in upon them with a shout and in a few minutes had them prisoners they prayed us mercy but it was not granted one of them earnestly entreated  me to spare him and in answer to my question as to what part captain dunnington had taken in the matter he replied that that gentleman had only intimated to them that he wished me to be laughed at not abused but that the sight of the watch and the  money i was supposed to be the possessor ofwas the sole incentive which led them to rob and bind me and that in order to cover the crime of the robbery they had set the hut on fire this villain i s dadventures op charles marsralt woild haie spared but the gentlemen who accompanied me insisted on serving them all alike we now formed ourselves into a court tried them and found them guilty of robbery and an attempt to murder they were sentenced to be hanged to the nearest tree allowing them half an hour to pray but one of them however availed himself of the benefits of prayer while the other two heaped upon us all manner of imprecations the tilne allowed being up we commenced hanging them lthis was quickly gone through with and a hole being scraped out of the soft earth with some pointed sticks we huddled them together and covered them over with dirt and leaves we then returned to galveston from whence after remaining a a few days longer i took my departure for home having lost eight weeks in my painful search i now resolved to seek for her in the various cities after much inquiry in new york i came upon a person wuho had seen captain dunnington the day before i sent this party to seek out the place where he was stopping if possible and bring me word i instructed him when he once saw the captain not to lose sight of him but to follow him wherever he went in twodays my agent returned and apprised me that he had observed the captain take a carriage and ride in the direction of the jersey city ferry whither he followed him  the river was crossed with my spy on the same boat with the captain and when the slip was reached both parties started on foot night was fast approaching yet the captain walked briskly on up the street and out of the town still followed by my agent the sun sunk below the earth and the stars refused to shine but the pedestrian walked on  several hours passed and there was as yet no si m that the captains journey was concluded by this time he wis aware that he was watched  at length ite stopped to rest himself and cast a glance towards the man who was following him my agent secreted himself behind some old ruins to screen himself from observation  presently the captain rushed up and seized him jad vwith a pistol in his hand forced him to confess who it was that

as follows s brave a man as you are oughtto be generous i ask  you my life friend instead of killing me bind up this dreadful wound in my arm  he craved quarter in so piteous a manner that i assisted him to his feet i then took from my pocket a handkerchief and bandaged his arm whilst doing this i observed a crowd of ten or twelve men hastily descending the side of the mountain on which we were standing a horrid presentiment of instant death came over me for my pistol then contained but a single cligge i the robber be side me noticing my fear and algitation sjd in a calm voice fear nothina yung man i am the leader of those men and they will not harm you when they see that i am alive  by a signal of his hand he checked the approach of the band who were hastening towardss he then spoke again i fnend the day is now departing and i adviseyou not to travel farther down this mountain tonight some of mymen areontheir l ts and as i cannot see them until tomorrow i will not be re senible for your safety below here you will find a pathway that leadsto a rude though striongly built house belonging to a rich old  who rillain as he is once did me i grevious injury go you s ththous and ask nhim to give   wn  for the nllt o     j dventures of charles marshall tell him you were beset by the robbers and that you had wounded their leader hemust knomw me because i have already caused him some unhappy days he robbed me of my patrimony when i was an infant and made me what i am do not leave there in less than three daysif he will allow you to stay and make your visit last no longer than eight the advice of the robberchief with his dozen assassins but a hundred yards from me was of course not to be refused  therefore i quickly mounted my horse and pursued the path which struck off from the main road a few rods farther down the mountain it led me down into a deep and rugged ravine through which it ran for several miles at length i came to what appeared to have once been an old stone castle with a high tower still standing there was a ditch surrounding the building over which led a drawhridge there was however no waterin the ditch jumping from my horse i fastened him to a tree going to the gate i rapped loudly an extremely ugly negro answered my summons and demanded my name  i  answered that my name was dunnington for i had travelled under this cognomen the better to mislead the father of cornelia should he hear of any one making inquiry after his daugh ter presently fwas admitted the negro informed me that the master was away and would not return until the morrow hehowever wel comed me a  frugal repast was spread of which i partook and at an early hour i retired to bed in a room on the ground floor i soon fell asleep and did not awaken until daybreak on trying to pass out i found the door locked on the outside so that i could not open it and i made my exit from the room through a window into a  garden beautifully and tastefully laid out after walking about a  few minutes i seated myself on stone bench at the foot of the tower and occupied myself in observing its singular architecture while thus absorbed in thought a piece of slate the dropped upon me apparently from the roof of the old building and to avoid a similar accident i removed to the opposite end of the bench a few minutes afterwards a second piece of slate fell near me the accident seemed surprising i arose alarmed i examined the tower attentively and perceived at the distance of twentyfive or thirty feet from the top a window i picked up the tiles that hd been cast down and on the first i deciphered these words scratched with a  pin    charles is it you you still live on the second was written oh deliver mesave cornelia   ald hs lost bride cornelia dunnington     it is impossible for any one to imagine what averse sentiments agitated me at that moment my astolishment my grief my em btrrassment were inexpressible i examined the prison of cornelia and sought how i should be able to rescue her from it she threw down another piece of slate on which i read at midnight bring me paper ink and pen and attach them to a string you will find dangling from the window tomorrow after the sun rises look for a letter in the garden depart now tesu rseslok  i returned to my room through the window and reclosed the blinds how could i penetrate into the tower and how could i perform this in the short space of three days the time at which i wished to take my departure these thoughts occupied my mind greatly and it was horrible to contemplate that i might not be able to surmount the obstacles that lay in the way of rescuin ornelia from the prison in which she was confined but for what as fhe in that frightful prison the letter which she promised me would doubtless iniform me and it became necessary to procure the writing materials eye the return of the master of the house who i was well convinced was some particular friend perhaps a relative of captain dunnin gtons breakfast was served me by the negro who had likewise carefully attended to the wants of my horse from him also i procured the writing materials i then strolled around the place and through the garden until noon when i was apprised mr hubbard the owner of the place had arrived i presented ysl to him with all the assurance i couldicommand under the circum stances he was a man about fifty years of age of rough and epulsive manners he asked me who i was i informed him as i had previously done the negro my uncle captain dunningtop said is has given me a secret mission for you but in order to explain that mission i must be alone with you on my way hither i was attacked by a gang o out laws the leader of which i wounded severely with ball from my pistol with a move of his hand the negro who was present when i made up to mr hubbard left the apartment captain dunnington sent me began i see it very wellthat he sent you answerd hubbarl to askstammered is what he inquired i took courage to ask news of his daughter continued i news of his daughter answered he r  ar so      abdvexttry bov cjarles mabrsatt mr dunnington said ityes captain dunnington said his daughter cornelia was here i  saw hubbard tuiirn pale he looked at me a long time in silence  you astonish me said he at length s captain dunnington must have been very imprudent to have trusted you with a secret of so great importance not more than you would do sir replied i have you no confi dant we would be a very unfortunate set of people if we could place no confidanie in any one captain dunnington bade me say to you that young marshall the traitor to whom his daughter was engaged has already traveledi over a great part of the contr in search of her and that there is a probability he will visit this seo i tion if he dares to come here said hubbardj suddenly i will give him a lodging he will occupy for a long time do you know this young marshall  have often seen him at my uncies i answered he is said to be a handsome man continued he he is well formed and about my height i believe replied i care lesly  he is an insolant fellow remarked hubbard  and if ever he fal into my hands hell rue it it is a long time since dulnning ton wrote to me where is he i have particular instructions xfrom him  not to mention his whereaboutsall i dare say to you is that he is near and will see you soon he is concealing his retreat for sotme purpose unknown to mni probably not wishing young marshall to know he is still in the country i answered l hubbard seemed greatly astonished i thought even i saw signs of fear he seemed much embarrassed s do you say dunnington will be here soon asked he yes returned  in a couple of weeks at farthest he looked again at me and suddenly affected as much indifference as he had before shown of embarrassment said    return to your uncle i am sorry i have nothing but bad news to send him tell him that cornelia isnot here t i was in turn greatly surprised what said i cornelia is not here i tell you answered he to oblige dunnington whom hesteem i undertook with repugnance the care of his daugh ter no person excepting myself and the negro joe knew ihe

which still boundmy rists n which nally succeeded  i was pacing up and down the apart ment with rapid strides after i had freed my limbs when suddenly i heard hubbards voice crying joe get your gun quick  the house is attacked  frightful noises now resounded on every side of the old building tion within and the old negro who had thbere was a great co oinw            pesnl acted as sentinel at my room door rushed away hurriedly presentl i heard the soundof many voices among which i could distinguish that of hfiubbard by its loud tone i now heard the report of several guns and the groans o f some one in the agonies of death the noise fora moment was very great but after a cry of triumph the fearful uproar gave place to as fearfula silence soon a roar ing sound struck my earthere was a hissjng noise in the airthe night became less dark and the trees in the garden were tinged w ith red and yellow hues       adventures of charles marshat t i flew to the window the flames were devouring the old castle they approached on every side the room in which i was confined and to complete the horror the most piercing screams proceeded from the tower where i knew cornelia was imprisoned the reader may well be penetrated with a sense of the horror of my situation the fire becomingmore and more fierce had reached my room and already the flames were battling around the foot of the tower from whence cornelia sent forth shriek upon shriek to which i responded bycries of fury  suddenly i heard the voice of hubbard begging for mercy and the tramping of feet in the passage near my door i battered and  kicked against it uhtil those without heard me they opened my prison with a blow of an axe and one of them seized me he wa about to stab me with a dagger when i recognized in him the rober chief i threw myself at his knees and spoke to him he remem bered me oh it is you is it said he  itisit is gasped i but oh sir there is a womanmy be trothedin that tower and she will be burnt alive let me out to assist her go said he and i rushed out and to the foot of the tower where was lying a  long ladder with superhuman strength i raised it and placed it against the wall it barely reached the open wrin dow at which cornelia was now standing i darted up with light ning speed and soon had her in my arms she was almost senseless from suffocation and feebly asked  who comes to me it is i charles cried i as i commenced descending with my precious burden the flames meanwhile roaring around every step of the ladder trembled under my feet arrived at the foot of the burning tower her joy at her deliver ance renewed her strength  several of the robbers now came upy shouting hes a brave fellow and deserves her at this stage of the proceedings the tower as well as the sur rounding walls fell to the earth with a terrific crash burying in its ruins the wounded negro who lay groaning in agony in the garden then the robbers brought forth hubbard he was bound with cordsrage terror despair everything which could rack the heart of a tortured villain glowed in his rolling eyes he beat the ground with his feet and uttering horrible blasphemies reproached heaven with its just vengeance                      and hs lost bridie cornelia dunnington         a the meantime my beloved pressed my hand in hers ah said she  charles we have escaped but one evil we are still in the hands of villains for these men i am sure are the robbers of whom i have heard my persecutor hubbard so often speak  perhaps worse than death awaits us no no corneliathe robberchief is my friend you speak aright said the leader at this moment approach ing us but come tell me you were in the lower room and the lady was in the tower why was that ill wager a bet that you you rogue were trying to carry off that maiden from that old butcher there pointing to hubbard and you were right he is a deep blackhearted villain and she is beautiful come explain this to me i explained to him the particulars of our love up to the time i entered the castle and the robber seemed satisfied so far as i was concerned but he demanded of cornelia a history of her sufferings first assuring her that we were both safe for the present wine was then offered us from a flask of which we partook cornelia then spoke as follows when i was taken from home by my father he brought me hither and placed me in the care of hubbard i have not seen him since some days after his departure the visits of this wicked old man became more frequent and longer certain words which he uttered to me on one occasion on bringing me food led me to suspect that his designs were infamous he dared one day to ex plain them to me and i assured him that my worst hatred only should be the return of his tenderness he answered me coolly at he time and said that after a while i would become more accustom ed to his presence and suffer his assiduities and even to desire them separated as i was from everything i loved and closely confined by my tyrant for he informed me i was his prisoner i had not even the feeble consolation of being able to give myself tranquilly the remembrance of my past happiness the only wit ness of my anxieties and miseries he seemed to take pleasure in augmenting them on one occasion he came to me and assured me that you charles had been killed by my father by the bar barous joy he affected i believed the news to be true unpitying tyrant  i cried to him leave me leave me he did so about  oclock that night i heard my door softly opened and by the light of a lamp which i always kept burning i saw the tyrant ap proaching my bedside i had feared this and was well prepared to prevent it i had armed myself with a knife which i had taken     adventures op aharles marsmat the precaution to conceal beneath my pillow i heaped upon the accursed miscreant the reproaches he justly merited and vowed to him that if he daredto approach i would stab him with my own hands he recoiled with surprise and afright i am tired of bearing your contempt said he in going out and if i did not want you for something more pleasant you would see what the arms of a woman could do against me but i know a sure way to conquer your pride soon you shall think yourself too happy to purchase your pardon by the most humble submission he went out some moments afterwards the negro entered pistol in hand i must do him justicehe wept in announcing to me the orders of his master dress yourself madame you must follow me it was all he was able to say he conducted me to the upper room in the tower where but for you i would have perished he locked me in that horrible prison there i languished more than a month without fire without light without clothes with bread and water for my nourishment a simj e pallet for my bed only one thing served to render my misery bearable i saw the tyrant no more while he waited tranquilly for me to solicit his pardon i passed whole days and nights in calling upon my father and weeping for my lover oh charles with what astonishment was i seized with what joy was my soul penetrated the day that i recognized you in thegarden the chief of the robbers listened attentively to the history of her misfortunes with which he appeared deeply affected all of a sudden a noise resembling the trampling of horses was heard it was now daybreak and on looking up i observed a crowd of mounted men approaching the robbers with the exception of the chief immediately took to their heels and vanished hubbard then cried  ah i you perfidious wretchesl you loving couple you still have not conquered me the neighboring gentlemen have heard of my misfortunes and have come to xeeor me they shall not at all events have the power to do more than avenge your death villain it said the robber as he placed a ptstol to his ear and was about to despatch him when cornelia begged bhim not to do so the gentlemen on horseback bow rode up and at their head was captain dunnington as soon as he perceived me he cried wreth you have not only betrayed me and my daughter   and hs lost bride cornelia ifunnrngton    the woman who loved you but i here find you associating with rob bers in their hellish deeds he jumped froi his horse and pointed a pistol at me cornelia sprang for his arm as he fired it and the contents entered the brain of hubbard who had by this time risen to his feet great was the consternation of those who assembled around the body of hub bard as he lay dead a stillness the most dreadful ensued taking advantage of this i asked captain dunnington as well as the ba lance of the company to listen to a recital of cornelias sufferings which i now begged her to give  this she did without hesitation reciting what the reader already knows dunnington was deeply affected by the sufferings of his child and instantly became sensible of the important service i had rendered her regarding me without wrath he appeared anxious for me to speak which i now did captain said i do i not deserve cornelia for my wife we have long loved each other  give her to me and bless us i will charles said he smiling you deserve her and i should have long since noticed it had i not been blinded by political ambition and a false sense of honor she is yours take her and be happy during this the robber chief had glided from among us unno ticed and i have never seen him since well gentlemen said one of those who had accompanied cornelias father  who is this dead man and what shall we do with him he is an old slave dealer who has lived here many years in seclusion the particulars of his life are known to me alone fear ing the halter for some of his bloody deeds he broke jail many years ago in rhode island accompanied by a negro and came here i was then living in this neighborhood and knew his secret from hie own lips i promised to save him from the officers of the law provided he would lead an honest life in future which he constantly assured me he was doing  i however heard yesterday that he robbed the children of a widow of this property by inducing her to sign a will in his favor when she was about dying by that will he obtained the title to the old castle or house here now in ruins and which was the former residence of the lady who tookl him and his negro friend in outof ch       m   nd hi negro friend in out of charity i wonder

the proper tribunal you are all witnesses that i meaat at least nov to kill him although my pur epose was a deadly one towards the preserver of my child horses were furished for cornelia and myself from the still unharmed stabling of hubbard and the entire party started for the village of waynesboro which was distant but a few miles arrived  theire a corloners jury returned to the body of hubbard where an inquest was held on it the verdict was  accidental shooting i made no complaint of course against my future fatherinlaw and no further judicial proceedings were had after a few days of rest i led ornelia to the altar receiving her from athe hands of her father a week  or two more found us agtcome where my sisters gladly welcomed us since then we  have enjoyed unglall oyed happiness sweetened by the frequent re currence to the sad misfortunes of our early love charles l marshall belshazzar or the fall of babylon a tale of the orient by theron b appell new haven tuttle morehouse  taylor printers  belshazzar or the fall of babylon belshazzar or the fall of babylon chapter i reader let your imagination wander back to that period of time when babylon the great then queen of the earth reigned over the eastern world the most beautiful and powerful city of the orient its mighty walls spanned the euphrates and encompassed within their limits an area fifteen miles square but tis useless for me to describe its hundred gates of brass its hundreds of squares and towers its statues and palaces its hanging gardens laden with rich fruit and filling the air with the fragrance of their blossoming flowers the terraces that overhung and the splendid barges that floated upon the waters of the euphrates as it meandered through the citythese are familiar to every reader of history tis enough that there were fit scenes for the enactment of those deeds which romancers love to chronicle and but few of which have been handed down to us by history not but that they may have been duly chronicled but the ravages that old father time and the hands of barbaric conquerors have made upon them leave but little for our inspection therefore bear with me reader if my description of men and events is not so minute in tales of life portrayed at the present time at the time we write of belshazzar sat on the throne of babylon while the armies of the medes and persians under king cyrus lay encamped before the city but the haughty belshazzar laughed at their beseiging besieging  as he well knew the enemy might beat in vain against his massive walls and secure in their position the babylonians looked down from their towers in contempt upon the foe beneath expecting that the persian would soon depart when he found all beseiging besieging useless therefore they heeded the enemy but little and spent their time as usual in feasting and revelry on a clear night when the moon was on the wane and threw a partial uncertain light on surrounding objects a single boatman was plying his oars vigorously as he glided in a little skiff oer the waters the euphrates in the northern part of the city while he bent to his task with all his power he scanned the shores with an anxious glance as if seeking a place where he might land in safetyfor rapidly idly following his course was a large craft well manned and bearing half a dozen armed warriors the boatman was a youth just verging into manhood of a light compact form with features not handsame handsome but bold and regular glossy raven looks curled about his brow and hung in clusters to his shoulders but the prominent trait in his features which would instantly attract attention was an eye large deep set of the blackest hue and which seemed luminous as it flashed with excited glance from shore to shore and then upon his pursuers he saw no avenue of escape upon the shore for terraces and garden walls lined the banks and despite his efforts the pursuing craft now rapidly approached the soldiers clustered around its prow and one arrayed in richer costume who seemed commander shouted to him to surrender never was the clear reply villain dog of a spy we know you surrender instantly or you shall die well toss your carcass into the waters then come and slay me surrender i never shall run him down sink his craft shouted the enraged chieftain well drown him without a blow the youth had ceased rowing and grasping one of his oars stood up in the skiff as the heavy barge came rushing on he gave it a push thus gliding his skiff from beneath its prow then with a sweeping stroke he brought the oar down on the head of a soldier who fell with a dull plash and instantly sank the bargemen soon bore down on him again and he made a feint with his oar again to push off but changed the motion too quick for parrying and dealt the chieftain a stunning blow felling him on the barge jumping from his sinking skiff on board the barge he seized the sword of the fallen chief determined to sell his life dearly the contest was too unequal for prowess to withstand he wielded his sword with desperation slaying another of the soldiers and wounding several when he received a thrust of a spear in his shoulder throwing him overboard bleeding and senseless he immediately sank and the bargemen anxious to procure aid for their fallen comrades plied their oars and instantly glided from the spot on the right bank of the euphrates close by where this scene was being enacted stood a small house of hewn stone the waters washed its foundation walls and from its portico stone steps descended to the waters edge its dweller was johanan one of the sons of israel who were fulfilling their destiny by sojourning in babylon possessing that aquiline cast of features characteristic of the race he was tall athletic and being but little over forty years of age was yet in the prime of life his ostensible calling was the fishermans and daily he brought to the markets a small supply of the finny inhabitants of the euphrates yet could one have seen all the contents of his dwelling and witnessed all his transactions the humble fisherman would have been found a dealer in precious stones and by no means an unwealthy one on the night in question though the evening was far advanced johanan was sitting in his portico enjoying the cool breezes that were gently wafted over the waters and dreamily gazing at the lights that flickered on the opposite shore when his attention was arrested by angry voices on the waters below gazing forth by the partial light of the moon he beheld the conflict between the youth and his pursuers although not prone to interfere where his aid would be almost useless and he would also incur the vengeance of officials yet he resolved to aid the lone combatant if twas in his power and jumping into his skiff which was moored beside the steps scarce had the barge turned away when with quick strokes he rowed to the spot where he saw the youth sink scarce had he started when he saw his body rise and disappear again and as he neared the spot he saw it rise the second time knowing that the third would be fatal he plunged in and seized it ere it could sink supporting the body with one hand he swam with a few strokes of the other to the skiff and clambered in with his burden he found the youth nearly strangled with water but soon freeing his lungs his breath was restored but he remained senseless and bleeding freely from the wound in his shoulder turning his skiff to the shore he soon bore his burden up the steps into his dwelling and called loudly for miriam in a few moments a jewess appeared hastily appareled in a loose robe but we must halt a moment to describe her like her father tall and stately possessing a finely rounded formher every motion was grace her features like those of most of the israelitish women were fair brow of pearl cheeks of rosy tint small finely turned lipseyes large dreamy and black as the ravens wing father what want you ha whom have you here dead no but he is bleeding what means this quick daughter bring me lint and bandages we must staunch this bleeding or the youth will surely die be quick move as if your life were at stake and not his and then i will tell you miriam needed no second prompting from her stores of linen bandages were soon prepared her father meanwhile stripped the garments from the youths shoulder and with the aid of her nimble fingers the wound was soon staunched and securely bandaged while they were thus engaged johanan related the manner of his rescuing the youth saying i know not who he is or what he may be but i am ready to protect whoever is pursued by our oppressorsmay curses light on thembelshazzar and all his myrmidons they trample our rights and desecrate our god tis enough that he has incurred their vengeance we will care for him and when he recovers we may learn his tale but where shall we place him he must have dry clothing and a warm couch miriams eyes had dwelt on the young strangers features with a searching expression while her father was speaking and their pale beauty or his suffering condition awakened new and strange emotions in her heart as she gazed i will yield my apartment to him father i can prepare me another chamber and we can place him there immediately tis well said he and taking the youth in his powerful arms he bore him gently to her chamber and placed him on a couch now miriam said he bring me a pitcher of water and a flask of wine and i will watch with him during the night while you must seek some rest for you must tend his wants on the morrow tis lucky we have no servants in our household to babble of secrets perchance he may be some noted one whom twill be dangerous for us to harbor but none shall be the wiser so now daughter to your rest while i watch miriam retired to her slumbers but they were broken by strange dreams flitting through which were ever seen the pale manly features of the wounded stranger one more scene must we record and then we are done with the nights adventures while the youth whom we will call hassan was plying his oars in the endeavor to escape his pursuers a man might have been seen hurrying along the street that followed the waters edge keeping pace with the boats occasionally pausing when an opening between the houses would permit to watch their course he was tall strongly built of bold yet pleasing features and from his garb evidently of the chaldean race for his robe betokened him to be one of those learned menastrologers and magicianswho made babylon their abode at that period modas for such was his name was one of many of his race who were retained in service of belshazzars court their only duties being to be in readiness when summoned to divine future events of interest to the national welfare or the private fortunes of the courtiers by the positions and motions of the heavenly bodies and to explain dreams and other events that excited either awe or curiosity when hassan came in conflict with the soldiers on the barge modas glided between two buildings and stepping with quiet tread on to the portico of one watched the contest with manifest interest when hassan sank and the barge turned away he was on the point of departing in a moody manner when he beheld a boat dart from the steps of a house he watched johanans course anxiously and when he beheld him bearing hassan into his dwelling uttered a sigh of relief then turning into the street he surveyed the dwelling of johanan carefully as if to mark its identity and then walked rapidly away toward the northern part of the city following the rivers course when he had neared the walls he entered a little dwelling by the river side and ere long emerged dressed in a closefitting garb different from the usual citizens dress and accompanied by a boy they entered a little skiff that was moored close by and then rowed away to where the mighty walls spanned the river from the arched masonry a massive framework of iron hung beneath the waters edge thus preventing all egress and ingress of boats nearing the bank modas plunged into the water and diving deeply in a moment rose beyond the ironwork and swam quietly ashore having landed he walked briskly away seeming heedless of molestation by the parties of persians who patroled around their camp the lights of which could be seen in the distance meanwhile the boy returned with the boat and no sentry of the hundred gates of babylon was wiser for the magicians departure chapter ii when hassan awoke the next morning he was bewildered he had a recollection of his combat on the euphrades euphrates  and his ears yet rang with the boiling of the waters when he sank beyond this all was blank glancing around the apartment everything he beheld was neat and tasteful silken curtains neatly embroidered hung over his couch various paintings adorned the walls the furniture though heavy was fancifully carved and a vase of sweet scented flowers stood near his couch vainly endeavoring to divine where he was or how he came there he attempted to rise but instantly fell back again in agony and found by the pain and bandages that he was severely wounded as he thus lay he heard light steps approaching and partially closed his eyes resolving to feign sleep and observe in what care he was glancing through his partially closed eyelids he was surprised to see a maiden surpassingly beautiful enter and after glancing at him a moment place some refreshments on a table beside him open the lattice admiting admitting fresh air arrange the curtains with noiseless motions and then she came and placed her hands gently on his brow as if to see whether his blood was fevered as she was turning away he slowly opened his eyes and gazing on her with evident admiration said stay beautiful one tell me where am i and how came i here you are with those who will care well for you but you must not divulge your presence else we may be involved in trouble i know i see your meaning but fear nothing i am no serpent so tell me where am i you are in the house of johanan beside the rivers bank johanan ye are of the children of israel then aye but how came i here my father rescued you from the waters when drowning last night and brought you hither may the god of his race reward him for it he shall surely be repaid by me he needs no reward but you must not become agitated by conversation partake of some refreshment and then i will send my father to you and he will relate all you wish to know she placed the refreshments where he could easily reach with his unwounded arm and retired hassan gazed after her as she departed and remained staring as if in a trance till the sound of her footsteps had died away then blessing the fates that he had fallen into such hands broke his fast with a light heart and merry as one well could be wounded and lying in the care of strangers ere long his host entered and related to him the manner of his rescue many thanks to you for your timely assistance i feared not death but i have much yet to live for and perform you shall not go unrewarded for interfering in my behalf speak not of reward i should scorn it for saving the life of a fellow being especially from the hands of an oppressor ha what say you of oppressors did i say aught i spoke vaguely methinks you were being slain by some of the royal troops how did you incur their vengeance if you were guiltless were they not oppressors ha i understand you your race have little to thank belshazzar for and you would learn my tale aye you speak rightly in both senses hassan seemed to hesitate a moment then said i am wealthy and have no near relatives so i live quietly by myself with a few faithful servants in the center of the city and wile away my time in seeking such adventures as chance may throw in my way of late while aiding a friend in a little intrigue i became involved in a broil with an officer of the royal guards and wounded him in single combat since then he has been dogging my footsteps full of vengeance last night he with some of his comrades fell upon me in a bystreet near the river i escaped their attack and rushing to the riverside found a skiff and jumping in rowed away but the fates were against me they hailed a barge that was passing and were soon in hot pursuit the rest you know your tale seems plain aye tis no strange matter to be knocked over and drowned these times but you spoke of oppressors fear not to express your opinion in my presence but be cheered i tell you babylon will change masters ere long heaven grant it may but how i cannot see does not the persian lie encamped before us think you cyrus would prove a worse monarch than belshazzar nay but it cannot be the persian can never scale these mighty walls and his army will march away after having threatened and muttered like the fleeting clouds of a summer shower your comparison is good but i tell you the storm will gather its fury and burst over babylon and the blood of our reveling oppressors flow like water i care not if it do but i fear twill not come to pass so saying johanan departed scarce had he descended when some one knocked for admission at his door answering his summons he found none other waiting for entrance than our friend modas the chaldean when he had entered and become seated johanan looked enquiringly at him as if to learn his business modas returned his gaze saying you have a youth named hassan concealed here i would speak with him johanans brow contracted for a moment then staring coolly at his visitor he said i know naught of missing youth or concealment if this is all for which i am honored by your visit you may as well depart again for i have no time to waste in idle discussion modas smiled i thank you for your course and tis well done now listen i am both the servant and guardian of the youth you last night rescued from his enemies on the river i witnessed the whole so you have nothing to fear but many thanks to receive now lead me to him johanan though somewhat surprised never changed his features but grasping his visitors hand said tis all well we now understand each other in yonder chamber you will find the youth but agitate him not too much or his wounds may produce a fever modas entered the chamber much to the surprise and joy of hassan after a long conversation he descended again bidding his host adieu and casting a curious glance at miriam a short time now quietly passed away hassan recovered the effects of his wound and in a few days was able to arise from his couch but weak from the loss of blood was compelled to remain under the protection of johanans roof miriam was his constant companion she wiled away his weary hours with cheering converse sang to him sad songs of the captivity of her race almost melting the listener to tears and then gay troubadours of the festive scenes of babylon accompanied by the harp that brought smiles again hassan sat and listened watching her graceful motions as she flitted hither and thither performing her few household duties often musing like one in a dream or endeavoring to solve some perplexing problem after a lapse of two weeks modas visited him again when he had departed hassan descended from his chamber and found his fair hostess alone miriam said he i must leave you tonight she started and the color receded for a moment from her cheeks why so soon you have scarce recovered your strength yet you need be in no haste you are a welcome guest i cannot doubt it but i would speak of another subject come sit by my side and listen miriam became seated somewhat agitated for her womans instinct told her what was coming miriam though wounded when brought beneath your roof i have since been pierced by a deeper dart fascinated by your every motion i have learned to love to live upon your smiles can you will you return my passion i offer you neither rank wealth or station i am not even of your race all i offer is my lovethe first pure love of a youthful heart but if you will become the partner of my life be i who or what i may fear not but what i will protect honor love and exalt your station as if you were a princess speak tell me my fate shall i go forth desolate and heart broken or shall i go to win the proper station whence i can return for a loving bride the rich warm blood had mounted to miriams cheeks as she listened she returned his gaze with a searching glance and then as if trusting in his sincerity placed her hand in his exclaiminggo buoyant and full of hope your love is returned hassan drew her to his bosom imprinting the first sweet kisses on her rosy lips then they discoursed long of their love and the future thus for a time we will leave them when the shades of evening began to fall modas came in a skiff to convey hassan away the youth bade his host adieu placing a string of costly pearls on miriams neck and stepped lightly on board the skiff the beautiful jewess stood upon the stone steps gazing after the fast retreating form of her lover and little dreaming of the storm of trouble that was gathering over her head chapter iii now we will turn to another scene on the night of hassans departure tis an apartment in the royal palace rich carpets wrought in fantastic figures cover its floors damask curtains hang around its walls and between their heavy folds portraits of former monarchs and pictures of battles hang in finely carved frames from the ceiling golden lamps are suspended that shed a clear but not dazzling light while in various niches around the walls stand little vases of silver filled with sweet scented flowers seated on a divan at one end of the apartment was a man arrayed in magnificent robes he was in the prime of life with regular and not unhandsome features once fair but now flushed with intemperance and sensual in their expression of medum medium height but corpulent black waving locks and haughty glance such was belshazzar king of babylon he seemed ill at ease and rising paced up and down the apartment in an impatient manner at length he seemed relieved by the entrance of a man arrayed in the chieftains costume of the royal guard ha moran you have finally arrived what news good have you found her or learned who she is aye both well done by the heavens twill pay to sail on the river every day if we can spy out such beauties on the shore who is she a jewess the daughter of a fisherman though he is said to be rich i am certain of the matter for i marked the dwelling well and learned all i wish from an old woman near by the charmers name is miriam ha then she is a jewess well it matters not these daughters of israel are ever fair this one is beautiful and must be mine now listen moran you have trusty soldiers who will do your bidding without wagging their tongues can you not seize this maiden without any alarm and bear her away aye if i can learn when her father is absent i can easily bear her away upon the river then put your men on the watch and bring the fair captive to the temple of belus it shall be done as soon as possible tis well your reward shall be ample now what learn you of the persians movements but little they are encamped in quiet and keep their lines so loosely guarded tis almost impossible for our spies to pass them however i have one who enters their camp with impunity ha who is it he shall receive our favor tis modas one of our chaldaeans chaldeans  he manages to elude their vigilance and he says they will soon raise the seige siege  and only keep their gates shut a while for mere bravado so your majesty need apprehend no danger from them by heavens i do not king cyrus may besiege our walls as long as he pleases he might as well attempt to scale the heavens but how do the people feel secure they laugh at the persian then all is well so now fail not to capture this maiden she seemed too rich a prize to lose never fear tomorrow night she shall grace the temple with her presence on the following evening as miriam sat in her apartment lightly touching the strings of her harp and musing oer the destiny of her lover she was aroused by a demand for admission at the door fearing no harm and supposing it to be some one who might wish to wait for her fathers return for she received many such a customer after night fall she hastened to answer the summons opening the door a man in citizens attire who was no other than moran the guardsman said is my friend johanan at home i have business to transact with him no but he will soon be in is your business urgent tis of importance then enter and await his return as the stranger entered she turned to lead the way when moran with a quick motion cast his robe over her head and grasped her in his arms thus muffling her voice and holding her powerless in his grasp giving a low whistle some half dozen of his followers quickly entered to aid him in vain were miriams struggles and attempts at escape in a few moments her captors had her securely bound then stepping out on the portico moran gave a signal and a barge that had been lying in readiness advanced to the steps miriam was conveyed on board and the barge glided rapidly away oer the waters towards the centre of the city scarce had it faded away in the distance when johanan entered his home to find it deserted and his well loved daughter mysteriously gone upon the grand square in the centre of babylon stood the famous temple of belus its massive foundations covered an area a furlong square and tower rose above tower till it reached nearly a furlong in height this stupendous structure was at once the temple of a popular deity and a fortalice of great strength manned by the legions of belshazzars royal guard so that within its walls every fancy of his capricious will was supreme law it was commanded by bonari a middle aged warrior who obeyed no law except the kings wish with bonari there dwelt a beautiful and light hearted maiden who was known and treated with respect by all inmates of the temple as bonaris daughter selina for such was her name was a fair haired light complexioned beauty whose blue eyes sparkled with mirth and mischief and whose voice was full of music as she caroled the popular songs of babylon while she wandered at random from hall to chamber from balcony to turret throughout the mighty temple now singing some wild air to the soldiers who grouped at their ease in the lower halls and then appearing on the topmost turret where the eye could glance oer the sea of roofs and gardens for miles around even to the outer walls many were the secrets she ferreted out in the old temple yet she kept her own counsel and prated not her knowledge of its hidden passages and vaults having thus taken a glance at the temple we must turn to our heroine as the euphrates flowed near the walls of the temple moran soon conducted his captive to a well furnished apartment in the eastern wing then releasing her bonds quickly departed barring the door as he left miriam knew that she was a prisoner but why or wherefore was beyond her comprehension going to the lattice that admitted light to the apartment she saw the lights shining from dwellings far below and knew that escape was impossible in that direction amazed and torn by conflicting emotions she threw herself upon a couch and ere long sank to tearful slumber when she awoke the sun was shining brightly through the lattice refreshed and calmer in mind she gazed on the city below and by the statues and fountains that surrounded the great square she knew that she was in the temple but wherefore was yet a mystery she thought of hassan and her mind recurred to the combat on the river perchance they had incurred official displeasure but why seize her thus and again where was her father was he too a prisoner thus passed the day in harrassing doubts an ethiopian servant brought her meals and trimmed her lamp but vouchsafed no answer to her questions opening her mouth instead to miriams horror she showed a mutilated tongue at an early hour in the evening she was startled by the entrance of a man gorgeously arrayed and not unhandsome though flushed with wine who are you that come to the captive are you friend or foe a friend what else could i be to one so beautiful then tell me why i am torn from my home and imprisoned here twas done for your happiness a curl wreathed the lips of the beautiful jewess and her eyes flashed with anger for she began to understand her position pray explain she sneered i will i have seen you and charmed by your beauty loved i had you brought thither that i might proclaim my passion and entreat you to become mine a noble way to woo forsooth who are you that thus dared to trifle with my liberty think you thus to win my love gently i am one whose love you should be proud to receive thousands of maidens would sell their very souls to win my smile i am belshazzar your king miriam started with surprise but drawing herself haughtily up said has not your majesty a queenaye and wives enough beside and do you prate to me a humble maiden of love think you i would listen to such a tale even if offered at my feet as should be at my fathers house belshazzar gazed at her a moment in evident surprise then said listen maiden i throw off my prestige as king i would win your love become mine and you shall never want or repine but live in splendor where you will i will pour out treasures at your feet and raise you to a position high for one of your captive race if you feel the power of love if you would lead a life of ambition and pleasure become mine you shall never regret it i can only treat your words with the scorn they deserve they are none the better for being uttered by a king sooner will i sell my life than my honor ha some youth has already won your heart is it not so that matters not tis no business of yours by heavens i thought as much know you where you are and who i am i would have won your love you scorn my offers now i shall claim my prize whether you will or no and he attempted to grasp her in his arms with a sudden bound she tore herself from his grasp and drew back a few paces belshazzar made another attempt to seize her but she placed her hand in her bosom and drew a bright sharp dagger and raising it said touch me again at your peril i will bury this dagger in your craven heart king though you be so beware the king turned pale with anger the rays of the lamp shone brightly on the polished weapon and he saw from the nervous grasp with which she held it and the burning glance of her eye that she was bent on mischief leave me no longer insult me with your presence march through yonder door or by the god of my fathers i will spill some of your craven blood and she advanced with the dagger raised to strike with a scowl belshazzar backed out exclaiming think not thus to escape me you never shall leave this apartment till you are mine i can well wait till your dagger is wrested from you when he was gone miriam threw herself on her couch to reflect on her position she had reclined there but a few moments when she was startled by a grating sound near by rising to see what it meant with astonishment she beheld a large portrait frame roll heavily aside as if moved on wheels and a fair maiden step through the opening thus revealed the strange visitor gazed kindly upon her who are you that visit me thus strangely surely one so young and pure cannot be leagued with my enemies i am no enemy i knew there was a maiden captive here and i came to visit you i had just arrived behind this picture when your royal visitor entered then you heard the king aye these walls were made for hearing it done me good to hear you brave him out if he was a king and she laughed merrily but but who are you how came you hither thus strangely oh my father is governor of the temple i have always lived here and learned many a strange secret but i feel interested for you tell me how came you here and if i can aid you i will fear not i will be your friend i like the way you repulsed the king the fair jewess related her capture when she had finished selina said what would you have me do can you not conduct me away by the passage whence you entered no it has no outlet beyond the walls alas there is no escape can you not get me a dagger i fear mine will be rested from me in my sleep aye here is one i always wear i can get me another easily can you leave here when you please yes would you send a message if so i can carry it if you can go to my father and tell him where i am you will do me a great kindness and she proceeded to inform selina where her father dwelt and after further conversation they bade each other adieu selina promising to visit her again chapter iv on the following day selina left the temple as she was often wont to do to walk among the numerous gardens and fountains that filled the public squares she walked at a lively pace towards the northern part of the city and in an hour had arrived at johanans door when she had been admitted she said am i addressing johanan the jew aye i am he then i come to bring you tidings of your daughter ha speak where is she i have searched for her among her youthful comrades till hope was gone she left not her home she was borne away by force i began to suspect as much by whom i hardly dare to tell you you must not reveal my words you need not fear i shall seek for vengeance but i would never betray where i obtained my knowledge she was borne away by the kings minions to be sacrificed for his pleasure by the king may curses alight on him where is she in the temple of belus then escape is difficult but how knew you of it i am the governors daughter and know many a secret of the old temple for i reside there can you not aid her escape i fear me not at present but fear not for her safety now she drove belshazzar from her prison room last night at the point of the dagger he will not molest her again while she is armed and ere long i hope to plan her escape if it can be done without my agency being revealed i came to inform you of her position i must now away or my long absence will be noted i will see you on the day after tomorrow if you will meet me at the fountain before the temple then i shall know better how to aid her escape i will meet you but for heavens sake release her if you can she is my only joy all that is left to me on earth and to have her thus torn away is agony when selina departed johanan sat for a long time lost in musing the agonized expression of his features showing how deeply he was moved at length he was roused by another summons at the door and rising admitted modas the chaldean ha welcome said he i have need of your advice if you can aid one who has lately aided you my services are at your command but where is your daughter i have a message for her tis of her i would speak she has been snatched away from me by violence snatched away what mean you johanan related his conversation with selina modas mused awhile then said fear not for your daughters safety in three days she shall be restored to you surely be not surprised i can bring a power that will thwart belshazzar aye his sun shall set in a night of blood so be wary look to your own safety and be not surprised for strange things will occur but i must away i have much yet to do when modas left he proceeded to the royal palace and sought out the chief guardsman moran with whom he conversed regarding the movements of the persian encampment having assured moran that they would soon raise the seige siege  a learned that belshazzar was to hold a great feast on the eve of the following day modas departed with a strange expression on his features and turned his steps towards the temple of belus having entered that part of the mighty structure devoted to the priesthood and the services of the deity to which it was dedicated he proceeded with the manner of one familiar to the place to a cell on the northern side of the temple as he entered a man well in years and silver haired who much resembled him in countenance arose saying ha brother back again i thought you in the persian camp what new movements have you i expected you not till the morrow all is well i am on other business i must explore these old passages know you ought of a maiden belshazzar has caged in the other wing of the temple nothing he or his courtiers often bring captive maidens hither but i know naught of them know you where they are usually placed aye in the rooms entered by the portraits if there is a maiden here you would seek you will probably find her in one of those three apartments i know where they are no one will enter til i return i suppose not at present i will close the entrance if there does modas now moved a sliding panel revealing a narrow passage in the masonry of the massive outer wall following its narrow windings ere long he arrived the first of the apartments mentioned moving the heavy portrait back by means of the hidden springs he stepped boldly into the apartment where he beheld miriam for a moment she trembled at his abrupt entrance then uttered an exclamation of joy as she grasped his proffered hand then you have found me have you seen my father how fares he i but shortly left him and hassan where is he in safety all are safe but you and i come to bid you have no fears tomorrow night shall see you safely restored to your father and your lover start not hassan conceals nothing from me so wait patiently you have weapons have you not aye a pair of daggers you will not be molested till you are disarmed and i hope to rescue you ere then so rest in peace modas returned to the priests cell brother said the priest when shall i look for the accomplishment of your plans tomorrow night so soon aye the end is nigh can you be in readiness all shall be prepared then all is well modas now hurried to the northern part of the city and by the means we have before described left its walls under cover of night and entered the persian camp another day has passed again the shades of night have fallen over babylon shrouding all objects in a dim uncertain light for although the moon was nearly gone the stars shone brightly in the skies oerhead johanan sat in his portico musing moodily on his daughters dangers and wondering in what manner the chaldean could rescue her as he gazed abstractedly on the waters of the euphrates it occured to him that they were far below their usual level stepping down on the stone steps he found the waters fast receeding receding and his boat nearly stranded amazed he turned to the porch and stood gazing with astonishment on the bed of the stream which was fast becoming dry leaving a sandy bottom interspersed with little pools at length a new thought seemed to occur to him for he seated himself and remained gazing anxiously up the bed of the stream meanwhile let us turn to other scenes throughout the city in palace and cottage was held one universal feast songs wild and gay the tripping of feet in the mazy dance and strains of music were heard in every quarter all was revelry in the royal palace a mighty throng of the beautiful the wealthy and the highborn were gathered in the banqueting hall to honor the festive board of belshazzar sweet strains of music by invisible musicians floated in the air gold and silver ware in abundance plundered from the mighty temple of solomon glistened on the tables and the wine in the goblets sparkled beneath the rays of a thousand glittering lamps oerhead the feast was nearly finished the costly viands had disappeared under the vigorous attacks of the courtiers and now the red wine began to flow intrigue began its sway and bright eyed maidens lent willing ears to tales of love belshazzar whose handsome features were already flushed with wine beckoned to his chieftain moran who had left the feast and again returned how now moran said he in a whisper how fares my beautiful jewess she is safe and secure have they disarmed her by my soul but you should have seen her handle her dagger twas no trifling play i thought she would murder me her dagger is gone so you have naught to fear then by the heavens she shall be mine this night be ready to accompany me to the temple in another hour well see who shall win as he turned again to his wine a wild cry of terror rose from the assembly and many fingers pointed tremblingly to the wall belshazzar rose to his feet and gazed a cry of terror also broke from his lips the goblet fell front his hands the flush of wine was gone and his cheeks turned an ashen hue for there was seen a perfect hand high in air writing rapidly on the wall and yet no form angelic or human was visible soon the magic words glistened and shone like lines of living fire all the mirth was hushed laugh and song burst no more from gay lips the wine had lost its charm the throng sat pale and silent for they had beheld a miracle and whether for good or evil none could tell for none could read the mystic writing when they had in a measure recovered their terror belshazzar ordered all the chaldeans and magicians of the court to be summoned that they might translate the lines that shone so brightly on the wall but for once the subtle sons of magic felt the weakness of their power in vain was their lore of magic in vain their knowledge of the stars and ready sleight of band that made serpents of reeds one after another they turned sadly away for none could tell then spoke belshazzars queen saying there is a prophet of the children of israel in babylon whom thy father o king found to be of great wisdom and whom he named belteshazzar let him be called a messenger was soon sent and ere long returned with the noble daniel the prophet of israels god in whose knowledge and power all yielded confidence as they heard the words with which he addressed the king then all was hushed as turning to the mystic lines the prophet announced their decrees god hath numbered thy kingdom and finished it thou o belshazzar art weighed in the balances and found wanting thy kingdom is divided and given to the medes and persians as the conviction settled upon the revelers that they had witnessed the decrees of the living god each countenance became paler and when the prophet left the wine remained untouched in their goblets a low murmur ran through the assembly and rising from their seats they prepared to depart but ere they could leave now sounds smote their ears the wild clangor of trumpet and cymbal the clash of arms in fierce conflict the shout of a charging foe and wild yell of the dying all told that a tide of war was flowing over fated babylon chapter v we left johanan gazing in anxious wonder up the channel of the euphrates ere long a startling vision met his gaze with measured tread no banners flaunting in the air no martial music to proclaim their advance he beheld a mighty host of warriors marching down the stream closely packed ranks of infantry bristling with spears long lines of cavalry each horseman equipped with drawn scimetar and shining shield moved silently on till the whole channel of the stream far as the eye could reach seemed one mass of warriors pouring on with irresistible force then the truth flashed to his mind the persian foe who had lain so quietly encamped before the city had turned the euphrates from its course and while all babylon was engaged in revelry were marching safe and silent to its very center then the words of modas occurred to him with full force and while he wondered what knowledge the chaldean had of the persians scheme his attention was drawn by two warriors who riding close beside the steps of his porch beckoned to him descending cautiously he was surprised at hearing a familiar voice say how now my noble host are you ready to seek vengeance on your miriams oppressors aye but how is this surely you seem to be my friend modas and this seems much like hassan none other descend and mount i will quickly furnish you a steed babylon changes owners tonight and you might as well mingle in the fray right gladly said johanan as he mounted a fully equipped steed which they held but how came you with the persian hosts we came as many another who has felt belshazzars tyrannyfor vengeance but let us on the king feasts tonight but there will be other sounds than revelry ere morn onand pressing on full as the uneven channel would permit they were seen in the front ranks they had now arrived at one of the public squares where the banks of the river shelved to the bottom of the channel and turning their horses heads long lines of cavalry began to file up the banks and pour into the streets while every available foothold was thronged with infantry meanwhile as many watchers had already detected the rapid march of the foe every quarter resounded with the rallying cry fast as the alarm spread the citizen soldiery sprang to arms and hastened to the conflict but the persian onslaught was impetuous and their advancing columns swept the terrorstricken babylonians from their path led by well known guides the cavalry with whom were our friends raised the cry of on on to the royal palace and riding over the citizen soldiery they swept the royal guard like chaff before the winds from their course and poured into the grand banqueting hall of the palace where the feasters yet remained the conflct conflict was carnage belshazzar and most of his courtiers were soon passed from time to eternity and the mystic decree that yet shone over the scene to the wonder of the persian was fulfilled when the persian had swept the palace they turned the tide of war toward the mighty temple of belus soon the grand square before the vast structure was thronged with infantry while heavy bodies of cavalry filled every avenue whence aid could be brought but the temple seemed likely to prove a stronghold not easily conquered its towers and parapets were manned by the choicest soldiery of babylon who poured down showers of arrows of melted lead hot oil and seemed determined to die fighting at their post every entrance was closed and strongly barred for a time the persian stormed in vain when the great gateway leading to that wing of the temple where the people were accustomed to assemble in worship of their deity was thrown open by a portion of the chaldean priesthood at whose head was the brother of modas loud shouts of triumph now burst from the besiegers as they hurried through the entrancefor babylons mighty stronghold was fallen from hall to chamber by passage and stairway as tower rose above tower the persians rushed in countless numbers though brave the resistance of the babylonians was vain for their foes were numberless and flushed with victory and after a short conflict those who were not already slain surrendered modas hassan and johanan had abandoned their steeds and were among the first to enter the temple guided by mozana modas brother when the conflict lulled they sought miriams prison chamber as they were about to enter they heard shrieks from female lips with the hasty trampling of feet in contest bursting open the door they beheld moran with selina in his arms just entering the secret passage of the portrait while two soldiers who had just wrested miriams dagger from her grasp were dragging her after them moran endeavored to close the passage but modas to whom the different combats of the night seemed to have restored all the buoyancy of youth bounded after him and cleaved his scull with one blow of his scimetar and then bore selina to a seat johanan was about to attack the other soldiers but hassan said back leave them to me and handling his weapon with all the skill of a practised swordsman he struck down one at the first pass when the other dropped on his knees and begged for mercy then take your comrades carcass and go said hassan as he turned and clasped miriam in a warm embrace johanan viewed this little interlude with looks of evident approbation when the party became seated and johanan was expressing his joy at his daughters recovery they were startled by an exclamation of astonishment from modas the chaldean had been bending over selina who had scarce recovered from a swoon when he burst out with great god it is it is it must be my long lost child what mean you brother said mozana surely you must be crazed crazed well i might be look here behold in the struggle with moran the garments had been torn from selinas shoulders and traced in scarlet upon the fair white shoulder a perfect arrow barb shaft and feathers was seen listen said modas years ago as you brother well know my beautiful bride and infant child were torn from my home by the myrmidons of the then prince belshazzar as you miriam have now been from that day to this i never could find them so i have lived only to seek vengeance and richly have i won it now in the day of my triumph i believe my daughter is restored to me for the infant child had this strange mark upon its shoulder she is she must be my long lost daughter selina had now recovered and opening her eyes gazed around fully restored speak daughter what is your nameyour parentage my name is selina ha twas my wifes who are your parents my mother i cannot remember my father is chief commander of the temple and know you nothing more nothing of this mark on your shoulder or of your mothers death nothing perchance this governor may reveal more of the matter if he can be found ay said hassan i will send a soldier to seek him and entering the passage where a number of the persians were assembled he bade an officer to seek if the governor of the temple was among the prisoners and to bring him thither if he could be found alive and returning to his comrades they waited in anxiety the result of the search when nearly half an hour had elapsed the officer returned with the fallen chieftain of the temple your name said modas regarding him with a piercing glance bonari you have been governor of this temple for many years aye so far tis well now whose daughter is this maiden mine liar your features plainly contradict the tale now reveal her history or your head shall fall beneath the axe speak and to the point if you value your life bonari stood for a moment then replied deception is useless she is no child of mine though i have nursed her and loved her at length as my own how came you by her her mother was placed here in confinement and died suddenly of the heart disease this infant was left in my care having no children of my own i adopted her my wife soon died and i reared her as the only being for whom i had any attachment tis enough come to my arms my loved my long lost child with a cry of joy selina was clasped in her fathers embrace when they had become seated again modas said my noble prince grant me one boon what is it said hassan let this governor be restored to freedom he has been a father to my child it shall be done miriam arose trembling agitated with pale features but with eyes that shone with a painful brilliancyspeak again modas what called you hassan modas started and turned his gaze enquiringly to hassan the youth nodded i called him prince miriam became paler yet but turned to hassan saying who who then are you speak i pray i am a persian cambyses grandson of king cyrus the median miriam sank fainting to her seat murmuring lost lost when she recovered cambyses held her folded in his arms and the others were gone as she gazed up into his eyes and beheld their earnest expression she trembled and nestled closer in his grasp can it be she murmured that you are a prince a persian and yetyet and yet i love you think you that i would desert your love because i may yet fill persias throne by the heavens you know me not nor the power of true love your father plunged not into the euphrates to save a prince and you nursed but a poor unknown youth when i was lying wounded in your house as such he won your love and yet hopes to raise you to a throne as his loving queen are you now content to become his bride the tears of joy now coursed down miriams cheeks she could hardly believe the words that thrilled so sweetly on her ears when she had become calmer she said but how how came you in babylon when my father drew you from the river tis a simple tale we have long had our spies in babylon chief among whom was modas who as you have learned maddened by the loss of his bride was earnestly seeking for vengeance on belshazzar he has often been in the persian court and camp i accompanied him hither to see fully the accomplishment of our schemes and by some mishap one of the kings spies learned me to be a persian and attempted my capture the rest you know but how have your armies gained entrance to the city right easily twas modas scheme we turned the euphrates from its course and marched beneath the walls in its channel we will now leave the lovers to their converse and but little more need be said belshazzars dynasty was overthrown the persian king darius was placed securely on the trone throne of babylon ere many weeks elapsed there was another grand festival in the royal palace prince cambyses was wedded with a babylonish maidenthe beautiful miriam at the same time selina was united to cyaxares a median officer yet in his youth and a comrade of prince cambyses the knight of castile the knight of castile chapter i on an autumn morn in the year  two cavaliers were riding through a mountainous pass in the southern part of the kingdom of castile king ferdinand had just closed the summers campaign with the moors of grenada his chieftains had returned to their fortresses and single knights wandered whither business love or pleasure chanced to lead them one of our cavaliers was hernando perez del pulgar afterwards renowned in the conquest of grenada he was tall of massive form and fair features his companion was of light active frame pale features black eyes and beard all his equipments even to his plume were of the same raven hue now you may ask who was this sombre knight he first appeared in the spanish camp before malaga attracting attention by his valor and seeming boundless wealth yet none knew who he was or whence he came when knighted by ferdinand he vouchsafed no name but saidcall me the knight of castile hernando said the black knight we are nearing the castle urena you are free to relate your adventures but reveal naught of my captivity in malaga fear not but why this mystery tis strange men ask me who is your comrade and i say i know not tis my fate in justice to myself and others i must remain unknown even to you call me us usual alphonso in the valley beneath them they now beheld the castle urena it was built on the southern bank of a river and a deep moat isolated it from the shore gay banners floated from its towers and strains of music fell on their ears ha said pulgar tis a tournament and urging their steeds ere long they entered urenas gates the courtyard was now an arena on the left was a pavilion for the judges and nobility on the right a staging for spectators the count urena sat as umpire he was cold and stately haughty yet courteous on his right were a number of knights prominent among whom was julian dleon he was of elegant form and very handsome features he was nephew of antonio late marquis dleon he had had an elder cousin gonsalvo who was lost in battle some years previous julian by the death of his uncle had become marquis and guardian of his fair cousin maria he was present as a suitor for urenas only daughter eleanor francisco varra a boon comrade of julians de lavega and others filled the circle on the left were eleanor urena and maria dleon eleanor was a graceful being with rosy complexion sparkling eyes and glossy curls maria was smaller and very fair the maidens were firm friends i wish the lists were open said eleanor whom think you will be victor i care not dleon i suppose but who comes here pulgar and his comrade now approached urena welcome del pulgar whom bring you i am known as the knight of castile ha the knight of malaga welcome the marquis dleon regarded the strange knight with a glance of startled wonder and awe the sports now commenced four knights had a tilt with lances three were unhorsed and francisco varra challenged all comers del pulgar unhorsed him and then withdrew dleon now entered and the knight of castile raised his gauntlet who are you cried dleon a knight as well as you enough we will fight to the death if you will as you please i care not all was hushed as both dashed forward dleons lance struck the knights shoulderplate with full force lifting him in his saddle but dleon himself was hurled from his steed senseless alphonso waited further challenge soon a huge knight named jose garcia who came with dleon entered and challenged alphonso to battle with the axe in a few moments they were equipped are you ready said the giant aye then prepare to die for a time alphonso parried his heavy strokes at length his shoulderplate became removed the fastening had been broken by dleons lance see you not i am defenceless tis my advantage would you murder me as you will then beware and be brought his axe with a quick whirling stroke deep through garcias helmet to the brain urena now proclaimed him victor and bade him receive his guerdon at the hands of eleanor kneeling at her feet she threw a silken scarf over his shoulders then all adjourned to the banquet hall where alphonso held the seat of honor by eleanors side much to the discomfiture of the marquis dleon they conversed on various topics but though he seemed versed in affairs of camp and court she could gain naught of his name or destiny nor was maria more successful with del pulgar thus the lady eleanor retired with a brain busy in conjecture of the stranger when alphonso and pulgar retired pulgar soon slept but alphonso startled by a slight grating noise saw a large portrait move aside on the outer wall and the marquis dleon peer forth in a moment pedrillo an attendant of the marquis stepped into the room the new comer took a flask of wine that was standing on the table and emptied a vial into it and quickly departed when alphonso awoke in the morn pulgar was just raising a goblet of the wine to his lips hold on your life he shouted and rising while pulgar wondering obeyed he dipped a jeweled ring in the wine when withdrawn it was no longer brilliant what means this said pulgar he then explained and they determined to leave without delay at the morning repast alphonso announced their departure to urena and turning to eleanor said in a low tone can i hope that you will remember the stranger when he has gone to the warriors grave aye you are not easily forgotten keep this ring in remembrance till we meet again if ever i will but why such hurry to leave reasons i cannot divulge so farewell when the knights left urena as they crossed the plain and rode up the mountain side they saw a small body of armed men following them it was pedrillo with six of dleons retainers mistrusting hostile pursuit the knights halted in a level sheltered nook and awaited the comers they soon appeared and attacked them without parley or delay the comrades parried their lances and plied their axes so well that ere long the six were all slain and their leader galloping away for his life meanwhile dleon bad been closeted with urena a union of their families was a pet project of urenas for many reasons dleon left the count in high spirits for he had pledged him eleanors hand stopping out on a terrace he beheld pedrillo coming at full speed meeting him in the courtyard he said so soon back did they flee no did you bid them bury the knights twas little use bidding dead men dead men what mean you mean nothing only my men were all slain and those demons rode away unharmed dleon cursed and fumed awhile then bade pedrillo bury the men quietly eleanor had a page fernando a sprightly youth of sixteen who chanced to be rambling among the hills that morn and seeing the knights and the pursuing party watched their movements and unseen witnessed the conflict in the afternoon he returned and related the scene to his mistress she listened with surprise and bade him keep silence on the subject in the evening dleon found eleanor alone and kneeling at her feet poured forth his tale of love she listened in silence and replied in a calm tone assuring him that she could not return his love dleon was surprised though he plead in lovers style he expected not refusal in vain did he urge his suit baffled and chagrined he departed ere long her father entered eleanor said he do you refuse dleons suit what mean you i mean as i told him i love him not and why is he not young brave fair and wealthy he may be but i love him not love daughter this is folly your hand is pledged on my honor and wedded you must and shall be never never with him by heavens you shall think not thus to thwart my plans and so saying he departed a week passed at urena eleanor so resisted her fathers commands that he told dleon to drop his suit for a time one evening eleanor sat in her chamber in a deep slumber when pedrillo boldly entered with dleon the marquis took her in his arms and entering a secret passage in the corridor they soon emerged beside the moat outside the castle where a boat with two men awaited them dleon bade pedrillo bear her to the castle leon and return quickly the boat landed below where three steeds awaited them pedrillo bore eleanor and they rode rapidly among the hills many miles when they suddenly met a band of moorish scouts pedrillo slipped from his saddle placed eleanor on the ground and dashed into a thicket while his comrades were instantly slain the moors raised eleanor and rode away with their captive and captured steeds at early morn pedrillo arrived at urena dleon cursed him at his tale but seeing that all was lost and none could tell of his deeds became calm great was the excitement at urena when eleanor was missed the whole country around was searched but no trace to the mystery could be found high among the mountains near the moorish city baza stood the castle zali abdalla el gazan its chieftain though young and withal a gallant was a thorough warrior and kept many scouts in the mountains on the alert for enemy or plunder it was one of his bands that met pedrillo on the next evening a scout reported the tale is the maiden fair bring her hither ere long eleanor was ushered into his apartments he addressed her in spanish saying welcome fair maiden fear not you shall be treated with all courtesy how came you among the mountains i know not but tell me where am i in the fortress zali who are you i am daughter of count urena ha how came you asleep on the mountains i went to sleep in my fathers castle i awoke a captive i know no more abducted and drugged but rest at ease you shall be treated as befits your rank he bade a moorish maiden await her when gone he murmured beautiful as an houri i must win her if possible in due time alphonso and pulgar arrived at the camp of ferdinand at cordova alphonso bore dispatches from the governor of malaga and they visited the king whom they found unattended except bya by a stately grey haired priest welcome brave knights you bring important news perchance i may have a mission for you sir mystery that requires skill and secrecy we are at your service i doubt it not come hither tomorrow night meanwhile the priest father ambrose had been gazing earnestly with a startled expression on alphonsos features when they departed he drew down his cowl and sallied out in pursuitfollowing them to their lodgings in the evening father ambrose visited alphonso pardon my intrusion i feel a strange interest in your welfare and come to offer you some advice if acceptable it ill becomes me to reject the friendship of one of your calling you speak wisely for youth i want no knowledge of your secrets on diguise disguise  but be not surprised at my words i already know of some of your adventures the other day at urena and tell you you have made an enemy of the marquis dleon beware of him for he is a crafty foe ha what know you of dleon no good so be watchful of him he is already jealous of you for you found favor with urenas daughter really your means of information are to be envied they are reliable at all events chapter ii on the next night pulgar and alphonso visited the king who proposed that they should attempt the capture of the fortress zali the key of baza they pledged themselves to surprise it if possible we will now pass over a month among the mountains near baza was a small camp of christians it was the knight of castile and pulgar with his retainers their tents were in thickets they made no fires and had no horses all was still naught to indicate their presence well disguised as a moorish merchant alphonso left the camp to visit the infidel stronghold having concerted a plan of action with pulgar a few hours later he was ushered into abdallas presence to whom he represented himself as a moorish merchant who had been driven from malaga and cruelly wronged by the christians he talked of revenge and proposed to abdalla a plan for capturing the fortress alhama alleging that he had a brotherinlaw there who was a renegade moor whose assistance he could obtain abdalla was highly pleased with his plan and bade him make himself free in the castle during the afternoon he paced the castle walls talking with the sentinels on that evening abdalla sought eleanor fair maiden said he entranced by your beauty i have learned to love can you return my love i have wealth rank untiring ambition all are laid at your feet if you will become my bride arise it cannot be we are of different faith love overcomes all scruples of creed would you become a christian ha no you would not respect a renegade nay so pain me no farther i pray then farewell for today i hope for better favor on the next evening alphonso walked out on the northern battlements and tarried late in converse with a sentinel till they heard the hooting of a large owl in the ravine below the sentinel gazed over the parapet and alphonso dealt him a heavy blow stunning him instantly drawing a cord from his bosom with a weight attached he lowered it to the ground it was seized and drawing it up he fastened the grappling of a rope ladder to the parapet with a vial of fluid he washed the tawny hue from his features and threw off his robes in a moment more pulgar stepped on the terrace bringing alphonsos armor his retainers silently following till a hundred were assembled alphonso bade them follow him quickly a sentinel now gave the alarm with a loud shout they rushed for the great guardroom where the startled moors were arming meanwhile we will turn to another scene abdalla again visited eleanor lovely one said he will no entreaty induce you to love me pain me not i have already told you cruel maiden do you love another that you have no right to know ha i see how it is by heavens you shall be mine you shall never escape me with a low cry she sank upon her seat as abdalla spoke loud shouts and fierce yells with the clash of weapons fell upon his ears amazed he heard the cry of isabella for spain grasping his scimitar he rushed to the guard room there the conflict was short and fierce the light helmets and scimitars of the moor were of no avail before the axe and broadsword abdalla rallied his men but they soon yielded flying from hall to chamber abdalla bounded away toward eleanors apartment the knight of castile intent on his capture hurried after him and coming to the open apartment saw the moor bearing a christian maiden into a passage in the outer wall hold infidel or die he shouted too late sir christian and he seized the spring that closed the passage alphonso burled his axe with sure aim sinking it deep in the head of the moor and grasped the maiden as the passage closed as the light fell on her features he was amazed to behold eleanor urena as she recovered from her swoon she murmured the knight of castile howhowcame you here i have taken the castle oh heavens be praised but the moor deadbut oh how came you here in a few words she related her tale alphonso now sought pulgar the moors were all prisoners they held a conference and decided that alphonso should bear eleanor across the mountains in moorish guise and hasten to cordova for reinforcements and meanwhile to let the moorish flag wave from the flagstaff to keep the walls sentineled with men in the moorish garb and keep prisoners all stragglers who came to the gates meaning to reinforce ere the moors of baza should know the castle was fallen on the next morn alphonso was conversing with eleanor he said mine is a strange life all trouble and mystery with no happiness till i met with you since i have cherished sweet hopes grant me your love let that bless my career and i will yet claim your hand with rank proud as your fathers speak tell me my fate my heart is yours alphonso now i can face all my fathers wrath for know you not he has sworn i shall wed the marquis dleon hahas is it come to that but let us leave the lovers to their converse on the next morn alphonso and eleanor arrived at urena the count was rejoiced to meet his lost one again and amazed at her tale but he was cold though polite to alphonso eleanor had urged him to say naught of their love and so bidding her a sad adieu alphonso hurried away for cordova when he was gone eleanor soon found her page fernando whom she deputed to follow her lover and become his esquire joyfully fernando proceeded on his mission none knowing whither he went or missing him soon after alphonso with his new esquire left cordova with a heavy garrison for zali as he neared the fortress the moorishmountaineers on the surrounding crags taunted them but what was the moors surprise to see the gates thrown open and the cresent crescent sink beneath the banner of the cross we will now pass over a year and visit the spanish camp before grenada meanwhile the marquis dleon had renewed his suit with eleanor but in vain were the threats and entreaties of urena she vowed that she never would wed with dleon while the knight of castile lived dleon and urena were summoned to join the seige siege of grenada and eleanor and maria were in the suite of queen isabella eleanor often heard from alphonso by fernando now she hoped to meet him for isabella was going to the camp alphonso had often met with father ambrose who seemed much interested in his welfare thus matters stood one morning when the queens cortege was ushered into the camp amid bursts of martial music the roar of cannon echoed through the walls of the alhambra arousing the moors who thronged the walls and gazed sadly on the scene for now they knew there was no hope of the christians departing the tents of the spanish camp were pitched in straight lines in the centre stood the kings pavilion on its right the queens and adjoining hers del pulgars who was now chief guardsman of the queen among the maidens who remained in the queens pavilion were eleanor and maria thus alphonso soon found opportunity of quiet converse with eleanor meantime del pulga pulgar made love to maria dleon who received his suit with favor but bade him keep their love secret as the marquis dleon had pledged her hand to his boon companion francisco varra ha is it so said pulgarwhen grenada is fallen i will bear you away to my mountain home despite dleon one morn a daring moor dashed through the christian camp and burled his lance at the queens pavilion pulgar stepped from his tent in time to see the infidel disappear resolved to repay the insolence with alphonso and a band of choice spirits he attacked and forced a small postern gate and riding rapidly through the streets pinned an ave maria on the door of the grand mosque with his dagger by dint of hard fighting his comrades held the gate till pulgar cut his way back when they started alphonso bade his page stay behind but eager to witness the fray fernando followed on foot gliding through the gardens on the vega he nearly ran upon two men talking in a thicket listening a moment he was surprised to find that they were the marquis dleon and pedrillo plotting the assassination of his master pedrillo was to stab alphonso while sleeping in his tent with a poisoned dagger on the next night pulgar and alphonso waited the assassins coming having placed an image stuffed with straw in alphonsos bed with midnight came pedrillo they saw him enter and pierce the image with his dagger die assassin they cried he bounded through the rent he had made overturning a lamp into the straw as he rushed forth alphonsos sword cleft his brain they grasped his body and bore it to the space before dleons tent when they heard a cry of fire and beheld their tent and the queens in flames the wind was blowing and the whole camp was soon in flames and uproar with morn the whole army marched forth in battle array and the moors poured fort to meet them but they met with repulse and their last hope was gone for ferdinand soon began to build a city encampment with streets and churches among the camp followers was a beautiful flower girl named isadore one day dleon sought her disguised as a servant with a bouquet of roses and bade her deliver it to the knight of castile from his lady love saying his mistress bade him seek her and give her a piece of gold to deliver it isadore had a pet spaniel that soon after seized the bouquet in sportive play she gave him a sharp reproof and proceeded to deliver her message alphonso received the fragrant flowers and placed them to his nostrils for a moment when isadore returned she found her little spaniel in convulsions and evidently poisoned she thought of the bouquet and fearing mischief hastened back to pulgars tent and found alphonso suddenly taken ill in a few words she told pulgar her suspicions and protested her innocence pulgar sent fernando in haste to father ambrose who was also skilled in medicine he soon arrived alphonso was now alarmingly ill the priest watched his symptoms then shook the bouquet over a goblet of watera light powder fell from the leaves and the waters sparkled and foamed at its touch my son your life is in danger i have a powerful antidote it will increase your agony but it is all that will save alphonso drained the draught and was soon in convulsions at length he became calm and weak good father he murmured i am goinggonei have a secret to revealaheleanorfarewellfareand sank back breathless ambrose gazed wistfully on the white features and said tis overhe is at peaceaccompany me pulgarwe must converse of this matter in the morning pulgar had the sad task of breaking the news to eleanor tenderly he revealed the sad tidings she remained calm but the knight wept as he saw the stern woe imprinted on her features send maria to me she said i will follow him to the grave and then woe is me alphonso was buried that afternoon a vast concourse followed his body to its tomb in the new church of st john when the ceremony was over varra who was present with dleon said the fortunes favor you dleon do not forget your promise of maria wait wait till i get her back to the castle leon tis well but it seems strange urena so opposed this knight he was no common rival ha think you so i have my secret influencesi will win the proud beauty yet on the next day father ambrose sauntered by dleons quarters with isadore dleon was conversing with others mark the cavalier in blue sash is he the one that gave you the bouquet ayetis the same voice grenada soon surrendered and many knights returned home pulgar parted with maria bidding her never fear varras suit and if urged to give seeming consent for a while on the day after urena and dleon with the maidens returned to urena everything passed quietly for a couple of weeks then dleon addressed eleanorfair maiden i come to once more offer you my love mock me not by talking of love i loved you for years you have smiled on another he is no more return now my love and every act of mine shall be exerted for your happiness i have no faith in your words ha you revile me now listen i can hurl your father from his castle to the scaffold and cast you forth a beggar if i will yet i love you but i will plunge to the infernal regions sooner than lose you so ponder over the matter adieu chapter iii eleanor remained alarmed and astonished ere long her father entered daughter said he do you still refuse to wed with dleon oh spare me i cannot love him love perdition seize your whims he loves you as the wolf loves the lamb eleanor i have borne too long with your obstinacy i shall not die on the scaffold to serve your fancies so choose between dleon and crimestained beggary what mean you dleon holds proofs of my political intrigues that will cost me my head wed with him and our interests are one and wed you shall oh heavens do with me as you will life matters little now why was i not spared this blow great was marias agitation on the same day when dleon bade her prepare to wed with varra in a week when he should marry eleanor she hastened to eleanor who summoned fernando and bade him haste away and seek del pulgar too late said fernando yonder he is galloping away what yon minstrel pulgar what has he been doing here playing minstrel and spy so rest contented the wedding morn at length came maria gave up all hope when urena came to lead them to the altar on the same morn king ferdinand with a gallant troop arrived at urena he was returning to cordova and stopped to join the festivities urena was pleased with his majestys presence and begged that the kings chaplain might perform the ceremony the castle chapel was crowded with retainers and knights before the altar was a platform for the bridal party dleon varra eleanor maria urena and the king occupied the stage the priests stood before the altar one was old father ambrose the other a young priest with his cowl over his features seemed indifferent to the scene the parties arose maria trembling agitated but eleanor pale cold stern as a statue of ice urena and dleon were sponsors for the brides at the usual inquiry if any knew cause why the parties should not be united father ambrose paused a moment vexed at the delay urena cried go on to the amazement of all the young priest exclaimed in a loud tone i object to the marriage of maria dleon a cry of joy burst from marias lips go on shouted dleon i am answerable for her unite them at your peril holy father i object go on cried urena you cannot prevent my daughters wedding i object even to that then answer with your life hold said the king in a stern tone peace urena you must not trample on the church hear him moodily urena said speak then thou meddler the young priest threw off his robes revealing a light form clad in rich costume with the spurs and badges of rank ere he could speak a strange cry broke from the lips of eleanor and a yell of horror from dleon he regarded them a moment and said i have been known as the knight of castile tis a lie cried urena the knight of castile is dead ask him is it a liepointing to dleon who stood murmuring the gravethe gravehas given up its dead at the same time a knight arose in the audience twas del pulgar comrades said he tis the knight of castile alive as i have always known shall he be heard with a wild cheer the knights crowded the aisles and surrounded the platform with drawn swords the king looked on smiling now said he let there be silence alphonsothe dead alivesaid have patience while i relate a strange tale i was the son of one of three brothersthe eldest a noble whose wife died without any heir my father was next and died young leaving me and one sister in my uncles care my other uncle left one son my junior we were all reared under our uncles care i was ever protector of my young cousin but he was churlish and quarrelsome when we had attained manhood some years ago we followed the marquis of cadiz into the mountains of malaga you all know the massacre that befel us in the flight i kept no weapons but my sword halting among the rocks i met my cousin bearing his axe i said how shall we escape to my horror he replied you have stood too long in my path to perdition now with you and raised his axe my sword was of no avail he crushed my helmet and left me senseless and as he supposed dead attributing my loss to the moor the next morn i awoke a prisoner in a dungeon in malaga i soon recovered only to remain a slave and was placed in the employ of a moorish merchant where i remained till malaga fell by our arms for the last year del pulgar was prisoner with me when malaga was taken i sought a vault my master had compelled me to construct and bore away all his treasures giving me wealth in abundance i wished not to return to my home choosing to keep my secret i have since met my cousin and received several murderous attacks from him and at last came near the grave by poison this worthy priest gave me an antidote that left me in a trance and under the semblance of death i again passed from my cousins path i have now appeared to thwart forever his schemes and protect my sister urena who had listened in great agitation exclaimed whowho then are you gonsalvo marquis dleon the hand of maria is at my disposal and julian dleon shall meet his punisment punishment  and he clasped his sister in his arms julian stood frozen with rage and horror while he was speaking only his eye gleamed with baffled anger as it turned on the knights around him urena now seized gonsalvos hand saying welcome marquis dleon pardon my former rudeness the power that urged me now is gone turning to julian he said vile miscreant you have held me too long in your toils now i defy you julian replied you too shall fall and placing his hand in his bosom he drew out a packet and handed it to the king saying read your majesty see what a traitor your host has been the king read awhile and turning to urena said i knew all this long ago i pardon you on one condition speak said urena sinking on his knee i am under many obligations to the knight of castile he loves your daughter consent to their marriage willingly i always said she should wed the marquis dleon to the astonisment astonishment of all father ambrose exclaimed i protest against their marriage what mean you said alphonso i mean to object to this maidens marrying the present real marquis dleon and why can you object because he is too old and she could not desire to wed with him throwing off his wig and robes father ambrose stood forth a fresh looking man of some sixty years and said i am antonio marquis dleon an exclamation of surprise burst from the spectators and a cry of agony from julian who sank to the floor with a stream of blood flowing from his mouth he had burst a blood vessel and fallen stricken with death peace let him lie said the old marquis and listen to my tale some years ago at the time of my supposed decease i was sitting at a late hour in an arbor in my garden when i heard steps approaching and hastily concealed myself beneath the seat my nephew julian and pedrillo a rascally servant of his entered what was my horror to hear them coolly plot my death that julian might fill my rank pedrillo was to poison my wine on the morrow when they had left i hardly knew how to avert my perils all night i pondered i had some knowledge of drugs and possessed some narcotics with the aid of a trusty servant i fulfilled my scheme the next day i gathered all my treasures ready for flight poured away my wine and drank a potion that placed me in a trance resembling death for a time i awoke in an open coffin in the family vault with my servant by my side taking my treasures i hastened to cordova and sought admission to the church i have since kept strict watch on this villain who is now punished by his own deeds when the knight of castile came to cordova i penetrated his disguise and since watched over him i have been received into the church and now proclaim my nephew gonsalvo maquis marquis dleon julians spirit had flown to its retribution bear him away said urena and beside the corpse francisco varra crept away a sadder if not wiser man father ambrose said we came to a wedding i see naught to hinder

particularly excited over his income tax or as he called it his war tax he had never liked the warthought it unnecessary and wicked the work of politicians the fighting of brother against brother was a terrible thing in his eyes if you asked him who begun the warwho struck at the nations lifeif self defence were not a dutyhe would reply with vague generalities made up of partisan tricky sentences which he had learned without comprehending their just significance growler came in upon me the other day flourishing a square piece of blue writing paper quite moved from his equanimity there it is just so much robbery stand and deliver is the word pistols and bayonets your money or your life i took the piece of paper from his hand and read philadelphia sept  richard growler esq to john m riley dr collector internal revenue for the th district of pennsylvania office  chestnut st for tax on income for the year  as per return made to the assessor of the district  recd payment john m riley collector youre all right i said smiling id like to know what you mean by all right growler was just a little offended at my way of treating this serious matterserious in his eyes i mean ive been robbed of fortythree dollars and twentyone cents he continued do you say it is all right a minion of the government has put his hands into my pocket and taken just so much of my property is that all right the same thing may be set forth in very different language i replied let me state the case very wellstate it said growler dumping himself into a chair and looking as illhumored as possible instead of being robbed said i you have been protected in your property and person and guaranteed all the high privileges of citizenship for the paltry sum of fortythree dollars and twentyone cents as your share of the protection o thats only your way of putting the case retorted growler dropping a little from his high tone of indignation let me be more particular in my way of putting the case your income is from the rent of property yes what would it have cost you to defend that property from the army of gen lee recently driven from our state by the nations soldiers cost me growler looked at me in a kind of daze as if he thought me half in jest exactly what would it have cost you lee if unopposed would certainly have reached this city and held it and if your property had been of use to him or to any of his officers or soldiers it would have been appropriated without so much as sayingby your leave sir would fortythree dollars and twentyone cents have covered the damage perhaps not possibly you might have lost one half or two thirds of all you are worth growler was a trifle bewildered at this way of putting the case he looked puzzled you have a store on south wharves said i yes what has kept the alabama or the florida from running up the delaware and burning the whole city front do you have forts and ships of war for the protection of your property if not who provides them they are provided and you are safe what is your share of the expenses for a whole year just fortythree dollars and twentyone cents it sounds like a jest growler did not answer so i kept on but for out immense armies in the field and navy on the water this rebellion would have succeeded what then have you ever pondered the future of this country in such an event have you thought of your own position of the loss or gain to yourself how long do you think we would be at peace with england or france if the nation were dismembered and a hostile confederation established on our southern border would our war taxes be less than now would life and property be more secure have you not an interest in our great army and navy as i and every other member of the union does not your safety as well as mine lie in their existence are they not at this time the conservators of everything we hold dear as men and citizens who equips and pays this army who builds and furnishes these ships where does the enormous sums of money required come from it is the nations workthe people aggregate in power and munificence and so irresistible in mightunconquerable have you no heartswelling of pride in this magnificent exhibition of will and strength no part in the nations glory no eager hand helping to stretch forth growler was silent still there was no power in you or me to check the wave of destruction that was launched by paricidal parricidal hands against us if unresisted by the nation as an aggregate power it would have swept in desolation over the whole land traitors in our midst and traitors moving in arms against us would have united to destroy our beautiful fabric of civil liberty the government which dealt with all good citizens so kindly and gentle not that one in a thousand felt its touch beyond the weight of a feather would have been subverted and who can tell under what iron rule we might have fallen for a time or how many years of strife would have elapsed before that civil liberty which ensures the greatest good to numbers would have been again established but the wave of destruction was metnay hurled back upon the enemies who sought our ruin we yet dwell in safety your property is secure you still gather your annual income protected in all your rights by the strong national arm and what does the nation assess to you as your share in the cost of this security half your property no not a farthing of that property only a small per centage of your income from that property just fortythree dollars and twentyone cents pardon me for saying it friend g but i am more than half ashamed of you and seeing the way you put the case i am more than half ashamed of myself he answered frankly why taking your view this is about the cheapest investment i ever made you certainly get more money than in any other line of expenditure yesterday i had a letter from an old friend living in the neighborhood of carlisle the rebels took from him six fine horses worth two hundred dollars apiece six cows and oxen and over two hundred bushels of grain and not content with plundering him they burnt down a barn which cost him nearly two thousand dollars but for the men raised and equipped by the nation in support of which you and i are taxed so lightly we might have suffered as severely how much do you think it cost in money for the protection we have received in this particular instance a million dollars perhaps nearer ten millions of dollars from the time our army left the rappahannock until the battle of gettysburg its cost to the government could scarcely have been less than we have mentioned of this sum your proportion can scarcely have been more than three or four dollars and for that trifle your property and perhaps your life were held secure no more of that if you please said growler showing some annoyance you are running the thing into the ground i own up square i was quarreling with my best friend i was striking at the hand that gave protection if my war tax next year should be a hundred dollars instead of fortythree i will pay it without a murmur dont say without a murmur friend growler what then say gladly as a means of safety put it as you will he answered folding up collector rileys receipt which he still held in his hand and bowing himself out not many days afterwards i happened to hear some grumbling in my neighbors presence about some income tax growler hardly waited to hear him through my lesson was improved in his hands in significant phrase he pitched into the offender and read him a lesson so much stronger than mine that i felt myself thrown into the shade you have been assessed fiftyeight dollars he said in his excited way fiftyeight dollars one would think from the noise you make about it that you have been robbed of half your property fiftyeight dollars for security at home and abroad fiftyeight dollars as your share of the expenses of defense against an enemy that if unopposed will desolate our home and destroy our government already it has cost the nation for your safety and mine over a thousand million dollars and you are angry because it asks for your little part of the expense sir you not worthy the name of an american citizen that is hard talk growler and i wont hear it said the other it is true talk and you will have to bear it was retorted fretting over the mean little sum of fiftyeight dollars why sir i know a man who has given his right arm in the cause and another who has given his right leg do they grumble no sir i never heard a word of complaint from their lips thousands and tens of thousand have given their sons and wives have given their husbandssons and husbands who will never more return they are with the dead sir you are dishonoring yourself in the eyes of men a grumbler over this paltry war tax for shame i turned away saying in my thoughts so much good done my reclaimed sinner has become a preacher of righteousness loyal leagues clubs or

friend ive been thinking said i speaking to my husband who stood drawing on his gloves have you he answered then give me the benefit of your thoughts that we shall have to give a party you know weve accepted a number of invitations this winter and its but right that we should contribute our share of social entertainment i have thought as much myself was his reply and so far we stand agreed but as i am very busy just now the heaviest part of the burden will fall on you there is a way of making it light you know i returned how he queried by employing a professional caterer he will supply everything for the table and furnish writers we will have nothing to do but receive our guests my husband shrugged his shoulders and smiled as he said what will it cost almost anything we please but the size of the company will have the most to do with that say we invite one hundred then we can make the cost range anywhere between three hundred dollars and a thousand a large sum to throw away on a single evenings entertainment of our friends i am very sure i could put it to a better use very likely i answered still we cannot well help ourselves unless we give a party we shall have to decline invitations in future but there is no obligation resting on us to make it sensational let the hardings and the marygolds emulate extravagance in this line we must be content with a fair entertainment ment and no friend worth the name will have any the less respect for us all that is a question of money and good fame said my husband his voice falling into a more serious tone i can make it three five or ten hundred dollars and forget all about the cost in a week but the wine and the brandy will not set so easily on my conscience a slight but sudden chill went through my nerves if we could only throw them out there is no substitute replied my husband that people in our circle would accept if we served coffee tea and chocolate instead we would be laughed at not by the fathers and mothers i think at least not by those who have grownupsons i returned only last week i heard mrs gordon say that cards for a party always gave her a fit of low spirits she has three sons you know rather fast young men as the phrase is ive noticed them in supperrooms this winter several times a little too free with the wine we both stood silent for the space of nearly a minute well agnes said my husband breaking the silence how are we to decide this matter we must give a party or decline invitations in future i replied which shall it be his eyes looked steadily into mine i saw that the thing troubled him turn it in your thought during the day and well talk it over this evening said i after tea my husband said laying down the newspaper he had been reading and looking at me across the centretable what about the party agnes we shall have to give it i suppose we must drop out of the fashionable circle in which i desired to remain or do our part in it i had thought it all overlooking at the dark side and at the bright sideand settled the question i had my weaknesses as well as others there was social eclat in a party and i wanted my share wine and brandy and all said my husband we cannot help ourselves it is the custom of society and society is responsible not we there is such a thing as individual responsibility returned my husband as to social responsibility it is an intangible thing very well to talk about but reached by no law either of conscience or the statutebook you and i and every other living soul must answer to god for what we do no custom or law of society will save us from the consequences of our own acts so far we stand alone but if society bind us to a certain line of action what are we to do ignore society if we must ignore society or conscience what then his calm eyes were on my face im afraid said i that you are magnifying this thing into an undue importance he sighed heavily and dropped his eyes away from mine i watched his countenance and saw the shadows of uneasy thought gathering about his lips and forehead it is always best he remarked to consider the probable consequences of what we intend doing if we give this party one thing is certain what that boys and young men some of them already in the ways that lead to drunkenness and ruin will be enticed to drink we will put temptation to their lips and smilingly invite them to taste its dangerous sweets by our example we will make drinking respectable if we serve wine and brandy to our guests young and old male and female what do we less than any dramseller in the town shall we condemn him and ourselves be blameless do we call his trade a social evil of the direst character and yet ply our guests with the same tempting stimulants that his wretched customers crowd his barroom to obtain i was borne down by the weight of what my husband said i saw the evil that was involved in this social use of wines and liquors which he so strongly condemned but alas that i must say it neither principle nor conscience were strong enough to overcome my weak desire to keep in good standing with my fashionable friends i wanted to give a partyi felt that i must give a party gladly would i have dispensed with liquor but i had not the courage to depart from the regular order of things so i decided to give the party very well agnes said my husband when the final decision was made if the thing has to be done let it be well and liberally done i had a very dear frienda mrs martindale as schoolgirls we were warmly attached to each other and as we grew older our friendship became closer and tenderer marriage that separates so many did not separate us our lots were cast in the same city and in the same social circle she had an only son a young man of fine intellect and much promise in whom her life seemed bound up he went into the army at an early period of the war and held the rank of second lieutenant conducting himself bravely a slight but disabling wound sent him home a short time previous to the surrender of lee and before he was well enough to join his regiment it was mustered out of service albert martindale left his home as did thousands of other young men with his blood untouched by the fire of alcohol and returned from the war as thousands of other young men returned with its subtle poison in all his veins the dread of this very thing had haunted his mother during all the years of his absence in the army oh agnes she had often said to me with eyes full of tears it is not the dread of his death that troubles me most i have tried to adjust that sad event between myself and god in our fearful crisis he belongs to his country i could not withhold him though my heart seemed breaking when i let him go i live in the daily anticipation of a telegram announcing death or a terrible wound yet that is not the thing of fear i dread but something worsehis moral defection i would rather he fell in battle than come home to me with manhood wrecked what i most dread is intemperance there is so much drinking among officers it is the curse of our army i pray that he may escape yet weep and tremble and fear while i pray oh my friend i think his fall into this terrible vice would kill me alas for my friend her son came home to her with tainted breath and fevered blood it did not kill her love held her above despair and gave her heart a new vitality she must be a savior not a weak mourner over wrecked hopes with what a loving care and wise discretion did she set herself to work to withdraw her son from the dangerous path in which his feet were walking and she would have been successful but for one thing the customs of society were against her she could not keep him away from the parties and evening entertainments of her friends and here all the good resolutions she had led him to make were as flax fibres in the flame of a candle he had no strength to resist when wine sparkled and flashed all around him and bright eyes and ruby lips invited him to drink it takes more than ordinary firmness of principle to abstain in a fashionable company of ladies and gentlemen where wine and brandy flow as water in the case of albert martindale two things were against him he was not strong enough to set himself against any tide of custom in the first place and in the second he had the allurement of appetite i knew all this when with my own hand i wrote on one of our cards of invitation mr and mrs martindale and family but did not think of it until the card was written as i laid it aside with the rest the truth flashed on me and sent a thrill of pain along every nerve my heart grew sick and my head faint as thoughts of the evil that might come to the son of my friend in consequence of the temptation i was about to throw in his way rushed through my mind my first idea was to recall the card and i lifted it from the table with a halfformed resolution to destroy it but a moments reflection changed this purpose i could not give a large entertainment and leave out my nearest friend and her family the pain and wild agitation of that moment were dreadful i think all good spirits and angels that could get near my conscious life strove with me for the sake of a soul in peril to hold me back from taking another step in the way i was going for it was not yet too late to abandon the party when after a long struggle with right convictions i resumed my work of filling up the cards of invitation i had such a blinding headache that i could scarcely see the letters my pen was forming and when the task was done i went to bed unable to bear up against the double burden of intense bodily and mental anguish the cards went out and the question of the party was settled beyond recall but that did not soothe the disquietude of my spirit i felt the perpetual burden of a great and troubling responsibility do what i would there was for me no ease of mind waking or sleeping the thought of albert martindale and his mother haunted me continually at last the evening came and our guests began to arrive in party dresses and party faces richly attired smiling and gracious among the earliest were mr and mrs martindale their son and daughter the light in my friends eyes as we clasped hands and looked into each others faces did not conceal the shadows of anxious fear that rested on them as i held alberts hand and gazed at him for a moment a pang shot through my heart would he go out as pure and manly as he had come in alas no for i had made provision for his fall the company was large and fashionable i shall not attempt a description of the dresses nor venture an estimate touching the value of diamonds i have no heart for this no doubt the guests enjoyed themselves to the degree usual on such occasions i cannot say as much for at least one of the hosts in the supperroom stood a table the sight of which had smitten my eyes with pain its image was perpetually before me all the evening while my outward eyes looked into happy faces my inward gaze rested gloomily on decanters of brandy and bottles of wine crowding the suppertable to which i was soon to invite the young menmere boys some of themand maidens whose glad voices filled the air of my drawingrooms i tried to console myself by the argument that i was only doing as the rest didfollowing a social custom and that society was responsiblenot the individual but this did not lift the weight of concern and selfcondemnation that so heavily oppressed me at last word came that all was ready in the supperroom the hour was eleven our guests passed in to where smoking viands rich confectionery and exhilarating draughts awaited them we had prepared a liberal entertainment a costly feast of all available delicacies almost the first sound that greeted my ears after entering the supperroom was the pop of a champagne cork i looked in the direction from whence it came and saw a bottle in the hands of albert martindale a little back from the young man stood his mother our eyes met oh the pain and reproach in the glance of my friend i could not bear it but turned my face away i neither ate nor drank anything the most tempting dish had no allurement for my palate and i shivered at the thought of tasting wine i was strangely and unnaturally disturbed yet forced to commend myself and be affable and smiling to our guests observe mrs gordon i heard a lady near me say in a low voice to her companion what of her was returned follow the direction of her eyes i did so as well as the ladies near me and saw that mrs gordon was looking anxiously at one of her sons who was filling his glass for it might be the second or third time it is no place for that young man one of them remarked i pity his mother tom is a fine fellow at heart and has a bright mind but he is falling into habits that will i fear destroy him i think he has too much selfrespect to visit barrooms frequently but an occasion like this gives him a liberty that is freely used to his hurt it is all very respectable and the best people set an example he is too ready to follow i heard no more but that was quite enough to give my nerves a new shock and fill my heart with a new disquietude a few minutes afterwards i found myself at the side of mrs gordon to a remark that i made she answered in an absent kind of way as though the meaning of what i said did not reach her thought she looked past me i followed her eyes with mine and saw her youngest boy not yet eighteen with a glass of champagne to his lips he was drinking with a too apparent sense of enjoyment the sigh that passed the mothers lips smote my ears with accusation mrs carleton a frank cheery voice dropped into my ear it was that of albert martindale the son of my friend he was handsome and had a free winning manner i saw by the flush in his cheeks and the gleam in his eyes that wine had already quickened the flow of blood in his veins you are enjoying yourself i said oh splendidly then bending to my ear he addedyouve given the finest entertainment of the season hush i whispered raising my finger then added in a warning toneenjoy it in moderation albert his brows knit slightly the crowd parted us and we did not meet again during the evening by twelve oclock most of the ladies had withdrawn from the supperroom but the enticement of wine held too many of the men thereyoung and old bursts of coarse laughter loud exclamations and snatches of song rang out from the company in strange confusion it was difficult to realize that the actors in this scene of revelry were gentlemen and gentlemens sons so called and not the coarse frequenters of a corner tavern guests now began to withdraw quietly it was about halfpast twelve when mrs martindale came down from the dressingroom with her daughter and joined mr martindale in the hall where he had been waiting for them where is albert i heard the mother ask in the supperroom i presume ive looked for him in the parlors mr martindale answered i will call him for you i said coming forward oh do if you please my friend replied there was a husky tremor in her voice i went to the supperroom all the ladies had retired and the door was shut what a scene for a gentlemans house presented itself cigars had been lighted and the air was thick with smoke as i pushed open the door my ear was fairly stunned by the confusion of sounds there was a hush of voices and i saw bottles from many hands set quickly upon the table and glasses removed from lips already too deeply stained with wine with three or four exceptions all of this company were young men and boys near the door was the person i sought albert i called and the young man came forward his face was darkly flushed and his eyes red and glittering albert your mother is going i said give her my compliments he answered with an air of mock courtesy and tell her that she has my gracious permission come i urged she is waiting for you he shook his head resolutely im not going for an hour mrs carleton tell mother not to trouble herself ill be home in good time i urged him but in vain tell him that he must come mrs martindale turned on her husband an appealing look of distress when i gave her alberts reply but the father did not care to assert an authority which might not be heeded and answered let him enjoy himself with the rest young blood beats quicker than old the flush of excited feeling went out of mrs martindales face i saw it but for an instant after this reply from her husband but like a sunpainting its whole expression was transferred to a leaf of memory where it is as painfully vivid now as on that nevertobeforgotten evening it was pale and convulsed and the eyes full of despair a dark presentiment of something terrible had fallen upon herthe shadow of an approaching woe that was to burden all her life my friend passed out from my door and left me so wretched that i could with difficulty rally my feelings to give other parting guests a pleasant word mrs gordon had to leave in her carriage without her sons who gave no heed to the repeated messages she sent to them at last all the ladies were gone but there still remained a dozen young men in the supperroom from whence came to my ears a sickening sound of carousal i sought my chamber and partly disrobing threw myself on a bed here i remained in a state of wretchedness impossible to describe for over an hour when my husband came in are they all gone i asked rising all thank god he answered with a sigh of relief then after a moments pause he saidif i live a thousand years agnes the scene of tonight shall never be repeated in my house i feel not only a sense of disgrace but worsea sense of guilt what have we been doing giving our influence and our money to help in the works of elevating and refining society or in the work of corrupting and debasing it are the young men who left our house a little while ago as strong for good as when they came in alas alas that we must answer no what if albert martindale were our son this last sentence pierced me as if it had been a knife he went out just now continued mr carleton so much intoxicated that he walked straight only by an effort why did you let him go i asked fear laying suddenly its cold hand on my heart what if harm should come to him the worst harm will be a night at the station house should he happen to get into a drunken brawl on his way home my husband replied i shivered as i murmured his poor mother i thought of her replied mr carleton as i saw him depart just now and said to myself bitterly to think of sending home from my house to his mother a son in that condition and he was not the only one we were silent after that our hearts were so heavy that we could not talk it was near daylight before i slept and then my dreams were of so wild and strange a character that slumber was brief and unrefreshing the light came dimly in through halfdrawn curtains on the next morning when a servant knocked at my door what is wanted i asked did mr albert martindale sleep here last night i sprang from my bed strangely agitated and partly opening the chamber door said in a voice whose unsteadiness i could not control why do you ask katy who wants to know mrs martindale has sent to inquire the girl says he didnt come home last night tell her that he left our house about two oclock i replied and shutting the chamber door staggered back to the bed and fell across it all my strength gone for the moment send her word to inquire at one of the police stations said my husband bitterly i did not answer but lay in a half stupor under the influence of benumbing mental pain after a while i arose and looking out saw everything clothed in a white mantle and the snow falling in large flakes heavily but silently through the still air how the sight chilled me that the air was piercing cold i knew by the delicate frostpencilings all over the window panes after breakfast i sent to mrs martindale a note of inquiry about albert a verbal answer came from the distracted mother saying that he was still absent and that inquiry of the police had failed to bring any intelligence in regard to him it was still hoped that he had gone home with some friend and would return during the day steadily the snow continued to fall and as the wind had risen since morning it drifted heavily by ten oclock it was many inches deep and there was no sign of abatement my suspense and fear were so oppressive that in spite of the storm i dressed myself and went out to call on my friend i found her in her chamber looking very pale and calmer than i had hoped to find her but the calmness i soon saw to be a congelation of feeling fear of the worst had frozen the wild waves into stillness god knows best she said in a voice so sad that its tones ached through my heart we are all in his hands pray for me agnes that i may have strength if he does not give me strength i shall die i shivered for both in voice and look were signs of wavering reason i tried to comfort her with suggestions as to where albert might be no doubt i said he went home with a friend and we may look any moment for his return why should the absence of a few hours so alarm you there was a stony glare in her eyes as she shook her head silently she arose and walking to the window stood for several minutes looking out upon the snow i watched her closely she was motionless as marble after awhile i saw a quick shudder run through her frame then she turned and came slowly back to the lounge from which she had risen and lay down quietly shutting her eyes oh the still anguish of that pale pinched face shall i ever be able to draw a veil over its image in my mind suddenly she started up her ear had caught the sound of the street bell which had just been rung she went hurriedly to the chamber door opened it and stood out in the upper hall listening who is it she asked in a hoarse eager under tone as a servant came up after answering the bell mrs gordons man he called to ask if wed heard anything from mr albert yet mrs martindale came back into her chamber with a whiter face and unsteady steps not replying the servant stood looking after her with a countenance in which doubt and pity were mingled then turned and went down stairs i did not go home until evening all day the snow fell drearily and the wind sighed and moaned along the streets or shrieked painfully across sharp angles or rattled with wild impatience the loose shutters that obstructed its way every hour had its breathless suspense or nervous excitement messengers came and went perpetually as the news of alberts prolonged absence spread among his friends and the friends of the family the circle of search and inquiry became larger and the suspense greater to prevent the almost continual ringing of the bell it was muffled and a servant stationed by the door to receive or answer all who came night dropped down shutting in with a strange suddenness as some heavier clouds darkened the west up to this period not a single item of intelligence from the absent one had been gained since as related by one of the young gordons he parted from him between two and three oclock in the morning and saw him take his way down one of the streets not far from his home leading to the river it was snowing fast at the time and the ground was already well covered closer questioning of the young man revealed the fact that albert martindale was at the time so much intoxicated that he could not walk steadily i looked after him said gordon as he left me and saw him stagger from side to side but in a few moments the snow and darkness hid him from sight he was not far from home and would i had no doubt find his way there nothing beyond this was ascertained on the first day of his absence i went home soon after dark leaving mrs martindale with other friends the anguish i was suffering no words can tell not such anguish as pierced the mothers heart but in one degree sharper in that guilt and responsibility were on my conscience three days went by he had vanished and left no sign the whole police of the city sought for him but in vain their theory was that he had missed his home and wandered on towards the docks where he had been robbed and murdered and his body cast into the river he had on his person a valuable gold watch and a diamond pin worth over two hundred dollarssufficient temptation for robbery and murder if his unsteady feet had chanced to bear him into that part of the city lying near the river all hope of finding albert alive was abandoned after a weeks agonizing suspense and mr martindale offered a reward of five hundred dollars for the recovery of his sons body stimulated by this offer hundreds of boatmen began the search up and down the rivers and along the shores of the bay leaving no point unvisited where the body might have been borne by the tides but over large portions of this field ice had formed on the surface closing up many small bays and indentations of the land there were hundreds of places into any one of which the body might have floated and where it must remain until the warm airs of spring set the water free again the search was fruitless mrs martindale meantime had lapsed into a state of dull indifference to everything but her great sorrow that absorbed her whole mental life it was the house in which her soul dwelt the chamber of affliction wherein she lived and moved and had her beingso darkly draped that no light came in through the windows very still and passionless she sat here refusing to be comforted forced by duty yet dreading always to look into her face that seemed full of accusations i went often to see my friend it was very plain that in her mind i was an accessory to her sons death not after the first few days did i venture to offer a word of comfort for such words from my lips seemed as mockery they faltered on my tongue one day i called and the servant took up my name on returning to the parlor she said that mrs martindale did not feel very well and wished to be excused the servants manner confirmed my instant suspicion i had looked for this yet was not the pang it gave me less acute for the anticipation was i not the instrumental cause of a great calamity that had wrecked her dearest hope in life and how could she bear to see my face i went home very heavyhearted my husband tried to comfort me with words that had no balm for either his troubled heart or mine the great fact of our having put the cup of confusion to that young mans lips and sent him forth at midnight in no condition to find his way home stood out too sharply defined for any selfdelusion i did not venture to the house of my friend again she had dropped a curtain between us and i said it shall be a wall of separation not until spring opened was the body of albert martindale recovered it was found floating in the dock at the end of the street down which young gordon saw him go with unsteady steps in the darkness and storm on that night of sorrow his watch was in his pocket the hands pointing to halfpast two the time in all probability when he fell into the water the diamond pin was in his scarf and his pocketbook in his pocket unrifled he had not been robbed and murdered so much was certain to all it was plain that the bewildered young man left to himself had plunged on blindly through the storm going he knew not whither until he reached the wharf the white sheet of snow lying over everything hid from eyes like his the treacherous margin and he stepped unheeding to his death it was conjectured that his body had floated by an incoming tide under the wharf and that his clothes had caught in the logs and held it there for so long a time certainty is always better than doubt on the sunday after the saddest funeral it has ever been my lot to attend mrs martindale appeared for the first time in church i did not see her face for she kept her heavy black veil closely drawn on the following sunday she was in the family pew again but still kept her face hidden from friends who visited her i did not call again after my first denial i learned that she had become calm and resigned to one of these friends she said it is better that he should have died than live to be what i too sadly fear our good society would have made hima social burden and disgrace but custom and example were all against him it was at the house of one of my oldest and dearest friends that wine enticed him the sister of my heart put madness in his brain and then sent him forth to meet a death he had no skill left to avoid oh how these sentences cut and bruised and pained my heart already too sore to bear my own thoughts without agony what more shall i write is not this unadorned story sad enough and full enough of counsel and warning far sooner would i let it sleep and go farther and farther away into the oblivion of past events but the times demand a startling cry of warning and so out of the dark depths of the saddest experience of my life i have brought this grief and shame and agony to the light and let it stand

to restrain him he leveled it and firedpage  horrible disclosures of a policeman i was sitting one day in my office in louisville kentucky when a pale fair goodlooking youth apparently about eighteen or twenty years of age entered and after closing the door and glancing around the apartment said i wish to speak with mr isaac baldwin my name sir i replied are we alone inquired the stranger we are i answered you see there is no one present but ourselves you are sure we cannot be overheard for i have a great secret to communicate which must be private and confidential take a seat i answered speak low and i will guarantee that no one hears you but myself the youth sat down and for a few moments seemed to be laboring under great excitement united with embarrassment i watched him closely for there was something so singular in his manner that i felt great curiosity to learn what matter of importance he had to communicate requiring so much secrecy i noticed that his bosom rose and fell like one panting from exertion and that large beads of perspiration stood on his forehead all indicating a mind ill at ease mr baldwin he said at length in a tone that quavered in spite of his efforts to appear calm and composed mr baldwin personally we are strangers but i have more than once heard of you as a brave daring and nobleminded man i bowed to the compliment and after a slight pause he proceeded i sir an about to trust you with a secret that will place my life at your disposal and after this avowal you will not of course be surprised at my hesitation whatever you may see proper to communicate i replied i assure you it shall be strictly confidential my words and manner seemed to reassure him and he continued you sir as i have reason to know have been for many years a constable in this city and during that time have been a great terror to evil doers i am about to make a revelation that will startle you and then ask your assistance to rid the country of a terrible gang of freebooters go on said i becoming greatly interested in the young stranger and anxious to be master of his secret i will begin he pursued by telling you what you already know that horses are every day stolen and the thieves are never detected houses are set on fire and consumed and no one suspects the incendiaries men are knocked down in your streets and on the highways robbed and sometimes murdered and the robbers and murderers escape and lastly that the country is flooded with counterfeits and spurious coin while the counterfeiters are suffered to run at large all this sir you know i do was my reply and i know it to my sorrow well sir what say you if i put you in possession of facts that will lead to the detection of all these villains these pests of society i will say i answered that you will be doing society a great service and that you will entitle yourself to a liberal reward i seek no other reward than revenge dark bloody and terrible a fearful expression sweeping over his pale handsome features yes sir you shall know all and then i will have that vengeance on these miscreants which they little think me capable of obtaining know then sir that i myself am one of this gang or rather was for i have renounced and am now about to denounce and betray them you i cried in perfect astonishment you a mere youth a beardless boy are you so steeped in crime as to belong to a band of cutthroats thieves incendiaries and highway robbers yes replied my strange companion a dark scornful smile curling his thin lips while his black eyes as he fixed them upon me assumed a singular expression yes mr baldwin i did belong to them but i do not any longer you forget sir that my business here is to betray them into the hands of justice true true pray proceed neither am i so young as you suspect replied the other and as to my being a beardless boy perhaps i shall astonish you by saying i am no boy at all how cried i fairly starting from my seat in surprise you are then yes sir interrupted the other i am a woman in male disguise madam said i i am all amazementi did not even suspect your sexpray go on my singular guest proceeded with her story and it was more than an hour before she concluded i shall not here repeat her communication for the reader will be made acquainted with all the details in the narrative of my own perilous adventures resulting therefrom i will merely state for convenience that she gave her name as elvira wilston but said moreover that while she remained in male attire i must remember to address her as clarence wilburton to carry out her plan of breaking up this formidable banditti it was necessary for me to so disguise myself that even my most intimate friend would not recognize me in broad daylight and thus proceed to the grand rendezvous of the robbers and join their fraternity i am not a coward by nature but i must confess this proposition startled me and made me hesitate by doing as this young stranger advised i would place my life entirely at her disposal and have no assurance beside the unsupported word of one who acknowledged herself connected with cutthroats and robbers that the whole plan was not a well laid scheme to put me out of the way i knew too that all the characters belonging to that class of which she professed to be a member hated me and that nothing would give them greater pleasure than to get me in their power where i could be silenced without danger to themselves and even if she were really in earnest as i believed she might at any moment change her mind and betray me beside a thousand events might happen to lead to my detection which would certainly be followed by instant death but notwithstanding all the danger i pictured to myself i soon decided on making the trial be the consequences what they might for imminent peril always possessed a charm for me which through my long eventful life i have never found myself able to resist i informed elvira of my decision and she seemed wild with delight her face flushed her eyes flashed and her bosom heaved as she exclaimed through her set teeth with hissing passion now will i have my revenge now shall they feel the consequences of insulting me the very worm that is trod on will turn the meekest lamb may be goaded into a fiery relentless tigress during the day i called on some half a dozen officers made them acquainted with my design requested their cooperation and then prepared to set out on my perilous mission i took leave of my family about dark telling them i might be absent several days but thought best to conceal from them whither i was going and for what purpose i controlled my feelings and parted from them in a cheerful manner though at heart i suffered the most intense anguish for i thought that in all probability i should never behold them again i then repaired to my office put on my disguise and awaited the arrival of elvira who had agreed to meet me there at eight oclock in the evening she came punctual to the hour i was seated when she came in and purposely stayed at her as if she were a stranger in order to see if she would penetrate my disguise she looked at me hard for a moment or two and then without any show of recognition inquired for mr baldwin hell be in directly i replied gruffly she took a seat to await his return whats your business with mr baldwin i inquired in the same gruff tone looking fixedly at her that i suppose i am at liberty to communicate to the gentleman himself she replied tartly her face flushing with anger then why dont you speak boy i rejoined my names baldwin she looked at me closely and scrutinizingly for a few moments as if she thought it possible it might be myself in disguise but her reply satisfied me i had nothing to fear in this respect it is mr isaac baldwin i wish to see she said with a scornful smile i laughed outright well elvira i rejoined if you play your part as well as i shall mine and do not betray me i think our plan will succeed she was thunderstruck and it was some time even then ere i could convince her of my identity but when i at last succeeded she was delighted beyond measure and assured me that even my wife and mother would pass me in broad daylight without the remotest idea they had ever seen me before there was a boat to leave at nine bound for the south and to this we now repaired i shall not touch on the incidents of our river voyage as these have nothing to do with my story suffice it to say therefore that on the evening of the second day we were landed on the kentucky side of the river a few miles below paducah and something less than fifty above the mouth of the ohio we are now said my strange guide in the territory of the freebooters and it behooves us both to play our parts well remember all the signs and passwords i have communicated and follow my instructions to the letter there were no signs of habitation where we landed except a solitary house an old dilapidated gloomylooking structure which stood on a steep rocky bluff whose base was washed by the ohio that is one of the haunts of these desperadoes said elvira in a whisper as she pointed toward it many a benighted traveler has found that old structure the end of his earthly journey murdered whispered i with a cold shudder ay sir murdered is the word and his body sunk deep in the waters that roll below but come let us hasten forward surely not there i said shrinking back with a feeling of horror we must pass the night there was the calm reply you are not afraid oh no not in the least i replied forcing a laugh and quickening my pace though my hair seemed to stand on end and cold clammy sweat stood in beads on my forehead is the house inhabited i inquired yes or i would not go there but you have nothing to fear if you follow my instructions remember your name is tom hurdis and that you have been to the north and east for a year or so sowing the rhino or in other words passing counterfeit money you will probably meet some of the gang there and you must swagger and blow with the best of them but will they not suspect i do not belong to them no for the signs and passwords will deceive them beside those you will meet there are the underworkers none except the captain lieutenant and one or two others know the faces and number of those belonging to the band these you will not be likely to see as it is a very rare thing they stop here and should anything chance to occur of a horrible nature you must act with the indifference of one accustomed to scenes of violence and bloodshed heavens you do not mean that i shall look tamely on and see a fellowbeing murdered yes if necessary for it is only by being calm and noting close that we shall be able to succeed in our design it is not on these mere tools i wish to take revenge but on their principals and as the latter are men moving in the first circles of society rich highlyrespected and even members of the church we can only convict them through their tools and must necessarily understand all the ramification of their diabolical league but a wordwill there be any here that know you i think noti hope not none at least ever saw me in this disguise and as clarence wilburton i hope to pass as one of your sex arrived at the door my companion knocked and a gruff voice said come in we entered a low dingy illlighted apartment and beheld two persons a swarthy lowbrowed villanouslooking man of about forty and a female about the same age who in every respect seemed a fit companion these were the host and hostess we both walked up to the man took his hand pressed his knuckles with our thumbs drew our hands across our throats and said life is dear and money scarce ha you belong to us he replied with a show of cordiality weve more friends here he gave a peculiar whistle as he spoke and from an adjoining room entered six stout villanous cutthroats whose hands i likewise had the pleasure of shaking as the host introduced each by name he having first learned ours we then entered into general conversation which was kept up for more than an hour during which i told such stories of myself and exploits as i thought proper and got from them many important secrets concerning themselves the band their leaders etc among other things of importance i learned that the second night following there was to be a meeting of the band at their cave or rendezvous and that it was expected the leaders would be present this intelligence so delighted elvira that she found it difficult to restrain her joy within proper bounds it was in the hope of some such meeting that she had brought me hither at this time though the precise time of the meeting she did not before know you must set out for this rendezvous tomorrow she said to me in a whisper as soon as we could manage to have a little conversation aside yes you must start for this rendezvous and i will be your guide most of the way you must be present at that meeting for they will be there and it is important that you see them and now she added with a look that expressed more than her words you must not sleep too soundly tonight but have an eye to what is taking place if i err not youll see enough to hang every villain here good heavens what do you mean hush wait and watch and as if to prevent my questioning her further elvira rose and crossed the room apparently to chat with the hostess an hour later i was lighted up stairs by the host and conducted to a miserable apartment containing a very decent bed considering the place i trust youll sleep sound tom he saidbut if you do happen to be disturbed i spose you wont mind it o no i dont mind trifles replied i with a knowing look but what is about to happen well maybe nothingbut we kind o expect a lodgerwho if he comes will sleep in the next roomthats allyou take ehha ha ha and with a wink and a nod the host set down the light and went out i shall not attempt to portray my feelings when i found myself alone but let the reader fancy himself in my situation with the belief that the foul murder of some innocent party was coolly premeditated and he may be able to conjecture in some slight degree what they were it is enough to say that i carefully examined my pistols put out my light and turned into bed without undressing further than to remove my coat and boots for some time i lay and listened to every sound determined not to give way to sleep for a single moment but at last everything seemed to become still and gradually a heavy drowsiness stole over my senses and in spite of my efforts to the contrary i went off into a state of unconsciousness how long i slept i do not know but i was suddenly awakened by a cry of murder murder help help mechanically i sprang from my bed and then perceived through the crevices of a thin board partition there was a light in the adjoining room softly on tiptoe i stole up to one of these crevices and peering through i beheld a sight so horrible that my blood curdled my hair stood on end and my tongue and limbs became paralyzed there were three of my villanous companions in the next apartment two of whom had a struggling stranger in their grasp whom they were in the act of gagging while the third was holding the light and looking calmly on as soon as the stranger was gagged they placed him on the bed with his head over the side underneath which was a large tub then one of them drew a knife i heard a gurgling gaspsaw the warm blood flowing in a big red streamand then overpowered with the awful sight i sickened my senses reeled and i staggered back to my bed more dead than alive and while i was yet looking too horrorstruck to move or speak he deliberately placed it upon his outstretched neck and cut his throat from ear to ear i heard a gurgling gasp saw the warm blood flowing in a big red stream and then overpowered with the awful sight i sickened my senses reeled and i staggered back to my bed more dead than alive how i passed the rest of that awful night i leave the reader to imagine i saw no morebut i had seen enough i had been an eyewitness to a diabolical murder and i secretly swore to have vengeance on the damnable perpetrators the next morning i met the host and his cutthroat associates with a smile you had a busy night of it i said ah did you hear us i was afraid the scoundrel would disturb you with his yells he replied but we fixed him at last and he rubbed his hands with glee yes we fixed him and well we got paid for our trouble fifteen hundred dollars will cover a multitude of sins so much i rejoined well that was worth having certain but who was he and how came he here for i did not see him last night no he hadnt come when you went to bed but we were waiting for him the fact is you see hed been up above to paducah with a small drove of cattle and we knew he was going to return this way on horseback so instead of killing him on the road as we might have done and left the blood there to tell on us the hostler where he put up who is one of us put a nail in the horses foot in such a way that after hed gone a few miles it would lame him and by the time he got here hed be compelled to put up for the night it takes usha ha ha but are you not afraid the authorities will trace you out i said the authorities be he rejoined how are they going to prove it on us eh no nojust let em come around here and theyll git sarved the same way the reader scarcely needs to be told that after this i had no appetite for breakfast and i pretended to be a little sick at my stomach as an excuse for not eating elvira however exhibited no squeamishness but ate very heartily though as she afterward informed me it cost her a great effort to force it down but she was fearful if she imitated my example the cutthroats would begin to regard us with an eye of suspicion the meal over we took leave of this hellish haunt of blood and horror and it was not until several miles lay between it and us that i could breathe with any freedom and even then my mental vision saw nothing but the murdered man with his throat cut from ear to ear and the red blood running ugh it was heartsickeningrevoltingthe very quintessence of horror and my flesh crawls as i write we journeyed on foot the whole of that day over a wild gloomy sparsely populated country and at night very much fatigued and footsore we put up at a miserable inn in a small village of some halfadozen houses i wonder if any here belong to the gang i said to elvira yes the landlord for one she answered for i made a private sign and he returned it heavens i exclaimedwhat a country i did not think there was at the present day a spot in all the mighty west where such a system of organized crime prevailed sir you have seen nothing she replied this is only one of many such which lie within a days journey of here you know the geography of the country where we are and therefore need not be told that three stateskentucky illinois and missouriall point together here and are only divided by the ohio and mississippi rivers and what more convenient than to pass from one state to the other should the officers of justice chance to get on the trail of one of these criminals and thus set the laws at naught the full extent of this association it is not to be supposed you will ever know i do not even know it myself and as to apprehending even onehalf of the criminals that is impossible however you may get hold of the leaders and break up the gang for the present then i shall get my revenge and you will be doing the state good service elvira and i passed the night at the inn occupying separate apartments and the next day we loitered about the village until toward night as the rendezvous was only a few miles distant and we did not care to approach it during the day as soon as it was dark we set out again and crossing a bleak barren country in a short time arrived at the foot of a steep mountain up this elvira led the way as one accustomed to the place while i followed at length we reached a low tabular rock surrounded by bushes and at a sufficient elevation to command a view of the country over which we had passed here said elvira i shall await your returnfor you must now proceed alone i need not tell you that you are about to encounter dangers of a very alarming naturebut if you follow my instructions to the letter i think you will escape unharmed proceed to the grand rendezvous of the banditti and join the fraternity as a member there is no danger of your being questioned by any but the leaders and if you take care to keep well in the background i trust you will be able to observe them closely and remain unobserved yourself return to the foot of this mountain pass around to the opposite side until you come to two large elm trees which stand out by themselves distinct on the plain take a central line between these trees to the foot of the hill and you will find a small and rather obscure path follow this and it will lead you direct to the cave then bear in mind all i have told you and trust the rest to providence now go and if possible meet me here before midnightbut if you come not within one hour of daylight i shall give you up for lost and depart alone farewell i shook her hand warmly and we parted i followed her advice and about an hour after found myself at the mouth of the cave high up on the mountain a sentry stood at the entrance who on my approach exclaimed who comes here one of the invisibles was my reply what wouldst thou to enter the place of covenant in whose name our mastersbarronni pass on brother i entered the mouth of the cave which was about the size of an ordinary doorway and descended a long flight of stone steps lighted at the bottom by a small lamp whose feeble rays just made the darkness visible and emerged into a large subterranean apartment which i should judge was about a hundred feet square with a high rocky ceiling and which was lighted by torches stuck in the ground all along the walls what made it more gloomy or frightful was a row of highly polished human skulls just behind the torches on which the lurid light shone with a ghostly effect about fifty men were present seated on benches near the entrance with their attention fixed upon the officers who occupied a raised platform at the opposite extreme of the cave of these latter there were fourthe captain lieutenant secretary and treasurerwho sat around a table on which were a bottle a lamp and two human skulls one white and the other red perhaps stained with the blood of some victim i took a seat among the larger party without speaking and without being questioned or hardly noticed and i need scarcely add that i became a deeply interested spectator of all that followed for something like half an hour the officers chatted and laughed among themselves during which several new comers silently took their places among the larger party who occasionally conversed with one another in whispers or very low tones at length the chief arose and as the light flashed full upon his pale intellectual features the reader may judge of my surprise when in this captain of bandittithis selfstyled barronnii recognized a gentleman who not long since had called at my office in louisville on private businessno less than that of putting me on the scent of a well known thiefand who had then given his name as william barnwell and represented himself as a new orleans merchant at first i was disposed to doubt his identity but i soon had reason to know i was not mistaken gentlemen he said taking up the red skull and pouring into it wine from the bottle i drink your very good healths with our usual toastlong life and freedom to the gentlemen of the forest the city the road and the river and death to their enemies mies and he quaffed the wine amid universal applause i now pronounce this meeting organized for business he said in conclusion and sat down the treasurer then arose and said gentlemen all of you who have been so fortunate as to collect money will now please pay it over to me to be safely kept until the day of division when each will get his share several now stepped forward one after another and handed him different sums which he placed in a large iron box while the secretary made a minute of how each had been obtained and the names of the parties that paid them in to my horror and dismay i saw the host of the haunt of murder step forward and heard the treasurer exclaim in a tone of surprise fifteen hundred dollars jack you have done well and shall not long go unrewarded no thought i not if isaac baldwin escapes alive it now occurred to me that if i could get hold of the books of this hellish association i could at the same time get hold of secrets that would hang them all and this i determined to effect as soon as possible though of course i had no hopes of succeeding in my design immediately i now noted the officers closely so that i would be sure to know them again let me see them where i might when the money had all been paid in and some other trifling matters had been attended to the secretary handed a paper to the captain who arose and said gentlemen here are some matters i wish attended to before our next meeting between smithland and dover on the cumberland river lives a farmer by the name of mason from whom a paltry horse was taken not long ago and who is moving heaven and earth to ferret out the thief or thieves i wish his house and barns burned to the ground and if this does not serve as a sufficient warning for him to hold his tongue the next time he must be silenced himself also the  bank at cincinnati i have ascertained can be robbed without much difficulty or risk and a splendid haul be made also the jewelry store of   co louisville can be entered in the rear by boring the groundfloor shutter and slipping back the bolt only one clerk sleeps there and he so soundly that very litttle little danger is to be apprehended i scarcely need tell you i learned all this in my capacity of a new orleans merchant also near the mouth of the wabash river in indiana one patrick kernes an irishman deals largely in horses and next week will have no less than fifty on hand which we must manage to dispose of for him also there are ten thousand dollars bogus at the mint now ready for circulation beside twenty thousand dollars of newlysigned paper currency for such as like to speculate in this way also there is an englishman now sojourning in st louis who carries with him no less than ten thousand dollars sowed sewed up in the lining of his coat he is making the tour of the country and is anxious to find material for a book of thrilling adventure i think we ought to help him to some whether he lives to write them out or not everything is planned and at the proper time he will be decoyed into visiting this region of country in order to be an eyewitness to the habits and customs of halfcivilized yankees also that scoundrel of a police officer isaac baldwin of louisville who has succeeded in nabbing so many of our friends must be put out of the way there is a plan in progress by which it will be effected i have once called on him already and shall soon do so again when everything is ripe for the accomplishment of my purpose i will only add he suspects not our design and will readily fall into the trap set for him also jim herring who is about to be tried in  for the murder of a traveler must be got off with false witnesses these and many others of like nature will be matters sufficient to occupy our time gentlemen until we meet again when there will be a regular division of the spoils of which due notice will be given to each and all tomorrow i shall be in paducah where i shall remain a couple of days and such of you as wish to engage in the affairs presented will meet me there at the usual place and receive private instructions thence i shall take a boat for louisville and shall stop with martin   street where i expect to remain a couple of weeks and where i shall be happy to see or hear from you address your letters to or make inquiries for william barnwellfor this is the name i am known by at presentand you will be duly notified of any change and now as everything seems arranged to the satisfaction of all we will proceed to the trial of the traitor bring in the prisoner two men headed by the lieutenant instantly proceeded to a distant part of the cave and rolling aside a large stone soon reappeared leading in a poor wretch heavily ironed whose teeth chattered and whose knees fairly smote together with terror he was greeted with hisses and curses and led up in front of the stand so as to face the captain who addressed him in a stern tone it has seldom been our lot he said to try any for the crime of which you john dennis stand accused a year ago you joined our fraternity and i myself administered to you the dreadful oath of our order that oath you have broken you were arrested for a paltry theft and became so alarmed for fear of a few months imprisonment that in the event of being liberated you promised the most awful disclosures well sir you told your talebut fortunately no one would believe itand you were tried convicted and sentenced to six months imprisonment think of that you whitelivered scoundrel think of that and hide your dastardly face to avoid six months imprisonment you would have hung us all well you served your time out and the moment you were liberated you were decoyed to a certain house where you were kidnapped and afterward brought hither where you will soon suffer the punishment due to your crime let me console you with the fact that if you had remained true to us you would doubtless have been liberated by some means or other long ere your term of sentence expired and some mark of honor would have been conferred upon you for your fidelity to the band as it is you will suffer at the hands of those who can both reward and punish have you anything to say in your defense mercy mercy gasped the poor wretch only pardon me this time good captain and gentlemen and i pledge you my souls salvation i will be the truest of the true to you all ever more you pledged your souls salvation before sir to the same thing and that oath i repeat you have broken as to mercy we know not the word and the pardon of a traitor is against both our constitution and the conscience of every member of our band no sir you must be made a warning example to the rest and i hereby doom you to be hung by the neck until dead prepare men to execute the sentence a rope that i had not before noticed drawn up to the ceiling over a pulley was instantly lowered to one end of which the lieutenant who officiated as hangman made a noose which he adjusted to the neck of the doomed who was held by the two men who had him in charge and whose shrieks and screams for mercy were the most piercing and heartrending i ever heard the moment all was ready up with him said the captain and the lieutenant and the others seizing the rope drew the poor wretch up by the neck and fastening the end around a timber at the foot of the platform left him dangling in mid air oh it was an awful spectacle and the crowd of outlawsthe grinning skullsthe gloomy glare of the torchesand the dangling traitorall formed a picture of horror that curdled my blood and made me sicken as i gazed as soon as the man was thought to be dead he was lowered and his body given to six of the party selected by lots to bury of these lots i had to draw one and i trembled lest it should fall to my share to be one of the sixbut fortunately i escaped soon after this the meeting broke up and never did i rejoice more than when i again found myself at liberty in the darkness without i soon managed to become separated from all of the cutthroat band and i made the best of my way to where i had left elvira oh i am so glad you have come she said in a whisper as i joined her and she seized my hand and shook it warmly you do not know mr baldwin how alarmed i have been lest something might befall you and now that i find you safe i could almost weep for very joy well did you get into the cave and see barronni and his associates i saw enough i replied and proceeded to narrate what is already known to the reader and so your own life was menaced she exclaimed as i mentioned the captains remarks concerning myself ah i did not know of thisit is fortunate for you you went it seems the villain i returned oh that i had him in my power and that i trust will be ere long and i proceeded to finish my story and so the traitor was hung she replied well i knew this was to take place and that made me so anxious for you to be there you now have proof enough to hang barronni and his officers and that is all i ask then will my revenge be complete but you have never told me elvira i said how you came to be connected with these banditti well sir i call tell you in a few words i was a young inexperienced honest maiden when i accidentally became acquainted with henry parker alias maurice graham alias william barnwell alias barronni he paid his addresses to me but was opposed by my parents who are wealthy and live in memphis tennessee he persuaded me to elope with him and we were subsequently married as i supposed legally though i have since found out it was a sham ceremony performed by one of his own men dressed as an episcopal clergyman well strange as it may seem i loved this man and even after i found out the deception he had practiced i forgave him and continued to live with him the same as before by accident unknown to himself i discovered who and what he was and still i clung to himthough determined to have him in my power in case he might play me false i managed by one means and another to find out the secrets i have revealed to you and you only well awful as they are i do not deny that had he proved true to me i should never have betrayed him but at last as i feared he would he grew tired of me and put me aside for a rival after this he no longer came to see me and when i heard where he was and called on him i was denied admittance determined however that i would confront front him i went one night in disguise to a place where he and his three officers were assembled i saw him face to face but he spurned me from his presence and the others jeered derided and cursed calling me names that i will not pollute your ears by repeating i left their presence and the moment i was alone i swore to have that vengeance which i am now i hope about to obtain but if they knew you possessed their secret it is a wonder they allowed you to run at largethat they did not secretly murder you ah sir but they do not suspect that i possess their secretfor i was always careful to conceal all such knowledge from them well aware what would be the result to me if they found it out no they think they have completely triumphed over me but it is said those laugh best who laugh last and i bide my time we now held a consultation as to what was best to be done and finally decided on returning to louisville as it was not yet eleven oclock at night we calculated on being able to reach the ohio before daylight to be brief we succeeded and were so fortunate as to hail an upriver boat soon after on which we took passage on arriving at louisville my first care was to prepare for arresting barnwell alias barronni whenever he returned to the city i called together the same officers to whom i had imparted elviras story before leaving and acquainted then with my adventures they were astonished and horrorstruck at my narrative and were almost disposed to doubt the truth of my story we took counsel together and everything was arranged to bring the guilty to justice on informing elvira of our plan she was delighted and could scarcely restrain her joy which truth compels me to say however was fiendish she declared she must be present when we arrested barnwell and all i could say to the contrary had no effect she begged and pleaded so earnestly to be allowed this favor that at last i yielded a reluctant consentthough i had a kind of presentiment that something terrible would happen some two or three days after my return word was brought me by one of the spies i had on the lookout that a person answering the description i had given of barnwell had arrived and been driven to martins   street as i knew it was his intention to spend a couple of weeks in town i felt in no hurry to seize him it was about the middle of the afternoon when i received the welcome news and i determined to do nothing until after dark at the proper time i sallied forth accompanied by elvira who had resumed the habiliments belonging to her sex some half a square from martins i left her in charge of another police officer with instructions that when i should come to the door and cough she was to be ready to enter while he and some half a dozen others were to keep guard around the house to prevent the possibility of escape and be ready to come at my call i had a curiosity to confront barnwell alone and have some conversation with him before i made the arrest martins house was a three story brick of a very genteel exterior and the last place one would think of looking for the chief of a band of outlaws and murderers i rang the bell and on the servant offering i inquired for mr martin the reply was that he had gone out but would return in the course of an hour perhaps less time i then asked if a mr barnwell was stopping with him and the reply was in the affirmative and to my question if he were at home the answer to my great delight was the same i then said i desired to speak with the latter gentleman for a few moments if he was disengaged and was immediately shown into the parlor by the servant who disappeared to call the man i sought in a few minutes barnwell entered dressed in splendid style and with so gentlemanly a bearing that i could hardly realize he was the same person who had presided over the banditti at the cave on perceiving me he at first turned a little pale but quickly recovering himself advanced to me with a smile of recognition and friendly extending his hand said mr baldwin if i mistake not i think we had the pleasure of meeting before yes i replied in the same cordial manner you once called upon me at my office i accidentally learned you were in town and stopping with mr martin and having some little business with him i thought i would just see you also in regard to the information you gave me concerning that thief whom i regret to say we have not been able to get hold of as yet indeed the rascal i am very sorry for it he replied eyeing me as i fancied a little suspicious perhaps i said you could give me some additional information no i know of nothing beyond what i told you before i have been out of town ever since and just returned today ah yesbeen to new orleans i suppose yes and when i left here i expected to remain therebut a private speculation induced me to return to this city i am glad however you have called on me about that matter and i will put myself to some little trouble to gain more information should i succeed i suppose i can find you at your office almost any day yes i am generally there and shall be happy to see you at any time now i think of it he said appearing suddenly to recollect something i think i know of a little affair that will not only surprise you when i make it known but if you follow my advice will put money in your pocket it is a great secret however and i shall tell it to you in strict confidence i bowed my acknowledgments and he added but not tonight mr baldwinnot tonight tomorrow perhaps or soon at all events i will do myself the honor to call upon you where we can be certain of not being interrupted here i was suddenly seized with a violent fit of coughing and muttering something about the room being close proceeded to the door the moment i opened it elvira and two of the officers entered and i stepped quickly back to the parlor where i met barnwell just coming out to see what was the matter the moment his gaze fell upon elvira and those with her he seemed to comprehend all at a glance his features grew deadly pale and he staggered back fairly gasping what is the meaning of this it means that you william barnwell alias captain barronni and was there hanging dead cold and stiff his face black and his tongue protruding and his features awfully distorted with the last mortal strugglep are my prisoner i said approaching and placing my hand on his shoulder it means that i triumph in your shame you monster fairly screamed elvirai who once loved you whom you by the basest arts seduced and then cast off for another it means that the hour of my sworn vengeance has come and that i shall live to see you hung and afterward have the pleasure of dancing over your grave no by  that shall never be cried barnwell with a horrid oath gnashing his teeth with fury and quick as thought he produced a small pocket pistol and ere i had time to restrain him he leveled it and fired elvira uttered a single piercing shriek and fell back into the arms of a police officer a bloody corpse the ball had penetrated her heart and her sinful soul had fled to give an account of its deeds at the bar of the most high now gentlemen i am your prisoner said barnwell calmly take me away to prisoni know my fate as we were about removing him martin returned and was immediately taken into custody both were conveyed to prison together but placed in separate cells it was terrible to witness the heartrending grief of the family of martin when they learned what had taken place he had a beautiful wife and daughter both of whom shrieked and tore their hair and exhibited such hysterical emotions as i hope never to witness again i tried to console thembut i found it impossible to say anything that would soften their grief the coroner was sent for an inquest held on the body of elvira and a verdict returned in accordance with the facts the next day she was decently interred and i was one of the few who followed her remains to the grave and as i saw her body lowered to its last restingplace and reflected on what a bright career might have opened to this poor child of sin and sorrow had she followed the advice of her parents i do not shame to say i shed a manly tear of pity and regret for her untimely fate the trunk of barnwell was broken open that night and all his letters and papers taken possession of these i found on perusal would be of great service in aiding me in the detection of his accomplices in crime in order that the latter might not get wind of what had transpired and so elude us we hushed up the murder of elvira as much as possible and the press so far generously aided us that only one paper and that an insignificant one contained any notice of the horrible transaction the next day all that night i sat up reading the papers and letters found in the trunk of barnwell and early in the morning accompanied by a magistrate i repaired to the prison hoping we might induce him to make a private confession the jailer conducted us to his cell and as he opened the door another horrible spectacle was presented to my view barnwell had taken off his shirt torn it into strips and with these had made a halter which he had fastened around his neck and the grates of his cell window and was there hanging dead cold and stiff his face black his tongue protruding and his features awfully distorted with the last mortal struggle oh heaven spare me any more sights like this i cried rushing away like one fleeing from the plague there is but little more to be told that strictly belongs to my narrativefor the breaking up of the banditti is a matter already known to the public through the press acting upon the knowledge we had already obtained we went secretly to work making arrests we traced out the officers of the banditti and two more of them were taken into custody and lodged in prisonthe other escaped and is yet at large we made a descent upon that vile haunt of crime where i witnessed the murder of the drover and i am happy to say succeeded in arresting the host and hostess and all the others who had any concern in that diabolical transaction they are all now in prison awaiting their trials none as yet have made any confessionthough i have hopes that one or more may be induced to do so before the dreadful penalty of the law for murder is carried into effect a large number have been apprehended alreadybut the greater portion of these cutthroats i fear are still at largethough the den of their infamy is for the present broken up and being scattered and without leaders they have not the same power to inflict their damning crimes upon society as before while i live it shall be my care to prevent so far as lies in my power their reorganization i have said i have hopes that some one or more of the prisoners will make a confession of their crimes for by this means and this only shall we ever be able to get at the secret and mysterious history of this band of outlaws i make it a point to visit the prisoners occasionally and never fail to urge upon them each and all a confession of their guilty deeds as yet i have received no positive assurance from any that he will make the desired revelation but the host of the house where the drover was murdered who gives his name as jack wilder has led me to believe that i shall yet prevail upon him to give me a true narrative of his bold daring and bloody adventures should he do so and the public have a desire to peruse his criminal story i shall feel it incumbent upon me to lay it before the world in a form similar to this of mine a word or two more and i have done i do not know reader what you may think of my own adventures i hope you have found them interestingi know you have found them horrible my friends persuaded me to publish them and whether or no i have acted wisely in taking their advice i leave you to determine at all events you have them i will only say in conclusion that the names of every person mentioned in all the foregoing pages are fictitiouseven my own is a nom de plume but if the events are real mere names are of little consequence and that the startling incidents i have recorded are true in every particular i need only refer to the statements published in the daily and weekly prints a few months since reader unless as the chronicler of the adventures of jack wilderor as he was termed by his companions bloody jacki shall probably not appear before you again adieu isaac baldwin the end an officer commanded the brave and gallant crittenden to kneelnever replied he i kneel only to my god just published the awful doom of the traitor or the terrible fate of the deluded and guilty being a full disclosure of the character and selfish designs of general lopez who decoyed a multitude of our best and bravest citizens to an awful and untimely grave in the island of cuba by william bland cincinnati published by h m rulison no  east third street  entered according to act of congress in the year  by h m rulison in the clerks office of the district court for the district of ohio the awful doom of the traitor or the terrible fate of the deluded and guilty narrative of the adventures of william bland on the island of cuba i left the city of pensacola west florida upon the th day of june  for the purpose of gaining fame distinction and personal popularity as well as to increase my small amount of this worlds gear for my father had left me but his tools with which he had worked as a carpenter and a small frame house upon leased ground my mother died while i was quite young and my education and care had fallen upon my father who dying left me alone in the world without a single relative my education and fiery nature of soul made me yearn for a more ambitious course of life than had been my fathers lot i had friends among persons of my own sphere in society but i felt that they were not the companions of my spirit nature had given me a handsome face and a tall active person and i resolved to unite the efforts of my mind and body to distinguish myself beyond the sphere in which fortune had chanced to place me and paramount to this came a consideration which determined me to make some hazardous effort to be worthy of a being upon whom i had set my soul this was inez ramos the most exquisite creature in west florida she was the daughter of one of the richest planters on the escambia river he was a descendant of the old spanish stock who originally settled that delightful country she was a true castilian beauty angelic in countenance and of a most graceful and elegant figure i had first seen her in the streets of pensacola and from the moment my eyes rested upon hers i resolved to earn a reputation and be worthy of the glorious creature who filled my constant thought i met her daily and although i dared not speak to her i felt that as we glanced one upon the other that there was a deep mysterious sympathy of soul between us and this thought grew upon me as day by day new and unmistakable evidences became visible that my passion was in some sort reciprocatedwith this belief hope became resolve and at this time i heard that the patriots of cuba were upon the eve of making an effort for liberty the very word fired my soul and collecting all the means which i had in the world i made my way to new orleans where narciso lopez had publicly made it known that it was his intention relying on the assistance and goodwill of such troops as could be raised in this country and the state of insurrection which existed among the creoles of cuba to make a descent upon that island and establish the cause of freedom among a people who were suffering under tyranny and only waited for aid to revolt and declare themselves a free and independent community mr segur of the new orleans delta who had through his paper represented the island in a state of revolt furnished some seventyfive thousand dollars to purchase the steamship pampero and sundry cannon arms and cartridges had been bought at a sale of united states government remnants lopez assured the party which i joined soon after my arrival in new orleans that there was a feeling of disaffection throughout the vuelta abajo region which was the principal tobacco part of the island and that the people were ripe for revolution and that the discontented spirits were white agriculturists and mechanics the very classes who in all ages have been the successful men in heading attempts to overthrow tyranny we were likewise assured by lopez that the country people would crowd down to the seashore to welcome us and furnish us with provisions and water and whatever else they could for our aid and comfort it was intended to make a revolt in the vuelta abajo in order to divert the attention of the governor of the island from the landing of lopez and his army which consisted of six companies of infantry three of artillery one of cuban patriots one of hungarians and one of germans under the command of narciso lopez as generalinchief and john pragay as second in command and wm l crittenden as chief officer in the regiment of artillery thus we embarked in the steamer pampero with a force which amounted to six hundred men exclusive of several who joined us in the mississippi river but the captain having announced that he could not carry us all a portion returned leaving on board four hundred and eighty men we touched at key west for stores where we were informed that a revolt had taken place in the vuelta abajo lopez accordingly determined to land in that district of the island owing however to the appearance of certain spanish vessels we were compelled to disembark on the shore of morillo at eleven oclock at night on the eleventh instant notwithstanding some slight opposition was manifested by those engaged in guarding certain stores at that point however these were soon deserted and forsaken and lopez having left colonel crittenden with about two hundred men in charge of the unnecessary arms and provisions advanced with the remainder of the expedition to las pozas with this portion of the army i went myself the few countrymen fled as we came up and on arriving at las pozas we found the place abandonednor would the inhabitants be persuaded to return the next day we were attacked by the spanish troops but although they fought manfully they were repulsed with considerable loss while our own gain was made very dear by the death of colonel pragay a gallant officer who had been second in command of the expedition as well as several other officers and some fifty men killed and wounded finding that we did not meet with the expected sympathy of the people which lopez had taught us to anticipate and that we were attacked by the very persons whose cooperation we had relied upon it was determined upon to take to the mountainsthe branches of the sierra camirioca which approach the coast in this region with this intention we gave up possession of las pozas and started on for pinar del rio but by the treachery of the guide we were conducted to the coffee estate of frias where we again encountered the spanish troops this resulted in the loss of four or five of our men which reduced our force at frias to two hundred and twenty mentwelve or fourteen being wounded with these we passed to brujo where we spent the night and the next morning went to martilorena where we were surprised as we were breakfasting by the spanish troops and our whole party entirely dispersed over one hundred of us secreted ourselves in the forest onethird without arms where we remained for four days with no food but the horse of lopez together with some corn and wild plantains i with a party of some eight or ten finding the forces of lopez wholly routed after we had killed as i said before the horse of lopez and divided it among one hundred and twentyfive wretched men who had not eaten for fortyeight hours encamped on one of the highest mountains in the island of cuba exposed to all the violence of terrific northern storms we therefore left the party and wandered through the mountains unable to extricate ourselves subsisting on such weeds and roots as we could find it is impossible for me to describe the sufferings of those nightsheaven forbid i should ever pass such again the rain fell in torrents while ever and anon a terrible crash would announce that some massive tree had fallen either before the force of the wind or the still mightier lightning rocky ravines which had been dry or at best trickling rivulets rose and swelled until they became roaring rivers which rushed with terrible rapidity down through the gorges of the mountains and lost their foaming torrents in the black forests which clothed the steep mountain sides here we were without shelter fire or food pelted by the pitiless tempest and our stomachs gnawing with ravenous hunger we remained in the mountains until the morning of tuesday the th when having had but one meal in six days and after eating loathsome snails and other insects we felt that we could bear it no longer we therefore determined to go into the plains considering that it would be better to be killed outright than to die a lingering death which we would certainly do in the mountains we accordingly advanced to a house where we were treated with a great deal of kindness and received a most excellent breakfast the master of the hacienda was absent when we arrived the mistress of the house her daughter and a slylooking priest were the only white persons that we saw the daughter was a noble and beautiful woman i saw the name ramos upon several pieces of plate as we breakfasted and seeing the kindness of the young lady toward us i ventured to ask her in spanish if she had relatives in florida she answered in very good english that she had and that she had visited the united states and that in fact she had been partly educated at the convent of sisters at nazareth kentucky i mentioned to her the name of inez ramos and in an instant her whole face brightened and glowed with a ruddy gleam of satisfaction as i unfolded to her apart from the company my intimate acquaintance with inez but how was my own surprise heightened when she assured me that inez was her cousin and dearest friend here was a link which in a moment united us i saw in isabella ramos an angel come to rescue me and under the light of her dark eyes hope rose in my heart and i fondly dreamed in the sunshine of the hour to once again set foot upon my beloved home of florida and behold the being for whom i had thus periled everything but darkly was that golden dream clouded when my companions refreshed invigorated and prepared with a guide and provisions to make their way to the south shore and escape beheld just as we were upon the point of leaving the cunning villanous priest with a large body of armed countrymen who surrounded us in the twinkling of an eye and immediately bound us securely after stripping us of half our clothes and rifling our pockets of whatever they contained before my hands were bound inez stepped up behind me and slipped into one of them a strip of paper with these words on it in english written with a pencil young friend you may rely upon isabella as she did this she gave me a look from her beautiful eyes of such sympathetic meaning as left no doubt in my mind but that i might yet hope that day we reached san cristobal under the impression that we were to be shot but upon our arrival there we were informed that a proclamation had been issued ten hours before our arrest sparing the lives of all fillibusteros who had been made prisoners or gave themselves up in four days except the traitor lopez with forty other prisoners we left san cristobal for havana and on the same night reached guayamas the terminus of a railroad road from havana here an order came from concha the captaingeneral to proceed to mariel and embark he being fearful that we would be torn to pieces by the rabble we left mariel in the steamer almendares and reached havana where we were confined in the city prison in the rear of the fort called the punta we prisoners first had our hair cut close to our heads next passed into the hands of another barber who deprived us of our whiskers another provided us with prison uniform and the whole terminated by a huge negro fastening us together in pairs with a chain similar to a logchain in size and weight and firmly secured to the ankle shortly after our confinement the city was astir and a mingled mass of human beings crowded on through the main streets toward the gates of the city at the paseo this tide of people was made up of negroes creoles and spaniards they went forth to see fiftytwo americans butchered in cold bloodthe condemned without a trial marched forth to die with a firm unflinching step casting a scornful eye upon the cowardly mob of spanish negroes and officials they were bade to kneel and receive the fire of the troops not one obeyed an officer stepped up to the brave and gallant crittenden and commanded him by the authority and order of the governor to kneel how noble was his reply never i kneel only to my god in a moment more the massacre was complete and the hot blood of the fifty valiant hearts soaked the earth of that misgoverned island i cannot dwell upon the dreadful shock given to our feelings as these heroic men were led forth ten at a time and fell before the murderous fire of the spanish officials their hirelings heaved the yet warm bodies into carts and hurried them off from our too much oppressed vision oh this coldblooded assassination gave a bloody hue to the bright sun which lighted the grim batteries and white walled houses of havana on the night of the th of august lopez disappeared from the mass of our band with a few cubans and endeavored to make his way to the south in his route he came across a young mountaineer and offered him a draft for two thousand dollars if he would guide him to the plantation of diego de tapia but lopez doubting the fidelity of the person afterward disappeared there sat the body which a moment before was alive but now a ghastly and inanimate corpsep  in the woods and was captured in the pinos del rangel by jose antonio castaneda with a force of peasantry and afterward surrendered to captain luis jarequemada upon the th just seventeen days after his landing lopez was taken to the city of havana and imprisoned and upon the day of his execution was brought forth at seven oclock in the morning in the presence of an immense crowd in front of the punta and the vast prison opposite the moro wherein we were confined and from a high window in one corner of my cell i witnessed him when he suffered death by the garrote his effigy having been beaten about the streets for two days previous by the inhabitants and afterward burnt eight or ten thousand troops were assembled and as many citizens when lopez came forth with a firm and steady step but a pallid face and ascended the platform his person was enveloped in a white shroudthe executioner then removed the shroudand there stood the general in his full military uniform before the assembled multitude his appearance was calm dignified and heroic not a muscle quivered he looked upon the preparation for death unmoved his countenance remained unchanged and his whole bearing was firm and manly the executioner now removed his embroidered coat his sash cravat and all the insignia of his military rank as a token of his disgrace lopez with his hands tightly bound together in front now stepped forward and in a clear strong voice slowly spoke to those around charging upon certain persons the treachery of having compromised him and asserting that his death would not change the destiny of cuba having spoken for some time he was interrupted by the executioner who was standing a little behind him and who said in a gruff and insulting tone come be quick be quick lopez turned his head partly around fixed his eyes upon the man and said sternly gritting his teeth wait sir he then continued adieu my beloved cuba adieu my brethren with this the general stepped back seated himself on the stoola priest with the crucifix and burning taper stood on one side of him and the executioner upon the otherthe collar of the garrote which was formed of two steel plates was then clasped around the prisoners neck and the priest now placed the crucifix between the generals hands and just as he was in the act of inclining his head to kiss it the executioner sprung the fatal screw and at that twist the joint of the neck cracked and the head of the unfortunate man at the same instant dropped forward and touching the crucifix he never moved again there sat the body which a moment before was alive but now a ghastly and inanimate corpse the execution was conducted in the most orderly manner and in perfect silence no shouting or any other exhibition of applause was manifest immediately after the execution lopezs body was taken down and privately buried thus perished on the first day of september  narciso lopez a man that blinded over five hundred men by tales of falsehood forgery and deceit and led them from personal and mercenary motives into one of the most lawless rash and foolhardy expeditions of any age and by cloaking his damnable design of selfishness and imposing upon the noble souls of chivalrous men led them under the nominal pretext of advancing the standard of patriotism and liberty into an unknown snare which ended in imprisonment suffering and death thus did he deceive us all in our expectations to see the friendly aid of the creoles of the island for whose relief and freedom we were ready to risk our lives but alas we found the most bitter enemies where we had been taught to expect the warmest friends and the promised hospitality was not manifested by a single cuban after our landing on the contrary the country people were our implacable foes and not only was no sign of friendship shown by them but they were the persons who hunted down lopez himself from his fastnesses and after binding him hand and foot brought him to havana a prisoner and made him pay the penalty of his falsehood upon that murderous machine the garrote we had all been deceived and by a man whom had we known him could never have so far imposed upon our credulity and our ardent disposition to give the blessings of liberty to our fellow creatures the cubans the most of our party were wellmeaning young men whose sympathy being aroused they were ready to render whatever aid they might to an oppressed and struggling people for the fate of these noble and disinterested men my heart bleedsbut for the infamous trickster who led us into peril which cost not only his own miserable life but the death or capture of upward of four hundred americans among whom were some of our bravest and most promising but misguided young men whose blood now fattens the soil of the queen of the islands while many a hearth has been made desolate many a heart wrung and many a family covered with the weeds of mourning in the homes which they have left this ambitious traitors whole history has been wholly against all the principles of liberty or the rights of human nature he was born in venezuela south america in  his father was once a wealthy land proprietor and his mother who is still living is a woman of rare elevation of mind and character in the struggles for south american independence his father was stripped of nearly all his property and reduced to the necessity of entering into commercial business at carracas and as an auxiliary to his main establishment he established a branch at valencia in the interior under the charge of young lopez here the father gen lopez headed the patriot forces of citizens and soldiers in  and defended the town against the attacks of the spanish power after a manly resistance of three weeks the place was obliged to yield and be given up to pillage and massacre general lopez was taken prisoner by the spaniards and executed the next dayand forthwith young lopez deserted the patriot cause joined the spaniards his fathers murderers almost immediately after the murder and fought on the side of the royalists throughout the rest of the war and under that party held the post of colonel of a regiment of cavalry and accepted a cross of san fernando at the end of the war he went to spain and fought on the side of royalty in that country and was sent by the spanish government to cuba with an appointment to a civil office here he married a most amiable and estimable lady of fortune and by the most cruel course of treatment broke her heart and spent all her fortune at the cockpit and gamingtable and at last finding himself out of money and out of power he conceived the desperate project of enriching himself by getting up a rebellion and revolution in cuba and all his movements in the united states during the last few years of his infamous career were directed to the accomplishment of that scheme of selfinterest and selfaggrandisement his first effort was to congregate a band of fillibusters upon round island last year who were dispersed by order of general taylor the next was the inglorious though not remarkably disastrous expedition against cardenas which led many to doubt the skill if not the courage of lopez the last and most tragic of all was our own pampero expedition which resulted so fatally to four hundred brave americans and his own end upon the scaffold of the garrote as a felon and a traitor his last enterprise was at best but poorly planned and badly if not ingloriously executed we were the sufferers who received neither countenance nor support from those we went to redeema people who do not wish and are unfit to be free but i now come to the key of the whole warthe avarice of lopez cuban bonds were worth ten to twenty cents on a dollar when our expedition left naturally they would increase as the prospect of liberating cuba became more certain lopez with his agents pretended that if the expedition liberated cuba from spanish tyranny that it would place a debt of fifty to a hundred millions upon the island and at the expiration of the war and after cuba should be free then it was to have been annexed to the united states and as a matter of course the payment of these cuban bonds was to be assumed by the united states and at least fifty per cent of this fifty or a hundred millions of dollars would have been in the pockets of those wouldbe philanthropists who active as they wished to be thought in the holy cause of liberty had personal interest alone at heart little did they care for the mothers wives and sisters of the gallant men who formed this illfated expedition who have been rendered miserable forever they do not feel the chains the anguish borne by those noble fellows doomed to spend years of their lives in spanish prisons i now turn to my own condition after the massacre of crittenden and the execution of lopez i still remained in prison opposite the moro it was a terrible place and while there i saw a man in one of the wards who told me that he had been confined in that horrid place for fifteen years his hair was white as drifted snow and his countenance the saddest that my eyes ever gazed upon he spoke to me and gave a short account of one of the most awful histories that ever fell from mortal lips said he i am an old man now yet by fifteen years my soul is younger than my body fifteen years i existed for i did not liveit was not life in the selfsame dungeon ten feet square during six years i had a companionnine years i was alone i never could rightly distinguish the face of him who shared my captivity in the eternal twilight of our cell the first year we talked incessantly together we related our past lives our joys forever gone over and over again the next year we communicated our ideas to each other on all subjects the third year we had no ideas to communicatewe were beginning to lose the power of reflection the fourth at intervals of a month or so we would open our lips to ask each other if it were indeed possible that the world went on as gay and bustling as when we formed a portion of mankind the fifth year we were silent the sixth he was taken awayi never knew whereto execution or to libertybut i was glad he was goneeven solitude was better than the dim vision of that pale vacant face after that i was alone only one event broke in upon my nine years vacancy one day it must have been a year or two after my companion left me the dungeon door was opened and a voice i knew not whence uttered these words by order of imperial majesty i intimate to you that your wife died a year ago then the door was shut i heard no morethey had but flung this great agony in upon me and left me alone with it again now you would ask what was my offense this only the archbishop was passing the street and i refused to bow to himwhereupon one of his menials struck me upon the head with the back of his sword split my ear in two and felled me to the earth i rose and snatching a sword from one of the party in the procession i dealt a stroke that severed flesh and bone and fairly cut off the hand that had stricken me down for this and this only have i suffered these horrors when i had heard this account my soul was dreadfully shaken now thought i if they could be so heartless as to confine this man here for fifteen years for such an offense when shall i as an invader and rebel escape from this black den of misery and wretchedness day by day my hope darkened they would not allow me the privilege of writing to my friends in the united states and our consul at havana from some heedlessness or heartlessness refused to give any attention to our prayers the gibbet or the galleys seemed to be the only probable change from our loathsome confinement at length it was rumored through the prison that we were all to start in a few days for spain how terrible my condition was at this news i cannot express my hopes were crushed and the thought of being separated forever from home and friends was almost maddening how sincerely did i curse the hour wherein i left my home upon this wild illdigested expedition i could not sleep the lone hours of the night were doubly dark from the gloomy prospect of captivity in the spanish galleys i wrote to the consul but no answer cameand i was hopeless at this desperate hour when i was daily expecting that we would be shipped for spain i was informed that a young spanish gentleman wished to see me being at large in the prison i went to a room where i found a very handsome young man with long mustachios he motioned me to a seat beside him and the jailer left us alone the young man smiled and whispered to me you may remember my promise upon the instant the lips parted displaying the exquisitelyformed teeth and the rich english tones struck my ear i recognized isabella ramos my heart leaped to my mouth and i was almost wild with joy but she bade me suppress my emotion and proceeded to inform me that the american prisoners would be sent to spain but to have hope and she would make an effort for my escape and having communicated the stratagem whereby she designed to effect my release she departed upon the next day a vailed lady called to see me in the cell wherein i usually slepti at once recognized isabellaand after some hurried conversation she displayed beneath her mantle which she doffed the suit of a spanish officer a full uniform and capand the dress and shawl which she herself had worn outside at that time she gave me as well as her bonnet and vail and informed me of the password by this time it was after sunset and the shadows of evening were falling fast so that a face could not fairly be distinguished with a beating heart i advanced after i left my cell to the door where the turnkey was idly smoking his cigar i gave him the password rapidly and in an under tone so as not to betray my foreign accent i passed out and by the direction of isabella i went to a house at some distance and took my seat upon the stone steps in a few moments i beheld an officer in full uniform approach the guard at the prison door and the doorkeeper touched his hat to him as he walked out with a bold military bearing not a moment was necessary for me to decide that it was isabella and in a few moments she joined me and beckoned me to follow her we walked rapidly to another quarter of the city where a negro coachman with an elegant carriage was waiting in a brief period we were without the bounds of the city and the night had set in a terrific storm suddenly rose but we stopped not the driver laid whip to the horses and we dashed on at a tremendous rate sometimes we found the creeks grown to torrents from the sudden heavy showering rain which poured upon the earthand we were in constant peril from the apparently reckless manner in which the negro who drove being urged on by his mistress dashed into gulleys and ravines and lashed his almost flying steeds through the darkness of the night which was illuminated every instant by the wild magnificent gleams of lightning at length we reached a hacienda in the country and the moon burst out from the mountainlike clouds in all her white glory and we alighted in a beautiful grove of leafy trees and followed a shellpaved alley to the large old mansion here i remained secreted for several days in an upper room of the house seeing no one but the servant who attended upon me and brought my meals and isabella who devoted nearly all her leisure to me and cheered me with the prospect of my escape from the island she told me that she had written immediately after she had first seen me to inez in pensacola and expected an answer in a short time notwithstanding i was confined my condition was a most wonderful contrast from that of a horrible dark prison to a large apartment overlooking a lovely landscape where the blue mountains were glowing in the golden sunshine and the rich groves of green hard by were filled with merry mockingbirds whose songs were not sweeter than the beautiful blackeyed spanish maidens who daily poured forth her songs upon the guitar and enlivened with her brilliant conversation my heart which had lately been almost in the most hopeless state of despair her father i learned was at another of his estates near cano and there was no person on the plantation saving father anselmo the priest whom i had seen when i first met her and the negro slaves of her father i had been several days in this room when one night about midnight i heard a shriek a loud and shrill shriek and then low muffled or stifled cries for help i listened and again i heard them though less distinctly than before at last i felt assured i heard my name called i sprang from my bed and dressed myself as quick as possible and hurried down stairs i heard the noise of a struggle in isabellas room and i hastened toward it as fast as i could through the darkness by the very faint light of the moon through the shutters i could distinguish one i took to be isabella in her bed struggling in the arms of a man who by the dim light i could not recognize but rushed upon him at once i grasped the figure firmly when instantly a keen dirk pierced my arm through and through and the pain compelling me to relax my hold the figure fled and in the gloom of the apartment i could not discover it but a few moments had elapsed when noises were heard all through the house and in came rushing the priest anselmo followed by ten or twelve powerful negro men here cried he is a scoundrel in your young mistress bedchamberseize upon him and bind him hand and foot isabella sat upright in her bed in her night clothes her black eyes wild with affrightand the priest stood close at hand and commanded the negroes to seize me it was he isabella cried i in english here is a piece of his gown i snatched from him he has stabbed me behold my arm but before i could exhibit my bleeding arm fairly to her she fainted and the ironhanded negroes bound my arms behind my back and the priest gave orders to bear me instantly to the sugarhouse here i was confined for two days without water or food upon the night of the second day i was taken out by the priest and negroes and placed on a mule with my hands tied behind me and conveyed through the woods and chapparal thickets toward mariel and imprisoned in a house smaller but similar to the sugarhouse wherein they had before confined me i was almost dead when we arrived from famine thirst and the blows which a giant negro had rained upon my back as from faintness i from time to time reeled in my saddle as i rode shortly after i was shut up in this house the negroes commenced piling dried sugarcanes and other combustibles around the outside of it when the horrible thought came over me that they were about to burn me alive i shrieked and screamed but the negroes laughed long and wildly at my cries and through a crack in the wall i could see them as the day was about breaking dancing with a fiendish delight around the buildingsome of them carrying armsfull of the dried canes and others holding blazing drywood torches after a time i saw the devilish priest moving among the ogrelike blacks by the red glare of the torches and the pale streaks of dawn i could discern his infuriate face at length he gave the command and the negroes like demons came rushing with their crimson torches and touched fire to the stalks of cane they burst into a flame instantly and i shrieked in the wildest and most soulstartled agony the smoke after a while came creeping up through the crevices of the floor all around the house as it was encircled by fireand from the various holes an army of huge rats came rushing into the room some singed and mad with pain flew at me i ran around the apartment to attempt to escape from them but they assailed me in every quarter jumping at me and attempting to crawl up my legs and biting me wherever they could lay hold on me i had no weapon but struck them off with my hands and feet but they would not desist they were furiously mad and in such innumerable quantities that i could not keep them off in addition to which the smoke now became so stifling that i could not breathe except when i put my head near the floor when the rats flew at my face i attempted to rush against the wall and kill myself but i was stunned only and was roused from the shock by a severe bite from a rat but by this time the atmosphere became so heated that it was impossible to respire and i again swooned from suffocation as i fainted i could hear shouts without and saw the red flames burst through the frame of the building my next sensation was that i was in the open air i opened my eyes and felt the back of my neck scorched and my hair singed and around me heard the confusion of arms in a moment i recognized not only isabella but my own inez at my side they had arrived with a party just in time to rescue me from the flames and disperse the priest anselmos party of negroes when the burning building fell in with a crash and by the ruddy glare we could see that the enemy were gone isabella briefly informed me that inez had arrived at her fathers hacienda upon the same day that the priest had imprisoned me and that hearing of anselmos diabolical scheme from a faithful old family servant they had set about to circumvent his design and that they had gone to mariel where they informed some half dozen american sailors who instantly agreed with isabella and inez to rescue their fellowcountrymen they accordingly hastened up from the port with my two heroic protectors under the guidance of the faithful negro who had revealed the damnable plot of the priest against my life most heartily did i thank those generous tars for their noble and manly kindness and still more deep was my gratitude to the highborn heroine isabella ramos who had overcome so many obstacles for a mere strangerand my own dear inez how cordially did i clasp her to my heart when i heard how she had hastened to my reliefand how was my amazement increased to learn that these were the very sailors with whom she had crossed the gulf from pensacola and braved the danger of the deep all for my sakeand that the bark in which they came was one of her own fathers and how lay in the bay ready to return as soon as we could reach mariel i blessed them a thousand times i even criedyes wept like a womanmy tears were irrepressibletears of joy snatched out of distress and danger the enemy was gone with haste we urged our inez ramos way to mariel and reached there before the sun was up but anselmo had forestalled us and as we were passing the outskirts of the town we were suddenly surrounded by a band of soldiers belonging to captaingeneral concha the governor of the island their numbers disarmed all opposition and we were all seized upon and the sailors bound we were forthwith ordered to march toward havana and accordingly we set forth as prisoners and pursued our way during a sultry day with the sun blazing upon us with an intensity of heat which was intolerable isabella and inez were mounted upon mules and under the immediate charge of the lieutenant of the company who kept strict guard upon them all day long having halted at noon and sunset we still pursued our way after night as there was moonlight we had journeyed far and it was late at night when as we were passing a heavy skirt of wood whose tall trees threw their black shadows across the road an armed party on horseback with their faces muffled burst suddenly out from the thicket in advance of our company when some of our soldiers made preparation to fire upon them but instantly twenty bright muskets were brought to a level and flashed in the gleams of the moon which glanced through the trees a voice from the party who had thus suddenly checked our progress commanded a halt and in a few minutes with his broad sombrero decked with a black feather drawn down over his blackwhiskered face their captain rode up to our lieutenant and after whispering to him a few words the whole party of general conchas men whom we were under galloped off with our sailors behind on their horses and left isabella inez and myself in the hands of this new party whom i rightly guessed at the first glance to be highway robbers in the neighboring mountains they all wore very long hair and mustachios which almost hid their faces when combined with their broad sombreros their dress was a loose blouse coat with leather belts in which were stuck a couple of swords and a broad knife upon the whole i had never seen a more wicked or assassinlike set of scoundrels they bore us rapidly through the valley until we reached the chain of mountains which stretch away toward bahia honda from quanajayhere at the foot of a giant peak in the midst of a dense forest of ceiba and palm trees they all dismounted and entered a huge antique monastery whose exterior walls were apparently in ruins and covered with long thick masses or festoons of moss but when we got within we found the ancient sanctuary converted into a stand for wines and liquors which glowed with ruddy tints from a multitude of burning lamps which lighted up the dim aisles of the shadowy old chapel and here we also found a jolly bacchanalian host of banqueters of the same robberlike character as those who had captured us they all rose and saluted our captain as he entered and shortly after father anselmo made his appearance at which the host sent up a shout or cheer which made the high dark vault of the church echo loudly at length we were all seated at a very long table upon which were ranged bottles glasses and cigars in enormous profusion father anselmo entered one of the cloisters of which there was a long range on either side of the church and the whole company waited quietly and in a very short time he came forth in a bishops robes and marched up to the head of the table where he went through with a sacrilegious mockery of a grace while the whole company responded with a mystical set of mummeries and preserving the most solemn expression of countenance until the priest commenced a travestie upon the language of the holy eucharist when they began to break the bread which lay upon the table and break off the necks of bottles and then began a wild chant in which all the revelers joined while a grotesquelydressed robber with a high sugarloaf hat sat down to the timeinjured organ and played the most ludicrous strains as an accompaniment which made the hollow vault vibrate and resound again as each chant concluded the riotous revelers would clink their glasses with high glee give humorous toasts and sing amatory songs at length father anselmo commanded that the nuns be shrived whereupon each robber drew a cap over his head in the manner of a friar and walked from the table to the cloisters on either hand of the long aisles and drawing aside a curtain forth came from each one all hooded and in gray gowns a female figure each knelt and received from the mock friars a benediction and the whole procession marched solemnly up again to the table to a mournful masslike music played upon the organ suddenly the instrument changed its solemn tones and began a gay and merry air while half a dozen violins hitherto unseen came out from under the cloaks of the sham monks and they all struck up the time as father anselmo struck with his cross upon the table suddenly all the gowns and hoods of the nuns flew off and the gray sisters became a band of most beautiful women arrayed in the richest and most costly manner and their black glittering eyes and rosered cheeks burned brightly as they quaffed one after another hurried bumpers of the crimson wine shouts laughter song and revelry now filled the church with stunning confusion and the discord of this strange saturnalia was increased fourfold as they all resolved themselves into a dancing party which reached half way down one of the great aisles isabella inez and myself sat near the sanctuary in silent amazement at these horrible orgies in the sacred precincts of a church a momentary cessation would occur in the music and each mock monk would lead one of the false nuns up to the table and quaff a glass off with her and in a few moments more be winding his lascivious arms around her voluptuous and yielding waist and imprinting warm kisses upon her cheeks and lips the captain of the robbers now ordered me to kneel before the altar and confess my sins and they would pray for me i refused he insisted i still objected but he commanded again and again i peremptorily declared that i would not commit an act which i felt to be sacrilege and a violation of the holiest feelings of the human heart he threatened me with the severest punishment if i persisted but i sternly and resolutely vowed that i would suffer anything rather than do this gross wrong to my education and conscience no sooner had i uttered these words than father anselmo cried away with him to the rack and forthwith a couple of the pseudomonks caught me one by each arm when suddenly a heavy jarring sound was heard and a broad iron door in the wall slid slowly aside and to my horror revealed a chamber of the ancient inquisition there stood all the terrific instruments of torture racks wheels pulleys and screws the vault which contained these terrible implements was dark but lighted by a glowing furnace or pot of burning charcoal they fastened me down in an iron chair and baring the soles of my feet they anointed them with oil and placed them close to the fire of course i shrieked with the intense agony of this blistering pain at this inez sprang from her seat and rushing to me she clasped her arms around my feet to shield them from the fire when father anselmo ordered the men to release me and put inez in my place the moment the men freed me and laid hands upon her i felled the first one that touched her with a single blow of my fist when the captain bade them relinquish the punishment and proceed with the dance and in a moment more the glasses were clinking and the music playing the same lively dancing airs father anselmo despite the remonstrance of isabella compelled her to enter one of the sets and the captain drew inez with him into an opposite party long did they dance and drink while i sat near the altar in silence most of the men were deeply intoxicated and reeled as they went through the dance and engaged in all manner of voluptuous and amative figures and attitudesthe pretended nuns abandoning themselves into the arms of the robber monkswhen anselmo and the captain clasped isabella and inez in their embrace who struggled in vain to escape they covered their faces with kisses and were hurrying off with them in their arms to the cells or cloisters as fast as their drunken state would permit them to move for by this time the whole party were steeped in liquor anselmo in his maudlin madness tore open the bosom of isabellas dress as he dragged her to the cell and clung to her like a satyr when with an effort she stretched herself back and plucking a small hidden dagger from her girdle she planted it full in his breast and he sank instantly a corse upon the floor the captain released inez and moved as well as his drunken legs would carry him toward anselmos body whither the whole drunken party were crowding in great confusion in the midst of this babellike confusion i motioned to inez to follow me which she did and we reached one of the windows or rather side doors and were escaping when a pistol shot was heard and we looked back and beheld that the captain had fired and killed isabella this doubly increased the confusion during which time we got without the church and fled for life toward the coast we had not advanced many miles when day began to dawn so seeing a cave whence a spring issued we entered and remained until night again came when we sallied forth on our way to the coast the moon shone beautifully and i calculated that we should reach the seashore either at mariel or curacoa as we wandered we found some wild fruit by the way side and eat it with a relish which exercise and appetite alone can give we avoided as much as possible all chance of discovery by taking bypaths as would keep us from losing the main road the atmosphere was soft and mild and the moonlight silvered the fields and groves by which we passed and the country was one of enchanting beauty after several miles progress we heard the heavy hoofs of horses coming down the highway behind us and we instantly secreted ourselves behind the thick green hedge which skirted the roadside with beating hearts and almost suppressed breath but to our unutterable joy we discovered the party to be our old friends the sailors who had all been taken by the soldiers when the robbers bore us awaywe heard their clear round english voices and our hearts fairly danced for joy they were delighted to see us alive and soon informed us that general concha the spanish governor had ordered the whole of them to be released and discharged and they were now on their way to their vessel which lay before curacoa so taking inez and myself with them we reached the port about daylight when a band of villagers came out armed with swords guns pikes sticks and stones and attempted to stop our partyour captain assured them that we had authority to leave and showed his passport from general concha but instead of regarding this they hurled a shower of stones at us which struck some of our party whereupon the sailors became furious and springing from their horses and fastening them as best they could they dashed into the swarthy group of spaniardsmen women and children fled from the sailors who were unarmed save with such sticks as they could pick up as though deaths self where chasing them shrieking for life they ran in all directions hiding themselves in the houses making no defense saving occasionally firing a gun which touched none of usso that in a brief space of time a handful of american tars had dispersed the whole village lage without weapons and we pursued our way along the wood which skirted the beach until we saw the stars and stripes of our vessel flapping in the bright gleams of the opening morning in a short time more we were on board and in safety but the moment inez became assured that we were both out of danger she fainted having borne the scenes of this terrible night with fortitude her too much excited nerves could no longer bear the racking anxiety day dawned and we weighed anchor and were leaving the island fast when a spanish vessel at a great distance fired at us but we put on all sail and flew from her swift as the gulls that went with us over the gulf inez recovered but could scarce think that it could be reality it was like some horrible dream but when i came to speak of the fatal end of her heroic cousin isabella neither of us could refrain from kneeling and offering up a prayer to heaven for having delivered us from these strange perils we reached our homes it is useless to say we were unitedmy rashness has been taught a bitter lesson and the sad fate of our companions whose bones are buried in cuba or those whose bodies are buried alive in spain in her black dungeons should be a solemn warning to all young men not to inconsiderately and imprudently venture forth upon any expedition merely upon the promises of unprincipled and designing men who are preaching liberty but ready to barter a brothers blood for gold but what shall i say respecting the officer placed by the united states government as our consul at havana it was a bold delusion which lopez led us intofor though wholly without principle and honor lopez was not without couragebut mr owen sits quietly at home in his country seat near havana and allows a ruthless butchery to take place without the slightest interference and when called upon to account for his conduct attempts to palliate it by saying that he was so far removed from the authorities of the island that it would have been too late why did he not make the effort why did he not try and then see if it were too late why did not the english consul not find it too late he demanded his fellowcountrymen in the name of the queen of great britain and they were released but our own representative officer stands inertly and suffers a massacre of his fellowcitizens without any intervention in short his apology is worse than his position and time itself will scarcely remove from his course of conduct the damning imputation of listlessly and wantonly allowing his fellowcountrymen to suffer a military martyrdom when the exercise of prompt and determined measures would have saved their lives it is a melancholy thing to reflect upon the whole affairthe scheme which played upon the love of liberty within patriotic american hearts and caused them to rush to the rescue of coward creoles who were incapable of comprehending liberty or feared to strike for their freedom and then more terrible than all to think that men could be found who for the base love of gaina traffic in bondscould lead young and generous men like victims to the slaughter making the greensward of cuba grow red with their blood and leaving their dead bodies to moulder and decay in a land where they were taught to believe that the banners of freedom would be seen glittering thick on the breezy plainsand where when they planted their feet on the soil and cried god and liberty a host of republicans would have echoed back an answer hailing them with acclamations loud as thunder in the storm where they had expected to see the alliance of king and church rent asunder and the barrier which had withheld the people from their rights broken to pieces but alas we found a people willingly bearing oppression from tyranny and the benighting influence of priestcraft resting like a dark spell of sorcery upon the whole island the spirit of northern climes the high love of liberty was nowhere visible and this expedition which went forth with the holy feeling of a crusade for freedom found an avaricious traitor at their head and all their exertions directed to his aggrandizement and the aid of a set of wretches incapable of appreciating this generous aid in a struggle for political and religious independence poland greece and hungary have had their martyrs and have shown themselves worthy to be free but the cubans are base enough to wear their spanish chains and bow their necks that bigotry fanaticism and priestcraft may place their feet upon them whenever and as they please god help fair cuba her inhabitants are willing slaves to spanish power and the graves of the heroic crittenden and his associates were made in a patriot purpose but for a despicable people once more i point to the dark dungeons of spain where our patriot brothers pine in chains and warn by this sad example the impulsive youth of our land from hastily seizing the sword in behalf of foreign climes and leaving the weeds of mourning to hang over the homes of widowed wives and brokenhearted mothers the end the  mas star for the poor by the author of bread washington g s gideon printer  the mas star for the poor the christmas star

one we live inin one of its many homes of ease and plenty entered the christmas day cheerily it came through the richly curtained windows and sure of its welcome it wakened as many happy ones to as many happy greetings as ever one roof might cover it wakened the master of the wealthy mansion from his restless merchants dream of occupying his business in the great waterswhere the tide seemed turningto the certainty of wellsecured wealth and plenty which in all human calculation he could never lose it wakened the lady sleeping on his breast from light dreams to a lighter lifea life fullblown whose only burthens were the flowers of its own bloom ah the flowersyes it wakened the children in their comfortable nursery and then began the christmas mirth kriss kringle had filled the

merry christmas merry christmas resounded through the house thus merrily came the christmas day and merrily passed alonggift followed gift for servants and all for the whole household had a share in the christmas day the christmas alms had been cast into the treasury where the abundance of the many that were rich mingled with the all that she had of the poor widow and just as faithfully as the merchants books could account to their credit and debit on that christmas day so faithfully was written on high the angel record wherein the lord of the treasury acknowledges that he who giveth to the poor lendeth to the lord friend after friend assembledthe christmas dinner overflowed the generous board the christmas joy like the christmas wine poured full and free the childrens flying feet had left the dance for the dazzling branches of the christmas tree which was just revealed and eagerly each little hand was grasping its expected treasure when in the midst of all the noise and merriment the sound of a handorgan was heard under the windows there was nothing in its streetmusic to attract the refined ear of any of that operaloving throng and it might have played its christmas strain unheard and unheeded but for one childs heart of open sympathy where the blessed chord of charity had never been touched in her young life in vain the little hand which was raised to receive her present from the glittering tree was stayed and changed into the attitude of attention to what was without the sweet face of delight and self enjoyment grew sweeter still as the expression came and went of pity and generosity and never had the little marythe pet the darling the most tenderly cherished because the most delicate and frailthe only daughter among many sonsnever had she appeared half so lovely half so loving half so lovedas now when with childish impatience and the earnest eloquence which is unused to denial she turned away to beg admittance for the little wanderer without oh mama papa it is my little organgirl please let her come inshe is so pretty and so tired in the cold street and she has had no christmas gifts i know and she sings so sweetly you will love to hear herjust let her come inshe used to come every dayand then she was sick for a long time and the man came without her and now she is well againpray let her come in little mary was not denied and the troupe entered the organgrinder one of those in our streets todayand the child such as often accompany such attractions except that a remarkable degree of beauty in the little face and form required no fortune teller to read how the lines of life would be apt to be crossed and tried and tempted and troubled in that little palm questioning her they found that her country was italy and that she had the name and the age of the little mary eight years ago in such different countries were born perhaps at the same hour such different children and the holy baptismso differing in these widely severed landsbut which ought to be the same because both are christian with the same signthe cross of christteaching the same story of the blessed among womenhad united in giving with such different gifts of wealth and poverty the same name perhaps at the same hour to these two little marys my name papa and just as old asshe whisperedpoor little thing i wish she could stay with me the little stranger acquitted herself to the entire satisfaction of her childpatron and to the evident satisfaction of the whole company her extreme beauty and graceher natural childish delight in all that she sawher grateful thanks for the presents heaped upon her increased in its effect by the slightly foreign accentthe desire to return the favors so unexpectedly showered on her by her music her only possessionand then so naturally her performance with all the pride of her arther song of a land so far for such little feet to have come fromand at intervals the accompaniment of her tambourine which displayed her whole beauty and gracealtogether charmed every beholder in repose her face was very melancholy but most gentle the eyes shaded with their long lashes appealed as if for protection with such a mournfulness in their look never seen in children who are kindly cared forand the mouth was sad and firm as childrens are not who take not care of themselves but when the lips were parted in their singing the eyes brightened until they seemed to burn like starsthe cheek glowing and the whole face was radiant with the light of a genius which in her country more than any other springs often by tile wayside in the open air bending lowly as she departed with her gathered gifts and dainties she kissed the hand her little namesake extended to her and pressed it to her breast forgetful of her acquired language at the moment when her heart was speaking so loudly her parting salutation was unwittingly and naturally spoken in her mother tongue and with thanks for being told to come some day again the christmas beggar went out blessing and blessed as the door of the hospitable mansion closed behind them and the street stretched out before them long and cold she thought it had been all a dream but her hands and arms were full of the christmas gifts and she knew that they were real the twilight had only just closed in and above her in the sky was the evening staronly that one in all the skyshe could see it shining so kindly friendly on her as if to cheer her way so in all her heart there seemed but one like a star to lovethe little marythe only one in all her heart she could see her smiling so kindly friendly on her as if to cheer her way oh christmas star this was thy power ii suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid then not for of such is the kingdom of heaven over the world the same christmasover the world the same christ children bound together in happy bands our two little marys whom the world would forever separate meet at last as may we all meetat the feet of christ as in the days of the saviour on earth the offspring of the prince would not have shrunk from sharing with that of the beggar the arms of the divine master so is it now and the christianity that would be otherwise and must have its pew and its place and its price to pay forgets the divine precept and prayer that we all may be one as the evening star pursues its path steadily and surely until around it is gathered the shining glory of heaven so the beggars star faded not nor faltered until to her was bound the sweet influences as of the pleiades the little mary of wealth and love rested not until she had shared the blessings so thickly clustering for her with the little mary of poverty and want from the time when she had shared her christmas gifts with the homeless child she had thought of nothing but the little wanderer surely it was christ himself who thus as her restored gift bade her gather back from the glittering branches of the christmas tree a jewel for his crown all the enthusiasm of her beautiful nature had been drawn out to support the object of her remarkable affection none knew the pleasure she had taken in her apparently overweening attachment ment none knew the thought and care which she had spent in her plan of rescue for the street beggar how she had lain awake at night to think and then fallen asleep to dream how they might be together how the immeasurable distance between them might be overcome and when at last like a holy star came the idea of the sunday school none knew the blessing in which the little tired mindtired with its wandering after a wandererthen rested yesthe sunday schoolthat was the place she had seen many beggars there there they might be together there they might be equal there the two little marys might together kneel and with united voices pray our father and be sisters how she treasured up her plan for a whole week until she should meet her teacher then how her heart throbbed when she made her request the granting of which was to gather another lamb into the fold how the glad tears sprang to the tender eyes which were so pleadingly raised to the teachers face and when the promised admission was readily given how she went away so happy how she wished the week gone and the sabbath come which was to be really such a holy day how she lingered at the church door to wait for the steps which were so surely so thankfully coming all the way from the dark cold lodging where the children of this world would have called her poor to the free entrance of the house of god where the children of light are made rich then clasping each others hands one little mary led the other little mary into the blessing she had prepared for her and seated beside her on the same bench they read from the same book to be taught by the same care in the same alma materthe american sunday school iii thus had the full heart so crowded with love in all its full stream of blessings turned to befriend the heart which had touched her compassion with its desolate loneliness and generously did she befriend herand it was no light thing to dofor after the novelty of their appearance at the door had worn away which was very soon all the house grew tired of their return it was shocking music and a great bore to have it grinding in their ears so often was said in the drawingroom and the children from a natural imitation echoed the cry and the servants who always feel safest in following the tide of life which is over them magnified and moralized and demoralized the thoughtless speeches of their superiors until at last one day it ended in a banishment of what there had been so much effort to gain oh do come from the window mary and then they will go away we are all so tired of them this was often said im sure said the old nurse who prided herself upon the respectability of being settled i wonder your mama allows you miss mary even to look at such onery people as them much less to be inviting them in im sure its only ahelping of them on in their wicked life the lazy worthless vagaboneswhy dont they go to work and as to that child shes agoing the broad road to ruin fast i think ill step out said john the waiter as he entered with a costly tray of delicacies which he was preparing for the childrens lunch ill just step out and send them beggars off its too much collecting such a gang of ragamuffins on the pavement ment and there is no end to it let these furriners keep to their own country i say so saying he left the room oh nurse nurse stop him cried little mary pale with emotiondont let him mortify her sooh frank harry turning to her brothers stop himpray dopapa said i might have them to play whenever i chose and i love little mary oh it is too bad and covering her face with her little white hands as she turned from the window she burst into an uncontrollable fit of sobbing her brothers had stopped their romp at the further end of the apartment in answer to her appeal but when they reached the window it was too late they were just turning to depart the song was stopped in the midst and the singer had turned away but she had not turned before she had seen the distress sweep over the face of her childfriend at the window and as she turned away she felt as if a cloud had come over the only star in her sky leaving her dark and desolate she has gone mary sail frank and we had better let her go now for john would only mortify them more if we bring them back but she shall have some money i will run after her with thisand he ran off oh frank oh harry it is too badand the most violent sobbing shook the little frame as crouched upon the soft carpet she buried her face in her hands and refused to be comforted the nurse and john frightened at what they had done when they saw the extent of her grief began their mutual recrimination each blaming the other for what was the fault of both the children gathering around tried to soothe herbut no she could not be comforted the lunch was untasted by all and after many weary hours little marys first and greatest grief seemed subsiding like a rain the tears stopped at last but there was no clearing away no smileheavy was the light heart sad the merry eyes and slow the feet so quick in their nevertiring errands for all im sure miss mary i never dreamed of hurting your feelings i was only thinking of them i hope you will care no more about it and let me dress you nicely for dinner now the other children have all gone down quietly the gentle child submitted to the dressing she spoke not one word although the nurse tried to make her talk as she stood to be dressed only once the nurse noticed that she put her hand to her head and held it there for a moment as if in pain the motion of that little hand smote her to her heart and her remorse was great when that night the little mary lay down not to rise in the morning with the other children in health and strength but ill and suffering she was paying the price of her befriending when all were roused at night to assist her then it was remembered how she had at table spoken nothing and eaten nothingand how throughout the evening the face had been pale as marble with only one small spot on the cheek which seemed to burn deeper and brighter as the paleness increased at once she was very illand now her mother wondered she did not before see that she was sick but there had been company all the evening in the drawingroom and she remembered with a pang how she had noticed the brilliant face only to feel proud of its beauty which attracted as usual the admiration of the guests now over the little form they watched as none know but those who like them have watched a like form while the fever burned on like a devouring flame wasting the strength and threatening the lifehow precious none know but those who like them would have eagerly bargained to have parted with all their possessions so they might keep a suchlike little heart from beating away so fast always delicate the tenderest care had ever guarded her from the least crossing of a will so gentle that the indulgence of it was at once its allowance and its reward she was therefore unprepared for the excessive trial which she had so cruelly suffered in the cause of her little friend the story collected from the children and the distressed account of the offending servants explained sufficiently the cause of the childs state while her earnest calling in the delirium of her fever for her beloved companion showed how the pressure of the heart affected that of the brain the physician advised that the object of her solicitude might be brought to her but an unconsciousness of all save the phantasies of the fever rendered it useless at last after many weary days the child lay resting after a hard struggle for the liferelieved but exhausted no ache no pain but so weak she could hardly live she did live but oh so frail the tenureso pale the fair fair faceso thin the little white handso fluttering the heartlike a crippled bird which disease had touched with its withering blight forever around her little couch was gathered every thing that could divert or please a passing fancy my darling said her mother gently as she kissed her see the fresh flowers your father brings you thank you dear mamadear papa i love them very much and the little arms were thrown in caresses around first mother then father my darling again said her mother see your little mary your father brings to stay with you as you wished all the time and be your little sister dear mamadear papa oh thank youi love her better than flowersoh yes again as she spoke the little arms were raised caressingly and when they were again folded it was around the form of the other little mary iv never to go away to be her sister so her father and another had said and so it was they had planned it all and purchased it even for it was like a purchasethe release from the organgrinderwho was not unreasonable and kindly disposed to help his little countrywoman and give her up to a better fate than his strolling fortunes followed long and weary would have been the time in the sick chamber but for that blessed deed of charity which while it divided the blessing divided also the care for such is the virtue of charity that its reward is in its hand day after day it was beautiful to see the two childrenthe two marysbut ah it was sad the contrast the child of opulence with hand filled too full to hold lifes treasuresaye lifes best treasuresto behold her drooping and dropping them fainting and failing away while the child of poverty with hand extended for the passing almsaye so often passing herto behold her gathering and grasping the gifts of generous goodness and growing more graceful and beautiful day after day one little mary laying aside lifelife so gaily decoratedjust when the other little mary was putting it on ah it was sad to see but it was beautiful too to see the love of the two children to see the gifts of the one gathered back so gratefully by the other to the generous givers breast and then enjoyed together the winter had passed and anxiously her parents watched to see the spring and summer revive their droopingflower but in vain anxiously they sought in other climates the health that might yet restore her precious life and when the autumn winds began to blow they took her where no chill breath might touch her languid frame too roughly and so they guarded and cherished her with all that money could obtain or human skill control but in vain there was no medicine to heal her sickness and when the winter snows were on the earth and again the christmas garlands hanging on the walls at her desire they brought her home to die v christmas over the world again again in the sky the christmas star again the angels anthem falls from heaven again in this home of ease and plenty enters the christmas day but it wakes no sleepers now in that luxurious chamber there are those who watch but not for christmas and they look up wearily with no welcome for its almost mocking light as it falls around the one they watch far different from the scene where the christmas light first smiled far different from the manger where the christmas day first broke far different the luxury of the apartment it enters now gilding the costly furniture and rich adornments and flinging its radiance full upon a picture of the virgin and childonly a picture not the lifeat whose shrine its first ray was kindled yes far different was the scene but most unlike of all that the christmas light was touching unlike to what it first touched was this instead of birthhere was death instead of the cradle here was the grave oh christmas star here is thy power for the death is the birth and the grave is the gate of life the little mary was gone through into heaven but the other mary lingered yet lingered to strew over her christmas grave their morning flowers covering her innocence with their sinless bloom lingered to pour with a beggars gratitude the debt of love pressed down and running over into the mothers bleeding bosom and when the evening star came out again into her lonely sky she seemed to see in it again her guide and friend and again one little mary may lead the other little maryeven beyond the sky children bound together in happy bands take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven o christmas star what else betide as kings were led by thee to lay aside their robes of pride and be clothed with humility so would we seek divine command so follow thy holy ray as rich and poor we together stand in the light of the christmas day o christmas star o christmas star thy shining track we see but the gate is strait from earth to heaven and the path is humility so shall it be in that better land all pride shall be passed away and the rich and the poor shall be hand in hand in that better christmas day a story of ocean grove by james a bradley a story of ocean grove by james a bradley a story of ocean grove a story of ocean grove one evening in  two young women came out of the old methodist church at long branch not the large church which general grant attends in summer but the little old church which stands opposite to it now used for stores one of the young women looked anxiously around as if expecting to meet some one her companion observed it and taking her arm said earnestly mattie dont please dont the words had scarcely been uttered when a young man came hastily toward them and offered himself as escort to the two ladies in a short time they reached the home of one of the ladies whose name was mary where good nights were exchanged and the remaining two continued their walk the following day mattie called on mary and after the usual greetings mary said frankly mattie i want to talk to you about o nonsense interrupted mattie dont commence that old strain again i assure you its as tiresome and insipid as the perpetual squeak of an ancient hand organ if i choose to have a little sport pray dont disturb me in it it wont do any harm wont do any harm said mary how little you know of the human heart pshaw replied mattie if you include stephens heart you make a slight mistake why hes not sufficiently compos mentis by nature to know what love is even if he has a heart at all but we must retrace our steps and give the reader a brief account of the history of these two friends mattie was a very pretty girl and had come to be recognized as the belle of the village in which our story commences her company had been sought by manyyoung men who were quickly charmed by her bright pretty face and had allowed their hearts to become ensnared before they were themselves conscious of the danger until they awoke to the sad fact that they had been beguiled at the caprice of a pretty face into a foolish flirtation to be thrown aside when the sport as mattie called it grew wearisome to her so it came to pass that her reputation as a thorough flirt became established and young men were more cautious in their friendly advances occasionally one knowing her character as a coquette would not only not seek her acquaintance but avoid her society altogether whenever mattie heard of a case of this kind she seemed determined to conquer and would put herself in his way employing often too successfully all those little arts to captivate which girls have studied too well her friend mary winship was two or three years older attractive in person and cultured in mind she possessed a womanly dignity too with that rare good sense which fitted her to be the companion of old or young equally well yet even a stranger could perceive on a short acquaintance with her that there was a cloud of sadness hanging over her young life she was cheerful always but subdued as the wisdom and experience of years were mingled with her youth very few knew why she was not more like her young associates none ever knew from her lips how her young heart had been crushed by disappointment but we will use an authors privilege and tell the reader that her character may be the better understood among the many visitors at long branch in the summer of  was a young man named william arlington who belonged to an old and very wealthy family in virginia some how or other he had become acquainted with mary and they were very much attached to each other her parents were pleased with the young stranger and were proud in the thought of their daughters prospective good fortune in a union with a man of intelligence and social position arlington did not acquaint his parents with the fact of his intimacy with the winship family but it reached them through the officious kindness of some friends who were cognizant of the whole matter arlington senior was exceedingly wroth in his arrogance and pride of family and went through the usual formula adopted from time immemorial in similar cases he threatened to disown and disinherit his son and heir if he persisted in consummating the foolish alliance of course the tender youngling having no means of support and being by birth a gentlemanin other words unable to labor was very much alarmed at the adverse turn fortune was taking it was not his fathers displeasure so much as the unwelcome prospect of work and limited allowance before which he quailed yet mary was very dear to him and he had engaged himself to her and felt that he could not thus lightly relinquish her so he began to arrange a plan by which his fathers displeasure would be appeased and at the same time secure to himself the only girl he had ever really loved a short time after while bidding mary good night after an evening visit he lingered hesitatingly under the old tree at the garden gate and mary quickly divined there was something upon his mind which he desired yet dreaded to express she suggested that his manner was more constrained than usual and inquired the cause he then told her of his fathers disapproval of his acquaintance with her and of his unwillingness to displease him but said he dear mary i have thought of a way which if you will only consent will quiet his fears and make me happy forever father is old and cannot possibly live many years longer we can be married privately and live apart meeting occasionally as we have done until his death and then i can announce publicly that you have been my wife for some time will my mary consent to this he held her hand as he asked the earnest question but she drew it from his grasp as she looked steadily into his pleading eyes and calmly but firmly answered never never no never my family may not be able to boast of noble and distinguished members but they have always been known as christian and virtuous people when they have married they have done so before the world i would rather be the acknowledged wife of the poorest honest man in the town than the secret wife of a prince no william i need not tell you how bright and sweet the dream of my life mingled and interblended with yours has been to me but she paused for a moment to regain the selfcontrol which was fast ebbing outwe must part forever now she hurriedly turned away and entered the house he waited like one in a maze for several minutes then slowly turned his steps towards his hotel mary secured herself in her quiet chamber threw herself upon her bed and wept in the bitterness of her soul the bright beautiful future had suddenly been enshrouded in a pall of gloom which it seemed to her no coming sunshine could ever dispel hope had died in her heart in her sorrow she remembered that god had promised to help in time of need and comfort the tempesttossed soul she read her favorite passages in her little bible and was comforted in the morning she came forth from the battle a conqueror she had consecrated her life in those still night hours to the cause of god not by secluding herself in a convent but by resolving henceforth to give her life her love and sympathies to the sorrowing and suffering all around her such was mary who remonstrated with her friend mattie about the flirtation stephen was an excellent mechanic respectable though poor and was highly esteemed by those who knew him he was confiding and girllike in his nature his chief weakness being his childlike faith and trust in everybody those who gained his confidence and then betrayed it sometimes said as an excuse for themselves that he was just a little simplenot altogether bright he was a good son to his widowed mother and besides taking care of her supported the orphan child of his only brother who lost his life in assisting to rescue persons from a shipwreck at long branch mattie at the time of which we are writing counted among her victories our friend stephen how happily the days sped on to him in the midst of his selfdenying toil as he thought of mattie and wove bright dreams of future bliss she had played with that confiding heart as carelessly and indifferently as she would pass a candy motto at an evening party mary winship saw all this and realizing fully the suffering it would surely cause earnestly begged her friend to stop ere it was too late pshaw said mattie how solemn you are you have mistaken your vocation mary a convent and a black vail and complete ignorance forever of hearts and love and all that sort of thing would suit your style exactly but as for me if i feel like having a lark now and then i will and no one shall interfere mattie listen to me i beg of you life is not all made up of youth youth is only the seed time of the lifes harvest that is to come and there are many who reap bitter sorrows in middle life and old age from thoughtless sowing when they little thought or cared for the reaping time martha was annoyed by marys reproof but she tossed her head saucily saying well i mean to have another string to my bow in about two weeks and i shall flirt with stephen till then poor fellow its an actual charity to him you know he loves me so and kissing the sedate mary she ran lightly away true to her determination she lavished all her attention upon stephen for a few weeks and he well his whole heart was absorbed in the faithless girl one sunday evening after the church was dismissed he waited as usual upon the walk to accompany mattie home judge of his surprise as she carelessly swept by him clinging lovingly to the arm of a stranger he entered his humble abode earlier than was his wont that sunday eve his mother noticed a change in his appearance the bright happy smile was gone and a settled gloom had taken its place he retired to his room but not to sleep his mother heard his slow steps wearily pacing the floor the night through she guessed the cause for matties reputation as a flirt was known far and wide yet she felt rather glad it was at an end and hoped in a few weeks he would have forgotten her and be himself again stephen went to his work as usual the next morning and returned in the evening and so passed day after day but oh how shorn of its simple peaceful happiness his home had become he would sit and think for hours and when spoken to by his mother would start from his stupor only to relapse into that strange quiet again it soon became the talk of the village that stephen morris was love cracked and no one laughed louder or more heartily over the thing than mattie weeks rolled on and the friends of mrs morris sympathized deeply with her for stephen began to neglect his work and the loss of his wages was severely felt by the widows little family after a time stephen seemed to arouse himself but as he passed along the street he heard things repeated by boys and girls which he had told in confidence to mattie proving clearly to him that she was making him the sport of the place one afternoon there was a great stir in the quiet village of long branch miss mattie woolly was to be married to a gentleman from new york he had been summering at one of the hotels and accidentally meeting mattie was captivated it was the stranger stephen had seen with her she had at last gained the prize she had sought she had vowed she would marry only for wealth and position and now the day had come that would make her a rich mans bride there was a large company at her fathers comfortable home and many and choice were the bridal gifts from family and friends it was arranged for the bridal party to start the next day for philadelphia and it was the pleasure of the bridegroom that the journey should be made in carriages the hour had come carriages were in waiting and those who were to accompany the happy pair were already seated it was the brides turn when just as she was stepping into the carriage a terrible heartrending scream was heard for a moment all was confusion and inquiry the bridegroom wishing to avoid any unpleasant scene if such there was signed to the coachman to proceed no no said mattie i must know the cause of that fearful cry they halted for a few moments when a friend returned and informed them that the screams came from widow morris home her only son stephen had been found drowned in turtle mill pond and his body had just been brought to his mothers house the bride sank back in the carriage fainting there was great confusion it would not do to proceed upon their journey until she was restored so she was removed from the carriage to the house again and the carriages were dismissed a few hours later mary stood by the bed upon which lay mattie now mrs giles mattie requested all to leave the room except her friend mary when they were alone she was about to speak but the fearful screams from the widows home again startled her and she sank back upon the bed prostrated at length she said oh mary you said youth was the sowing and age the reaping time the reaping time has come early to me was it i that made poor stephen crazy am i the cause of those awful screams tell me mary for i am dreadfully wretched mary could not answer for she knew too well her friend was reaping sooner much sooner than she expected she would gladly have done anything in her power to lessen the grief of her friend but she could only look on in silence and pity in a few days after the marriage ceremony and the funeral of stephen who was buried at mechanicsville matters moved on in their accustomed routine in the village mrs giles had gone away with her husband and the widow was supported by the kindness of friends but the best among them all was mary winship they had often met in classmeeting and the sweet singing of mary was full of comfort to her crushed heart after meeting mary usually accompanied her home and on one occasion as mary was about to bid her goodnight the widow said how strange it is that you can sympathize with suffering when you have been so free from it yourself your life has been like an even spun thread mary kissed the widow while the great tears gathered in her eyes as she simply said every heart knoweth its own bitterness during a protracted meeting held one winter at long branch the pastor was assisted by a young man who had just graduated he was very zealous as well as talented and his labors were productive of much good he was often brought into contact with mary winship whose sweet singing was a great charm of the social meetings one night after the services were over the young preacher asked permission to accompany her home he was charmed with her manners and after a few calls asked of her father the privilege of visiting the house as a suitor for the hand of his daughter the father smiled and said mary must answer for herself a few evenings subsequently the young minister told mary of his interview with her father and of his attachment to herself she was embarrassed for a few minutes then recovering her composure said i am very much pleased with your good opinion of me but believe me when i say i cannot become your wife i respect your character and your work i admire your talents and shall always esteem it an honor to be numbered among your friends i already regard you as my brother and i shall always feel an interest in you and pray for your success in your chosen vocation he thanked her for her candor and soon after left the place mary corresponded with him and in a year afterward a bridal party was gathered in an old fashioned mansion in trenton mary winship was there but she was not the bride the young minister had wooed and won an excellent young lady whom he married in her fathers house and mary became her friend and was often a welcome inmate of the family circle perhaps some of our readers who have visited ocean grove camp meeting grounds will remember main avenue running straight from the turnpike to the sea during camp meeting the sides of this avenue as well as other avenues are filled with vehicles of every description from the plain farmers wagon to the stylish landau from long branch on a bright august day a few years subsequent to the scenes we have narrated there were indications of unusual interest in the vicinity of the camp ground it was the last day but one of the meeting and crowds came pouirng pouring into the gates from all the country around carriage after carriage rolled up to the broad landing and depositing its happyhearted burden moved on to give place to others stages ancient rockaways oldfashioned carryalls that had been sacred to sunday use for generations followed each other in rapid succession to the platform there was farmer jones from chestnut plains in his great twohorse farm wagon his wife in holiday trim beside him with smiling happy face while upon the clean yellow straw in the bottom of the wagon were the remaining twelve members of his numerous family large and small just behind him followed a plain unpretentious team driven by a gentleman of marked demeanor as they reached the landing he sprang from his seat and assisted the sweetfaced lady who occupied the seat beside him to alight then turned his attention to the two ladies upon the back seat one required no aid as she stepped lightly upon the platform but the other was old and feeble very feeble and was helped from the carriage with great difficulty she was evidently an object of tender solicitude to the little group that had her in charge and was soon seated in a campchair while the gentleman secured his horse on the opposite side of the avenue when he returned he carefully assisted the old lady with the help of the younger ladies almost carrying her between them to the preaching stand then after seating them comfortably beneath a shady oak he took his place in the preachers stand among his ministerial brethren he was a preacher of marked distinction among them and was cordially greeted by the presiding elder who invited him to read the opening hymn and lead the vast congregation in prayer the hymn was announced on jordans stormy banks i stand and while it was being sung as such an audience only could sing it a little commotion was caused by the arrival of a magnificent turnout drawn by four noble horses whose burnished harness sparkled in the sunlight and made them seem like a superior race of animals as they pranced gayly on coachmen and footmen in splendid livery kept guard over this elaborate equipage which contained but two personsa mother and her little daughter about eight years of age as they drew up at the landing the footman with the precision of a trained soldier alighted and opened the carriage door the lady soon became an object of general interest and it was clearly evident that she was not at all distressed by the attention she attracted her dress was of the most superb material arranged with great taste and care with a profusion of jewelry amidst which many diamonds sparkled and flashed in the summer sunshine the little girl was the very counterpart of her mother in miniature and as the lady passed into the grove with queenly step farmer jones whispered to his wife look there betsy i guess that heap of dry goods is worth as much as my fifty acres the country girls especially were attracted by the distinguished visitor such dress they had never seen before and some of them would become the center of interest in their limited circles simply because their eyes had looked upon so much splendor yes farmer jones was right the ladys jewelry alone would buy his whole farm wagon and all the lady reached the preaching circle just as the concluding notes of the hymn were sung she stood erect during the prayer that followed and continued standing for some time partly to gratify her vanity in attracting attention and partly because of the way in which she was gotten up her rich silks disdained contact with the rude board seats a gentleman soon offered his camp chair bowing condescendingly she thanked him and seated herself it was a glorious midsummer afternoon the fresh sweet seabreeze came singing up ocean pathway and whispered musically among the pines overhead moving birds and chirping insects sects to join their tiny notes with natures orchestra it was an occasion of more than usual interest as the preacher of the hour was not only celebrated for his eloquence but for the purity of his style and the marked spirituality of his life when he arose the very air seemed hushed to tranquil stillness and his audience listened as to a voice from heaven in clear earnest tones he announced his text whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap those sitting near the fashionable lady noticed that she turned pale and seemed about to faint and one lady beside her kindly inquired if she was sick no no said the stranger it is nothing i shall be well in a moment will you not occupy my tent until you are betterpointing to a tent very near no thank you replied the lady i am better now the preacher delineated with a marvelous fidelity that held his audience almost spellbound the life of a sinner the sowing the indulging in evil propensities desires and passions called popularly sowing wild oats and the fearful consequences which must inevitably follow he spoke of sowing to pleasure money appetite pride and vanityconnecting with each its legitimate gitimate harvest and final result the ultimate degradation of the character and ruin of the soul after describing phases of life and showing in all its vividness the reaping of such sowing he passed on to the futurethe reaping time of the soul many a sinner in that breathless audience quailed before the startling picture presented to their minds by the preacher with tearful eyes he warned them of their danger and while al most overcome by emotion he said thank god i have a message of reconciliation from the lord of the heavens for that one whose wayward rebelious rebellious heart is softened and repentantlet the unrighteous man turn from his sins and come unto me and i will have mercy and now said the preacher i come to the joyful part of my sermonthe sowing and reaping of the christian with masterly touch he depicted the trials crosses and selfdenials of many a lover of christ the sowing in tears in pain in weariness in reproaches in poverty in scorn in contumely he alluded to the adversities and afflictions that had been the heritage of many of gods chosen ones from earliest time which had been so grandly borne by prophets and martyrs and not less so by the humble and unknown everywhere whose sublime record of patient enduring trust was written on imperishable tablets above but look up said he as he raised his hands and eyes to heaven a blessed invitation is already written for you in letters of living light across the portal of the skies come ye blessed of my farther inherit the kingdom prepared for you sowing in sorrow you reap everlasting joy sowing in tears you reap the eternal felicity of the fathers smiling countenance sowing in loneliness and want oftimes you shall surely have as your reward the innumerable company of the firstborn and the opulence of the fathers kingdom forever who that looked upon that scene and beheld the rapt countenance and streaming eyes of alfred cookman as he uttered these concluding words could ever forget it he sat down the vast audience was deeply moved and gave expression to their feelings in shouts and joyful exclamations but there was one soul that fed upon his concluding words and felt that portion of the sermon was peculiarly for her she had long desired that the lord of the harvest should call her home life to her had been a continuous warfare and now that her work was done and she had become old and feeble she longed to be at rest she listened eagerly as if in the speakers rich tones and rapt expression she heard an angel message summoning her to her reward and ere he closed her imagination had taken wing her patient face was raised to heaven her eyes flashed with a strange light she seemed about to be translated and as the elder arose to read the closing hymn the old lady clasped her withered hands and shouting in a feeble voice glory glory glory she fell back helpless all eyes were turned towards her among them were the startled eyes of the rich lady whom we have described she seemed riveted for a moment then turned deathly pale for in the placid face around which a halo of heavenly light already seemed to beam she recognized the aged mother of stephen morris and beside her pillowing the gray head upon her bosom sat mary winship whom she had not seen for many years she saw no more her eyes closed and she sank fainting to the ground and was carried to a neighboring tent yes reader it was mattie now mrs giles who was spending the summer at long branch and hearing of the meetings at ocean grove determined on gratifying her curiosity by attending little dreaming that the services would possess any interest for her if the preacher had known her previous history and wished to arouse an interest in her mind he could not have chosen a more effectual text and theme it went to her heart like a twoedged sword for she had never forgotten the irreparable injury she had done mrs morris nor the words of mary youth is the sowing time the reader will readily recognize in the party who occupied the plain carriage mary winship her preacher friend and wife and mrs morris mrs morris was carried to the tent of a friend where she lay apparently unconscious for some time while sitting at her bedside a request came from mrs giles that mary would come to her as mary entered the tent mrs giles burst into tears and clasped mary in her arms when she could command her voice she asked the lady who owned the tent if they could be alone for a few moments o mary she exclaimed how i have suffered this afternoon it seems as if the preacher must have known about stephen morris and how his poor mother was almost heartbroken on account of his death my soul was terrified when i heard that feeble shout i turned around and saw her pale face and you beside her oh mary how bitterly i have reaped god only knows how much fearful suffering would have been spared me had i taken your advice mary soothed her as best she could and recalled the words of the minister in which he showed gods willingness to forgive and pardon she then kneeled down with her and prayed with great fervor and shortly afterward accompanied her to her carriage where mrs giles exacted a promise from her that she would call upon her the next day at the west end hotel where she was staying mrs morris remained in the tent to which she had been carried and the next morning feeling somewhat stronger she was removed to her home but she never unclosed her eyes again when asked if she were unable to do so she replied no not unable but unwilling she wished never to look upon earthly things again god had mercifully vouchsafed her a view of the land beyond the river and conscious that her failing body could last but a few short hours she feared she might lose the lovely vision if she looked upon earth again just before she died she called mary to her side and kissing her tenderly said mary we shall meet again mary called according to promise on mrs giles at the hotel and was grieved to find that a few hours had made a decided change in her feelings she received mary rather coldly and parried all allusions to the scene at ocean grove yes mrs giles like thousands of others felt strongly the call of the good spirit wooing her to seek forgiveness but alas the love of the world and the pride of life triumphed in her heart her good resolutions were all forgotten and she became one of that mighty host that say go thy way for this time when i have a more convenient season i will call for thee while they were talking mrs giles little daughter entered the room and when ocean grove was mentioned said mother i wonder what that old lady saw when she looked up at the sky and do you know mother i was awake for a long time last night and i thought i could see the minister again as he lifted up his eyes to heaven and said christian i have a message from the lord of the harvest for you mamma i want to be a christian mary was moved to tears and pressed the child to her bosom deeply grieved in her heart that the dear little one must be given up to the care of a worldly unchristian mother mary winship lives to do good to many she is a guiding star and although disappointment almost crushed her young heart it made her a ministering angel mrs giles still lives an unhappy fashionable woman she is rich and therefore able to gratify her fondness for display but when she rides in her splendid carriage and wherever she goes a ghost sits ever beside her she can never banish from her memory the

liberty street  clayton berry or new years calls clayton berry a temperence temperance story about the year  there came to williamsburgh a gentleman with his wife and child from massachusetts he had been for many years foreman in one of the manufactories there and at length arose from that humble position to that of resident agent at the mills and finally active partner in the warehouse in new york his wife was a woman of rare intelligence and although once an operative in the same factory with her husband she had in common with most new england girls received a superior education and was fitted to adorn the elevated social position that wealth so often gives upon his arrival in the burgh mr berry went to reside in what was known at that time as one of the fourteen buildings on grand street between union avenue and bushwick one of which was then and instill occupied by d m esq at that time grand street was much like the streets of a new england village the writer well remembers the beautiful shade trees that then surrounded those dwellings clothed in summer with the richest foliage and vocal with the songs of birds there was no belgian pavement then and the grass grew luxuriantly on either side of the carriageway the berrys had not long been settled in their new home when their neighbors called to make them welcome and were much pleased to find the new comers so intelligent and agreeable from that time mr berry began to take an active part in all the social and benevolent enterprises of the day old williamsburghers will remember the central hall which stood on the corner of south first and fifth streets where finkles provision store now stands they will also remember when general rosecranzthen unknown to famelectured on the early settlement tlement of california also dr weitings lectures c at that time a few leading men full of zeal and fully identifying themselves with the place determined that williamsburgh should not lack in intellectual entertainments foremost in procuring the services of eminent men to lecture in central hall was mr berry then as now croakers were not wanting to belittle everything done in williamsburgh many a contest mr b had with them telling them what he plainly foresaw that williamsburgh would one day take her place socially intellectually and financially by the side of her older sister brooklyn at one of the annual elections for president of village trustees the democracy selected mr e d as their standard bearer mr d was personally known to most of the citizens and was popular with all classes the opposition knowing they had a strong opponent to contend with urged mr berry to accept the nomination this he positively declined as his business forbade the sacrifice of time required to discharge the duties aright a less popular man was chosen and as a consequence mr d was elected and here at the zenith of his prosperity and usefulnessblessed with all that can make life happy we would gladly leave himbut painful facts are yet to be told in the fall of the year  the financial partner in the house of van blarcom howe  berry was missing large rewards were offered for any information concerning him but no tidings came and his prolonged absence led to an examination into the affairs of the house when it was found that mr howe was a defaulter to a large amount it was the old old story speculation heavy losses concealment it was a severe blow to the concern but they weathered it and would have stood perhaps to this day had not the disastrous year of  followed in the commercial tornado that swept through the land the house went down and to make their ruin complete their factory took fire and was burned it was without insurance then mr berry utterly broken in spirit thought to restore his failing health by a voyage to europe but to no avail he died almost immediately on his return home mrs berry now thrown upon her own resources sources began to look around for means wherewith to help herself and child claytonnow grown to be a fine manly boy she thought of the home of her childhood where she knew she would be truly welcome but the old farm was small the soil was cold and worn out yielding but a scanty subsistence to those already dependent upon it and she thought of the detriment it would be to her son to remove him from the studies in which he was making such rapid progress so with the assistance of friends she opened a small store in grand street and clayton continued at the old school in remsen street under the tuition of mr bush ever foremost in his class he won the approbation of his teacher who took delight in watching the development of his rare intellectual powers mr b one of the trustees will remember the boy who on one occasion drew tears from all eyes by the eloquent manner in which he described the death of an ancient hero at this time clayton was a scholar in the south second street m e sabbath school then under the superintendence of j k mr k saw in the boy the dawning of real genius and invited him often to his house ever enjoying the flashes of wit and sunshine that seemed always to follow the boy wherever he went one evening the store was closed and mrs berry was about to retire when glancing at her son she saw a look of deep care and sadness on his face his head rested on his hand his brow was clouded and her fond heart was filled with anxious fears she drew him gently to her pushed back the clustering curls and gazed in his earnest and thoughtful eyes you are sadly troubled tonight my son and it grieves me tell me the cause of it cause enough mother when you are toiling from early morning until late at night to support me in idleness i have never realized till today how selfish and unkind i must have seemed to you i a great strong boy living upon the fruits of your industry scarce knowing or caring how the money came but mother it shall not be so any longer i am fully determined to seek employment tomorrow one of our boys has got a place in stewarts and there is room for another and after a while i hope to earn enough to keep us both then you shall live in some nice quiet street like other people mrs berry was proud of the spirit shown by her noble boy but the cherished desire of her heart had been to give him a thorough education then see him grow to manhood fitted to adorn any position in life a worthy son of his much loved father for this she had toiled and struggled amid care and discouragements but for this she would gladly have laid down the burden of her life to sleep with him who reposed so peacefully on the sunny slope of the cypress hills so she told him her labors had not been in vain fortune had smiled upon her the little stock in the store was all hers and there was a surplus stock laid away sufficient she thought to give him a collegiate course clayton tried to shake her resolution and finding it to no purpose he set to work with renewed energy often studying far into the night the commencement of the following year found him fully prepared for college the day of his departure was one of unmixed sadness to the widowed another her loved and cherished son gone from her fond embrace her sheltering caregone into the world to form new ties make new friends the coming years might give to her a proud and manly form but her boy no more forever with many a tear she gave him to the care of a widows god the father of the fatherless the days wore slowly on till news reached her of his safe arrival then the letters came in rapid succession breathing high aspirations and ardent hopes and gladdening her heart with accounts of his rapid progress in one he wrote dear mother what do you think of my studying law the professor thinks my talents just suited to that profession and if you approve i shall shape my course accordingly but we cannot follow him step by step in his career suffice it to say he worked arduously and acquitted himself nobly graduating with the highest honors and when he left the college halls he bore with him the kind wishes of all and a farewell letter from the president in which he said continue as you have begun my young friend carry out the high impulses by which you have ever been actuated and your name will yet be a household word in the land among the first to welcome clayton on his return home was leander scholes a friend of his earlier years and one who had not been forgotten during his absence he too was a young man of great promise the very soul of honor in short the exact counterpart of clayton berry one day while walking in bedford avenue they were joined by edward colton whom clayton at once new by name though he failed to recognize in the tall flashily attired young man the pale delicate young boy he had known in his school days edward colton was a gay rollicking sort of a fellow full of fun and though considered a pretty good sort of a chap he was universally conceded to be rather fast and many wondered to see him on terms of apparent intimacy with such a man as leander scholes but there was about him a dangerous fascination that few could resist clayton felt the influence of it and despite his better judgment soon found himself on the friendliest footing with the man he had first looked upon with dislike the three walked and talked of their boyhood days and the many changes that had taken place then of the girls and as clayton was a comparative stranger to most of those mentioned colton proposed that he should join them in their calls on new years then just at hand he readily assented and when all was arranged a neat little card was prepared bearing the names of the trio thus edward colton leander scholes clayton berry  the first of january dawned bright and clear it was a day to make or mar the destiny of many a young man it was a day to make or mar the future of clayton berry yet no shadow of his coming fate rested upon his young heart or stayed his bounding step as he started forth to make his first new years call they soon reached the house of mrs willow and after chatting awhile arose to take their departure when mrs w invited them to take refreshments remarking at the same time you see gentlemen we have two tablesthis is mine and that is my daughter marys now mary was a scholar in lee avenue sabbath school and had been deeply impressed the sunday before by the remarks of the superintendent mr lummus on the evil of drinking wine at new years calls and as she could not prevail upon her mother to give up the accustomed wine she begged the privilege of setting a temperance table of her own now gentlemen said mrs willow which do you prefer i must confess i do not object to a glass of wine once a year said colton smiling i object to it at any and all times mary hath chosen the better part and i prefer her table said leander on leaving the house he said to colton i wish there were more girls like mary willow if there were there would be fewer drunkards made today drunkards said colton thats a pretty hard name to give a fellow for taking one glass of wine one glass of wine returned leander how many are there that once tasting have resolution to stop touch not the accursed thing is my motto and depend upon it it is the only safe one you are wiser perhaps than the old patriarchs didnt paul tell bartimeus to take a little wine often for his stomachs sake clayton and leander laughed heartily at coltons new rendition of the scriptures leander saying i believe it was timothy that paul recommended the wine toand then medicinally well we wont say anything more about it now here is ald armeadows and here we call in the spacious parlors they found some very pretty girls of rare conversational powers the airy nothings of the day were passed lightly over then the conversation took a wider range shakespeare and the ancient poets were discussed till clayton felt his heart glow with unusual warmth and when they arose to leave and the inevitable refreshments were offered he declined saying i have enjoyed a feast of reason i would not exchange for the most sumptuous repast their next call was at dr cheesemans in lee avenue now the doctor was blessed with two intelligent daughters girls who understood all the great questions of the day and with them leander and clayton were soon in animated discussion but colton sat apart looking weary and impatient till his friends seeing that he was annoyed at their long delay arose to leave mrs cheeseman urged them to take a cup of coffee first but bowing their thanks they retired no sooner had they reached the street than colton exclaimed  whew what strongminded girls they are horrid bores too how under the sun you could enjoy their society is more than i can comprehend just wait till i show you the sort of girls i fancy just wait till you see miss marvin and her sister and here we are at the deacons now they were ushered into the elegant drawing ing room and miss magnolia marvin arose to greet them tall and majestic a perfect vision of loveliness she advanced extending her hand to clayton saying have i really the good fortune to see mr berry of whom i have heard so much it is a pleasure indeed to meet you clayton blushed and ere he could recover his selfpossession she had motioned him with a graceful wave of her beatiful beautiful hand to a seat by her side claytons heart beat almost audibly but with a tact peculiarly hey own she drew him into conversation and in admiration of her he soon forgot his embarrassment miss marvin was a coquette of the first order and having heard of the fine talents of the young lawyer she determined to add him to the list of her conquests with many a cunning device she whiled away the time while he remained by her side a willing captive leander seeing his friend was spellbound by her fascinations said gentlemen it is growing late are you aware that we have other calls to make clayton arose but a little hand was laid upon his arm and a winning voice said oh do not go mr berry till you have had a glass of wine with me thank you dear miss marvin said clayton but you will excuse me when i assure you that i never drink wine but mr berry pleaded the gentle voice this is not exactly wine it is the pure juice of the grape father has had it in the cellar ever so many years and it is not like drinking anything intoxicating you know so saying she poured out a glass full to the brim while clayton stood irresolute colton raised his glass and said heres a happy new year still he hesitated when miss marvin turned her bewitching eyes upon himsurely you will not refuse to drink with memany happy returns of this day leander tried to gain his attention but poor clayton had eyes only for the beautiful syren who was luring him so steadily to his ruin another glance at the charmer then seizing the goblet he drank his first glass of wine once out from the influence of her who had so beguiled him clayton felt a keen regret for what he had done how could you so easily forget the good resolutions you have so often made said leander it pained me more than words can tell to see you drink that wine well replied clayton i really did not like to do it but there was no escape you would not have me be rude to a lady no said colton and he has no right to force his puritanical ideas upon us it is a pity if a man cannot drink once a year particularly when a lady urges it no lady would urge it said leander warmly and when she persuaded you to sacrifice your principles to gratify her vanity i say she was a fienda viper i will not hear you speak so of miss marvin returned clayton the hot blood rising to his temples and he pursued his way in silence for though leander had long been a bosom friend he felt his indignation turn fiercely against him for the wine had begun its work leander felt keenly the alienation of his friend and he saw that new dangers awaited him and he determined to save him if possible at whatever cost to his own feelings so assuming a cheerfulness he did not feel he said well we will not disagree about her but take a look at some of my friends the misses barker i would not have you miss seeing them but here is mr smiths one of our first men said colton interrupting him let us call here first in mr smiths brilliantlylighted parlors they found a goodly number of city officials a minister a lawyer or two and last but not least the mayor thrown for the first time into such society clayton carefully scanned each facelistened eagerly to every word with a worthy ambition to stand one day with the foremost of them the mayor greeted him kindly saying i once knew your father he was a man take him for all and all we may never look upon his like again yet i know not continued he musingly why his only son should not walk in his footsteps he was interrupted in his remarks by mrs smith who asked one and all to the refreshment table they gathered round the wellspread board the wine sparkled the jingling glasses made merry music and wit and mirth flowed freely a toast was proposed leander from the opposite side of the table cast an imploring glance at clayton but colton whispered in his ear it is too late to retreat now see the parson is touching the mayors glass that is a signal for all to drink so be a man and do as the rest do saying which he drank the contents of his glass and clayton did the same leander sick at heart arose to leave and his friends soon followed him with tears he begged clayton to delay no longer but go immediately home remember your mother and by the love you bear her escape from the snares that surround you while yet you may i am no longer in leading strings said clayton and dont propose to go home till i get ready and feeling competent to take care of myself yet awhile i will bid you good evening saying which he took coltons arm and walked rapidly away leander stood for a moment irresolute scarce knowing what to do but feeling that further remonstrance would avail nothing he turned sorrowfully homewards well i am not sorry to see the last of him said colton he has been a damper upon us all day with his old womanish airs and his fear of our getting tight for my part i have brains enough to stand a glass of wine or two for that matter another call and yet another and everywhere the wine clayton no longer hesitated drank again and again till colton seeing his hand grow unsteady and his eyes gleam with a strange light coaxed him away come my boy this is what i call real enjoyment but it mustnt be carried too far you are new to this sort of thing you know and must go it moderatelyand colton reached out his hand to steady his friend who grasped the railings for support come now i think you had better go home never till i have seen my dear angel miss marvin i fancied she saw me hesitate to drink with something of scorn in her beautiful eyes i will show her i can tosscan toss off a glass like a man he reeled as he spoke and fell heavily to the ground it is past midnight all the houses that were so brilliantly illuminated a few hours since are now dark the streets are now deserted and no sound is heard save the occasional shout of belated bacchanalian have all the people retired no there is one person at least whose eyes cannot close in sleepthe mother of clayton berry she for the first time in her life fears something has gone wrong with her son she listens to every sound starting at every footstep she waits expecting to hear her son enter the door but as the footstep passes she sinks back almost distracted the clock strikes two she hears an unusual sound of persons coming up the street their steps are slow and uncertain she listens attentively they seem to be dragging somethingfor she can hear the scraping on the walk an awful suspicion crosses her mind perhaps some accident has befallen her son but as the footsteps passed the house she dismissed the fearful thought from her mind and falling into a deep reverie for a time she noticed nothing she was startled by a violent ringing of the bell she hastened down stairs saying he has come at last as she opened the door the light was extinguished by the wind and at the same time something was thrown into the hallway at her feet she screamed in terror arousing the people in the house and when the door was closed and the lights were brought she looked at the object on the floor her eyes almost started from their sockets the awful truth was apparent her son her darling boy thrown into the house by his companion dead drunk her brain reeled she cried oh god support me then throwing her arms out wildly swooned on the body of her boy how painful to write this part of our history yes clayton berry was overcome by wine and his companion though intoxicated was yet able to drag him to his mothers door it was late next day when clayton awoke from his drunken sleep he looked around bewildered trying to recollect the occurrences of the past night and as he raised himself in bed a severe pain shot through his head i have no recollection of coming home he mused i remember coming from mrs winenmans house but nothing further just then he heard a suppressed groan from his mothers room he arose hastily and taking his clothes from the chair noticed they were soiled and torn then the horrid truth was apparent he had been overcome by wine and some one had brought him home instead of going to his mothers room he locked the door and sat down overwhelmed with grief how can i see mother again how have i requited her kindness remorse is said to be the most harrowing feeling of the human heart certain it is that clayton berry was that morning one of the most wretched of gods creatures about noon his mother knocked gently at his door and asked if he was well and if she should get him some dinner he answered that he was not well and would keep his room until evening how can i look mother in the face again he said i am almost resolved to leave home and hide my disgrace in some distant place oh wretch that i am to place myself in such a painful position towards evening mrs berry called him again but he said let me wait till morning perhaps i shall feel better so the sorrowing mother suppressed her yearning to converse with her son and retired to her sleepless couch to await the morn with clayton too the night passed slowly now walking the floor uneasily then throwing himself upon the bed but not to sleep ever and anon asking himself how can i ever meet mother and then too it must be known to all in the house the next morning clayton arose early and descended to breakfast as he entered the room his mother greeted him with her usual manner but there was a deep sadness in her face and in the tone of her voice harder to bear than any reproach the meal was taken in silence and when clayton arose to depart to his business his mother said good bye my son and bestowing her accustomed kiss she threw her arms about his neck and burst into tears gently disengaging her arms he returned the kiss and sobbing left the house it was many days before mrs berry could talk calmly with her son of all that occurred on that new years day clayton with deep humiliation begged his mothers pardon assuring her he would do so no more with gods help said his mother in low reverent tones did clayton keep the pledge so solemnly made that bright winter morning for weeks and months he did but he was advancing very fast in popularity making rapid strides in his profession and winning hosts of friends and it was hard to refuse always yet his course was marked out and he followed it with unfaltering step till one day when his duties were of a very arduous nature the senior partner of the firm urged him to take something stimulating he tasted only a taste but the spell was broken then followed the friendly glass now and then only at long intervals it is true but slowly and surely undermining his resolution he soothed his conscience by saying one glass cannot hurt me and nothing shall tempt me beyond that among the clients of graham  co was a man named brown a californian rich and heavily involved in law suits with him clayton soon became intimate and while out to dinner one day deeply engaged discussing the cases he forgot and took his second glass of wine for that day as was before mentioned clayton was an agreeable companion and his society was sought by the first in the city the evenings that kept clayton from his home seemed long to mrs berry yet she excused it to herself by this thoughthe is young and it is but natural he should seek the society of those of his own age strange as it may seem edward colton still continued on intimate terms with him but leander was not often found in their company when he met clayton alone he was the same kind friend and exhibited a fondness nay even affection for him not often shown by brothers but his advice was unheeded and his presence seemed a restraint on many evenings in the week leander might be found with other intelligent young men of the burgh at the library in south eighth street clayton and colton frequently spent their evenings in the same neighborhood but how different for clayton had already become a moderate drinker and though he concealed it from many his mother could not be deceived and many a sleepless night she passed in gloomy anticipation of the future in one of the gilded saloons on the south side frequented by those in the higher walks of life there was one night a large company assembled to witness a game of billiards between a champion from new york and a gentleman in williamsburgh well known for his skill and fondness for the game during the evening the wine flowed more freely than usual for many friends had met there and the reprehensible practice of treating was often indulged in clayton being an adept in the game was often appealed to thus bringing him into notice and arousing the jealousy of colton who considered himself much the better player and when some discussion arose he sneered at claytons decision and called him a dunce clayton felt the insult keenly in the presence of so many strangers but before he could find words to express his angry emotions colton added fuel to the flame by speaking in still rougher terms of the new york player now claytons sympathies had been with him through the entire game and inflamed with wine his indignation knew no bounds at what he considered a breach of hospitality and he asked him angrily if he wasnt ashamed no retorted colton nor ever had cause to be since the night i dragged you home clayton sprang to grasp a cue when colton anticipating him seized one of the ivory balls and threw it striking him in the face maddened with rage and pain clayton cried out your life shall pay for that and before his friends could prevent he caught an empty wine bottle and hurled it at his head colton fell to the floor friends ran to his help but he made no sound while the blood streamed freely dr north was called and soon pronounced his injuries serious captain w of the police force who had been attracted by the noise waited but to hear the doctors opinionthen placing poor clayton under arrest hurried him off to the station house the reader will say perhaps that our hero is making swift progress downward let them look around and see if they do not know one at least whose descent was as rapid on the night of claytons arrest mrs berry sat waiting for her son hour after hour passed and he returned not at length morning dawned a knock sounded at the door she hastened to reply to it and met for the first time in many weeks leander scholes fearing she knew not what she asked has anything happened to clayton i came to talk with you about him said leander evasively is he injured tell me quickly she said in great agitation leander begged her to be calm and then proceeded to tell her as gently as possible the occurrences of the past night as he had learned them leander accompanied mrs berry to the station house where she was received with the characteristic courtesy of captain w who was much affected as he had known the family when mr berry was living they entered the cell where clayton was confined and found him lying on a rude cot his face buried in his hands oh my son exclaimed mrs berry sinking down beside him clayton did not move speak to me or my heart will break a suppressed groan was the only answer for clayton overwhelmed with shame could not look up leander advanced and taking claytons hand said do not despair i have long been a friend and will not desert you now tears came to claytons relief and when he could control his emotion he said oh mother if i had only taken leanders advice i should not be here what an awful night i have spent in this place if there be a hell more tormenting what must that hell be tell me leander is colton very badly hurt yes but the extent of his injuries cannot be known till  oclock when a consultation will be held mother said clayton throwing his arms around her neck from this hour i am a changed being in the long night just ended my life has passed in review before me and once out of this difficulty i will never touch a glass of wine as long as i live oh that fatal call on miss marvin would to god i had heeded your entreating look leander as i stood beside her table while they were in the cell word came to the station house that colton was dying and as mrs berry and leander passed through the anteroom every voice was hushed for though those officers of the law were accustomed to behold crime in all its aspects it appalled them to think of the fate of this young man and the blow that yet must fall upon the strickenhearted mother colton died on the following day and the coroners jury brought in a verdict came to his death by injuries received at the hands of clayton berry clayton thereupon was conveyed to the jail in raymond street to await his trial every effort was made in his behalf by friends eminent counsel was engaged and many lawyers who had known him offered their services seldom had prisoner so much to hope for the day of trial came the courtroom was crowded the history of the case was known far and wide and awakened general interest and when the judge asked the customary question guilty or not guilty there was breathless suspense till clayton in a low voice said not guilty his counsel did all they could urged the young mans character his friendship for colton and his excitement upon receiving the blow from the billiard ball and having exhausted the power of eloquence the case was given to the jury they were out long then came in for instruction on a point of law and would gladly have acquitted him had they not sworn to give their verdict according to the evidence after a time they came in and took their place and the judge asked if they had agreed upon a verdict the foreman of the jury replied they had guilty or not guilty guilty of manslaughter in thedegree but recommended to the mercy of the court while he was speaking mrs berrys gaze was rivetted upon him and when he ceased she sank back beside leander who since claytons arrest had been her constant friend the judge said he would pronounce the sentence and as the prisoner had been recommended to mercy it should be the lightest allowed by the lawstates prison for the term of two years it was with difficulty that leander could support mrs berry to the cars she spoke not a word shed no tears for the fountain of her tears was dry she was utterly crushed they sat down and presently the foreman of the jury entered and took a seat by leander with whom he was already acquainted a few remarks passed and then he turned to mrs berry and with kindly words tried to console her saying that without doubt the governor would soon be induced to pardon her son but his words fell upon dull ears mrs berry seemed past all feeling but leanders heart was full for he remembered that it was at his house that clayton took his first step in his downward career yes deacon marvin the father of magnolia was the foreman of the jury the next day a close carriage stopped at the jail and clayton accompanied by a deputy sheriff got in they drove rapidly to the depot in thirtieth street and were soon on board the cars for singsing when the train reached yonkers mr brown the californian of whom we have spoken came in and seeing clayton extended his hand in greeting but the hand he sought was withheld it was manacled clayton averted his face while the officer in a few words told all that had happened in his absence mr brown was shocked thunderstruck and turning to clayton said my dear young friend my heart aches for you believe me no time or expense shall be spared to bring about your release arrived at sing sing clayton was hastened out when a gaily dressed lady rudely jostled him saying to a companion in sneering tones how very democratic our conveyances must be when a lady must be brought in contact with a jail bird miss magnolia marvin on a visit to friends failed to recognize in the criminal the acquaintance of other days clayton however knew her at a glance and whispered through clenched teeth as she passed viper indeed within the prison walls the officer bade him farewell and took his leave the warden hastily glanced over the court papers then turning asked about his previous character clayton seeing it was no idle curiosity that prompted the question told him in a few words his careersince he made his first new years call the warden wishing to save him from contact with hardened criminals assigned him the position of book keeper in the harness shop but nothing could save him from the hated prison clothes an icy chill passed over him as he arrayed himself in the garb of his deep degredation degradation  he had been there but a few weeks when his mother accompanied by leander came to see him with difficulty she recognized her boy in his changed attire and shorn of his beautiful hair but clayton saw a yet greater change in her her step was slow and feeble her brow was graven with deep lines of care and her breath came slowly painfully the interview was shortneither could endure itand it was many weeks before she came again then in her basket she brought many little articles to add to his comfort many little tokens of the love which through good and evil report had never ceased but as she was about to leave she drew him gently toward her and said clayton i shall not come to see you any more my strength is going very fast and i feel that i have made the last journey i shall ever make i bear with me a broken heart soon very soon i shall lie by the side of your father and now my child will you try to meet me in heaven looking to jesus for forgiveness and help clayton fell on her neck and burst into tears sobbing as though his heart would break saying at length mother i have never forgotten your teachings and in my lonely cell at night i have prayed and my soul has found comfort and i can say i the chief of sinners am but jesus died for me the mother held him in one long embrace then departedforever her heart was indeed broken she reached home but with great difficulty and the next morning was found dead when the sad tidings reached clayton deep melancholy seized upon him for a few days he performed his duties mechanically never heeding or speaking to those around him then he fell violently ill with a fever in his delirium raving incessantly of his motherhis lost motherthen starting up exclaiming i have been stung by a

bradshaw the last time that i ever saw anthony sherman was on july th  in independence square he was then ninetynine and becoming very feeble but though so old his dimming eyes rekindled as he looked at independence hall which he said he had come to gaze upon once more before he was gathered home what time is it said he raising his trembling eyes to the clock in the steeple and endeavoring to shade the former with a shaking hand what time is it i cant see so well now as i used to halfpast three come then he continued let us go into the halli want to tell you an incident of washingtons life one which no one alive knows of except myself and if you live you will before long see it verified mark me i am not superstitious  but you will see it verified reaching the visitors room in which the sacred relics of our early days are preserved we sat down upon one of the oldfashioned wooden benches and my venerable companion related to me the following singular narrative which from the peculiarity of our national affairs at the present time i have been induced to give to the world i give it as nearly as possible in his own words when the bold action of our congress in asserting the independence of the colonies became known in the old world we were laughed and scoffed at as silly presumptuous rebels whom british grenadiers would very soon tame into submission but undauntedly we prepared to make good what we had said the keen encounter came and the world knows the result it is easy and pleasant for those of the present generation to talk and write of the days of seventysix but they little know neither can they imagine the trials and sufferings of those fearful days and there is one thing that i much fear and that is that the american people do not properly appreciate the boon of freedom party spirit is yearly becoming stronger and stronger and without it is checked will at no distant day undermine and tumble into ruins the noble structure of the republic but let me hasten to my narrative from the opening of the revolution we experienced all phases of fortunenow good and now ill one time victorious and another conquered the darkest period we had however was i think when washington after several reverses retreated to valley forge where he resolved to pass the winter of  ah i have often seen the tears coursing down our dear old commanders careworn cheeks as he would be conversing with a confidential officer about the condition of his poor soldiers you have doubtless heard the story of washington going to the thicket to pray well it is not only true but he used often to pray in secret for aid and comfort from that god the interposition of whose divine providence alone brought us safely through those dark days of tribulation one dayi remember it wellthe chilly wind whistled and howled through the leafless trees though the sky was cloudless and the sun shining brightly he remained in his quarters nearly the whole afternoon alone when he came out i noticed that his face was a shade paler than usual and that there seemed to be something upon his mind of more than ordinary importance returning just after dusk he dispatched an orderly to the quarters of the officer i mentioned who was presently in attendance after a preliminary conversation which lasted some half an hour washington gazing upon his companion with that strange look of dignity which he alone could command said to the latter i do not know whether it was owing to the anxiety of my mind or what but this afternoon as i was sitting at this very table engaged in preparing a dispatch something in the apartment seemed to disturb me looking up i beheld standing exactly opposite to me a singularly beautiful female so astonished was ifor i had given strict orders not to be disturbedthat it was some moments before i found language to inquire the cause of her presence a second third and even a fourth time did i repeat the question but received no other answer from my mysterious visitor than a slight raising of her eyes by this time i felt a strange sensation spreading throughout me i would have risen but the riveted gaze of the being before me rendered volition impossible i essayed once more to address her but my tongue had become powerless even thought itself presently became paralyzed a new influence mysterious potent irresistible took possession of me all i could do was to gaze gaze steadily vacantly at my unknown visitant gradually the surrounding atmosphere seemed as though becoming filled with sensations and grew luminous everything about me appeared to rarifythe mysterious visitor herself becoming more airy and yet even more distinct to my sight than before i now began to feel as one dying or rather to experience the sensations which i have sometimes imagined accompany dissolution i did not think i did not reason i did not move all were alike impossible i was only conscious of gazing fixedly vacantly at my companion presently i heard a voice saying son of the republic look and learn while at the same time my visitor extended her arm and forefinger eastwardly i now beheld a heavy white vapor at some distance rising fold upon fold this gradually disappeared and i looked upon a strange scene before me lay spread out in one vast plain all the countries of the world europe asia africa and america i saw rolling and tossing between europe and america the billows of the atlantic and between asia and america lay the pacific son of the republic said the same mysterious voice as before look and learn at that moment i beheld a dark shadowy being like an angel standing or rather floating in midair between europe and america dipping water out of the ocean in the hollow of each hand he sprinkled some upon america with his right hand while he cast upon europe some with his left immediately a dark cloud arose from each of these countries and joined in midocean for a while it remained stationary and then moved slowly westward until it enveloped america in its murky folds sharp flashes of lightning now gleamed throughout it at intervals and i heard the smothered groans and cries of the american people a second time the angel dipped water from the ocean and sprinkled it out as before the dark cloud was then drawn back to the ocean into whose heaving waves it sunk from view a third time i heard the mysterious voice saying son of the republic look and learn i cast my eyes upon america and beheld villages towns and cities springing up one after another until the whole land from the atlantic to the pacific was dotted with them again i heard the mysterious voice say son of the republic the end of a century cometh look and learn at this the dark shadowy angel turned his face southward and from africa i saw an illomened spectre approaching our land it flitted slowly and heavily over every village town and city of the latter the inhabitants of which presently set themselves in battle array one against the other as i continued looking i saw a bright angel on whose brow rested a crown of light on which was traced the word union bearing the american flag which he placed between the divided nation and said remember ye are brethren instantly the inhabitants casting from them their weapons became friends once more and united around the national standard and again i heard the mysterious voice saying son of the republic the second peril is passed look and learn and i beheld the villages towns and cities of america increase in size and number until at last they covered all the land from the atlantic to the pacific and their inhabitants became as countless as the stars in heaven or the sand on the seashore and again i heard the mysterious voice saying son of the republic the end of a century cometh look and learn at this the dark shadowy angel placed a trumpet to his mouth and blew three distinct blasts and taking water from the ocean sprinkled it out upon europe asia and africa then my eyes looked upon a fearful scene from each of these countries arose thick black clouds that were soon joined into one and throughout this mass gleamed a darkred light by which i saw hordes of armed men who moving with the cloud marched by land and sailed by sea to america which country was presently enveloped in the volume of the cloud and i dimly saw these vast armies devastate the whole country and pillage and burn the villages towns and cities that i had beheld springing up as my ears listened to the thundering of cannon clashing of swords and shouts and cries of the millions in mortal combat i again heard the mysterious voice saying son of the republic look and learn when the voice had ceased the dark shadowy angel placed his trumpet once more to his mouth and blew a long fearful blast instantly a light as of a thousand suns shone down from above me and pierced and broke into fragments the dark cloud which enveloped america at the same moment i saw the angel upon whose forehead still shone the word union and who bore our national flag in one hand and a sword in the other descend from heaven attended by legions of bright spirits these immediately joined the inhabitants of america who i perceived were wellnigh overcome but who immediately taking courage again closed up their broken ranks and renewed the battle again amid the fearful noise of the conflict i heard the mysterious voice saying son of the republic look and learn as the voice ceased the shadowy angel for the last time dipped water from the ocean and sprinkled it upon america instantly the dark cloud rolled back together with the armies it had brought leaving the inhabitants of the land victorious then once more i beheld villages towns and cities springing up where they had been before while the bright angel planting the azure standard he had brought in the midst of them cried in a loud voice to the inhabitants while the stars remain and the heavens send down dew upon the earth so long shall the republic last and taking from his brow the crown on which still blazed the word union he placed it upon the standard while the people kneeling down said amen the scene instantly began to fade and dissolve and i at last saw nothing but the rising curling white vapor i had first beheld this also disappearing i found myself once more gazing upon my mysterious visitor who in that same mysterious voice i had heard before said son of the republic what you have seen is thus interpreted three perils will come upon the republic the most fearful is the second passing which the whole world united shall never be able to prevail against her let every child of the republic learn to live for his god his land and union with these words the figure vanished i started from my seat and felt that i had seen a vision wherein had been shown to me the birth progress and destiny of the republic of the united states in union she will have strength in disunion her destruction such my friend concluded the venerable narrator were the words i heard from washingtons own lips and america will do well to profit by them let her forever remember that in union she has her strength in disunion her destruction god help our noble ship of state by wesley bradshaw god help our noble ship of state the storm is on her now and madly partys billows dash upon her shattered prow up up ye

seven by wesley bradshaw during the struggle for independence the american patriots were as much harassed by the tories as by the hired mercenaries sent by despotic royalty to conquer and force them into submission to a power which they hated soon after the southern forces were placed under the command of general greene the latter sent out general morgan with one thousand men to cut off those tories infesting the western portion of south carolina scarcely had morgan with his brave band taken up his march ere cornwallis the british commander became aware of the movement and instantly dispatched the bloodthirsty colonel tarleton in pursuit the indefatigable morgan soon learned of this and accordingly halted and prepared for battle the enemy presently appeared in such force however that morgan retreated as far as cowpens a little town in the northern part of what was then union county where he determined to meet the foe at all hazards the sun of january th was going down as he entered the town and so close was the pursuit that the dim shadows of evening had not yet deepened into the darker shades of night before tarleton came up of course it was now too late to commence the battle but each commander spent most of the night in issuing orders to and arranging his troops for the contest of the morrow the greater portion of morgans band consisted of the militia who though brave were comparatively undisciplined and of course not likely to long withstand the shock of a charge of thoroughly trained troops to the disposition of this part of his command therefore general morgan directed his particular attention and endeavored by appropriate addresses to infuse within their breasts the same indomitable courage that possessed his own heart among the militia were seven personsa father and his six sonswhom general morgan specially complimented these seven patriot soldiers wore nicknamed by their comrades the little regiment for a reason which the reader will easily comprehend from the following description john hillier sr then some fiftyfive years of age stood six feet five and a half inches was of fine proportions and weighed over three hundred pounds while the youngest john hillier jr aged twentytwo measured six feet three inches and weighed two hundred and fifty pounds the five other brothers varied in size and weight between these two in addition to these gigantic proportions the hilliers were possessed of enormous physical strength and the most dauntless courage though often before engaged in skirmishes this was the first time that they were to take part in a regular pitched battle and of course the rest of the army were somewhat anxious to show how they would behave john said general morgan to the elder hillier who with his sons was eating a hasty and frugal meal from off a hollow tree i suppose that you and your brave boys would rather fight together than be separated yes general replied the patriot touching his rough cap respectfully and rising to his feet i think we would be of much more service to you and to our noble cause when united than parted you know general thats what washingtons all the time telling us americansto stick together else well get beat and i tell you what general washington knows whats what well john rejoined general morgan smiling at the heros quaint expression of his opinion of washingtons judgment well have some warm work in the morning and i am going to give you and your lads here the most dangerous position in the battle tomorrow you shall bear the first standard into the fight and i know that the glorious banner of our country cannot be placed in better hands thank you general thank you for the compliment and i and my lads will promise you this that while we can stand and fight or kneel and fight or lay down and fight youll see them stars and stripes floating then as time is pressing move up to the front answered general morgan gathering up his reins and riding slowly away and remember he continued as his steed pranced along impatient of the curb i shall keep my eye upon the little regiment good night good night general was the reply accompanied by the usual military salute and thus they parted our flag our flag for ever the still hours of the night passed slowly solemnly on and each patriot soldier as he watched the twinklings of the faraway stars and listened to the frosty wind as it moaned past thought that perhaps those selfsame shining worlds would the next night send down just such twinklings on his own bloody corpse or roughlymade grave the stars however gradually paled away and then faint gray gleams in the eastern sky told that day was coming to light the wardemon and deathangel to their work presently as the sun came fully above the horizon and streamed his glowing beams over icy hillocks and along the snowy field the bugles shrill note sounded the enemys advance and the patriot band prepared for the onset in front of and a little apart from the van of morgans force were john hillier and his six giant sons the father himself bearing aloft the flag while the latter ranged themselves three on each side of him as a guard well done little regiment exclaimed the general as he rode down the line encouraging his men to stand firm before the foe who were now approaching on came tarleton and his merciless butchers with that steady coolness and veteran determination which always have such a fatal effect on militia anxiously morgan glanced upon his undisciplined force which he noticed was already beginning to sway from side to side and back and forth but even at this critical moment he was unable to repress the thrill of joy which passed through him as he beheld the hilliers at a word from their father cooly coolly and deliberately drawing their long heavy swords would to god i had a hundred such little regiments he said between his closed teeth i would the sentence was unfinished for at this instant at a given signal tarltons troops clapping spurs to their steeds charged with fearful fury for a moment or so the militia tottered and surged and struggled and then breaking fled in wild confusion thus leaving the devoted hilliers wholly unsupported morgan expected to see the latter swept to earth and ridden down like reeds before the tempest but even he did not know the the little regiment quailing before the formidable giants tarletons men swerved either to the right or left of them and thus threw away their own advantage which the spartan americans turned to their account in a voice that was clearly heard above the din of battle the elder hillier as he raised himself to his full height shouted close up lads close up our flag our flag for ever instantly he was encircled by his sons whose herculean exertions actually kept the whole force of the enemy at bay determined however to take the rebel standard tarltons men raged wildly about their intended victims but as uselessly as the stormtossed ocean lashes the beetling cliff man and horse sunk to earth until at last their bodies formed a rampart within which the little regiment wounded and bleeding fought like lions seeing at last that sabres were useless a british dragoon now drew a pistol and levelling it at young john hillier shot him through the heart close up lads close up our flag our flag for ever again thundered the father and the fearful circle was once more serried and unbroken by this time morgan had succeeded in bringing up his regulars and heading them himself he rushed to the rescue of the noble hilliers but alas too late a second of the little regiment fell then a third and a fourth and a fifth back to back ned our flag for ever hoarsely commanded the elder hillier as he saw his fifth son sink at his feet for awhile morgans fierce assault attracted the attention of tarltons men like tigers did the patriot commander and his handful of men strive to cut their way to the two environed heroes and save them but fate had ordered it otherwise and the last son falling the father was left alone in the midst of his relentless assailants still however the flag floated proudly above the doomed hero and still that gory sword swept below its folds in many a horrid circle and still as frenzy took the place of reason hillier shouted in wild hoarse tones close up lads close up our flag our flag for ever for a moment the giant patriot raised himself to his full height whirled his sword aloft and delivered his last vengeful stroke among his enemies one of whom he clove nearly to the saddle such was the force of the blow that the blade snapped asunder leaving only the hilt in the heros hand who casting this from him sprang up razed the starry banner that he had so long and bravely defended and convulsively wrapping it about him sunk beneath a shower of blows exclaiming with his drying voice close up lads close up our flag our flag for ever unable to tear the flag from about the fallen man the british now turned their full attention on general morgan who after a desperate resistance was forced to fly in the course of the pursuit however the enemy fell into irretrievable disorder and ever on the alert morgan taking advantage of this rallied his broken force and charging the foe totally routed themthus rewinning the victory which he had so signally lost his first thoughts after the defeat of the enemy turned upon the brave but fated hilliers and together with his aids he rode back to the spot where the spartan band had fought and fallen surrounded by their victims lay the seven gigantic hilliers about the eldest of whom was still closely wrapped the colors which had been committed to his care in the morning now riddled with bullets torn and soaked with the blood of its champions as morgan gazed down upon the silent form at his feet tears gathered in his eyes and with the words bury them in one grave and above all dont remove the flag from about old johnit is a heros shroud and a hero is in ithe was about to turn away when one of his aids exclaimed he lives he lives a groan and a slight movement of the body proved this to be correct a surgeon was quickly in attendance who after an examination gave it as his opinion that in less than twenty minutes the life which was still lingering in the old hero would be gone the group therefore continued around the dying man who at the end of about ten minutes revived so far as to raise himself on his elbow and exclaim close up lads close up our flag our flag for ever this was his last effort and spasmodically drawing his spangled and bloodstained shroud closely about him he fell back to earth a corpse with the thoughts of such sires and such deeds as these living in our memories is there today within the boundaries of the land which our fathers have bequeathed to usis there one american who in his heart does not love and venerate the starry banner under which the heroes of  fought and died is there today in the wide expanse of our republic one american who will not exclaim with the dying hero of cowpens our flag our flag for ever still knitting stockings by wesley bradshaw on a recent tour we happened to spend a day or two in newark new jersey with a friend who will consider this our warrant of appreciation and thanks for the many kind favors received at his hands during our sojourn driving one afternoon a few miles out of the city we approached a little cottage or rather log cabin which was evidently a survivor of the revolutionary era or perhaps of still greater age it was not so much the venerable appearance of the humble cot that attracted our attention as its peculiar location nestled down in a little dingle or valley below the level of the road it was partially hidden from the traveler by a clump of trees with which it was surrounded and through whose waving foliage we caught occasional glimpses of its quaint smallpaned windows and the smoke curling fantastically from out its roughly constructed chimney there was something so romantic something so weird about the modest building that we questioned our friend concerning its history which we felt sure must be a strange one that little cabin as well as its owner replied he is one of the relics of the olden time a souvenir of washingtons day i could tell you many things about it but would rather let you hear all from the lips of aunt jane herself the proprietress who lives in it with a young girl whom she has lately adopted as her child and heir we will step in on our return and have a talk with her and i assure you you will be more than astonished about an hour later we drove back to the log cabin and my friend fastening his horse drew my arm through his and together we descended a flight of broad oaken steps or rather footboards that brought us to the cool and shady garden before the cottage i was more surprised than ever before me stood the aged looking cabin its quaintness displayed with full effect the step in front of the door was a very broad flagstone flanked right and left by two wide oak benches painted a deep stone color the door itself was one of those black walnut curiosities of which few remain to the present generation manufactured in england and imported to the colonies in days long since gone by knocking loudly my friend at the same time seized the huge iron handle and latch and waited for permission to enter this was instantly given and the following moment we ushered ourselves into a room of the revolution this is the only term that fitly describes the apartment in which we stood its furniture was all of the high straight uncomfortablelooking style of that period the long dingyfaced clock was revolutionary the windowsills were revolutionary the mantelpiece and its rather clumsy ornaments were revotionary revolutionary  and the two inmates in appearance were very revolutionary the youngest one was a pale sweetlooking girl of about fifteen and was attired in the dress usually worn by the children of the time of washington which imparted to her a singularly strange look the eldest who was dressed in the exact martha washington style of brown or fawn colored shortwaisted gown high fullpuffed cap and neat white cambric kerchief pinned about the shoulders seemed to be somewhere about fifty or fiftyfive years of ageno more when we entered she was knitting woollen stockings of which a pile lay on either side of her seeing that we were visitors she laid aside her work and with much dignity rose and took a step forward to meet us good afternoon aunt jane said my companion advancing and taking the hostess by the hand allow me to present to you mr bradshaw a friend of mine who was so much interested in your cottage that i resolved to bring him to you that he might hear its history and your own also from your own lips you are very welcome gentlemen you do me much honor i pray you be seated was the reply in full melodious tones made by mrs jane seymour as she motioned us to two chairs that the little girl had nimbly drawn forward after a preliminary conversation in which i found mrs seymour fully posted upon national affairs she commenced the following narrative ninetynine years ago last wednesday i was born in new york city do not start sir she continued as we involuntarily manifested some astonishment at this statement made as it was by one whose nearly black hair bright eyes and full form indicated no more than fiftyfive at farthest ninetynine years have passed over me and left me no friend nor relation save my country for a long long time when i was ten years of age my father removed from new york and settled on this very spot he did not however build this cabin which had been put up many years before by two or three men who had been subsequently murdered by indians after their death the house which had the character of being haunted was allowed to remain unoccupied and was tumbling in ruins when father took possession of it and repaired it we were never troubled by the spirits and began to prosper very well just as the war broke out between great britain and the colonies at this juncture our family consisted beside father and mother of two sons robert and james and three girls elizabeth mary and myself and sir it makes my heart even today tremble with joy when i say that all of us entered at once and earnestly into the sacred cause of our country father and robert and james went into the provincial army while mother and us girls remained to take care of the home and little clearing i was too young to be of much use in this respect and for awhile i did not know what to get at that in my childish conception i thought would serve the great cause at last one day as i was helping mother to comb some wool an idea struck mei could knit stockings to keep the soldiers feet warm in winter time the next morning i was up with the sun and with a good large ball of yarn and plenty of stout steel needles i commenced my work and for weeks together from dawn to dark i sat and knitted and sang so enthusiastic in fact was i in my occupation that i was soon nicknamed the army stocking knitter time wore on and still i knitted and when in the winter of  general washington and his brave army were forced to retreat before the british to newark i was still as busily at work as ever at this time i was thirteen and i remember with vivid distinctness the sad and heartrending scenes i then witnessed the day the troops came into newark they marched down this very road and oh sir it was a pitiable sight the snow was deep and the weather piercing cold with a sleety rain falling many of the soldiers were half naked and without shoes or stockings while their hands were so frozen around the stocks and barrels of their muskets that they could not unclasp them yet all seemed to bear up heroically though they were so wearied and cold that they staggered about like drunken men general washington suffered equally with the humblest soldier in the army and endeavored to cheer the sinking heroes forward as the troops marched past he stood upon that large stone that you saw close to the top of the stairs leading down to our garden and spoke kindly and encouragingly to them while they in return brisked up and cheered him as lustily as they were able the sick and wounded he ordered to be carried down into our house until it was full the rest were sent on with the army after all had gone by he came down himself and remained nearly two hours looking to the comfort of his disabled men for whom we all did our best my main anxiety was to present each of them with a pair of my nice warm woolen stockings of which i had fifty pairs and i was delighted beyond description at the gladness with which my gifts were received unconscious of or rather not understanding the difference in rank of the commanderinchief i picked out the largest pair of stockings i had because of his great size and going to him timidly laid them on his lap as he sat talking with a wounded officer in a moment my mother seized me and with a sharp rebuke for my rudeness was about to remove me when she was restrained by general washington who placing his arm around me drew me to him and kissed me saying god bless you my dear little daughter are these for me picking up the stockings i answered shyly that they were and pointing to the rest told him he might have them also i will take them said he and give them to my sick soldiers and now i will give you this for yourself with these words he removed a little golden trinket from his watch guard and placed it in my hand then kneeling down with me close beside him he prayed long and earnestly he had scarcely finished when a horseman dashed up and the following moment entered and informed him that the british were in full pursuit with a hasty farewell he went out and mounting his horse galloped away after his little army soon after a detachment of the enemys dragoons came along and took possession of our cabin but suffered us and our wounded guests to remain unmolested the next time i saw washington was the day he entered trenton in triumph when with many more young ladies i strewed flowers in his path after that the revolution went on with varying success until the crowning victory at yorktown secured to the americans the fruit of their struggle when the army was disbanded father and robert returned safe and sound but james was killed in the battle at germantown and buried close by chews house years passed on and one by one those engaged in the war of independence dropped off washington and his estimable wife were gathered home my mother my father my two sisters and robert were laid in the tomb and at sixty years of age i found myself without a relation in the wide world i too now wished to be gone but waited patiently gods own time in my sixtyninth year i was decrepit nearly blind and my hair was as white as the snow in my seventieth year however a great change came over me i rapidly recovered my strength my white hair turned dark as you now see it and i put away my spectacles my eyesight becoming so strong that i can now easily read the smallest print for many many years it has been a source of wonderment to me why i have been so highly favored by providence but i see it now i have been thus permitted to live that as in my childhood beheld the birth struggle of the american republic i may before i am gathered home witness the great question proved that she is capable of ruling of conquering herself and sir i bless my maker that my eyes will be permitted to see the second grand struggle of america ended in a manner that will make her the first nation on the earth when this comes to pass i shall be ready to say now lord lettest thou thine handmaid die for my eyes have seen thy glory i pray night and morning for our brave volunteers and not only that but as i knitted stockings in my first childhood for washingtons army so in my second childhood i employ my time it knitting stockings for the army of the union and should death overtake me ere peace spreads her bright wings over our land he will find me knitting still knitting stockings for the volunteers a christmas dream by james t brady a christmas dream by james t brady illustrated by edward s hall new york printed by c a alvord  entered

you this little volume the sketch it contains was written some fourteen years ago when you were a clerk in my office and although it was published at the time in the new world then edited by our mutual friend park benjamin esq i did not suppose it would ever be presented in a more durable form but as you retained a copy took it with you on your various pilgrimages and during the christmas season read it to strangers even at the antipodes it seems to be yours more than mine and i thus bestow it upon you mr edward s hall has made the book valuable by the admirable illustrations with which he has adorned it and the friends for circulation amongst whom exclusively it is designed may possibly derive gratification from having this frail memorial of him who with affection and esteem subscribes himself yours ever james t brady new york march   a christmas dream a christmas dream chapter i not one cent but please sir we havent any bread at home not one cent i saybegone yet it was christmas eve and this sullen denial proceeded from one well provided with the worlds goods toward a ragged and barefooted girl who as she tramped over the cold pavement held out to the stonyhearted man a thin and tremulous hand yes it was christmas eve the anniversary of that holy hour when we are taught that he was born who turning aside from the great and the wealthy sought the friends of the humble and achieved his most divine labors for man in relieving the loathsome and degraded it was christmas eve and the heart of a girl which could have been made happy by the meanest coin that ever oppresses the rags of at beggar was by at cold denial of the pitiful boon sent cheerless out upon the wide seat of selfishness where if it should break in agony the event would no more attract the notice of the multitude amidst which it happened than the bursting of a bubble would disturb the ocean it was christmas eve and the streets were crowded with happy people who thronged about the various shops to provide a jolly dinner for the morrow or to purchase presents for young folks who were destined to dream all night of treasures more valuable and vast than those which were displayed at the magic mention of open sesame where the toys glittered in profusion the boys were gathered at the door wondering at the prices of what they were never to obtain and gratifying their spirits by wishes that were never to be realized in the windows of confectioners shops were exhibited the luscious and captivating preparations which were very likely soon to occasion busy employment for the family physician past all these the wretched girl wandered disconsolately wearying herself still with the inquiry why others should be so blessed with all the means of pleasure while she in the prime of her life knew little but sorrow and want she had not yet become acquainted with adam smiths wealth of nations nor investigated a report by the secretary of the treasury i had no time to pursue the person or fortunes of the girl she disappeared suddenly in the tide of human beings that swept on in sullen monotony even like the river which in its way to the ocean pauses not whether the flower the ripe fruit the decayed tree or the being full of life fall on its rapid waters my attention was arrested by the haggard features of a miserable chiffonier who with a sack over his shoulder and a hook in his hand was journeying homeward after a days vile labor in searching the kennels of the metropolis a fur cap drawn far down to his eyes left exposed a sharp brow under which were hidden cavernous eyes that seemed to shrink from the foul work to which they were subjected one would have thought while gazing on his   sunken cheeks stern mouth and projecting chin that no smile had even for one instant lighted his sombre countenance tenance and yet who knows that he had not hopeful and a happy youth in the pleasant land of france or the romantic home of the switzer it was hard to believe that the morose and melancholy wretch had ever been a child and nestled in the arms of a devoted mother while her fond eye shone upon his sweet slumber like the evening star upon the dusky earth but so it had been no doubt and possibly there were many who came at his birth to congratulate proud parents hopes for a familys honor had perhaps grown strong as he progressed toward boyhood he had haply been confided by a dying mother to the care of a merciful heaven and sent out upon the world to seek his fortune with the cheering encouragement of interested friends to think that the child which fresh from heaven would have received the blessing of the redeemer if it had lived in the period of his benevolent mission should thus be converted into a begrimed and wrinkled wretch obtaining the means of existence from the very refuse of poverty the world has more justice than we believe remarked at this moment a gentleman passing me to the friend at his side and i knew from the speakers look and manner that the way of his life had been one of ease and success and that he knew no more of the fierce passions and dreadful wrongs that often convulse mens frames than the little rivulet making its way century after century through the solemn stillness of a primeval forest knows of the tempests that sweep the ocean in the wildest nights a carriage passed methe highmettled horses attached to which were controlled in their graceful and spirited movements by a pompous coachman who held   the reins delicately on the fingers of his white gloves while behind a footman in lace and frippery looked over the top of the vehicle as if in constant expectation that an acquaintance would come flying over the heads of the horses inside was the same churl who had refused the girl one copper and it was plain that he had forgotten forever except perhaps as the theme of an inflated discourse about increasing pauperism what i could not but remember as a striking illustration of those disparities which while they must ever exist in life can never fail to excite the regrets of all who wish that there could be less of suffering on earth and more of real pleasure a terrible shriek arose from the pavement and i saw the wheel of the churls carriage pass over the leg of an unfortunate girl the carriage stopped for a moment the driver coolly inquired if any body were hurt the crowd who had immediately assembled told him to drive on and i pushed toward the injured girl just in time to see that it was she who had but a few minutes before elicited my sympathies and that the coarse man who was holding her in his arms and exclaiming in french my daughter my poor daughter was the scavenger whose dismal face i had just encountered even at the moment when the poor girl was borne into a druggists shop and while the crowd stood gazing in a boy racing past exclaimed as if the world depended on his lungs i wish you a merry christmas and a happy new year the crowd melted away from the apothecarys door the shuffle of the multitude went on in its old monotony the curses and shouts of omnibus drivers were heard above the clatter of myriad wheels rattling over the cobble stones and i wended my way homeward resolved that i would on the morrow search for the unfortunate girl and see what might be done to relieve her but the sounds of music issuing from a fashionable restaurant attracted my attention and i went in we all know what a restaurant is in new york now with what elegance and costliness if not taste most spacious salons  manger have been arranged where mirrors and polished white columns ornamented with gold and gay curtains with glittering loops and cushioned seats invite to apician suppers with which the most fastidious palate must be gratified i hid myself in one of the boxes and modestly ordered some ale and a cigar resolved to let the music which had lured me from my homeward path harmonize with the thoughts which arose out of the strange episode in my life which had occurred from the accident to the girl and the circumstances which preceded it well it has ever been so and it must be so until the end of time poets and orators have complained that suffering too often attends the lives of those who deprived of the means to make woe endurable linger through a painful existence to a wretched end and this should stimulate the faith and the hope of the skeptic in his heaviest and most cheerless despondency it cannot be that the almighty will not at some time and in his own inscrutable manner equalize the disparities at which in this life we revolt his omnisciencewhich seeing through all the disguises of a corrupt nature beholds the lecher in the priest and the virgin spirit in the unfortunate harlot he who knows how favorably the conscience that has yielded to strong temptations compares with that which never felt the necessity of resisting one dishonest impulse he who beholds the injustice by which trembling innocence suffers at the bar where bloated arrogance presides sides he who has his quick ear ready to catch the dying murmur of the poor outcast reluctant even in the last agony to let the world that has rejected him know how he feels its tyranny he in short who knows the truth and the right and can exhume them though centuries of falsehood and wrong be piled above has some great temple ready where under his own infallible guidance that which was unjust on earth shall be remedied and those who suffered injustice shall be redressed all this while the four musicians performed a sweet german melody full of home and its associations a touching strain which convinced me that music derives its power from harmonizing with those unuttered thoughts of our deepest nature for which mere language is inadequate yes and it is but just there should be a heaven in which those silent and unrevealed aspirations of the spirit which can never be satisfied here and at which the world scoff may find the pleasure for which they long the ale was heavy withal and my eyes drooped under its unpoetical influence so i left the lights the germans and the music and would have made my way homeward had i not been arrested at the doorstep by at withered old man very like the poor scavenger but a little more neatly attired who had a sack over his shoulder and seemed hurried for time as he expressed a wish to have some conversation with me we passed back to the seat i had just left and amidst the music the clatter and the smoke took seats and commenced gazing at each other with silent but absorbing interest chapter ii my vis  vis was decidedly a strange character it was difficult to detect the exact expression of his countenance for it varied continually laying upon the table the sack i have mentioned and opening it he proceeded with a very grave air to produce a number of volumes and arrange them with studious care you will be surprised sir he remarked when i tell you who i am nothing can astonish me much in these days of magnetic telegraphs but this is probably said he the first time that you have had actual conversation with one who does not belong to this world and is merely an agent of an absent monarch to collect for him the trophies which increase with each succeeding moment i began to think my companion a madman and the conviction was strengthened when he proceeded to say yes that monarch is the past an unrelenting and unyielding tyrant who never returns the lightest trifle that ever comes within his grasp and you i remarked appear to be his confidential clerk or travelling agent it is my duty said the mysterious stranger to collect during the brief period assigned for my labor such mementos of his power as this earth may afford and when i shall have laid them at his feet i too will become one of his victims and his monuments and be denied the privilege of ever visiting this earth again and what is your name i inquired alas exclaimed the stranger i am the passing year and although visible to you at this moment have usually neither a local habitation nor a name amongst mankind i perceive that you are on the border line of lifethat boundary between manhood and old age at which the affections and feelings linger the mind still looking backward to the scenes in which it knew the sweetest delights while the flesh growing weaker at every step journeys toward eternity in these volumes i have the record of what man has achieved during the time of my pilgrimageof the wrongs and virtues that have disfigured or adorned his career it is a strange history of hopes that are blighted friendships estranged promises violated faith disregarded right trodden in the dust wrong elevated to the highest places merit spurned by the foot of presumption and virtue checked and insulted by vice in her flagrant and infamous career observe   the comparative size of these volumes here holding up a book not larger than a childs primer is the record of virtuous resolutions kept what huge quarto enrolls those that were violated the bad preponderates ponderates over the good through all these volumes in the same proportion ah sir mine has been an unpleasant duty i was ushered into office amidst the wild shouts of the multitude hailing my approach as if i were to bless them all with a profusion of heavens choicest gifts alas many who shouted deliriously at my advent are now low in the dust and have been compelled to look on powerless while death laid his icy hand upon some of the most generous hearts that ever thrilled within mortal bosom i could tell you of one who seemed born to show how much that was immortal and noble could dwell within the precincts of a human frame from childhoods earliest prime to the moment when far from friends and kindred he breathed out his spirit to heaven there was no time when he stood in the path of any fellowcreature or when there existed one wretch to whom his departure could afford a thrill of fiendish satisfaction his heart was open to generous influences as his countenance to the benign expressions which beaming from every feature cheered his troops of friends there was no impulse of his soul no word on his lip no pressure in his hand that had ever felt the influence of hypocrisy and in the prime of his manhood you might read his nature as easily as that of a child having nothing to conceal he wondered that men were surprised at the frankness which was part of his nature and he could not understand why in association with his fellows there could be a feeling called reserve there were many very many places where without his ever knowing of his importance the appearance of this benevolent and kindly being was hailed as the sufferer hails the ruddy dawn and when he was striving to cheer the heavy hours of those who seemed to need his sympathy how many hearts were eager to yield him the same solace full of boyish innocence he yet plumed himself upon the ripe experience and practical wisdom of the man assuming for the while to give himself the weight that age and trial demand an appearance of austerity which could but for a moment abide upon him and which only served to amuse like a grotesque mask concealing the features of a smiling face in all that was generous unselfish and warmhearted he was to most of his fellows the wonder as well as idol and there lives not one being who ever sought the influence of his kindly spirit and went away dissatisfied men wondered that he did not yearn for fame and yet detecting himself in such a desire he would have banished the thought at once as involving a wish to elevate himself above those whom he loved he would rather have the thanks of a beggar than the throne of csar but he has gone down into the grave even when his friends strained the insight of their hearts for his coming and delighted in the expectation   that they must soon behold one who never grasped the hand of his fellow from any but a brothers feeling he has gone from no more apparent necessity than dies the bird which during the sunny season poured out its melodious song from the leafy spray and has since uttered its last note in the wild wood he has gone and all who knew him regret his departure and feel that it is a greater trial to remain here now that he is no more than even to venture on the unknown world in quest of him and the hearty greeting he knew how to give if you ever feel a doubt that the beautiful and good exist hereafter think of such a character as i have here described and ask yourself if there can be one reason why such a being having existed should ever utterly perish but i weary you with these saddening thoughts it is the christmas eve come forth with me into the air and i will reveal to you what no mortal eye hath seen before i will show you in your own history how is connected by a mysterious influence the christmas of the present with the christmas of the past chapter iii there is an elmtree in the park near chatham street which in the golden prime of my boyhood was the rendezvous at which after school hours and during holidays we so often assembled thence to set out on many a cheerful adventure in quest of fun the merry group which clustered there so often comes to my memory with the same distinctness as if by some magic influence i were carried backward over the intervening period to those happy schoolboy days once more i well remember that glorious period during which unlike almost all my companions i did not lose the enjoyment of present happiness in the strange ambition to be a man all my wants were then provided for by those whom it has been my lot to see laid in the dust oh how at the hour when school was dismissed we scampered off as wild caprice suggested making the street resound with jocund shouts and engaging in the various sports which youth so ingeniously niously devises there was an ogre too in those daysthe keeper of the parka mild and worthy man in his ordinary mood no doubt but with a nose that blushed scarlet over the transgressions of his lips we gave him the title of rumnose which perhaps was more just than elegant and it was our great delight to annoy the poor fellow leading him into useless chases up and down the steps of the city hall and through its entries over its vestibule and even into the courtrooms where justice is said to be administered christmas eve was a great time then and was seen from afar we commenced discussing its advent and the delights it would bring from the last holiday that preceded it and even now when in the maturity of life we find christmas at hand and feel no excitement of preparation we wonder why we miss the feverish expectation with which it was once awaited forgetting how few cares we had then to disturb the darling anticipation of the heart how delightful then became the home from which we had so often stolen out at nights in defiance of parental authority and to the imminent danger of our persons there was such a busy note of preparation about the house such mysterious terious deposits of turkeys and quarters of mutton in the hall such strange developments of baskets only equalled by the banquets that come from the earth in pantomimes and such a profusion of fruit and confections actually left within our reach without even a prohibition to touch them who can even forget the smell of his christmas home there is the christmas table of your youth said my companion and lo i had become a boy again the dinner table was surrounded by the family once more there was not even one absent he by whose kind paternal side we grew toward manhood occupied the head of the table his hair slightly dashed with gray his face radiant with a cheerful smile and his proud glance directed around the abundant board to those on whom his hopes and pride now centred and there was too my mothershe of whom the recollection now that she has been some years laid in her narrow place of rest is like a mingled sense of pleasure and duty each ever present and each in turn growing stronger than its kindred feelingshe to whom in my earliest sufferings i breathed my secret complaints with the sublime confidence fidence that they were as safe as they could be in heavenshe whose ready ear caught up every syllable in which i told of any wrong her son had suffered or honor he had attained however evanescentshe whose large heart peopled by her children seemed yet capacious enough to nurture all the afflicted of the human raceshe whose face now in the greatest anguish of manhood comes like an angel from god to my spiritual sense and whispers in language which the soul only can hear that there will be a season of relief and of happinessshe the dearly beloved idol of my whole nature whose hand still seems to have smoothed my pillow when i lie down for rest on earth whose presence shall be felt in each thrill of my latest breathings at the solemn hour of death and who i know will be the first to meet me if we be restored to each other by the benign mercy of a benevolent god there too about that table were all my brothers and sisters all were in perfect health and all happy such eating drinking laughing singing and after the dinner such dancing tumbling and playing at blindmans buff the scene went swimming before me and in an instant the whole of a past life was disclosed the christmas of manhood said my companion the same table with no diminished store of what may yield the body pleasure but oh how much narrowed the happy circle which once gathered there at the happy christmas season he was gone the pillar and the prop of all gone in the maturity of life but before the frosts of age had been laid too deep on the generous impulses that burned in his magnanimous nature she too had departed at whose decease it seemed so unwise that any should be permitted to remain and in the absence of whom the rose seemed to have lost its fragrance and the very stars their glory a sister too whose graceful form moved like a thing of light and pleasure through the household gladdening wherever it cameher chair also was vacant and now that i observe i more closely i miss the face of him whose features seemed to flash from them in combined light all of good and pleasant that existed in all the family beside death alas had stepped in and thinned that little band and the members of the circle once so extended now drew closer and closer together because of the breaches that had been made in their ranks to sustain each other until at the command of him who gives and takes away the last link of the chain shall i trust be reunited with that from which it was wrested when the first of our dear ones perished my time is drawing near to its close said the passing year and i have but one more scene to show you there was the parlor of our home the fire that i had expected to see burning cheerfully when i returned had a dim look and strange to say four figures sat around it holding correspondence with each other with looks that indicated conversation but were unattended with any sounds how can i describe the pleasure that pervaded each pulse of my frame when i recognized the dear departed members of our family enjoying as they were wont to do in life the comforts of that home which their presence bad so often made happy how ecstatic would my joy have been could i have embraced them all but the hand of my attendant was laid upon me and i could but gaze upon i my heavenly visitors rapt in wonder and delight they have been waiting for you to come home said he and will not quit the house until you are secure in slumber look i gazed with astonishment while my dear lost ones ascended to the rooms where our family repose and saw each of them stoop over those who were sleeping to kiss the slumberers cheek then all stood around the bed and elevated their eyes with their prayers to our maker then they returned to the fire and seated themselves once more and there came back to my delighted spirit such sensitive recollection of all they had done for me and of what i had omitted that might have made their lives more happy that i could have fallen on my knees before them and besought the forgiveness of each but i was restrained by my companion and it was not until i had laid myself down to rest for the night that the beloved faces visited my couch also and lingered over my pillow with looks of undying love then i heard the prayers for my prosperity mingled with sounds of sweetest melody which seemed to combine expression of all the memories that followed my steps from childhood to the present hour the benign faces of the dear ones disappeared but my old companion stood beside my bed and laying his hand upon mine said in a voice whose every tone still lingers in my memory you have seen tonight the appeal of suffering spurned by the heartlessness of bloated avarice you have seen what would be the rank injustice of a world controlled by blind chance where if the afflicted child were crushed beneath the wheel of the miser there could be no redress for the one nor punishment for the other you have been assured by visions that those whom you loved above all others on earth still follow and are with you and watch over you when slumber is sweetest these have not been the visions of a waking sense but mysterious revelations from your heart teaching the sublime lesson that the influence which any beloved object once gained over your nature will survive the decease of the object itself and if you do but cherish it a little will be as a fragrance shed upon your soul to make it pure forever wake on the morrow and conduct your life as if it had been disclosed to you that they whose good opinion you so respected while they lived are still near to the dear ones whom they nurtured and for whose prosperity they were ready even to lay down life the ancients had their household godsthe work of mortal hands and only sanctioned by the sincerity of superstitionwhile you through the blessing of heaven enjoy the omnipresent care of the great creator and have as gods of the household the memories of departed loved ones to be reunited with whom should be the aim and end of your whole existence ponder this well and feel the solemn truth which it was my mission to disclose that in the midst of happiest life and when the thoughts of death are furthest from your heart there may be close beside you eager with care lest you should by some false step be lost from the path that may lead you to their arms those for whose presence in another world you should pray most fervently to your maker i know not how my mysterious visitor departed nor where but he made my christmas more cheerful than it would have been but for his teachings i communicate the lesson he imparted to me with the hope that even with as much pleasure as descends upon one ray of sunshine into the prisoners cell it may fall on the heart of those who have recently suffered a domestic affliction there must be many who at this festive season will be compelled to steal away from the pleasures of general hospitality and who will spend the hours that were in happier times devoted to heartfelt pleasure in the society of the dead and not of the living to these even my words may be like the raindrops on the parched earth and i would say to them that it may perhaps occasion anguish to those they love and have lost to see them indulging sorrow that is useless although grateful and that they should rather spend in mild pleasure the hours of that holiest season when he came to bless the earth through whom we are taught that the dead and the living may meet and be happy again oddfellowship exposed price oddfellowshp exposed   cling to

fast horses and stray women entirely alone in short he should swear off everything that does not enhance the joy of the do mestic circle this settles a man some what this gives a man a chance to think after a year or two if a man isnt extra honest he will begin to have new ideas ideas of worlds outside of hisow  that was my case exactly mrs baxter held her owh pretty well and although i had no hankerings after the fleshpots of egypt yet i somehow felt it my duty to find some rational excuse for being absent   from home now and then of an evening not that i loved lucy kate a whit less than before butwell i wasnt home sick so much as i should have been but you see i wanted to be honest all the while in whatever way matters shaped themselves i desired to be square and to give mrs b no grounds for com plaint i knew she would never suspect me of wrong she knew how docile i had become ons night i proposed to her that i should join the masons and then she could take the eastern star degree i showed her what a splendid thing it would be if she should happen to become a widow or fatherless the proposition frightened my poor  wife so that her back hair fell down and she appeared to be dissolving generally you see she had read bricktops expose of that order and so she appealed to me to abandon the ideanay she commanded me to put it away then we went to bed and she told me all the terrible things that those awful masons had done to her dear first husband although she had only recently found it out his hair never grew out again she said they raised him by his nose and it was always out of joint afterwards the bumps and bruises stuck by him for six months and what was worse they burned him so that he couldnt sit down to his meals and was obliged to take them lay ing down or standing up for as much as three months afterwards and all this before they had been married scarcely a year           i as she contended that it had hastened her first husbands death i took sudden disike to the order and promised to have nothing whatever to do with it then she sobbed like a glad chickabiddy and nestkd down to snore but my mind was fully made up to join something if it wasnt anything more than a meetinghouse or a reform organization there must be found some reasonable ex cuse for being out a night or two each week i skirmished around the society for the prevention of cruelty to aiimals for a whileand tried to have them take me in and make me a member of that organiza tion but because i wouldnt agree to chloroform every oyster i swallowed and file my canarybirds teeth at least once per month they voted me ineligible on account of having so tough a heart then i tried to join the knights of st   crispin but they wouldnt have me be cause i wasnt a shoemaker and couldnt prove beyond a doubt that any of niy an cestors weae cobblers the fact of my brotherinlaxw being able to concoct a good article of sherrycobbler would not go down with them although undoubt edly the concoction would have done so then i tried the knights of st peate rick but they rejected me because i wasnt an irishman and had never dabbled in politics after these and numerous other trials it began to be known around that i was anxious to join something and then i re ceived invitations by the dozenanother proof of what advertising will do a friend of mine by the name of podger came tosee me one day and asked me if i wouldnt like to join the oddfellows i asked him what inducements he could  hold out for you see i was in demand now and could afford to be a trifle partic ular he replied as for inducements i can hardly tell you what how often do you meet once every week but being a married man you can easily make it two or three nights a week to your wife by telling about committee meetings charity visits etc do you understand he asked winking quietly i think i do said i so far so wood now what are the requirements oh a triflefor initiation and a trifle every week in the shape of dues but if you ever conclude that you would like to get even with the lodge you can play sick for a few weeks and receive charity no thank you guess it wouldnt pay but how long does a man have to lay abed h   or remain in the hospital afteral eing ini tiated there you lalor under a mistake odd fellowship is freemasonry toned down di vested of its rough and trying features why bless

conveyed to them just see how honest i was i resolved at once to make a confidant of my wife and tell her all about it just the moment we met i also made confidants of several of my friends on the boat and we had two or three bottes of wine on the strength f it no sooner had the cars slackened their speed and arrived within a reasonable distance than i leaped to the ground and after pinwheeling it for a moment i picked myself up and started for the hotel where my loving wife and wellfathered children awaited me lucy kate said i rushing up to where she stood on the piazza eureka what she asked in wonder eurekai again exclaimed champagne i guess quietly remarked lucy kate no no my love come upstairs and i will tell you all about it we retired to the privacy of our own parlor where i unbosomed myself without loss of time why eli baxter do you really mean it she asked after hearing me through yes in less than a month your adored husband the d will be an oddfellow i replied proudly

pickle that i ate during the eveningi somehow had an attack of unreliability what transpired after i had piloted my sable attendants to the   room i have but little recollectio  or but i was found the next morning i was found by an artista friend of minewhom my anxious wife had engaged to hunt me up he interviewed the night hands and by that means found my room the door was not locked and as he push ed it open the situati n struck him so forcibly that he made a sketch of it which is reproduced andc presented in this cdn nection   i am always very particular about my clothes always placing them care fully upon a chair near my bed but on this occasion owing to the effect of that pickle on my functions i had made a mistake and reversed the order of things placing my coat and vest carefully in bed and hanging myself over the back of the chair i have been laugh c at a great deal since then on ac count of that little   mistake and my friends always look in credulous when i try to explain the effect that the long branch pickle had onme however the next day i returned to new york and was joined by myyfamily in the course of a few days licy kate would give me no rest until i took out that policy on my life and as i wished in allways to increase her love for me i hu mored her with getting insured   but the allimportant event was at hand i had been proposed balloted for and elected to become a member of the great order of oddfellows i was about to go through the gentle forms and pleasing ceremonies which distinguish it from free masonry my friend podger who had taken such an active part in getting me under way called for me at my residence i told my wife as i parted from her on that longto   beremembered oc casion that neither of us realized how much we owed pod

baxter hides hself in hs clotiies again of that call the grand surgeon and see what he says they agreed whatthe deuce did it meansick i never felt better in the whole course of my life  however they took me into another room where several dignifiedlooking men were seated as though in ordinary conver sation the grand surgeon was appealed to and after looking at me a moment he asked to feel of my pulse i handed over my wrist and he fingered it while the others gathered around in evident solici tude lets see your tongue said the grand surgeon i slipped it out for inspection you are a sick man sir  you will have to be put to bedand submit to a course of treatment before we initiate you iivsh to see if there is anything chronic  about you for none but sound healthy men are admitted into the benefits of our order i protested that i was well but that did not appear to make any impression with them they had voted me sick and that settled it they took me into anothei room where there was a bed and after un dressing they put me to bed with great care and attention then several doctors gathered around and after holding a consultation they be gan to give me medicine this i did not object to so much for it tasted very much like a good article of brandy toned up with peppermint then they watched the effect with much anxiety for several min utesthe grand surgeon seated on the side of the bed with my wrist in one hand and his watch in the other ah it worksit works i they all ex claimed after a few moments   i thought i felt it although i couldnt see where the  sick came in exactly what was this all about was it a part of the initiation and had i begun those harmless forms without knowing it this was the most reasonable conclusion and so i kept quietand resolved to take it as it came yes he is cured the olamueshumki has restored him and at the same time it shows us that he has nothing about his system that prevents him from becoming an oddfellow said the grand surgeon get up and dress yourself he continued without loss of time i went into a box like closet where my clothes were hanging and hurried myself into them after which i was again conducted into the anteroom well how do you feel now asked podger why firstrate between you and i podger i think them fellows were mis taken oh no you looked bad frightful put in another anybody could have seen that you were not well now brothers let us retire to the lodgeroom and open the lodge said an old fellow with a nose as red as a roosters comb this gentleman we will leave in the hands of a committee who will at once begin his instruction preparltory to ii tiation  with this the crowd who had assembled in the room withdrew and left me alone with a pair of solemn old mules who im mediately drew down their faces and be gan to look as though they were about to make a funeral of me you have heard the orders of the nabob grand said one of them and which the other immediately repeated oh is that the nabob grandi asked   yes

even to stug gling when the good of the order require itbinding myself under no less an obli gation than to have my wife eloped with my motherinlaw become a member of my family my bodily sufferings to

 yes i take it all in go ahead slowly they stumble who run fast now the first duty that we impose upon you or rather the first lesson that we give you is reflectionthe great governor leveler and modifier of the world the checkrein of greatness  and the sheet anchor of society said the other old roodiri taking a hand in trder that your reflections may not in   way be disturbedthat you may ha  una oen view over the past and pi em son a  ilimpses of the futurewe i plrace gyu in a room alone by yourself tiayou maythere commune with your i say old man no jokei asked pull gown the lid of my east eye  if stranger wittin our gates we never jokei replied the most solemn rooster of the two but do you pretend to tell me that i am in the process of being made an odd fellow   you most assuredly are its the oddest way of getting at a thing that i ever experienced but i sup pose its all right t you will find it so and you will allow us to volunteer a word or two of recom mendation at tiis stage of the affair take whtver comes and ask no questions it will be much the best for you that is all right much obliged but just at this point allow me to ask you one question more am i to be put through all of the degrees tonight no but we will make you eligible for them all before you get through oh you propose to get meinto  suitable condition that isget up an ap petite so that i can order whatever i have the money to pay for hereafter ehl   but henceforth i am dumb b lead me on to the sacrifice my two conductors exchanged glances and then they motioned me to follow   mt baxter id placed in a private btm wher ie  told to reflect on the past and pbesent   yes that is about how it is although you do not put it in the regular form well that may convince you that i am something of an oddfellow already   them this i did without any re uctancv so firmly convinced had i become that they had only a light charge in store for me they led the way to a small anteroom   furnished somewhat oddly at one side stood a round table upon w ch there was a large bowl a glass stood b the side ofit and achair was placed invitingly thefront   what is before you we will come for you anon with this they withdrew and closed the door leaving me alone i glanced around   mr baxter dresses hmself for tiie lodgeroom and suvey hise lf with pleasure a       i   be seated in taat chair and give way to reflection  remember all your former hardness of heart see the ways wherein you have erred and contemplate i   it was not a bad place to lbe in by any manner of means i looked to see what that huge bowl contained it was abot halffull of a palered liquid upon the su  face of which floated several slices of lemon and orange a ladle was placed handily by and glancingaround tomake sure that i was really alone i dipped out alit o f it into the glass and tasted it an involuntary smack of my lips fol lowed it was a very fair article of punch i seated myself at the table and began to reflect was this placed here for a snare did they think to test my stability aginst temptation and were ees watching me fromn sme unseen hole i pondered did they not tell me to contemplate what was before a  to be sure they diai d in what way could i do it so effet i  by tasting it at all evenriristoed to place such an interpreltiofn uiiot their recommendation and so helped myself to nother glass of the punch by jingoes thought i this isnt a bad commencement i believe this is just the kind of an order i have always been look ing forp eh on the start what would they giveme to contemplate before i got throughl  i dipped out still another glass i fact i dippedin like a veteran you see this was no initiation to me so far for i had been through with it many times before i believed what podger had told me about invalids going through with the initiation several times in succession for the benefit of their health a just as iwas getting right down to the contemplation of the fourth glass the door opened and in stepped the two brothers who had me in charge have you meditated yes that is i got pretty well to go ing whenyou came in have you contemplated   on every thing  yes on everything before me and i   must say that it isnt bad i replied smacking my lips tis well now you mustprepar togo into the presence of the nabob grand and the lodge i am ready place your hat upon your read and this sash over your neck i did precisely as requested now come this way and contemplate yourself i followed into still another small room which was furnished quite scrumptiously a large mirror enabled me to see myself about as tief others saw me but they could not fel as i felt unless they had a had some of that punch to  contemplate a huge sash it was that encircled my neck and reached nearly to my knees and i fancied as i glanced at my reflection that they didntofton get a betterlooking victim than i was but my reflections were cut short by the guides who took me by either hand and conducted me into the lodgeroom the sight was novel to me for an odder looking lot of mortals i never beheld before no two of themn  were dressed alike the majority of them wore the most hor riblelooking masks that were ever made while their bodies were covered with tights spangles bhlts and notched jackets a few were still in citizens clothes but nearly all wera masked beyond recognition es pecially was this the case with the officers and like the indians they seemed to in dulge in hidiousness inproportion to their rank at one end of the room sat the nabob grand with a nose fully a foot in length upon which rested a pair ofeye gasees about three inches in diameter his head    was ornamented with a close fitting cap to which were attached a pair of fiendish looking wings the vicious grand was only a trifle less devilish looking and so on down to the lowest officer who stood ready to take partiin the exercises i i glanced around the room and from the amount of machinery which i saw i began to think that the course of sprouts in store for me wasnt quite so mild after all possibly the punch that they had allowed me to meditate upon was to brace me up for what was to follow       i confess that the idea made some im pression on the cords of my legs and took every thing kittenish out of ihe but i was in for it and so i reached down deep for my best courtae and  sticking point to hang it upon  th   d me straight up before the nabob tr  w  ho looked at me very much as a  o d look on a mouse  what barbarian havt  ou here broth ers he asked in a deep sepulchral voice one whom the lodge has elected to become acquainted with our mysteries they replied       is hle ready and has he good nerves   he is ready aud has contemplated tis well stand him on hishead  before i was aware of itur burly ruffians seized and inverted me while my conductors sloped and left me to their mercy this didnt look very playful do you swear to preserve secrecy until  after death i do i replied and to be charitable even with your last shilling i do starid him up again this order being obeyed i was once more placed upon my feet although i had   almost too much to do to pull my head out of my hat into w hich it had been driven        peel him and prepare the chemicl bath that we may brinto light his many hidden sis cried the nabob fancy how such an order must have affected my nerves the idea of being stripped before the whole crowd was bad enough in all conscience but to have all my hid  sin shrought out was too much too inch        but it didnt appear to be too much for them and so at mejhey went and in less tite than it takes me to write it they had me as naked as when i came into the world in the meantime f long bench supported on trucks was rl lea into the middle of the room and everybody was hurrying hither and yon each preparing something for my vspecial benefit goodness this looked like mild treat mentgood for invalids  confound that podger  if i could only get at him now how i would exercise my muscle on him i well there i was and no mistake when every thing was in position they placed me face down upon this bench or tableand fastened me securely during which time i heard the clip of shears and got into an awful perspiration on accouit of it what were they doing i soon learned they had cut out a piece of parchment whose outlines corre sponded with the gure of a man then they bqgan to pur something warm and bitingupon  person from a watering pot uri j   h the nabob stood at my head holding a bottle of something dread fully pungent and asked me every now and then if i felt very charitable and like shellipaiut for the good of the order i      r i e       tolaco hiaritable i feltyoul bet  sf  er they had wet me down fwe i he  t  t his parchmentoverlme goq  eii

taking a fansfer of your hidden sins and shortcomings keep perfectly quiet thatmwnmayget a good impression o oord wasnt it awful ave you got them all out asked the nabob  yes here they are replied my tor mentors peeling the parchment from my body  you have been put through our chem ical bath which causes the principal sins of your life to appear upon your skin in black ink and by placing this parchment ipon them and pressing as we have done we are enabled to transfer them to it we thent wash your body and all traces dis appear save what we have obtained upon theparchment which we lock in the secret archives for future reference and if a brother gets to talking too loud about his good qualities we hold it up before him that he may read by this time i had been washed and sponged off and allowed to take a recum bent position they bought the man shaped parchment forward for my inspec tion while somebody threw a blanket over my shivering frame i gazed wonder ingly upon the documentfor

tion ibiis being complied with i began to get into my clothes while this oqld fellows drawingroom car as they called it was rolled out of the way and all hands were busy putting up something else i say nabob would it be irregular for me to contemplate again i feel awful shivery said t at his command i was taken to the contemplating room where i finished dressing and warmed up a bit it was awful the way they had gone on with me and i felt sore about it i looked sharply to see if i could see podger but the rascal was hidden behind a mask and i couldnt tell him from a sideo f sole leather isnt this a trifle roughi asked of one of the brothers who came up to contemplate   no said ie sipping the punch i call it quite smooth        i miean this initiation well i dont lmow we always com mence with the mildest things first so that the candidates may get used to it before we come down hardest he replied draining his glass and vanishing from the room good heavens commence with their mildestdo they  where is that pod geri muttered while trying to either get my courage up or to find a place to get well out of the place two masked devils seized and hur ried me upstairs opening a door which led into a small room i found eight or ten people there who like myself appeared to be neophytes undergoing the same otirse of sprouts that i was sweltering through closing the door behind they looked it and opened another which led into adark inclined viaduct where the deuce it led to was a mystery i suggested to several of those who appeared to be my com pagnons de voyage that we revolt and re fuse to be taken in any further than we were already but they hissed at the prop osition and cried onward to the last all right my lifewas well insured and i had just as lief go onward to the devil if the rest were going so i entered the tunnel with them what followed is better shown in the illustration than it can be portrayed by words we groped our way along and at last came to the mouth of it and found ourselves astride of a greased plank along which we slid in a very uncertain state until at last we arrived at what appeared to be the bottomless pit the devil stood at the mouth of it with a brake in one hand ready to let us all in if it so pleased him   strangers you have arrived at the mouth of the bottomless pit a movement of my hand will precipitate you all beyond the regions of hope and to avoid such a fate you must raise me one hundred dol lars between you various were the movements and expres sons amoing my fellowvictims but by some unaccountable coincidence they had all left their money at home and were competely deadbroke there wasnt a six pence among the whole lot but rather than have such a fate befall them i con cluded to bleed for the party and going down into my breeches i produced the change and his satasic majesty lifted us safely from our awkward position and transfeirus to still another room frowktplace i was taken alone and again i    to the lodgeroom i be gan torsee those other chps were only blind decoyduck to kep me agoing  being taken once more befe the nabob grand that functionary open conversa tion has he escaped the bottomless pit he has replied the conductor he saved himself and his fellowtravelers who passed through the viaduct of despair by paying the ransom demanded by the father of evil which his fellows could riot pay  tis well let i it be recorded in the seventh book among the nobles and dis tinguished that this brother in twe hour of extreme peril saved not only his own mut ton but the bacon of his fellowtravelers a smart blow upon a large gong brought my hair to a stand and made me think of more than they had brought out upon the parchment this halfgown clap of thunder always occurs whenever they open the covers of the great seventhbook mr baxter do you  still feel char itable  yes buit you have cleaned me out will you give us your check for the benefit of ourwidows and orphans i        s   other score i think i

if they had asked for it on any   now sir it has long been a custom among oddfellows to strip themselves to the very hide in the name of charity are you willing still further to show how ortlhy you are of becoming a great and   glorious oddfellow asked the nabob grand       i dare do all becoming the noblest of them i replied hark brothers he is made of good material and has lots of the right

a hack at him said the nabob motioning me away in the direction of his assistant the conductor put me rightaboutface and trotted me over to the other end of   the room where the secondary devil sat enthroned mr baxter how are your teeth he asked peremptorily oh they do very well for ordinary grinding i replied how is your general health pretty fair    are you happily married about as well as they will aver   have you accustomed your wife to your being out nights    i never have had much  xperience out since marriage are you willing to so accustom her for the good of the order i will try he will play it on his wife like a good oddfellow shouted the officer and it was repeated by the others one after   ma baxter as iie appeared wien takes from the purifioationtanim anothers and as a finishing touch some body again kicked that infernal gong if urio rder was at war with musons or the knights of pythias would you like atrue undlyal oddfellow liein ambush and steal into the camp of the enemy for the good oftheeorder i most assuredly would i replied proudly hark brothers he would le and eteal for the good of the order t this was repeated as before and finished off with the gong after which the entire crowd shouted in concert bully for baxter thus far you have proven satisfactory go on in your bold and hightoned career and you will come out all right pass on fromrhere i was taken to an anteroom what a lot of anterooms they did have to be sure furaished somewhat sump tuously and hung with tapestry you will please disrobe said my at tendant which was my meek inquiry peel you will then dress in this cos tumet he added pointing to a pile of duds which lay upon a chair i hesitated and glanced around on the table there was a mask shaped like the head of a jackass i wondered if i had got to appear in that in short i was slightly fiustrated and a great deal put about over what i had thus far endured but concluding that what man has done man may do i began to peel off my toggery when i had stripped to the inner skin he handed me a pair of short breeches and i drew myself into them then i placed a pair of sandals oi my no  feet ater which a red pointjjaket and a cloak protected my upper works   now then i will leave you to the oddfellows angel said my attendant moving toward the door  the whichi asked     behold he said pointing to an oppo site door while he vanished from another i glanced in the direction indicated the figure of a most beautiful woman dressed like i fairy followed by a poodle dog and a cat was approaching me good ness gracious how my heart went was she about to impart the finishing touches to my initiation whew now isnt this jolly i said to myself as i comprehended tie fact that we were in a room alone together she was indeed an angel and under the circumstahcesi could iot doubt but that she was a gernuine oddfellows angel i chuckled over thedelightful turn that affairs had taken and could now under stand why invalids went through with the initiation ceremonies fr their health i mentally resolved to take it in at least once per week as long as i lived she approached or it seemed to me that she floated toward me i held my breath and tried to look happy mortal will you promise  she asked in a silvery tone promisewhy i will swear to any thing you require of me better still you have sworn to be charitable will you make good your words by giving me your clothes and all that you have of value about you for the benefit of the poor  take everythingtake mei ex claimed i will for all good oddfellows be long to me oh you

satiricallys wouldnt i though      f beware you have one at home in her eyes you look like the epitome of good ness behold how you look in the eyes of outside angels she said placing the jack asss head over my face and turning me around to a mirror  strange how sheepish a man feels when he sees himself resembling a jackass i felt sorry for what i had said but she fastened the mask upon my head and placed something over my right hand that resembled an asss forehoof why decorate me thus sweet angel  i asked with timid sweetness that others may know what i found you to be she replied calmly rather anl odd disguise arnt it  well i have found you to be an odd fellow and you think this makes us even it will assist heretake this thistle in your left hand and await events she said handing me the prickly bouquei at the same time stamping upon te floor with her pretty foot the door opened and my attendant ap peared  present him before the brothers that they may see the seal that i have set upon him adieu saying which she touched my mask with her wand while her poodle dog yipped and the cat purred good naturedly against my leg turning away she vanished like a graceful shadow or a hope of rich relations dying and we were left alone without answering me when i asked   him what the deuce all this nonsense was e about he took me by the arm and trotted me intoand around the lodgeroom for the inspection of the assembled brethren after keeping up this trot until i was wellnigh out of breath he halted me in front of the nbob grand  what means this masquerading he demanded savagely our angel decorated him that we might know what he most resembled in his longings and desires replied the con ductor baxter what proposition did you make to our angel asked the nabob with ter rible solemnity well isimply asked her if odd fellows wie permitted to have private anges i replied vuiin  lecher goat donkey howled tie nabobiiing to his feet while  evebody ele also stood up you have offended our guardian angel how dare you sir thzs betray your nature odd fellows ar all honest menall honest i singlefeem ad men all married men when we nd that one has departed from the paths of rectitude we give him to a  skillful igsueon and appoint a committee to seeth his betrayed wife does n t suffer  aaunt quit my sight for thou art fitly decorated they were about to run me out amid the imprecations of the assemblage when the vicious grand threw himself before me and commanded a halt hold  most worthy nabob grand baxter is but human to er is human to forgive divine let us show our su periority by giving him a ducking agreed shouted all hands amid much excitement  good said the nabob awaywith t  him call in the watermen and let the evil tht is within him be washed away in iceater begone that settled it and they rushed me out   into another anteroom provided with a large tank hastily stripping my clothes from me they tumbled me into the water without the slightest regard to my bodily   mr baxter takes the ironclad tiroof oath before thei sacred altar of oddfellowshp   temperature or physical capacity for water when i got my head above the surface they poked me with spears and made me dive again then they welted me over   the head with stuffed clubs and inflated bladders attached to the end of a stick by a short string i yelled for mercy and at length they       desisted then two solemnnlooking negroes came in with a waterbarrel supported by two long handles on either side of it this they placed by the edge of the tank and proceeded to fish me out after which i was put into the barrel already provided with about three bucketfuls of water even colder than that in the tank taking up the barrel these funereal   looking oddfellows don in ebony marched into the lodgeroom with me and carried me several times around for the inspection of the brethren now wasnt this a trifle roughjust because they found out that i was only humani thought so are you better now asked the nabob as they sat me down before his throne    m baxter enacts the charitctlr of tue wandering mnbtrel assisted by the membbeis of the lodie      i wish i was able to be out i replied avith a dash of stoughton bitters in my tone i you shall be eleased but let this be a warning to you never again to forget yourself let your future actions be as chaste as our angels and as cold as the water in whichl you now crouch take him away and iut him in nuiform you mray bet understandingly that    was glad to get out into a warm anteroom and to have those darkies rub me off i yearned for that uniform which the nabob had alluded to and if it was ever so sum mery in its texture it would be better than bare hide which in my case was just no hide at all from the rude gaze of the brethren what if that angel should walk in after they had rubbed me off and stood me up before a stove to dry one of them handedmine a glass of brandy i took it raw concluding that i had already taken water enough then they placed a sort of a demidevils cap on my head and gaveme an ordinary pair of overalls wlewiwth to hide my hide after which they withdrew with their blasted old waterbarrel and left me alone i was deadbroke at that moment but i would have given fifty dollarsto have laid my hands uponfpqdger confound the fellow was this the mild initiation that he spoke of if this was masonry toned down what must masonry be in its raw state while cogitating upon this conundrum the door opened and the conductor who had led me into and through so many tribulations presented himself i say young man let me out of this and ill pay you well for it ive got enough ohis kind of a thing i sfiould wdrwn and quartered if i did the deuce you would but i say havent i got about through arent they about satisfied  yes you are now about to be taken before the great altar where the iron clad tinroofed oath will be administered after which a few more mild lessons will be given and then you are all light mild lessons eh i think i have learned what mild lessons are but never mind my life is well insured and i am reckless go ongo on he locked arms with me and we again entered the lodgeroom everything was serene and lovely not a sign of sorrow or regret was to be seen on anyof the masks before me   baxterone more testof your courage a and adhesive qualities and we shall be t satisfied are you ready to meet it i askedthe labob well draw it mild gentlemen if you s can do so as wellas not for i feel some what shaky ilreplied mount him  shouted the nabob thunder and blazes what did that mean they were so much in a hurry that conundrums didnliave a fair show for before i was awaiof what was intended the seized and placed me upqn the back of a wild boarwhose bristles were sharp and stiff enoughto make shoemakers awls of i howled with pain but they only laughed at me placing the reins in one hand and an anchor in the other the vicious grand told me to cling to hope of which the anchor was the emblem and to go it they gave the boar a jab with a spear and he started on a run up an inclined plane which led to an elevated racecourse which went entirely around the lodgeroom talk about masonic goats why they are equestrian luxuries compared with the animal which oddfellows make use of to test an initiates courage goodness gracious i how he did everlastingly git up and git around the ring i thought my time had come and that it was also very fast time to make matters all the more lively for me they followed my charger around and kept stirring him up with spears if he showed any inclination to slacken his pace at length however all hands appeared to have satisfied their spite against me so the boar was allowed to come down and i to dismount i felt that i should not be able to

the store of wilding  co liquordealers the courtyard itself was called tipple corner and watermen had ceased to apply there because their wares were never bought or used about the establishment there was a tree in tipple corner there was a pump in tipple corner but it was seldom disturbed all tipple corner belonged to wilding  co liquordealers they lived there mr wilding put on his hat at the age of fiveandtwenty and told bintrey his lawyer that that hat covered the owner of this property and the business transacted on this property he was thankful he then hung it up again a plain statement of facts without pantomime would have been quite as effective in this instance bintrey said ha ha and took a glass of wine then wilding took something then they both took something wilding got pathetic and cried and told how he had lived with his mother seven years after she took him from the home and when she died she set him up in the liquor business as successor to pebblestone nephew have you a partner secured asked bintrey i reckon and a housekeeper advertised for you bet after wildings proposing to get up a chorus for the little wanderers home they parted bintrey evidently thinking his employer had got enough joey ladle the cellarer then entered and complained that he had to drink all his wine through the pores of his skin and didnt like the idea of changing the sign as it changed the luck of the housean idea which by the way proved to be the correct one enter the housekeeper in response to an advertisement in the daily papers numerous applicants for the position of housekeeper appeared wilding ran the gauntlet that must be run by all who advertise there were the usual species of applicants old women young women and women who appeared neither old nor young handsome homely plainlooking and pretty painted and unpainted chalked eyebrowed and unchalked eyebrowed oneeyed twoeyed squinteyed crosseyed crookedeyed etc et cetera ad infinitumuntil poor wilding was ready to give up in despair and curse the newspapers for their extensive circulation this was written by ds and is considered one of his most felicitous descriptive passages at last however a woman dressed in black came saw and conquered she was a widder and her name was coldslaw the housekeeper speaks mrs coldslaw waited on mr wilding in the diningroom about breakfast sir eight oclockham and eggsfresh eggs she

his place then said wilding with a noble burst of enthusiasm to which he was sometimes addicted i will advertise for him and sign over my property to the home for little wanderers if i dont find the true wilding he then sent for bintrey and read a letter from neponset new characters on the scene george vendale the new partner entered the store wilding was agitated what is the matter i am another i had no business to come into this business i am somebody else and consequently was never in it vendale proposed to take something to cheer up his spirits which was clone the letteris it for you or for us for us vendale opens and reads letter from hardeider manufactory at neponset which commends the new firm to hoofensheister dock square their agent vendale by the way was in love with hoofensheisters niece whom he had met in summer travel vendale makes love one night george went awooing to the house of hoofensheister in the sittingroom was madame door who is introduced into the story for the purpose of bringing things round right by and by a description of her personal appearance is unnecessary there is nothing for her to say which will add interest to the tale and we consequently invite the reader to inspect her to his satisfaction and make up his own mind what she is like there she sits with her back to the wall look at her marguerite was not there he asked for her and she came hoofensheister went away and madame door went to sleep vendale said fair marguerite dost thou lovest me she turned her eyelids toward the ceiling and murmured i dost he bent over her tenderly and took from his coatpocket a box of jewelry and put it about her neck she blushed and tried on the necklace hoofensheister returned and made a row vendale outgeneralled him and under certain restrictions began to court marguerite in regular new england fashion this restriction was to always have a third person in the room hoofensheister chose madame door to be watcher but she invariably turned her back to the wall and never looked up during the whole evening vendale and marguerite of course only whispered they never said anything with their voices exit welding at this point messrs ds brownjohn and domby held a consultation in regard to wilding as it was evident that to make the story interesting he must be got rid of somehow mr domby suggested that an apoplectic fit would be a good idea no said ds thats too sudden and is not always sure death he must go gradually brownjohn thought that a coroners verdict died of cold hunger and being squeezed to death at the corner of tremont street and hamilton place november th  would be a capital idea that would hurt the sale of tickets for the next reading said domby ds with an eye to business assented brownjohn not being an interested party did not insist upon the tragedy but he must die before the beginning of the next chapter continued ds why not get rid of him by appointing him to a foreign consulship asked domby that would not be death but life eternal said charlie in his quizzical humorous way a western railroad train suggested brownjohn sure death soliloquized domby solemnly but how to get him there queried charlie plain enough interposed brownjohn liquordealerlongworth winesrye whiskeybourbon of course he must have all these to stock his cellars with but at the end of the last chapter it looks as if he was going to give up business said charlie that wont do lie had better fall downstairs have a hogshead of wine roll over him or something of that sort that would also be too sudden said domby you want to keep the nerves of the reader on a steady strain but never shock them this sensible observation was complimented by the speakers companions consult norwood suggested brownjohn how did beecher slaughter all his characters i didnt get through even the middle chapters but i saw there was to be trouble ahead let him die said domby wisely as little dombey didwater on the brain if you remember aright he was always talking of the wild waves and trying to dam the onward rolling river the joke took and all hands took something at dombys expense i have it said ds while he nervously rubbed his chin whiskers ill kill him in good old style as ive killed heaps of troublesome characters before him he took a pen and wrote gradually under the pressure of his brooding mind his body stooped his step lost its elasticity his eyes were seldom lifted from the ground at length when the partnership was but five month old walter wilding took to his bed and his housekeeper became his nurse he extended his hand to her and she gently took it he died and we all smiled to think how easily he got over it now said charlie rising i am going to walk up to worcester and back to get a good appetite for dinner the distance from boston to worcester and back is about eighty mileshis accustomed stroll of an afternoon you fill in the blanks while i am gone of course make it pathetic or it will be ridiculous dont begin the next act till i get back he vanished act ii vendale makes mischief after wildings death and since he was shinning up to marguerite vendale attended strictly to biz he frequented neither the lagerbeer saloons nor the genteel resorts where drinks were not sold over the counters but furnished at sidetables and as he did not sell by the glass himself the state constabulary allowed him to go in and make all he could if lie did not jam a certain amount hoofcnsheister would not allow him to marry his nieceand hoofensheister was determined he should never have that sufficient income we have before stated that hoofensheister was agent of the firm of which wilding  co purchased their spirits h called one morning and found v in a peck of troublea lot of hard cider marked  had turned out only corn whiskey and a large amount of money sent by wilding  co to the firm at neponset had been stolen when he heard this hoofensheister tipped over the envelopecase and spilt the contents vendale had found the forged receipt and hoof wanted to see it hoof pretended to be warming his hands over the fire when a porter entered and dashed a hod of coal in the grate and quenched the flame and all prospects of hoofensheister burning the paper hoof looked filmy whispered imbecile and on the whole concluded he didnt care much about ex amining the receipt i will write to neponset tonight said vendale it is supposed he wrote as in eight or nine days he got an answer telling him to get some one who could talk french to start for neponset at once with the receipt as the firm could then tell who forged it they suspected who the victim was who was to be sent to neponset with the receipt  tipple corner afforded plenty of people who could talk french but few who were honest the more he thought of it the more plainly necessity faced him and said go just then hoofensheister came in and said he would go too he measured vendale and found his companion was the biggest man vendale carried the receipt in the breastpocket of his coat he went to bid marguerite goodby vendales last look was for marguerite marguerites last words to him were dont go she smelt a mice act iii in the valley on a cold and stormy day in february a solitary horse hitched into one pung which contained two individuals might have been seen wending his way through the drifted snow on the road between boston and neponset the men were vendale and hoofensheister and the horse was a hired one as they rode slowly on hoofensheister muttered to himself while his filmy eyes gleamed from beneath his beetle brows where shall i rob him if i can where shall i murder him if i must no opportunity presented itself until they arrived at holbrooks in neponset they were in a room there which looked out upon neponset river at that place rapid and deep swollen and loud vendale lounged upon a couch hoofensheister walked to and fro now stopping at the window looking at the irregular reflection of the town lights in the dark water and peradventure thinking if i could fling him into it now resuming his walk with his eyes upon the floor where shall i rob him if i can where shall i murder him if i must so as he ran the room paced the river paced the river paced the river paced the river do you lock your door at night asked h no i sleep too soundly i advise you to put your valuable papers under your pillow take a drink this didnt come from tipple corner but is dorchester rum vendale didnt follow the advice but accepted the invitation goodnight and hoofensheister vanished to his own apartments left alone vendale raked up the fire and dozed undozed and raked it down again and vice versa the gaslight from the tallow candle burned dimly and threw its sickly rays about the apartment suddenly he latch lifted the door opened softly andhorrorsa man entered whos there ha ha boo boo yah yah too too cried vendale springing forward and endeavoring to frighten the intruder it was hoofensheister not in bed shouted he catching vendale by the foreshoulder as if meaning mischief are you ill ill no thank heaven twas but a dream cried hoof throwing himself upon his knees with upturned eye and outstretched hands vendale noticed the glare in his eyes and made a note of it however he accepted his apology they then took something bad rum ventured vendale no other kind in dorchester replied hoof both leaned their elbows on the table vendale dozed hoofensheister watched himhoofensheister got uphoofensheister went to the bed and turned down the pillow nothing there why should he turn the pillow if not to seek those papers that are in your breast can the reader guess this conundrum or does he give it up it was early candlelight in the morning but the candle had gone out hoofensheister called out sharply vendale we are called vendale rose he shook himself he yawned he looked stupid he felt more so he scratched his head which felt very large he though i not and did not think out into the street everything was strange his step was unsteady and like the witch in macbeth he felt a pricking of the thumbs he drank a couple bottles of congress two of missisquoi tried several rochelles and consumed a large quantity of citrate of magnesia he danced and cut a pigeonwing in the bracing air he then took breakfast after the matin repast hoofensheister said to him our journey amounts to nothing after all how for nothing the house is in canton you know we are a hardcider house in neponset and a sawmill at canton well boards happening to press of a sudden more than ciderwhich had gone through the pressdusenberry was summoned to canton holland the other partner has been taken ill and nobody can see him what do you do go back go on said vendale on on yes across blue hill clown to canton on the mountain it was impossible to take the team with them so they struck a beeline through milton for the blue hill the horror of a winters journey over this rough and rugged elevation is known only to foxhunters mountain torrents whirlwinds and avalanches beset the traveller at very step the dreaded snowslide buries squirrels partridges and rabbits in its relentless fury and if men are in the way it buries them also hoofensheister who was an old gunner passed on followed by vendale except when he stopped to take something vendale got dozy but followed and suddenly became conscious of struggling with hoof on the top of a big snowdrift on a high cliff wherefore gasped vendale because shouted hoofensheister you are a villain you are a fool the receipt at these words vendale who felt that he was euchred sprang into the air turned a complete somersault over the projecting cliff and lauded a hundred and fifty feet below in the top of a large hemlock as his body was regaining a perpendicular position in mid air he shouted god bless mar guerite from the tree he rebounded into the air some fifteen feet and horrors losing his selfcontrol plunged headlong down another hundred feetbut caught with his right hand a huge icicle one of fifty that hung from the edge of a ledge pointing down into the abyss a thousand feet below the mountain storm raged again and again it did not rage two men two dogs and another man and woman were soon upon the scene the dogs looked sharply down into the abyss and howled hes there cried the female give me the brandy and the rope she girded herself with a cord under the breast and arms she formed it into a kind of jacket she drew it into knots she laid its end side by side with another rope she twisted and twined them together she knotted them together she set her jaws upon them in different places and to separate them where she bit were impossible she threw them round a big maple strained and the tree came up by the roots she lield them for two men to strain at and they strained then they all strainedgiving a long strain a strong strain and a strain all togetherevery one except marguerite hoofensheister who stood there unmoved firm as bunker hill monument and like the quality of mercy was not strained these are the strains spoken of in the overture with two kegs for a balancepole down she slid into the ice and darkness soon the cry came up enough and they ceased paying out how does he lie he doesnt liehe hangs this is no time for jesting womanhow does he hang then perpendicularly there were fifty icicles on the edge of the ledge and the fortyninth has nearly melted beneath his grasp if that breaks before i get to him i shall never be married the men and dogs at the top of the cliff were horrorstricken the moons pale beams glimmered for a moment and in that moment when the moons pale beams glimmered she was seen to grasp the fiftieth icicle in her hand and transfer the rope from her body to that of vendale a cry came up softly pull away simultaneously with the order the fiftieth icicle which furnished marguerite hoofensheisters hold on life snapped in twain she felljust the length of vendaleand caught the heel of his boot not observing the additional weight the men at the top hoisted away heartily during the tedious journey up the craggy and icy cliff marguerites mind was beset with horrid emotions supposing the boot should come off or the pegs of the heel pull out but vendale encouraged her with every assurance as to the strength of his brogans said he fair maid if they were custommaid i shouldfear for your life but they were purchased of the c o d man at starvation prices and i know they are stout she breathed easier after this and in another moment a shout which rang from crag to crag told the icebound hills that the lovers were safe and there was no discount on c o d boots the clocklock when the three novelists had recovered from the effects of the trying and fearful scenes just witnessed mr domby exhibited a patent clocklock which he wished to ring into the story somehow as it would give the invention a good lift on this side of the atlantic ds joined with domby in the plan and immediately begun in his imagination to erect a building in which to display the curiosity to this brownjohn objected declaring there was no opening for the lock and if they were interested in any speculation they ought to advertise it in a legitimate way no throughfare of course offered no way but said ds we have the right to introduce the clocklock yes joined in domby and a combination will be exhibited which would redeem any story but the reader cant see it objected brownjohn and it would be impossible to explain its intricate machinery without diagrams mr brownjohn said dsleaning forward with a very convincing expression which plainly said it is minewhose story is this thats what i want to knowwhose is it domby well the fact of it is said d a little hesitatingly i dont think one writer ought to father the whole concern but all three of us can stand it if we hang together i have written a few stories alone said ds more flushed than ever which have proved popular and i reckon my reputation wont suffer if i shoulder this even with the patent thrown in mr brownjohn you have leave to withdraw and that is the way shouted brownjohn excitedly that you would smother struggling genius what have you done in this story sir you begun by telling what time it was is that a reason why the timekeeper should be introduced you described tipple corner must you describe the clocklock the work of your hands is observed on little points throughout the yarn must the hands of the clocklock deface their labor no sirthe shades of pickwick sam weller micawber copperfield nickleby the dombeys and sarey gamp forbid ds turned upon his heel with a look of unutterable disgust he motioned to domby and they conversed in an undertone for several minutes at the conclusion of the consultation the author of american notes blandly said mr brownjohn magnanimity is an attribute of the english character we leave you in entire possession of this thrilling narrative i do not wish the fraternal bond of union between the two countries to be ruptured by a quarrel about a work whose every element is moral and whose principal incidents though improbable are yet exciting the clocklock must have a place in my christmas story this threat has been carried out in arrival publication the principal incidents of which are taken from this story and it cannot be stopped you have got a job on hand if you attempt to harmonize the conflicting elements of this tale without machinery he bowed took his hat motioned to domby and they withdrew not however without ds sarcastically observing you had better get that crowd from the top of the hill soon they are freezing to death up there as they passed out of the door domby with a sardonic smile observed he cant do it cant i though shouted brownjohn as the door closed behind them well see seating himself in the chair just vacated by ds he looked over the ms and took in the situation at once he sneezed scratched his head seized a pen and wrote as follows the curtain falls george vendale and marguerite hoofensheister with their dumb and human companions made their way from the top of blue hillas hundreds had done before them as they were passing beneath the shadow of a high rock a man upon its top was seen to level a pistol at vendales head quicker than a flash joey ladle aimed with his unerring rifle and the body of hoofensheister came tumbling down into the valley in his pocket were found papers which proved conclusively that george vendale was the true walter wilding the man who was not touched walter wilding and marguerite hoofensheister married and did well considering that they owed to mr ds everythingeven their very existencethey followed him everywhere he went and made large sums of money in speculating on tickets for his readings domby and brownjohn received none of the profits but it is supposed that charlie did as he always dressed well in public bintrey became a patent lawyer and put the clocklock through the patent office by a peculiar arrangement it passed entirely into his hands ds and domby receiving nothing for their ownership the last seen of the two men and dogs they were chasing a fox over blue hill joey ladle never died the other persons mentioned in the story were alive and prosperous on christmas day  p sthe reason why this is called no throughfare is no affair of the readers postscriptfor the benefit of aspiring playwrights i publish the following warning which lately appeared in a boston newspaper no throughfareto the editor of the transcript whereas intimations have been made that certain obscure but ambitious dramatists are about to perpetrate a play the incidents of which are to be taken from the thrilling tale published on the first page of last saturdays transcript this is to warn them to at once desist as the author himself has prepared a drama which will be produced whenever a theatre can be found sufficiently firstclass to bring it out in this connection the writer would state that he desires the full benefit of his exciting narratives and will at once proceed to dramatize all except his political and religious articles as soon as they appear in print belllamy brownjohn boston dec   the grecian bend what it is profusely illustrated new york the grecian bend publishing company  entered according to act of congress in the year  by rockwell  rollins in the clerks office of the district court for the district of massachusetts the grecian bend the grecian bend the following pages were written from pure philanthropic motives the object being to guard the public against a distemper which has raged in fashionable circles during the summer causing pain and anguish to thousands cold weather may relieve the victims but if the patients should venture out on severe mornings and freeze in position the effects would be alarming to show how the grecian bend has been viewed from some lookouts we copy the following from the boston sunday times the narrative was written by a simple child of nature who never drank the limpid waters of saratoga from the springs and didnt comprehend the cool cunning of the crookbacked tyrant of his household a severe family affliction by bellamy brownjohn one of those calamities which makes whole communities feel particularly uncomfortable is the prevalence of a contagious disease especially one which will not yield readily to medical treatment the first i heard of the distemper called the grecian bend was from a minister who told me of one of his parishioners that had hitherto borne an irreproachable character but he added solemnly with the light of other days gleaming from his eyes she has become a grecian bendist have her family deserted her no but i have warned my wife and girls against her he clutched my arm convulsively and took me aside he then whispered mysteriously in my ear there is already a general cavingin of the parts and she looks like a lame kangaroo hapless communicant i mused it is he continued different from the mumps and is not like the disease which recently broke up our school transferred from one to the other by the touch why oh why he mourned should my flock be thus smitten brace up against it i replied firmly have faith and patience and your troubles as well as your lambs will get straightened out others of our dear sisters he continued i just hear are afflicted mrs lupkins caught it at a summer hotel she gave it to her neighbor mrs jupkins who had it doubly as severe as she a rivalry always existed between these dear sisters and the height of mrs jupkins ambition is to outdo the lupkinses her toothaches are always much severer than mrs ls we then partedhe bending over with sorrow said i to my friend jowler the other day hows your family pretty well said he with one exception my wifes got the grecian bend soon we met fowler and the three of us strolled down the street fowler said i hows your wife since her return shes very illvery illshes got the grecian bend has she got it bad i asked yesshe sits half the time on the doorstoop it pervades her whole system mr growler soon came along and in answer to our inquiries informed us that his wife had got the grecian bend i expressed the hope that the old folks and children were not afflicted with it also the three exchanged significant glances but said nothing i began to feel uneasy and ventured the fear that i had said something to wound growlers feelings they all smiled grimly but silence reigned in their midst it prevails i continued with assumed familiarity with the subject to an alarming extent in some neighborhoods i have heard the children are very severely lacerated with it the children exclaimed growler great heavens these ejaculations were interrupted by a sudden exclamation from fowler there goes one now one what i asked a grecian bend does it travel brownjohn its plain you are not posted said growler dont try and cheat us look there i looked and instantly doubled up like a jackknife after a few spasmodic efforts i recovered my equilibrium but my friends continued shaking their sides i declare now fellows its too bad to laugh she cant help it cant help it they all shouted and laughed heartier than before gentlemen said i you know this is just the season for such complaints and although the bend makes its victims appear somewhat to a disadvantage it is not right that we should laugh at the poor creatures the disease is a malignant type of the same excruciating malady to which all of us have been accustomed from boyhood theres another screamed jowler whom my words seemed to convulse rather than quiet we gazed and our bodies again contorted into the abyss of uncontrollability having nearly recovered fowler shouted theres one worse than ever a violent spasm simultaneously seized our quartette the shaking of the risibilities was so irrepressible that we were obliged to withdraw to a quiet corner where we could oscillate and flounder about unobstructedly fowler gave out first and then dropped then jowler then myself and growler was finally obliged to succumb a policeman came round and found us on   the pavement with a hinge in our backs and each one folded together like a sheet of paper he asked us if it was poison no answer was vouchsafed what kind of poison was it he continued growler gasped out grecian bendhack and we were packed in a carriage like merchandise and driven home electra was of course surprised and alarmed to see the driver bring me into the house with my classic head between my heels but the knight of the whip told her it was only an aggrawated case o the greeshum bend and she was becalmed with the assistance of neighbors i was pried apart and regained a perpendicular position i did not however trust myself out of doors among the bendists again that day in the afternoon mrs b called on mrs jowler and when she returned i noticed a change in her personal appearance she had begun to bend electra said i in alarm you are descending from dignity youve got it got what its an infectious disease and you caught it at the jowlers she blushed crimson dont now i prytheedont curve if you value my backbone and your own appearance take immediate and stringent measures for relief if the trouble is external put yourself in a straitjacket if its internal take chainlightning and vitriol or some other equally powerful antidotehoist it from your system if its contagious dont go near the baby it would break his little back dont let the lapdog see you for it would give him the jimjams keep away from the cat for she would be a raving maniac and by all means avoid your aged parents for their frames could never stand the wrenching i stopped to take breath and contemplate her position my sides began to shake but i could not smile a ghastly grin overspread my face my body went through the doubling process and various other contortions but although my feelings were tickled my countenance could not indicate laughter she bent and i doubled and thrashed until the furniture was miscellaneously scattered about and damaged by contact with my limbs the grecian bend is a terrible malady but it affects the sexes differently during infliction females assume the tortuous form of mr and mrs brownjohn on the street the red mans bow and their countenances are serene as the facial expression of the placid cockroach they catch the distemper from each other men on the other hand are thrown into convulsions and cramps their faces are horribly distorted and they can catch the disease only from seeing a woman who is afflicted with it what will cure it is another thing if it gets into the blood turkish baths and periodical suspensions by the neck with a few pounds of iron taken internally may eradicate it but if there is anything in a name cherokee medicines for the unfortunate are the only compounds which will prevail against the monster i think hamlet had it bad he was evidently suffering its excruciating tortures when he said they fool me at the top of my bent or bendwhich meant his cranium my wife is doing all she can to get well she locks herself up three hours each day and practisesendeavoring as she says to straighten herself out i have tried several times to enter the apartment while she was training but she persistently refused to open the door she has purchased some stont leather straps that look like a harness for a shetland pony and which she assures me will in a short time make her all right but she bends with the weight of the disease more and more each day i am trying to find out what she does with the harness and wish to try it on to see how it works but she assures me the straps are for ladies only it is a painful thing for one who loves as fondly as i to think that the wife of his bosom must wear habiliments like the beasts of the field notwithstanding which i double up every time i catch a glimpse of her i met fowler this morning and asked how his wife was worse jowler came along soon after and the verdict was worse and growler after shaking hands growled out worse i hope my friends said i we shall soon be enjoying our usual health i see we have all grown roundshouldered within a week they looked sadly at each other but tried to be pleasant ill tell you one thing at last i said with unwonted energy my wife has got to try some different treatment i believe these straps are dhumbugs and so do i they enthusiastically chimed in we then turned into an humble quarter of the town where there were ten thousand children and as many cartloads of dirt to each block the boys hooted at and stoned us and the hot breath of smuttynosed babies dandled in maternal arms smote our cheeks at each window as we passed along but we walked erect and happy we were out of the region of the grecian bend as we passed a large group of small hopefuls who did not abuse us i said my dear friends i am going to make those children a speech though not wealthy they are evidently welldisposed and susceptible then waiting until an expression of sadness came over my features i said with a trembling voice children beware of green apples and castor beans eschew them they will give you the grecian bend the effect of the warning would have been splendid had not one obtuse and irreverent little kuss ignorant of what i had already suffered shouted go to grass and shake yourself old toddyblossom his speech was received with enthusiasm by both his friends and mine disgusted i shook both crowds but when out of sight the old feeling came over me and i could but go and smile now reader pause awhile and your attention lend while brownjohn takes his smile ill do the grecian bend song of the grecian bend should you ask me whence these stories whence these curvings and these bendings with the mincing and the wincing with the curling of the tresses and the looping of the dresses why the dainty female footses that inspire the classic muses are pinched and cramped in highheeled shoeses i should answer i should tell you from the spring of saratoga where they go to quaff the water where the matron shows her daughter to the bobbing popinjays there the monster first bulged out hold your horses and ill tell you tell you simply tell you truly how they did it how they do it and should you ask me how i know it i will tell you i have done it first make up a toilet hideous put on a hoop of small dimension put on a dress of closest tension eat a peck of sour green apples apples plucked in early summer put a strap around your waist then two others down your haunches when the apples bend you over draw them tightly draw them closely underneath the rear of said hoop just below the tapering waist bind a coil of threeinch wire and let it stick out boldly stick out over this the pannier hang and when it wobbles to and fro glance behind you and observe what a splendid thing for flytime you have got behind your curve let your hands then dangle idly and flop about loose as may be in your walk step just three inches never mind your shoe that pinches see that cat upon the wall she has got itshe has got it got the bend without the leather and when the two are placed together with their backs so nearly curving with their panniers gayly streaming to our mind this thought they bring the grecian bend is no new thing when we look at these fair pictures pictures of the varied bends we see at once who long has had it and also where our daughters got it where first the sad catastrophe fastened to the human frame brought out bunches mammoth bunches and upset our calculations about the female form divine now made to wear a bushel basket an ugly clumsy bushel basket below the shoulders on behind a moral tale with a climax mary had a little goat its hair was black as jet and everywhere that mary got the goat was sure to get he followed her to a wateringplace which goats will sometimes do she harnessed it to a little cart the cart the black goat drew it capered gayly round about except when on the road and everybody liked the goat because the goat was good mary bought a new black dress which fitted every inch she put her feet in highheeled shoes which gave her toes a pinch but mary bore it gallantly and no fault did she find the goat grew sad and sorrowful and harnessed would not mind he gazed at her in silent grief and pined away with trouble his bleat grew weak his eye grew dim to see her bent up double no more he capered round about no more he drew his cart and so she took him out to walk to cheer his drooping heart but when he saw her panier far from the busy crowd he got his ebenezer up and bleated long and loud then he bent his body up and gave a sudden jump his horn went through the panier and struck her hip kerthump mary dropped her parasol and gave a healthy shout the straps gave out with sudden snap and she was straightened out the goat at once appeared much pleased and walked home by her side and that same day was strong enough to haul her out to ride after that the other girls who heard of marys shock all left their paniers at home when they took a walk moral this story teaches all who have the sad complaint endured to buy a goat and take a walk the bend may thus be cared the last of the grecian bend the adventures of a lodger

statesman and a skilful general wishes to ascertain all the vulnerable points most likely to be assailed by a restless foe as broken ribs from accident are in one part or another of daily occurrence i have given directions for the simplest easiest and best treatment of them and with my respects to a generous public at present farewell the adventures of a lodger the adventures of a lodger part i boston in social arts possessive skilful in science and progressive with many churches and devotions and fancy works called yankee notions when i first arrived there in  i knew nothing of its history but i admired its neatly painted houses and streets dotted as they were then with the sassafras and other large shady green trees its neat cottages with the clustering grapevine and clean smart and happylooking people after spending a week or two there pleasantly i left with some regret to go further downeast to the manufacturing establishment of tt and bd n h near the state of maine there being then no railway i paid my fare and went with the stagecoach with which i travelled seventy miles that day to dover where i remained till the severe snowstorm was over which set in soon after leaving boston being saturday and feeling desirous of reaching my place of destination i ordered my luggage to be sent after me and forced my way on foot the rest of the journey some four or five miles to gflls took dinner was engaged to board and shown where to go to work when ready called to see somebody and was respectfully associated in the evening in agreeable company the roomy and convenient cottage in which i passed this and some other evenings by invitation was partly overhung by the branches of a large tree with no other house very near near the barn was the sty stable and shed for the cows another for wood and henpen for chickens ducks and turkeys the pigeonhouse was high out of which they had access to the loft of the cottage and were safe from cat or rat or other piratical prowlers the mosscovered bucket hung in the well the watchdog was a mere handful but when chained up nights understood his duty and attended to it as well as a large one could have done by giving immediate notice of any strange footsteps a gun was kept in the house and the son a smart goodnatured and intelligent young man knew how to use it marksmen sometimes called coal was not used here but plenty of wood with a capacious fireplace good backlog and chimney crane and hooks on which to hang the utensils for cooking adorned the kitchen there was no ground taken up here with collections of gaudy flowers but when the snow was gone there were wild and beautiful ones scattered amongst the grass which before hot weather sets in is very green art cannot equal the charms of nature the windows had no shutters but were hung with long white curtains the ceiling white the walls handsomely papered over a table on one of them hung a mirror on the other a map of the united states a picture of george washington and some few others a variety of books edifying and entertaining with one or more newspapers were on the table for choice by request a young lady sung the mosscovered bucket that hung in the well her vocal musical powers did justice to those beautiful verses and i think surpassed those of jenny lind as her languages was clearly understood the company consisted of several rather reserved young men and young women and the matron an elderly and respectable lady there was no fanaticism nor anything extreme and appreciating the company i joined in the harmony it was a happy and innocent evenings amusement in the course of which apples and sweetcakes were served round and warm gingertea sweetened and tumblers were set on the table with an invitation the weather being inclement this sober and wholesome beverage operated as a good stimulant there was no lewd talking gambling intoxication nor slandering the evening seemed to have winged away quickly sleighs were brought to the door all were carried home that were visitors and i for my own part was soon in the arms of morpheus at my new boardinghouse i had my choice of bedroom in the second or third story and for a better view of the mountains further east and the northern lights aurora borealis i chose the latter when i awoke on sunday morning i beheld the floor for the space of a yard in front of the window covered with snow so even as to convince me at once its ingress was with the air particles of ice were on my sheets that must have congealed from my breathing and the storm continued to rage till some few days afterwards its fury appeared to be spent one beautiful moonlight evening serenely calm and picturesque in the view around i was on my way for a visit to the cottage a sleigh with its tingling bells overtook me at the turn of the road and there upset tossing two young ladies into the snow who were laughing whilst struggling to reach it i righted the sleigh and helped them into it after having quieted the horse and put in the buffalo robe whip and parcel of drygoods for which they had been to the store they in return invited me to a share in the sleigh as far as they were going we all stopped however at the same cottage not recognizing each other till after entering it but what i still think a much greater mystery is that whilst engaged in gathering up the articles named a written address in shape of a note previously forgot to a young lady at the very place i was going to fell from my pocket and in picking it up i picked up also a sparkling gold ring that lay near it the same ring lay near the same paper which fell from the same place in the coach and was claimed by a young lady as being hers it was the same one that directed me where to find the cottage at great falls after arriving therethe same one who sang so good and i have since thought perhaps she handed me that note in boston if that was so she must have had some other conveyance to what i had at least some part or parts of the way for when i reached this my destination she was there the deep snow and fine weather now made a lively time for the lovers of sleighriding and young girls with their thinbottom boots on winter bonnet overcoat and gloves flew away for miles and returned with red cheeks oxen having at the same time icicles hanging from the nose to the knees another snowstorm set in which for severity by far exceeded the first one it fell thick and heavy the snow already fallen was raised in prodigious quantities high up in the air my ears eyes nose and mouth were filled to blindness and suffocation at every attempt to move i had to raise my foot as high as i could to gain a few inches forward every minute i had to stop and turn my head to breathe which i could not do whilst facing the storm and almost instantly the drifted snow was up to my shoulders had penetrated into my closely buttoned clothes to the skin and the piercing cold wind precluded the possibility of remaining there alive i was at that time young strong and resolute and i dare venture to say that had any one to face that storm a mile their shroud would be snow with no chance of keeping open an aperture for breathingand no occasion for it after being frozen to death as some were that winter in that neighborhood and all the dogs of st bernard had they been there could not have saved them no one could see but indistinctly a short distance even from an upper window sheet lighting and very loud claps of thunder pealed and mingled with the storm in a few weeks the sun made his appearance hot and warm the snow reduced to water during the day froze into ice during the night and these alternate changes continued for weeks making rough uneven and smooth slippery places to pass through and over and again a sharp day and no sun the snow from the first to the last of it was many months i thought sometimes of the cottage and its friendly occupants hoping they were safe from harm and took my walk in that direction feeling somehow powerfully attracted on the next first fine evening i found them all well and was well received myiwell i wont tell her name now as owing to those trifling incidents the ring in particular her coming into the coach at salem and her telling me that she awoke this morning with an ominous impression that before night somebody would call at the cottagei say that in salem in the olden times she would have been found guilty of witchcraft but in these enlightened times people happily understood it to be a mere natural consequence cupid was seen very busy having a hand in it which explained the whole and for my own part although i was going to rhode island after spring set in i liked well enough where i was and sometimes thought i would like to lodge there at that neat and happy cottage i cannot sufficiently express my astonishment however when after reaching rhode island but a little way from a pleasant village there met my view not the identical cottage but one the very model of it and fully as handsome a young lady came out of it and helped me to a drink of pure water from a mosscovered bucket part ii my first recollection of being a lodger by the week was with an old couple named gin the brick block near the annawan cotton factory fall river when i first went there they used to brew strong ale and sell to customers what they did not themselves imbibe and quarrel and fight like sixty but they were older than that she was a big strong woman an overmatch for her poor old and i think would have been loving mate but she grudged him his share of the swipes and as bottles will leak out as well as barrels there had to be an occasional walk out to replenish the former of which she was boss as to poor old w whenever he returned after his lonely walk and told how he had been treated with a glass in such a store she would open fire on him which he would return by calling her in quite a variety of characters and amongst the rest a dd rn cc mdst these his retaliations she heard and answered with a vengeance but when a poor farmer wanted his pay he had to shout through a big horn stuck in her ear and she could scarcely believe and not fully till some other time she had kept boarders but as they could not live on nix they beat a retreat excepting one a machinist named tom grd who turned his coat to that of a lodger tom not finding it conventient to carry money the month round in his pockets had recourse to an alternative by having a shopbook and credit for eatables from tenth to tenth of each month and this might have worked well enough had she not made mistakes in taking poor toms storebook instead of her own to be charged therein to his account for her own use a poor simple man he knew not how long this had been practised but with grief and vexation in his countenance and hard of seeing and hearing in hers shed raise a storm any minute which occurred once in a whiledishonest mistakes the frequent repetition of which precluded the possibility of innocence for my own part i paid as i went along but i had soon discovered that she could not keep her hands clean i would find my eatables moved and you may depend on it not grown any larger after being circumlocuted by this old trapstick feasting and fortunetelling were amongst her games too but she could not make any effort to clean out her bedrooms which were swarming with bugs which annoyed worse than all the rest i also beat a retreat from no  lodginghouse as honesty cleanliness and comfort were blessings i had been long looking and sighing for in vain but still not relinquishing hope my spirits were a little more buoyant on engaging lodgings with a family named band within a few doors but lackaday they had two savage pigs that they could not pacify and besides their two selves a house full of children that watched anxiously every bite i took and keenly snatched at whatever i gave them there was not so many bugs but i was continually reminded of having read of what hungry wolves would do when you cant help yourself one or two girls and boys were studying the rudiments of grammar and the other i think the gamut for perhaps the piano altogether the present and the prospect of any future to charm me here was on so low a keyfrom my own earnings not being more than enough to keep body and soul together no stores in reserve and no friend but providence which we all know is often a very poor helpmeet when most needed and again often a good one at a chance however of bettering myself i quit no  lodginghouse to no  i had engaged and went next to lodge with a man named shaw at the corner of washington and annawan streets in the early part of june perhaps six or eight years ago i had formerly worked for shove  eddy next for john and jesse eddy and had returned from downeast again and was again waiting for a vacancy to go to work when having been sometime at shaws i concluded to look up some employ in the country for that purpose i took with me a solderingiron and tools for umbrella repairing intending to return in a few days or perhaps a week or two a few miles from fall river i got on to the sideboard of a wagon to pick a few cherries by permission the horse soon started i could not extricate myself though i attempted by catching hold of some higher branches of the tree which instantly broke and i fell on to the narrow hind wheel with a crash thatbroke some ribs with some difficultyfor i could not raise a foot from the groundi reached about a mile further bls store where i remained till the next afternoon when a man named s arrived with a wagon to carry me carefully to my lodginghouse in fall river i could not talk on the road and held on to the frame of the wagon with one hand that six miles we had to travel but didnt i get a shakeup all regular enough till we reached spring street within perhaps twenty or thirty feet of washington street into which we whirled round at such a rate as stopped my breath i had to let go and put up my open hand gasping the broken ribs as i often felt certain of afterwards caught into the lungs my brutal driver had started the horse into this wild gallop by a heavy blow on the rump and then turned growling a threat and raised it to strike me i had put up my open hand pleading for him to stop the horse which was the only offence i ever gave him the street being short we were soon at the end of it and the first breath i drew brought roars out of me a great deal louder than i have ever been capable of at other times which i could not restrain and which brought people in surprise to their doors mr shaw ran out to assist me from the wagon but my driver sat there rein and whip in hand and a face with bad minglings to appearances of impatience among the rest as if intent on further mischief and mocking me by imitation then bawling out his ribs are not broke his ribs are not broke had any one been in the way of that horse they must have been injured and i think now as i did then that his impatience was to start that horse again before i could get out the wagontop being low but some man standing with back turned that way the mean fellow was baffled i was got into bed with my clothes on and mr shaw came next morning and gave me a little water and told me the city doctor would not come because it was sunday and none came nor anybody else when not moving my voice was as faint as that of a very weak infant all of shaws tenement bedrooms were on the first floor the window of mine fronted into annawan street which here has a very steep ascent and would have required a strong voice to attract the attention of any one passing three oclock came and then as i guessed five i heard rather a heavy and cautiously soft foot approach my door that carried suspicion with it opened not the door but remained a short time listening without answering my cries for help and then went away in the same treacherous manner i now felt certain no help was to come for me i lay a while considering how i should attempt to make my escape from these barbarians that i consider to be worse than indians as i had never been at war with them and wished them no harm my wounded side was heaving beating and throbbing and i could feel the ends of two of my ribs flirting over each other as plainly as i can feel the ends of my finger and thumb more than two days had passed since the accident i was weak and faint and certain that without some help i could not live till morning i could raise myself straight and lay down the same way on my back but the least move at bending even my arm brought the roars out of me i concluded that if i could manage to get myself turned across the bed with my legs over the side and succeed in raising on to my feet i might possibly get out of that house it took me till near sundown and when i was at last crossways and my head lower my pain was very much increased i rested some time to recruit my strength with a consciousness that on my next effort depended my only chance for life if i fell back or sunk on the floor there i must die thank god i reached my feet i went through into the kitchen looking and feeling like a shadow whether they were crocodile tears at seeing me still alive i cannot tell but they streamed down her cheeks as she rocked herself in her big easychair and muttered that she could not help me i in the mean time put on my hat and went out on inquiring from a gentleman for a doctor it was with great difficulty that i could utter so as to be understood he showed me to his office where there was every comfort i could have under the circumstances next day i was carried off to a hospital some call titticut bridgewater where i remained six weeks broken ribs the best cure i know for broken ribs is to have a bandage to go twice round the body and keep it damp by wetting with cold water over the hurt about every hour during the day and dampening the sheets under the body if the bed be hot and sitting in fresh tepid or salt water so it will cover them for about ten minutes twice a day and resting this mistress shaw had in the mean time moved further down street very likely with a view of accommodating boat and railway travellers with lodgings when i first lived in fall river mass bedbugs were scarcely known some year or two ago on my return trip from new bedford i was told at a house in pleasant street that either they or the bugs had pulled down the bedsteads i hurried to the railway headed for bristol r i to a large boardinghouse where i used to go when in that neighborhood and was not molested by either bugs or servants my room being so high was rather difficult of access for servants my bed being of straw so well matted and pressed as to defy entrance by the most skilful bug it was some consolation to set them at defiance and here i might have luxuriated tranquilly on a bed that would have been i think fully as soft as the boards to lie on if it had been as level i had stopped occasionally with this family for some years it was now the depth of winter and no chance for me to earn a dollar this time i remained about five weeks the other boarders were in good employ which i could not get and by their continued insults and injustice showed with what contempt they viewed me they occupied all the lower rooms daily swept out and all the featherbeds and things must have been further considered since i was only charged half a dollar a week more than they the injustice i speak of on the part of the boarders was their conspiring to push me out to the further end of the table and moving all eatables out of my reach in the sittingroom they debarred me of all chance of reading and grinned like idiots i quit no  lodgings and came to newport stopping by the way at warren and providenceseveral weeks in the formerbut nothing curious or edifying to relate of it with one exception and that i very properly told to those who ought to know it in the latter place i stopped one night and as my slim means did not allow me to pay a tavern price i stopped at a private house and was to have a bed to myself the rascals got my pay and under pretence of waiting for something or other kept me up till too late to look for another place then showed me to bed with a sick man weak and tired i had no alternative i slept and next day came along with the boat thank goodness free from contagion though more from good luck than good management here i am however and have been now over a year since that occurrence who visits newports rugged shore for health and comfort may gain more than science can do for them it is months since i came to this house to lodge i was engaged by mr and mrs l to pay one dollar a week and to board myself i bought meat and bone for my sunday dinner soup was made and eaten and given away but not any apology made for leaving me without i said nothing but i thought it rather a coarse commencement one day shortly afterwards mr l spread out all the fingers of both his hands over and on to my meat on the table and turning to me demanded to know was it mine i told him it should be minei had paid for it soon after mr ls departure for annapolis violent quarrels were frequent between the motherninetythreeand the daughter i little thought then that these most absurd contentions were from jealousy and that i was really the bone of their rivalry and contention so far i could only wonder and guess that liquor or the dl or both had got into them i was soon astonished at seeing the mother from appearing like a decrepit old lady bounce with activity into the chair i used sitting to my meals crowding against me and savagely pounding the window bottom with her knuckles that like myself was innocent of any thoughts of trespassing and calling out meg i say meg does thee mean to marry agen does thee mean to marry agen at each interrogation raising her voice and accompanying it by vicious gestures and next vigorously pounding the table and looking like anything but natural when here but a few days and hearing her declaiming in gross language against meg as she called her daughter i simply remarked that i thought it improper when i instantly received such a blow near the eye as i think would have astonished as it did me any one endeavoring to be a peace maker oh if my mother had been there i was becoming rapidly more enlightened but i kept cool she went to the sofa laid down on her back and casting a penetrating look at me placed her hand very indecently saying its vary warm its vary warm ize sure its vary warm good heavens here was a trait of character but i have seen worse of her since i tell you that for months together they have been more or less intoxicated lighting pipes staggering and rambling about many a time during nights instead of being sober in bed which must create a risk of life and property that ought not to be run and of which i have many times warned them to no purpose between them and their associates i have been a long time passing through a tiresome ordeal prevention is better than cure i have heard margate tell that she had two husbands and then to her mother says she but what good are they to me since both of em are away the mother for some time fixed a steady look at me as if i were some way or other at fault margate in the mean time endeavoring to imitate some disconsolate young grass widow almost despairing for some tender lover now thinks i im a goner but i wont give up the ship should my head be knocked off i shall neer know the need ont rally round the flag boys ah but wasnt there a good time coming when i went to breakfast next morning margate was sitting fronting the fire with something on eight oclock a dirty apron over her shoulders a comb in one hand and the other in pretended modesty on her naked breast which made something like the appearance of a dirty white glove on an old sheepskin i stepped back in an instant and went again when i thought she had had time enough to make and eat a stew and behold you there she still sat in the same plight with the curtains not yet opened i again drew back as if the dl was after me and ran upstairs as if going to bed from bedlam and soon afterwards she called out in a thick voice the kettles boiling all the rest of the forenoon she was engaged in putting on her white stockings and admiring her legs and feet at which she many times invited me to look and vexed enough i told her i didnt want to see them and that she couldnt have me no how no use margate i wont have it muttering to myself ye two ridiculous old trollops well she went occasionally still in her undress to look at herself in the glass and after dinner to her toiletput in her false teeth fixed her hair put on a clean gown sticking up behind and then attempted to look smiling it was deception and caused me to wonder if any painter could portray one such countenance from lucifer and judas mixed up together she commenced again chasing after me faster than ever and seemingly with more determination sometimes staring as if asking how dare you attempt to shun me and an occasional remark that many men had no home though i was paying for my lodgings she would meet me smartly where two could not pass without compression and to make use of a nautical phrase she would stick out her sternpost being topheavy with two or three sheets in the wind and why should not these doings be published in way of warning to some and precaution to others mr l was not long gone away when meg called me to go into her bedroom for what i asked oh to talk a little i guess not said i if you want to talk with me say it out here she next attempted to guide my footsteps into her mothers bedroom to carry tea to bed for hera sprightly old woman who could not only help herself but get drunk and fight no no margate that wont go down with me neither i had at different times noticed them taking calculating silent looks at me as plainly as to say ill cut you out seeing me rather sleepylooking they thought they had caught a goose but i was watching them to have made myself agreeable with these two old jockeys i must have become a bachanalian and a kind of cupid and tasted the sweet joys of two disgusting hateful old women as their conduct made them to me they sometimes talk of our church and say that faith will save denying a belief in a future state and without showing even the semblance of respect or awe in any way for a supreme being making a hell upon earthall they can at least i have made efforts to direct their attention to a future state and been responded to by some wanton word or move and unnaturallooking grin or laugh when i had a days respite from their annoyancewhich was very seldomi began to hope they had tired themselves out but no such a thing it might be assimilated to a rest in a storm where evil spirits were consulting how when and where they should next commence to make their most effectual attack well meg came again at a headforemost bounce into my bedroom wanting to engage me in talk and i provoked at her want of common decency went out again without speaking she growled savagely after me and soon followed downstairs looking like a fury she laid down on the sofa saying as she stared at me that her patience was nearly worn out i was then reading a book at the table and no one speaking when she jumped up and seizing a chair with both hands struck the floor near my foot with all her might well i felt enraged and turned towards her as she passed by instantly demanding to know what she meant which interrogation she answered also savagely that she could do as she liked in her own house on the th of dec  still wicked and crazylooking with the fireshovel she tossed the covers off the stove and threw coals out of it about her mother and on to the floor some of which were redhot had succeeded in frightening her mother whose help she wanted more effectually to conquer me as she thought to her mind another course tending to that plot in pointof view commenced next day with no better results and with evident signs of intoxication on both megs mother pinched her behind saying meg thus strong meg thus strong i know that mother said she in rejoinder in the evening meg crouched down near her mother and addressed her thus mother you know i am a good daughter to you umph well i wait on you hand and foot and let you want for nothing and i bring you a pint of good strong beer every night she said nothing about the pint of rum that she brought for herself at the same time i asked margate if she thought her treatment of me was right she answered no but she had to do it i reflected on mr ls treatment of me helping to eat my first sunday dinner and along with what i have before told of him when going away he didnt condescend to look at me nor answer me and i overheard him say in an undertone to margate it must be done and now margate tells me she had to do it one is a command and the other apparently a compliance but notwithstanding her confession margate persevered in persecuting me she had made various offers one was to have the honor of sitting near them to make a display of eloquence of which and from it heaven save us rejected she hunted up some one who soon found a way every night with a bucket for swill i dont say that they did or did not take any snuff together but they had a long whispering one cold night in the next room and in the dark she then invited him and lighted him upstairs what they were doing it did not concern me to know but as she had a ham there i thought perhaps she wanted to let him see it well mr l has returned again to newport and last night he had the impudence to order me to go and bring a chair out of his bedroom i perceived there was premeditation in his unsocial command and answered him no cant make it fit and meg and her mother having no amiable attractions have

deep and far below finally received my last earthly remains there are more ills in life than need to be right and wrong cannot agree the mysterious messenger founded on fact by a member of the georgia conference nashville tenn published for the author by j b mferrin agt  the mysterious messenger founded on fact by a member of the georgia conference nashville tenn published for the author by j b mferrin agt  the mysterious messenger the mysterious messenger among the mountain spurs which jut out from the blue ridge in  county there is a pleasant vale which we will call bee gum valley through which a stream called moccasin creek gently flows this stream is formed by the junction of two others known as possum creek and mud creek these names are likewise appropriated to the two valleys respectively through which those streams meander at the confluence and situated between the two rivulets there was some years ago a small logcabin having no floor but the naked terra firma this was the justices courthouse of the bee gum district where a couple of smart magistrates presided monthly to dispense their legal lore from the georgia justice as this place was also an election precinct the sovereigns of the district were assembled at an early hour on the first monday in january  for the purpose of electing county officers at that time there were no less than seventeen distilleries in the county as may be seen from the report of the american tract society for that year whether this district was considered the dark corner of  county or not it is certain that it enjoyed the reputation of having more drunkards more quarrelling and fighting than any other justices district in the county jim ricks stillhouse was emphatically an institution of the district and was situated on possum creek about a half mile above its junction with mud a hundred or more of the habitus of the district including several females for the women of bee gum district sometimes attended the election doubtless to see and be seen were gathered together from the three valleys and their adjacent glens and hillsides the most distingu characters among them are those whom we will mention as constituting chiefly our corps de ballet there was squire porter a stout redfaced man who seemed to be a leading personage among the people and one of the presiding magistrates and superintendents of the election he always delivered his legal decisions with an air of great authority and when he wished to convey them more impressively than at other times he would add an emphatic now then there was emanuel his brother who was always called manny for short manny porter had brought up a barrel of jim ricks corn whiskey and tapped it under a large oak tree in front of the courthouse he had killed a poor drunken wretch at the election two years before and though he had been tried and acquitted his neighbors generally did not regard him as guiltless there was old bob pool a long gauntlooking man and his son lige a tallowfaced lad of fifteen bob had brought a fivegallon jug full of whiskey from which the managers of the election occasionally wet the eye netty mulligen a spinster born in the year of grace  was there guy bonner a deacon of mud creek meetin house and old father spavin as he was called the pastor of that institution with several of the breethren were in attendance jim rick accompanied by a dirtyfaced urchin whom he called hempy was also in the crowd now hempy had a pet fox which he led about with a string and while he attended his father at the stillhouse commonly kept the animal fastened to a young poplar tree hard by hempy and his fox were therefore wellknown characters in the neighborhood patrick omore a newly imported son of erin ben tucker old mose azant and others too numerous to mention by name were all present jake smith another conspicuous character was thought to be as good a man as ever trod shoeleather by which was undoubtedly meant that he was as hard to handle as the next man who this next man was we never were able to find out exactly but suppose it was general they all called him gineral jehoshaphat sprawler he had for many years been elected to the senatorial branch of the state legislature and had just returned from milledgeville in time to be at the election his wife mrs tabitha sprawler whom the general always called tabby was with him tabby loved jim ricks corn whiskey about as well as the general and jake smith a few paces from the big oak tree a onehorse wagon was standing with the hind gate off and a fat rosycheeked woman sat within offering cakes and beer for sale this was mrs polly smith jakes wife it was generally believed that tabby was as hard to beat as any woman in creation whether this was true of her in regard to matters and things in general it is certain that polly found it true in one particular at least whether the two or three drams that tabby had taken constituted the only causa belli or whether she indulged some hatred toward the rosycheeked vender of cakes and beer because jake had always voted against the general we never could learn precisely but so it was tabby had a piece of her mind to deliver to madam polly accordingly she stepped out in front of the wagon and said well madam what did you say miss sprawler asked polly i say madam that you is nt no lady thats what i say what am i then youre a goodfornothin nocount woman thats what you are what have i done to you miss sprawler youve been talkin about the gineral thats what youve done i hav nt you have i hav nt you have you sneakin lyin lowlifed goodfornothin heifer i declare miss sprawler i never said any thing agin gineral sprawler in my life i know better you said that he was nt any more fittin to go to sinate than your old dog towser lawsy massy i never said sich a thing in my born days you did you sassy hussy and ill make you take it back or ill scratch the rosebuds outn them cheeks miss sprawler yous drinky

come here do you threaten me with that stinkin drunken old husband of yourn ill let you know that i dont ax him any odds so saying she dragged poor polly out of the wagon and commenced pulling her hair at a dreadful rate o lawsy massy jake do run here jake happened just then to be in the courthouse making himself jolly with a few of his friends over the contents of the big jug as soon as he heard the last earnest call of polly he looked round and seeing the posture of affairs dashed the glass which he held upon the table and in an instant was at her side now jake was too much of a man to strike a woman so he set to work in order to release tabbys hold upon the long dark tresses of his plump souse he had not more than laid hold of her when a terrible blow on the side of the head directed by general sprawler felled him to the earth active as a cat he sprung to his feet in an instant and faced his antagonist who stood armed with a lightwoodknot and was now about to rush upon him with the ferocity of a tiger jake foiled the blow with one hand and with the other fist laid the general flat upon his back in an instant he planted himself upon the prostrate senator and commenced dealing the most telling blows into his sides the scene that followed beggared description the crowd rushed up and gathered in a circle round the combatants even squire porter left his seat at the table in the courthouse and followed by the rest of the managers rushed to the scene of conflict hoora for jake smith give it to him jake hoora for gineral sprawler rise with him gineral pull him off part em hands off said a man of gigantic form who dealing a heavy blow just above the eye of one of the generals friends put him hors du combat and rushing forward said let me come ill see fair play lay it on to him jake jake did give it to him for he continued to thump the prostrate legislator with his heavy fists by this time a score of men had their coats off their shirtsleeves rolled up and with horrid oaths and yells pitched in to the fight in good earnest fists sticks stones fingernails teeth were now freely and very promiscuously employed some had aching sides some blackened eyes some broken pates and others long hideous scratches on their faces or eyes terribly gouged one had his ear bit off another a thumb badly disabled and another a fingerjoint dislocated in the meantime the unpleasant position of the general induced him seriously to devise some method of asking for quarter at length he spoke thus plague on my skin jake if you ant the best man that ever i felt of now you jist git up and go part them women before they hurt one another jake rose immediately but the women had been parted before the generals words were taken as a signal for a general armistice and the fighting soon ceased hang me boys said the general if i dont buy every cake in polls wagon and treat good hoooora for gineral sprawler hooraaa for jake smith shouted the crowd and immediately gathered around the wagon every man filling his pockets with gingerbread at the generals expense the general and jake made friends and a general shaking of hands succeeded jake hitched up his old gray mare and giving the reins to polly whose rosy cheeks fortunately had not been scratched she drove home the dust and smoke of the battle the batterryal as it has ever since been called having cleared away a tall thinfaced palefeatured welldressed youth was seen entering the courthouse the general staring at the youthful visitor showed that he was a stranger in those parts he stepped forward to squire porter who had resumed his seat at the table and bending over said something in an undertone certainly said the squire and the youth taking a thick heavy plank ran the ends in between the logs in each side of the wall at the corner mounted on it and began to speak as follows come now and let us reason together thus spake the voice divine through the mouth of an inspired prophet this message comes to you this day by one who is neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet hear ye my words and give ear to the message which i bring my friends there is a monster in your midst that combines more elements of mischief than any other beneath the sun there is an evil among you which is more destructive in its effects than earthquakes famines pestilence and war would you have me represent in a figure the evil of which i speak there is a spirit in the atmosphere which stirs it into a terrible commotion it sweeps through the land with impetuous velocity with increasing momentum it rushes on tempestuous wing with hideous roar and appalling darkness it spreads over quiet homes and fruitful fields it leaves desolation and ruin behind it houses are thrown down people are buried in the ruins the fields are laid waste and the forest is prostrated on the ground the sturdy oak that long resisted its fury is compelled to yield and kiss the earth with its majestic boughs all nature lies in ghastly devastation the spirit of the tempest is alcohol the thundering roar of its furious tread the horrid blasphemy of human lips the lightning flashing and scathing in its course the keen darting forth of malignant passions the ruin produced human beings murdered wives deserted children in rags plantations overgrown with weeds or passing under the sheriffs hammer and worse than all a poor bloated wretch in the form of man in rags and filth going down to a grave of infamy and a hell of endless torture these are thy doings o alcohol here the speaker pointed at bob pools fivegallon jug the crowd now gathered within and around the house and stood gazing upon the pale thin features of the youthful visitor in mute astonishment hes a temperance man spoke out a voice when the youth pointed at the jug hes an abbilishunist said another hes a bible sicty man said father spavin the oracle of bee gum valley silence let the man talk said squire porter my friends continued the speaker not in the least disconcerted i will not attempt to convince you that intemperance is a great evil the poor unfortunate drunkard knows it is an evil he has felt it bite like a serpent and sting like an adder he thinks of his ineffectual attempts to reform of a wasted fortune of lost respectability of a heartbroken wife of ragged children and the desertion of friendshe feels it to be a dreadful evil he looks upon his repeated falls into the ditch his tattered garments his decaying health his agonized soul and knows that it is an evil no you can never persuade that drunkard that intemperance is not an evil until you convince him that vice is virtue that poverty is wealth that rags are royal vestments that disgrace is respectability that misery is bliss and that hell is heaven his wretched wife knows it is an evil she remembers the hymeneal altar and the plighted faith the early days of wedded love and the hallowed communion of kindred spirits the happy days of peaceful enjoyment but these are fled coldness cruelty neglect and abuse have come in their stead and she knows that drunkenness is an evil his injured children know that it is an evil how anxiously did they once listen to hear the footstep of papa upon the threshold what fire of love kindled and glowed in their eyes as they flew to meet him but he comes now and they flee to the woods for shelter they know that drunkenness is an evil the retailer knows that it is an evil when the poor drunkard has paid him his last dime for that accursed drink which has ruined his family and blasted all the hopes of life when he reels from the bar where he has swallowed his last destructive draught and falls prostrate on the floor the inhuman wretch that has filched his last farthing rolls him out at the door and says begone you drunken miserable sot the distiller knows it is an evil when he takes the precious corn that bountiful heaven bestows for human sustenance and converts it into the whisky in his infernal alembic he can listen unmoved to the orphans piteous cry for bread its an infernal lie shouted a stentorian voice from the crowd say that agin jim rick said jake smith and ill fill your breadbasket with my fist jim rather quailed before this unexpected menace from the champion of the day and in a tone much moderated said well now jake i never heard a olphin cry for bread in my life if i had id a give him some i blieve you would jim but it was mighty imperlite for you to be givin of the lie to that nice young man hush your talkin there jim rick be quiet jake said squire porter and let the man perceed with his speech the youthful speaker remained during this interruption perfectly calm and without the slightest visible agitation continued nor can i depict the extent of the mischief produced by this evil it has spread through all lands it has ravaged every coast it has infested every sea it has filled every prison and every hospital and every infirmary and every poorhouse and every abode of infamy throughout christendom it has prepared a subject for many a gallows a deadly weapon for many a heart a midnight incendiary for many a town go search the records of crime go count the convicts of state prisons go number the inmates of county jails go ask the miserable outcasts from society from kindred from home go among the makers and venders of this deadly fluid and tell the number of barrels that are daily emptied into human stomachs if you would form even a vague idea of its extent well may we ask cui bono now if you want to ax me any thing mister said guy bonner jist ax on if i cant answer you i know who can brother spavin is the greatest scriptorian we ever had in bee gum hold guy said a man whose legs were bent inward and whose eyes were of noncoincident axesin other words knockkneed squinteyed little dick thompson seizing a glass of spirits and approaching the speaker he continued ill let him throw himself outside of a dram of as good corn whisky as ever was made in jim ricks stillhouse if hell tell my name he had scarcely uttered these words when squire porter grasped the extended arm and hurling him back against the wall said stand there dick and hold your tongue i told the man he mout speak and you sha nt meddle with him now then with the most perfect nonchalance and seemingly unconscious of the interruption the speaker continued i ask what good can result from the use of intoxicating drink as a beverage does it benefit the body does it brace the natural constitution against the attack of disease has it ever prevented epidemics or any of the maladies that afflict the human family has it ever effectually removed from the human body any distemper that might not have been removed by milder means has it ever benefited the mind has the intellect been strengthened the judgment matured the understanding enlarged the memory improved by its use has it rendered the mind more peaceful serene and happy has it ever made any man more fit for social enjoyment or enabled him the better to cultivate the virtues of friendship and social life the inebriate it is true does imagine himself happy while he is intoxicated but all his happiness is only a delusion when he wallows in the mud like the filthy swine he imagines himself a prince when he is clothed in rags he imagines himself arrayed in gorgeous apparel while he is suffering for the necessaries of life he fancies that he is in the greatest affluence do you envy that man his happiness it consists in dethroning reason drowning reflection and stifling the voice of his conscience he quarrels with his best friends insults the virtuous and abuses the innocent what good does it do the soul the immortal the spiritual man it destroys every noble sentiment it fills the mind with remorse and horrifies the man with the most terrible forebodings but the moderate drinker the man who either drinks occasionally or habitually but not to excess is better off i admit than the miserable drunkard and yet he derives no benefit but a positive injury from alcoholic drink let facts speak in every place where cholera and yellow fever rage those who use ardent spirits as a beverage are among the first to fall thats as arrant a lie as ever was told upon the face of the livin yearth i had yaller fever last fall said bob pool and drunk jim ricks corn whiskey every day no it wasnt yaller fever daddy doctor walkdown called it yaller janders so said tallowfaced lige as he sat by the big jug with one hand resting upon the corncob stopper hold your tongue lige i say it was yaller fever youre a leetle too smart ill take you a buttonhole lower ill give the nose off my face said lige if doctor walkdown didnt call it yaller janders silence there roared the magistrate i said let facts speak in every place where cholera and yellow fever rage those who are addicted to the use of ardent spirits are among the first to fall i give you not my own opinion merely but the opinions of the most eminent physicians i will refer you to one who for the extent of his scientific knowledge his skill as a physician and the essential service which he has rendered mankind by his medical works is justly styled the immortal rush he shows how erroneous is the popular belief that ardent spirits are beneficial when a person is hot or when he is cold when he is wet or when he is dry when he is at rest or when he is laboring when he is sick or when he is well he says there is no nourishment in ardent spirits the strength they produce in labor is of a transient nature and is always followed by a sense of weakness and fatigue dr sewall late a professor of anatomy and physiology in columbian college spent many years in tracing the effects of spirituous liquors upon the human constitution he prepared a number of plates to represent the injurious consequences of alcohol upon the inner membrane of the stomach these plates exhibit a faithful picture of its ravages at different stages of its usenot upon the inebriate only but also the moderate drinker he has demonstrated the fact which the distinguished rush had proved before that the habitual use of ardent spirits has a direct and progressive tendency to debilitate the moral intellectual and physical powers of man dr gridley says when alcohol is taken in a certain quantity diluted with water as it must be before common use its effect is to arouse the energies of the system and for a while the individual feels stronger but the excitement is always followed by depression and loss of animal and mental vigor it contains nothing that can afford any nourishment to the body and consequently can impart no strength again alcohol is not only innutritious but is poisonous taken into the stomach in an undiluted and concentrated state in quantities of two or three teaspoonfuls it destroys life as clearly shown in accums experiments he concludes thus our fourth reason for the disuse of alcoholic liquors is that any thing short of abstinence exposes to all the dread consequences just mentioned here is the grand hope of our cause total abstinence defies all danger and mocks at consequences with it we are safe without it in peril i have seen a tract in which the names of nearly all the physicians in boston are appended to a declaration that ardent spirits taken in any quantity into the human stomach are injurious let this be our confession of faith as it is of the savants of boston when you get sick you send for a doctor no i dont spoke out a voice from the crowd when i git sick i sends for sal hunnicut for she can beat all creation a givin of lobeely cant she ben tucker well now hal said ben i cant say she beats all creation for doctor walkdown is hard to beat givin lobeely but i do say that sal hunnicut can physic bout as well as any of them bottom savealls at this point the oracle of bee gum valley looking round upon the group of men assembled in the cabin and with grave aspect and rather selfimportant and consequential air said it is my opinion that this business is a speckilation them bostin folks is alvays sendin out some new idees about temperance track and bible sieties theyre for evermore sendin some of their fine edicated men out here to git our money they ought every one to be driv outn the country it ant nothin in the world but a speckilation thats it it ant nothin else responded bob pool be quiet men be quiet said squire porter the young man stood at each interruption calm silent motionless as a statue which his pale this features wearing an expression of deep solemnity and imperturbable equanimity caused him to resemble but as he spoke his features were slightly radiated his voice was clear and well modulated his manner animating but natural as soon as squire porters commanding voice had produced silence the youth continued when you are sick i repeat you send for a physician why because you believe that he is acquainted with the structure and laws of the human constitution the different kinds of diseases and the remedies proper to be used you admit that he is able to trace the effects of any particular substance when taken into the stomach even in cases of disease of rare occurrence you bow respectfully to his authority how much more should you respect his opinions on a subject which he can investigate everywhere as in the use of ardent spirits i have not referred you to the little deceitful empiric you scoundrel said jim rick in great wrath who told you that little hempy rick was deceitful hush jim said jake smith i wouldnt said that forforwell i dont know what its awful jim its awful but i can tell you that hempy does sometimes go round the truth dont you remember what he said tother day about the fox climbin that poplar tree now jim foxes dont climb trees especially when they are as straight and slick as that poplar i think little hempy is a leetle deceitful jim not disposed to engage with jake remained silent and as nobody else came forward to defend hempys reputation for voracity the speaker was allowed to continue i say i have not referred you to the littleminded deceitful pretender to medical skill but to a rush a sewall a gridley and an armstrongmen of intellect men of learning men of widespread immortal fame i will now call your attention more particularly to the nature of alcoholic liquors and their tendency to destroy the digestive powers of the system alcohol is composed of hydrogen carbon and oxygen in the proportion of about fourteen fiftytwo and thirtyfour now every distiller knows that ardent spirit which is composed of alcohol and water in nearly equal proportions is obtained by direct chemical process the elements of the substance used must be separated by vinous fermentation and renited in different proportions to form it that the fruit or grain from which the liquor is distilled does not contain a particle of the intoxicating property is known to every one who is acquainted with the process of distillation to assert the contrary would be to declare an opinion founded on no scientific basis but obviously contrary to the demonstrations of chemical analysis by fermentation gases which do not naturally belong to the fruit are absorbed and uniting with the separated elements of the substance form alcohol and by distillation it is extracted with a considerable amount of water and forms what we call ardent spirit alcohol is therefore the intoxicating principle of all fermented liquors which have different names and contain various properties according to the nature of the substances yielding them brandy for example is obtained from the fermented and distilled juice of the grape and whisky from maize now i will prove by etymology that the fluid which the distiller obtains by the vinous fermentation and distillation is a deadly poison here jim rick looking first at the stout redfaced magistrate and then at jake smith said squire porter jake just let me say one word that fellers a hintin at me i know he is now squire porter ive been a stillin of peach brandy and corn whisky for ever so many year and youve been a drinkin of it all that time well that viny fulmination is as pison as ratsvane ratsbane the vulgar name for arsenic i never put a bit of it in my sperits in my life now i do nt put any maize in my whisky neither i stills my whisky out of as good injun corn as can be made on possum crick or in bee gum valley talk about my puttin of maize and viny fulmination in my corn whisky and provin of it by netty mulligen at this moment a pair of bright eyes flashed indignantly through a crack from the outside of the cabin on the right hand of the speaker and a shrill female voice cried out daddy spavin daddy spavin o daddy spavin tell that man if he says he can prove any thing by me hes got the wrong sow by the ear netty mulligen never was in my stillhouse in her born days was you netty no hoss that i wasnt the imperturbable speaker continued i say i will prove by the origin of the word itself that alcohol is poisonous take first the word intoxicate it is from in and toxicum this is the latin origin pliny informs us that it is from taxa a species of tree and which is in greek called  smilax toxicum is from the greek  toxon a bow or an arrow the barbarians used to poison their arrows and hence toxicum in latin came to signify poison take in the next place the word inebriate it is from in and ebrio as this word signifies to make drunk to intoxicate it bears a striking affinity to the other term the primary idea of the latin word is perhaps to drench and since to inebriate is to intoxicate and toxicum means poison the literal idea seems to be to drench with a poisonous drug we now come to the word alcohol it is derived from the arabic kahala or the hebrew kahal which that learned lexicographer gesenius informs us originally signified to paint the eyes black with stibium or antimony this was its oriental signification which however they subsequently applied to highly rectified spirits now stibium according to one m furtiere poisoned a certain moine or monk and hence in the french language it is called antimoine and this is whence we get our word antimony i admit that the light of modern science has dispelled the delusion which for a long time grew out of m furtieres report that stibium or antimony is poisonous it is now understood to be harmless to the human constitution in its crude state but still our derivation proves that it was once considered poisonous and while it was so considered the term was applied by the orientals to highly rectified spirits it is very clear that they understood alcohol to contain poison we judge then both from its component parts and its name that it is poisonous when we come to trace its effects we shall see that they are most destructive its deadly character has been fully proven again and again by the most skilful physicians they tell us that the great agent of digestion the gastric juice which is produced by the secretories of the mucous membrane of the stomach has no influence whatever upon alcohol whenever it is introduced into the stomach it is left to be taken up on the intestines to scatter unnatural fire through the system to inflame the blood to heat the brain and produce the most disastrous effects ardent spirits in their pure unadulterated state have been discovered in the brain of persons dying from their effects from the nature of this dangerous fluid and its ascertained effects upon the human system even in small quantities we conclude that it is a deadly poison i now ask you most solemnly did it not poison the man that was killed by mania a potu gracious heavens manny porter do you hear that this exclamation and interrogatory proceeded from jake smith he stood the picture of amazement while manny stood up against the wall trembling and pale as death the wretched culprit looked while jake addressed him as if he would sink into the earth jake went on yes you killed him manny you killed poor joe turner ill tell you what it is fellercitterzens im afraid that somethin awful is a gwine to happen the silence of death now pervaded the multitude and the speaker doubtless perceiving the effect of his words proceededhis pale marblelike brow so dazzlingly white remaining unmoved by any of the interruptions with which he had met i say did not alcohol poison the man that was killed by madness from drinking when we consider that this fiery fluid is so deleterious to all the powers of digestion we need not wonder that a man in a spree of drunkenness seldom has an appetite to eat and that for a considerable time after he is unable to retain the most wholesome food upon his stomach this is not because he derives any nourishment from the liquor for we have shown that it contains nothing nourishing to the system but because it has disabled the powers of healthful digestion this remark applies not only to the drunkard but to the habitual moderate drinker true the effect is not so visible nor the immediate danger so great as in the case of the confirmed inebriate but there is nevertheless a tendency progressive almost imperceptible to lay the foundation of chronic disorders and what is infinitely more to be dreaded an appetite for the most destructive beverage that ever entered into the stomach of a man as it is a poison let us treat it as a poison that any man should talk that way about one of the good creturs of god does appear to me perfickly blasphemious why didnt i tell the breethren yisterday at mud crick meetinhouse that ardent sperits is one of gods good creturs and did nt i show from the postle timithy to his son paul that he advised him to take a leetle for his stomachs sake now who can believe that the postle timithy would advise his son paul his own dear child to take a rank pison so spake the oracle of mud creek meetinhouse to whom jake smith thus replied father spavin father spavin i do think it is perfickly awful that you should talk to anto thatthat stranger in that way i feel awful father spavin i feel awful these words of the hero of the day seemed to fall with great weight upon the minds of the people and the youthful speaker proceeded in some extreme cases poisonous substances are employed medically and in cases equally rare it may be needful to use ardent spirits as a medicine for this reason no doubt the apostle paul thought it was necessary for timothy to take a little wine for his stomachs sake but mind you it was only in a case of bodily debility and to be used in a small quantity at that under all other circumstances we ought to abstain entirely from the use of alcoholic drinks as you would not willingly partake of any thing that you know contains a deadly poison treat alcohol in the same way i admit that alcohol is a creature of god and that it was created as were all other poisons for some useful end we may therefore with propriety point out some of the beneficial uses of it it is capable of dissolving the resins and many similar bodies upon which water has no action hence it is useful in making varnish it is capable of dissolving the essential oils hence its use in pharmacy and perfumery some substances which are soluble in water are precipitated by alcoholgum for example while on the other hand water precipitates resins from solution in alcohol it combines with sulphur and phosphorus but not with earths and their carbonates it dissolves sugar soap oxalic tartaric benzoic and some other acids alcohol is extensively used in the preparation of various kinds of ether the results of its action with sulphuric acid differ according to circumstances by varying the properties we may procure sulphovinic acid ether oil of wine or olefiant gas as it remains fluid at the lowest temperature it is advantageously employed in filling thermometer tubes in experiments in artificial cold it possesses great antiseptic properties and hence is used for preserving anatomical preparations on account of its ready inflammability the purity and intense heat of its flame it is conveniently but not very economically employed in chemical lamps usually called spirit lamps it readily dissolves ammoniacal gas and as the caustic alkalies potash and soda are taken up in large quantities by alcohol and as it does not dissolve their usual impurities the solution by distillation yields these alkalies in a state of great purity it is sometimes used in chemical investigations to separate two salts both of which are soluble by water but only one by alcohol for example seawater contains both sulphate and muriate of magnesia and the latter only being soluble in alcohol it affords a ready method of separation these are only a few of the good and useful purposes for which alcohol was created let no man say then that we are for refusing a good creature of god let us use properly but not abuse a thing so useful in its proper place as god has placed the elements of this dangerous fluid in nature and permitted man to combine them in their proper proportions so as to produce it so he has placed various metals in the mineral kingdom and permitted man to discover and use them we have no more right therefore to destroy our own lives or to injure our health or morals or those of our fellowman by the use of alcohol as a beverage than we have to use iron or steel in the form of deadly weapons to cut our own or our neighbors throats let us therefore treat alcohol as we treat other poisonsnever take it into the stomach except as a medicine and that under medical advice this is simply our doctrine of total abstinencenothing less nothing more on this foundation rests the hope of the inebriatethe hope of the moderate drinkerthe hope of the rising generationthe hope of the world what will you do then will you sign the total abstinence pledge no said old mose azant the most inveterate toper on the hill no it would be signin away our liberty our forefathers fout bled and died for liberty and we wont sign it away no says the poor drunkard it would be signing away our liberty our liberty and what liberty has that poor besotted forsaken downtrodden despicable creature why he has liberty to stagger from one side of the road to the other he has liberty to fall down and wallow in the mire like a brute he has liberty to array himself in dirty rags and to starve his wife and children he has liberty to be poor miserable despised and spurned all his days he has liberty to get a broken head a bruised eye battered limbs a bloody face and a very bad name he has liberty to rush down the hill of life heedless mad infatuated to land in perdition itself he has liberty to be kicked out of doors by the man who sold him the stuff that made him so gloriously independent and pocketed his last dime for the same really it is ludicrous to think of a drunkard have liberty he who is the slave of appetite have freedom he who has struggled often to break the chains of a destructive habit who has promised himself promised his wife promised his god promised his friends that he would never touch another drop and then rushed with the impetuosity of relentless craving into the vortex of drunkennesssuch a one enjoy independence it is worse than ludicrous it is a folly of the most stupendous magnitude is this the liberty which your revolutionary fathers fought bled and died to secure heaven deliver us from the galling yoke of such freedom give us king emperor autocrat sultan popeany thing short of the despotism of hell itself rather than the sway of alcohol o ye enslaved minions of whisky turn and today assert your nobler freedom declare your independence of that vile monster who flatters but to betray and blast you for ever you will not sign away your liberty and have you not done it have you not signed away your liberty to rob and steal and murder to commit perjury and treason and arson look at the constitution and the laws do you not stand pledged to support them do you not stand pledged to pay your taxes and to perform your military road and patrol duties did you never pledge yourself in a bond as principal or security in a promissory note or other civil obligation did you never pledge yourself at hymens altar or make a vow or form in the secret chambers of your souls a high and noble resolve to be just and good and true to god and man well what were all these but signing away your liberty to do evil and pledging yourselves to do what is right what says amor patri och ant is it me that you would be afther askin that thin plase your honor put the cart before the horse me name in truth is patrick omore up to this time tabby had been sitting down against the wall with the generals head resting on her lap the combined effects of jim ricks whisky and jake smiths blows had put him into a deep sleep tabby herself seemed suddenly aroused from a state of partial stupor by the brogue of the celt and she broke out thus hes an irishman pat and i bet hes akin to you pon me sowl said pat if he is hes a born gintleman ivery bit of him ant is it for this that ive come all the way to ameriky and cut wood these two years past for jim ricks stillhouse and all to hear you talk so swately like father matthew ant truth didnt i sign the plidge and bring the midal with me but your honor jim ricks cowrn whisky was all to strong for patrick omore what i repeat says patriotism what says love of country why that we ought to be peaceable and lawabiding citizens but look at the crime that flows from the improper use of spirituous liquors look at all the mischievous elements in society that are engendered and aggravated by alcohol look at the criminal courts the jails the penitentiaries the almshouses and other institutions which must be supported at an enormous public expense can any true patriot look at these things and fail to be convinced that it is his duty to sign the total abstinence pledge for his countrys good but says one man i am neither a drunkard nor am i in any danger of becoming one let them take the pledge who need it i do not and will you do nothing for the good of others will you take care to keep out of trouble yourself and use no means to keep others out how selfish pro bono publico squire said guy bonner thats a leetle more than i ought to take to call me poor bonner the publican is what i cant and wont stand with this guy pulled off his coat rolled up his sleeves and declared that although a deacon of mud crick metinhouse he was compelled to resent this open implication of his character why squire porter ive heard brother spavin tell what oudacious creturs them publicans was and to be put down as one of them is too much thats a hard sayin guy i admit says squire porter pitch into him guy pull him down throw him out o doors give him jesse shouted a number of voices within and without the house thus encouraged guy bristled up to the young man rubbing his fists together and grating his teeth as if he was about to chew him to pieces just then pat stepped in between the parties while the youth still stoodlike a marble statue immovable pale but dauntless back guy bonner not a hair of his head shall you touch at all at all hes a born gintleman all the way from me own swate gem of the sea and by st patrick and father matthew and all the saints ye shall not hurt him i reckon brother bonner youd better not do any fightin but it appears to me that these track and temperance and bible siety doins is a gwine to ruin this country thus advised the oracle hes calledthe oudacious cretur has said i was fellercitterzens said jake smith ef you please dont say any thing agin thatthatthatstranger i feel like somethin awful is a comin upon us i repeat continued the youth every lover of his country should sign the total abstinence pledge for the public good it is our duty to rectify the state yes said general sprawler who just at this moment awoke yes and the state will ratify it i told them so i told the honorable sinators that very thing in fact i made the longest speech on ratification that i ever made since ive been a member of the sinate col talkwell the piney woods sinator told me it was the best speech on ratification that he ever heard in his born days im glad sir to see that youre a friend to ratification hoora for ratification i say that we must purify the state of public morals we must cast the weight of our influence and example on the side of total abstinence what then i ask in conclusion is our immediate and paramount duty cast out all mauvaise honte yis yis your honor i will mount him and cast him out immadiately come along old mose azant the gintleman says you must be cast out immadiately and pat laid hold of the old toper who had sunk down to the ground in a state of glorious unconsciousness he dragged him along through the crowd and deposited him safely at the root of the big oak and returning took his station by the young speaker who continued his peroration i say we must cast out all bashfulness all false modesty and go to work like men there should be a general speaking out among the people the inroads of alcohol must be checked the distiller must be persuaded to abandon his infamous art the retailer must be won from his unholy traffic the drunkard must be retrieved from ruin to this end i repeat the people must be aroused the pulpit with its deeptoned sentiment of morality must speak the legislature with its penal sanctions the magistracy of the land with its authority the church with all its mighty moral and conservative power all must speak out upon this vital question teachers parents pupils young and old must speak the voice of the people says the great carolinianuttered under the necessity of avoiding the greatest of calamitiesmay without impiety be called the voice of god let this voice then utter itself from land to land and from sea to sea let it sound out from the mountains and among the valleys and along the plainsyea let it be echoed from the vasty empyrean itselfvox populi vox dei here the speaker descended from the board on which he had stood during the time that he addressed the people the crowd parted he walked out passed off and the assemblage remained for several minutes motionless as if under a spell and in breathless silence at length the stillness was broken by a low halfsuppressed murmur who is he where did he come from whats he up to then they inquired of those whose names he had called outdid you know him guy bonner no you netty mulligen never seed him before in my born days you pat omore niver a bit but hes a born gintleman pon my sowl he is at length jake smith arose and with the most awful demeanor commenced speaking in a slow and solemn tone as follows fellercitterzens i dont believe thats a man hes not flesh and blood did you ever see sich a white face in your born days i wouldnt a said what jim rick and guy bonner and father spavin said for the best farm on possum crick i tell you hes not a man hes an aungel from heaven he knows too much to be a man didnt he know little hempy and guy bonner and netty mulligen and manny porter and pat omore and old mose azant he just knows every thing thats in our hearts and all that we ever done in our lives didnt he tell about manny porter killin of joe turner and yit none of you never knowd him nor seed him before in your born days and then he told all about what alkerhol is made of didnt he say that its got the hydrophoby and the cowborn and the oxvomic in it didnt he show as plain as any thing that its got the viny fulmination and the stibium and the antimony and a heap of pison stuffs in it didnt he tell us that it blacks the eyes of the oriental injuns didnt he tell us all about the greek and the latin and the french and the hebrew and the rorabac languages and then didnt he prove pint blank that the alkerhol has the toxicum in it and the embryo yes fellercitterzens as sure as were here today its got the toxicum in it but the most awful thing to my mind is that its got the smilax in it no doubt in the world this word in the language of the oriental injuns means the smallpox i believe it for hes an aungel from heaven and has come to warn us fellercitterzens jist as sure as jim ricks stillhouse stays where it is we will all ketch the smallpox i mean to hitch up old gray and take poll and move away this is not all as sure as my names jake smith i mean to sign that total abstination pledge o jim rick didnt them last words make you feel awful didnt he say that nasty hempy and the fox and the poplar would die fellercitterzens i feel awful the last time we heard from those parts jim rick had signed the pledge and pulled down the stillhouse little hempy had become a smart young man and is never accused nowadays of going round the truth the fox lived to a good old age and was then gathered to the place where all the good foxes go the poplar was still green and flourishing manny porter had died of mania a potu and pat omore had the good fortune to get the right sow by the ear when he made netty mulligen spinster mrs omore father spavin was dead and general sprawler had become the pastor of mud creek meetinhouse guy bonner found out at last that corn whisky was oudacious stuff and he and most of the breethren had signed the pledge jake smith had become a classleader in the methodist church and to this day whenever he speaks in lovefeast he feels awful as he tells about the aungel that came from heaven to warn the people of bee gum valley to fly from the smallpox squire porter had become a clever local preacher and always closes his sermons with now then i may as well say for the satisfaction of the readerthough jake smith will probably never believe it till the day of judgmentthat the mysterious messenger was only a colporteur of the american tract society who passing through the neighborhood stopped at the courthouse and delivered a temperance speech which he had written and committed to memory gentle reader if you have read the story through and now say to yourself mihi fuit ridiculo just turn back and read the serious part by itself and exclaim o tempora o mores the end

in the cause of truth napier thinks this a characteristic of stickney i think so too the second volume of this work is prepared but i shall not publish it at present i have not yet completed my

covers the face i think such improvement will justify his sitting rely on me if i sketch him i will do him justice thats another strong quality of mine ii council of state a principal obstacle in the way of philosophical dissertation upon the geography and morals of any country is the necessity of going back to the creation of the world for a beginning so that before an author reaches the contemporary age he is ready to die fugit irreperabile tempus and his book is not finished how fortunate must i account myself in this respect when i come to write about floridacountry that was not concerned in the original creationcountry of entirely modern constructioncountry having no part in the book of genesis or of any other book beyond the memory of man it wasnt made agassiz says with ede and therefore didnt fall when adam ought to god knows of falling it has little need t is low enough already thus it has no share in the original sin where no law is there can be no sin exactly so the state has escaped all those petty restraints of the ten commandments and the other decrees of scripture that try mens souls in other lands a result of these facts may be seen in the free and easy life of the country the northerner moving into this blissful state is adapted quite readily to the new condition of things indeed with his natural inventiveness the yankee has improved on the innocent manners of the natives so that your pocket may be picked and your throat cut in less time and with more pain than in any portion of the cannibal islands i cannot say that i have found this condition of society the most agreeable for a man of my temperament to live in but that is a fault of my education which is puritanic we proceed now to consider the proceedings of the council of wisdom which met at fernandina on the night of the th february of the year two of stickney the historian who should pass over this occasion without seizing it to transmit to posterity a series of portraits of the gentlemen constituting that assemblage would but half accomplish the purposes of history the modesty of these statesmen prevents their exposing themselves in too strong a light to the impudent gaze of a too appreciating public in fact they left the north to escape distinction be it my duty to present them to an expectant world in their true colors i fear i may scarcely succeed in this effort as the quartermaster notifies me that my requisition for lampblack to accomplish the work would exhaust the present supply the building to be immortalized in history as that in which the grand scheme for the regeneration of nassau county was developed stands alone upon a marshy square on one side skirted by the burnt posts of an old conflagration on another by a stagnant ditch above whose green scum peer the edges and corners of a multitude of rifled pocketbooks to the rear a great dunghill in whose bowels you discover the cave the residence of that delightful hermit author of an essay on the eighth commandment which i have desired you to read about the door of his abode grow the broad leaves of the poison weed stramonium the author is not a married hermit but he is just as good as married by the mouth of his cave among the stramonium bushes sport several little imps of darkness who call the hermit father and say mamma to a dusky woman of the dominant race the edifice that stands among those scenes i can hardly call grand a more appropriate position one that would give it dignity would be the lower end of a backyard in the village there is no garden before the door but over the front in letters of browne spell it with an e the mystical title tea seas within are two rooms one is black and dark that is the apartment we enter to hear morals and wisdom there is no window in the side of this room and the walls are hung with a drapery of black cotton in one corner is an open chest wherein are the tools of locksmiths and certain queer looking wires and chisels it is marked t c a near this coffer is an old barrel said to have occupied that place for its present purpose more than a score of years it is nearly filled with strange looking fragments of ware in various materials of which brass is prominent the barrel is labelled in nearly wornout letters broken hopes and t c s on the night of the council which designed the conquest of nassau county the black room was lighted by only two candles allsop had charged the board with four so that we may listen in a corner without being observed too strongly by the oracles stickney t c spoke man with small cunning eyes thin lips sharp clean face face that says always dont trust me lips that say to all men alike im your special friend stickney spoke spoke to allsop and browne spell it with an e and the other stickney and robinson andgod knows who says he fellowthieves im in a strait if i dont get gilmore to move im undone if he moves and is unsuccessful im undone too ive lied to him about this state of florida ive lied to him like the devil i can lie when i try im hard to beat at it theres no truth in me robinson interrupted i beg brother stickney said he to cease this egotistical strain i beg him not to claim all the virtues of this gang we have all a share in these brilliant qualities i take nothing from my brother said stickney when he is looking said allsop but continues stickney i came not to this country to be simply a tea sea i feel myself competent as i am willing to occupy a senators chair in the next congress ive superior qualifications to represent the northern population of florida ive lied to the president voices so have i ive lied to chase here too ive been lying and swindling in fact ive done nothing else these fifty years ive never yet accomplished a result but im confident lying is my forte and if i dont succeed this time i never shall i may as well go under amen said brother robinson there remains now said stickney to consider a prime move nassau county must be at once seized by our troops the immense population of scared crackers in this district must be prepared to swallow my politics and robinsons morals if that scheme fail i have another im fertile in schemes i always was given to scheming it is true as i before remarked i have not yet accomplished any apparent result in a half century of scheming but the end is not yet i propose then to demand of the treasury department to secure my interests the method is simple to do it up browne spell it with an e let the general but declare the state abandoned the supervising agent will at once seize it for the treasury im hunks with chase so i go in bully for you senator said browne spell it with an e who arose and proceeded fellowthieves my name is browne spell it with an e i am descended from tubal cain the first worker in brass i came over in the mayflower and spell it with an e spell what said brother robinson spell browne spell it with an e you fool i surrender to no man in my ability to lie i am some on a trade didnt i come from boston didnt i fail in business didnt i try politics and dont it pay isnt it worth something to be a treasury agent to be a bossrobber and have a monopoly of the smuggling business o happy men to be my partners make your manners and say something amen glory to browne spell it with an e cried all i have heard brother stickneys projects for saving the country and especially that part called nassau country im here by authority to take up every abandoned thing in the department of the south except me cried allsop let the army abandon nassau i shall at once take it up in the name of the treasury im a candid man fellowthieves i talk much yes i talk a great deal i lie also oh how i can lie but after all im a candid man when i get possession of florida wont stickney go to the senate eh wont he though at this point the speaker drew down the lid of his right eye as if opening the shutter of his candid mind for investigation of course he continued of course i shall send stickney to the senate and robinson to the devil and as for allsop he will naturally enough fetch up at auburn fellowthieves i bid you goodnight when browne spell it with an e had seated himself up rose brother robinson up as much as he couldrobinson the virtuousthe pious robinsonbut the consumptive robinson who could not get up over much puny paleface robinson exhausted by youthful indiscretions he has given the little that is left to the lord not much to be sure and not a superior quality but the best he has up rose brother robinson the partner of tax commissionersof treasury agents robinson the friend of the poor african when sambo has funds to invest robinson the virtuousthe friend of piously inclined schoolmarms robinson the eunuch au naturel harmless robinson robinsonsuch a robinsonspeaks listen fellowthieves and brethren i feel it my duty to bear my cross on this important occasion i feel myself called upon to bear my heartfelt testimony in short reader you know robinson you know his speecht was like him realizing sensefeeling interestmy mental exercisesas saith the apostlenow i lay me and wound up by declaring he went into this thing tooth and nail prominent features of his just then a flash of lightning a burst of thunder an odor of brimstone in the midst of which the major and i left for we had to attend a iii council of war the mighty of the post were gathered there their sayings are of little weight however in these days of tax commissioners vagrant politicians treasury agents jew sutlers and smugglers nevertheless soldiers were there and sailors and a true official history cannot ignore them unimportant as they are the colonel great genial and jovialthe mellowhearted doublebreasted colonel two majors a handsome fellow from washington to whom the ladies never say nay but the lightest rustle of his name brings a neigh from every horse within hearing the other major a greatbrained clearheaded bigfooted man when he was made somebody spread himself god made a man that time not that he ever does anything else when he puts his own hand to the job but if anybody thinks every individual of the order bimana to be divinely created he is mistaken who do you suppose made the tea seas i know who did not in the conclave sat the captain a bearishlooking fellow with a very bare head like elisha the bear is his guardianangel and avenger he descended doubtless from that prophet or some other of the ancient seersdoublefisted man given to making friends and enemies a sailormantarry fellow brave gentle generous a chap that swings round big ships and walks off with locomotives man worth knowinga mighty human fellowa freeman these sat in council pondering how to do it i think said the captain the best thing you can do is to dump the whole cussed state into okeechobee and annex that lake to the gulf of mexico that is not in the orders captain said major brooks orders be  something i didnt catch from the sailor the major thought he was engaged in prayer i did not however sitting where he did in a dark retired corner i couldnt see the expression of his face but i thought he said damn or words to that effect we must take the state said the major thats the order brooks said the captain id like to see you on the return trip if there be any truth in shakspeare i think your boots will contain a large library of light literature captain says the major youre a mighty bright fellow if your manners were like the top of your head youd be a gentleman of elegant polish in fact captain if the inside of that capital shone like the outside youd be a wit major youre heavy gentlemen says major hay do you remember what the governor of georgia said to the governor of florida at such a time as this no majorwhat was it inquired the colonel governorsaid he t is a long time between drinks what do you suppose the colonel said not a word but he went and did what he always does however thats none of your business who said it was who cares what these soldiers and sailors said to each other they planned and the next day carried into execution their plan for the iv invasion nassau county was inundated by a force of three hundred pennsylvania yankees the order of battle which they didnt fight i have chosen to call the modern vernacular wormy and is not described in any work on tactics that i have yet perused but is nearly as follows the right of the column resting under an aged oak on the flank of camp cooper the left on amelia island nine miles distant the column was in the form of those zigzag approaches by which fort wagner was gained this order was designed and adopted as being a favorite with the commanding general of the department and best adapted to the phlegm of the heavy infantry of pennsylvania the charge was brilliant and successfulthe enemys fire having been silenced a week previous to our arrival by an order of the rebel general to change camp our troops captured a chicken a box of blue pills six cur pups and two cats together with an old woman of notorious fame then filed to the left and countermarched in good order towards home it being stated on excellent authority that the entire force of three hundred men reached fernandina in two hundred and ninetynine detachments the reputation of the old woman being made known to the major commanding he directed that she be entered on the return as abandoned to be turned over by the quartermaster to browne spell it with an e so she was turned over on the return march a loyal rebel was found with a house full of fixed ammunition and fowlingpieces the individual professing to be their owner told us how many cussid yankees they had killed and how bravely they had been handled receiving this statement as a tribute to the bravery of our southern brethren who are still americans although for a time alienated we declared that he must not be molested a general order was at once promulgated and a file of men set for his protection meantime stickney was sent for who addressed him my southern brethren said he im glad to see you once more under that old banner it does look old said cornfed under those stars and them stripes if theres one thing moren another does me good its that to see my old fellercitizens of floridy in all the conglomerate constellation of glory aburning in his and any other man or corner of the world and take the liberal and magnanimous amnesty procla see here stranger said cornfed if youve got anything to drink lets have it my friend with pleasure stickney brought a bottle from his coattail and extended it to the loyal rebel take the oath said he take a drink furst stranger said cornfed shutting his right eye and proceeded to empty the bottle after which he laid down on his doorstep now my friend said stickney heres a proclamationarise and let me administer the oath damned if i do said cornfed gentlemen says stickney this poor benighted man has been misled by his rulers and does not yet comprehend nor appreciate the benignant influences of the benignant and glorious administration under which we live under and benignant andand by the right flank march commanded the major leaving stickney to secure the vote on the doorstep there being nothing in the country worth stealing allsop was directed to return to the bosom of his tea seas the official report of the major commanding is not yet ready for publication it is delayed by the engineer officer who was last seen engaged in taking an astronomical observation through the bottom of a glass this observation being completed with some drafting to ascertain the latitude of the right flank i have understood the engineer has been heard to remark that the latitude of the movement was considerable there can be no doubt of the accuracy of the observation as the astronomer was assisted by the field and staff v conclusion treasury agents and tax commissioners keep your tempers you are as good as any of that accursed tribe that has been hanging on the skirts of the capital during the last twentyfour months hungry dogs all looking for bones you quarrel together when a bone is thrown to you and have no conscience about stealing from your masters if potter doesnt set you straight when he comes down im mistaken in the man t is my opinion stickney cant honeyfugle him would you know who is captain le diable let me tell you he is ninetynine out of every hundred honest men in this department yes tea seas ask any officer with whom you may be acquainted what is his opinion of the agents of mr chase and if he tells you what he truly believes youll cut his acquaintance this is no reflection on mr chase it is his misfortune to have selected indiscreet and dishonest men there isnt a good man here that wants to associate with one of you that is the sum of the matter if you provoke me sufficiently i will hurry up the second volume if i publish it ill make it glorious in the mean time i subscribe myself the

washington st boston mass n b we are now stereotyping seven new works and we shall publish  one in every thirty days they are all books of decided merit and ability and will be read and admired universally   catiuss aremarks to the reader friendly reader  catius has some remarks to make to you before you take his lamp in hand to make your explorations in the cavern of evil every mai who makes a book ought to make for it some kind of a preface and if he can make a good book he can make a good preface to go before it therefore do not be in haste to get hold of the lamp itself but rather read the remarks of catius and learn what the lamp is c now catius ventures to say that if you will but listen to these remarks though extended they may be you will not regret it for if they are not to the purpose catius designs them to be then you may be sure that the rest of the book will in all probability partake of the same infirmity and hence you may be informed at the be ginning and thus escape a greater misfortufne now for who catius is that is a question at present with many and perhaps it may continue as a question for some of the presents that are yet to come one ought not to be so dainty as to refuse to eat meat for the simple reason that he knows not who cooked it if it be well cooked and suits his palate and is in reality whole some andgood ought not that to be enough in its favor to warrant him in taking at least one meal of it when  v vi     catius to the reader the fact is considered that no one can live well by bread alone   catius will now say to theoreader that he is a man and not a woman and that of that there is no mistake this one point of the matter is thus summarily settled and i hence when the critic takes up his pen and disposes the ink in a form that will tell to the world what he thinks of things reltaing to the schemedofnt ethiw if he con sider the work to be weak and effeminate charge it to any poor and helpless female for no female did it fe males have done a good many things lately and among the rest have made many good books but this good book  they did not make let it be understood then that catius is a real live man and he anticipates that as long as he lives he shall continue in his original state how he came by this name some may wish to know why men and things have the particular names they do is a thing that often perplexes many and in this particular case all catius can do is to say that you happen to be one of them if he knew himself the reasons which called into being the set of principles which when in action wrought out for hir the name he now has the audacity to hope will beknown and read of all men he would surely inform you butfcandidlyhe doenoinonvt atdasit tdoes not seem to be demanded to know just why he has this name he will pass over the point with the simple sugges tion that if it has ever been used before that the original owner has in all probability been either shuffled off this mortal coil long ere this or if he has not actually gone he must go soon and be now in his dotage in either case he can have no further use for it and hence it amounts to no robbery   catius to the reader      v however this may be if any one dislikes the name he can do either of two things first find fault with horace for  taking a shine to it and thereby countenancing aa original wrong or else leave it unnoticed and either take another he may like better or if he would be better pleased do without any at all so much for the name catius presumes by this time that some would like to know why he calls the book theognis wegi thatis a laudable wish and without doubt is hbnestly made he will reply by saying that theognis was an old philos opher and was just the kind of an old fellow that catius would have scraped an acquaintance with if both had lived at the some time this would have perhaps been done but for the reason that in the economy of providence it so happened that theognis was born first and a long time intervening before the advent of catius junior theognis finished up his books and passed on and thus catius was deprived of the privilege of ever see incg him even considering the facts in the case catius thought it well to take some steps to perpetuate the old fellowes memory for a time longer and todo this he has put it as the title of his book there is no proof that theognis if he were living now would object to it at all or the doctrine it contains and in the absence of any opposition of the kind catius ventures to take the name and apply it as he desires for the adage has it a silence gives consent and more the law urges that we should consider one innocent of a crime till he is proved guilty if any of the descendants of theognis the venerated are living at this time and feel that the family is dis honored by the use catius makes of the name of their worthy progenitor by callinog on himr he will endeavor to make ample amends to defend himself in a case a vill    catius to the reader like that catius would claim the right to  send for per sons and papers let it be remembered then that catius likes theogniss way of doingbusiness to say the least of it and because he does he takes what of him he is able to find to assist in the task undertaken some one has asked c whats in a name  catius thinks considerable and probably many other w il think so in gagftim ho mh for the venerable theognis the next thing is  why call the thing a lamp this may appear strange to many and the fact chances to be one of the things catius cannot help and as one has said i what cant be cured must be endured   re ally a happy disposal of enclosed space for one to crawl out through well now having fairly got through even out on the other side of the dilemma as catius thinks he is not disposed to take advantage of those less for tunate than himself who inasmuch as they have not discovered the hole to exist are still on the dark side he will talk the matter over briefly and tell those who will give ear what he knows of the matter the book is called a lamp well now if catiuss memory serves him right he called it so for the good reason that he conceived the idea that the word lamp conveyed just the idea he desired to convey nothing wrong in that to be sure catius thinks and honestly enough that some people  to say the least of it and still be charitable in the matterare in the dark as yet and that they need light now he happens to think that this darkness has to do with the mind and not with the body and hence the lamp must be of a kind that will give light to the mind even as an oil lamp gives light to the body it is said in tory that aladdin had a wonderful lamp r so had    catius to the reader      ix theognis and a more wonderful lamp it was than any a knight of arabia ever hadat all events more so than any one of the lamps we read about the lamp theognis had was a spiritual one for what ever has to do with the mind is not of the letter but of the spirit so this lamp of catius is of the same nature and he anticipates it will prove itself to all who take it in handanefficient memns to assistthem ifl theirex plorations in the cavern of evil this last expression without doubt gives birth to an other question and that is why call it the cavern of evil  or if it be a cavern why explore it at all  and but there lest we get overladed with interrogations we will stop here and as the sailors say  overhaul things why call evil a cavern well because the word cavern conveys just the idea the world and catius among the rest has of it cavern signifies a dark place or a big cave a place many can pass into c now the great system of evil as the world considers it is simply a big cave in which the race are and save to those who chance to stand near the mouth or under some crevice or fissure no light comes in some few stand out near the mouth and under the openings namned and these see the light all the rest as they are near or distant from a likefavored situation are proportionately in the dark  catius belonging as he does to the human family has been in there all his life sometimes he has been near the mouth and then has thought things to be pretty well ordered after all then again under the fissures and the light was so comparatively scanty he was uneasy and struggled hard for thekgreater light and in his efforts to regain it he has full often mistaken his way and at the end of the contest has as it were become bewil x      catius to the reader dered fallen asleep for a timej and wlien he awoke has discovered himself to be so far from any openingr as to be almost entirely in the dark this variety of litght and shadow induced him to attempt a study of the na ture of the place he was in and when once more out in the light he was thankful for his deliverance and set himself at work to invent a means to further inform himself irtregard tothe construction of the cavern the materials of which it was composed c he conceived the idea that if he could but invent a light to take with him to the dark parts of the cavern he could then the better make up his report he has at last discovered what in the absence of a better name he calls a lamp the instrument may perchance have been used by others no one in the avern however appearing to be well informed of the kind of element the lamp was catius thought it well to use it in public and not monopolize it for his own good but rather than apply for a patent or even filing a caveat to secure to him the benefit of the discovery he used it much before all men and he will now say that he has explored well most parts of the cavern and finds it to be other than it seems to be by a casual glance at the parts of it that are nearest the mouth and fissures and further hse will observe that nearly all young children are at the mouth of the cakyepp and thatthq daing light from the realm outside leads them to think they  will always remain there or in some better place with them  are a few matured men and women who those in the middle of the cavern urge are  out there  build ing castles in the air  this charge is peradventure to this day brought against catius himself as for the most part it is but young children that are about the mouth of the cavern a   catius to the reader       xi it comes to pass that a persons in their turn are there and fa time see the light and then after having had the experience of that they pass in and are continually moving about at times in the rays of light which come in through the fissures and at others in the dark some by management or it may be by a particular permission of a higher power stay for the most part near the great openings oeabout the fissures and thusard seldom in great darkness  awhile others are less fortunate and are almost entirely in the dark and so continue till they die and are at last removed from the scene of action catius will nowsay to the reader that he has in turn passed through all these spheres and conditions and that he knows well the power of them all he has been into the farthest quarters of the cavern with his lamp in hand and he hasthe pleasure of stating that instead of a cold wet and mossy cave he finds it a realm of splen dor and magnificence the floor is hard pressed by the tread of the myriads that have in past time been there or are now living in it but that the sides and top are well hung with brilliant gems minerals of all hues are there and the whole top like one vast canopy is bestudded with polished stones at the parts where the light comes in throrgh the mouth and fissures like similar openings in a natural cavern the stones are comparatively dim in lustre and are of but a poop water the great opening to the cave catius discovers to be the part where it opens out into the great light which is god who encircles cid entirely surrounds it in all its parts the fissures are other openings which have been made by a power evolved by the worship of the heathen and widened by that evolved by the later ad vancing theology the great opening was one left by the creator at the x     catius to the reader time of creation and the veil which hung before it was entirely removed at the advent of gods son intothe world it was continued as removed by god through his son till his ignominious death and entirely destroyed on the morning of his triumphant resurrection from the tomb at the time of his wonderful ascension the light flowed in with unwonted splendor and it has never ceased entirely nor will it till the cavern itself shall be no more when the light shall cease to be divided and instead of disconnected parts at rill be merged and united in one splendid whole the lamp that catius has discovered he urges to be one invented by the creator himself and that it was put in the cavern so that men might in good time use it for the good of all who dwell therein catius claims not that he is the first who has discov ered the lamp or that has used it but that he doth the best heis able to put it into the hands of others who as he was are still in the dark and need it as much  thus much then for the reasons why the thing is called a lamp and why the great condition is called the cavern of evil and now as regards the other questions as relates to the reason for exploring the cavern catius urges in addi tion as an inducement to what of beauty may be discov ered there that as all persons axe in the cavesiandthe larger portion of them in parts that are dark it is of ben efit to all that explore it well to know as best they may v of its particular construction and by the knlowledge the examination brings to them discover as they may whether the whole is constructed with an anticipation to continue as it is now or whether there may not be great doors which are in good time to be opened and not only the great light of god flow in and illumine all   catius to the reader      xlii but that rather the dwellers there may each one of them in their turn pass out through them and dwell forever in the great realm anl source of all light itself catius has now in brief given his reasons c but as some are doubtless still unsatisfied that they may be the better prepared to use the lamp he will converse with them a short time longer and speak oqf the lamp itself it is but a lamp in allegory and the whole is made up of the common ideas and elements of hu man life of the characters who figure in the allegory catius will briefly speak first among them appears maleia a good old man of eighty years full of intel ligence and possessing a turn and kind of mind well anticipating an ability to do tte things for the perform ance of which the office inr the allegory was created if it be allegory then the reader will not of course de mandmthe reason why maleia was singled out as a par ticular name and as we all are agreed catius will not delay to argue long on this point maleia has many good qualities to recommend him he is from first to last as true as steel and honest to the letter he never for once is in doubt as to the truth of his theory and is as catius thinks judicious in his methods of communi cating the information he has he displays a good de gree of discrimination and propriety as o when he shouldi  discdiurse as he tms it and wheh to hold his peace  he adapts his themes to the time and circumstances of the particular case and better than ally he sets a worthy example for the imitation of every one who would lead an honest life what if he has said some things that have been said by others t he simply quotes and does not cut short his discourse  till he has named his authority and for the most part he pronounces it first xv     catius to the reader it is nothing to his discredit that he thus quotes for in these acts he but exhibits his willingness to trust to the opinions of others whom he considers and acknowl edges to be greater than himself if the things said by the ancient masters were worth saying to men of their time they are worth repeating to those of ours the adtors in the allegory are the lamp thewords they utterts the oil withinffit   so much then for maleia catius now leaves the good old philosopher to be dealt with by all with whom he may come in contact and in closing he has but to say that if the readers interviews with him shall prove as pleasant as have been those held by catius but little censure will come for having spoken favorably of him there are but few men living nor has there ever lived but few men like good ot honest maleia then next in order comes edwin maleias friend and pupilan upright intelligent young man courteous kind and respectful to the letter and above all devout and an honest inquirer for truth his whole character one rather remarkable catius confesses to be sported by a high holborn draper but never mind all rules have exceptions phelim the jester claims a passing noticehe de serves more  in spite of at however catifts wouldpre fer to be excused from the tisk of dissecting his charac ter or meddling with it at all for he confesses that at the earliest part of his criticism many things of an uninviting nature present themselves as elements of his being his tendencies to evade the truth and unflinchingly and in a barefaced manner attempt to outwit his entertainers in any one but phelim would demand and deserve commis eration and at times a severe censure   catius to the reader      xv his peculiar temper of mind displays a deplorable lack of what makes a man manly but take him  all in all his keen perception strangrely trammelled though at times it be continually makes him of note somehow and in some manner his wit and humor if it does no more retheves the sombre tints in the picture of the austere element of character andtemper in the nature of maleia he is honest and above suspicion phelim is the opposite and of all the company antd by them all himself not excepted he is an object of a continual apprehension he talks without thinking maleia thinks without dis coursing all the thoughts of phelim are gairish those conceived by maleia are sedate and wise maleia is the positive phelim is the negative the former is the good and the latter is the evil it is but the needed opposite and such being the elements of nature in each catius could not as he stood with his lamp in his hand fail to discover that phelim was just such a fel low or composition of particular elements as the scheme demanded to make itself complete phelim has his faults  who have not theirs  he had more than he ought to have had say some how asks catius in reply do you know that his peculiar element pf haracter in one directions was no more intense in its nature and bearings than were those of maleia in the opposite he was no farther off from maleia than maleia was from him and who but god alone knows which of the two in consideration of their original nature was nearer the great divine centre of all truth and good we let him pass now phelim figured well whence figured at all and he performed his mission peculiar as it was lite as well as any fool ever does and of all men who xvi     catius to the reader live fools represent and bring out some phases of hu man nature the best as natural as a fool  is no un frequent saying catius imagines that but few comparatively will pre fer to imitate phelimy and to give to his methods of ac tion the preference of all the trjo and esteem his ele ments of character the most important and desirble for imitation if such be the case with any catius has but to remark to such a one that he submits to the result that may come of the mistake for that to all such na ture has been liberal in the bestowment of a power that permits them to be a puppet in the side show of the great caravan of human life if some must be showmen there will be things to show but as a sort of advice of catius borrowing the method of thought from maleia he would say let him who would be the showman rather than the things showed beware how he imitates any body or any thing whose demeanor of operation provokes but a low raihge of human thought and more than all let him that finds himself at any time unwittingly in pos session of those elements so govern himself that but few will discover thepecuiliar properties he chances to pos sess for if he exhibits these qualities to a sufficient de gree he will in time surely be caged and exhibited for the entertainmentt of otherswhao though many of them although they may be really lower in the scale of being than he is still by the exercise of their ability to  keep shady escape the snare of the tricksters who loiter about in the highway of human life there is one more personace pardon the expression kind reader but how better could catius express it that is entitled to a consideration and that is dido he lived and acted just as much and as really as did any other body  dogs have their day and didohad his   catius to the reader      xvi of what breed he was or just how he looked whether his tail curled or was cut of  whether his ears were long or short hung down or stuck up whether his legs were long or short slim or chubbed whether as a whole he was gaunt and slim or fat and kinky  whether his progenitors were relatives of ihe stock of mastiffor hound pointer setter spaniel terrier or even a mixture of blood from some two or of all whether he was big or small white brown yellow or black c c are questions catius is aware will in turn be revolved in the brain of many who may chance to hear of him but to answer all these interrogations would take a much longer time and thats money and patience which is a thing etf more value than moneyt for money will not buy it than catius deems it expedient to assume he is burdened nith it will be left to the reader to decide as best he may just what kind of elements of nature and in what pro portionate quantities and how relatively disposed was required to produce the effort that was developed and en gendered by dido there will in all probability be some slight differences of opinion catius knows but he does not care to let that disturbhim for at whatever conclusion different critics arrive it will be but justsuch a conclusion and that alone as they shall think most favorably of and hence the chances are that ten to one each can do better for  himself than catius could do for him considering it better to let each judge as seemeth to him best catius will leave the matter rather than pursue it further and he will now take a respectful leave of the reader he had the foregoing words to say to him and now he has said them he has not said allhe might say by any means but he has said all he thinks is demanded d     xviii    catius to the reader so now kind reader if you please take the lamp in hand and begin your investigations do not look for too much light at one time nor for too much in any particular place you may fancy it would be pleasant to have it at the same time you want it more in another place the lamp will emit light enough to properly illumine all the space immediately about you and for the most part will make all agreeably light it promises and therefore you may well anticipate nothing more for tis but a sim ple lamp and not a sun the time has not yet arrived when the great doors will be opened and the sun of om nipotent powerpour in and at one effort illumine all when you have by the light shed from the lamp and that which comes by affinity to it viewed well all that part of the cavern in which for the time being you may chance to stand push along and take a view of other parts and so repeat the act till you have surveyed and looked upon all dont find fault because you cannot at times see more things than are immediately about you for what matters it if you do not see all at once if it so be that in turn you may examine and judge of all  the thing you attempt to measure is next to infinity and the meter you measure by is but of a finite make and composition theognis claims to be at lamp and not a sun the former will discover as many things as will the latter if it be taken with us to places where the sun would shine and discover the once hidden good and now reader catius takes a kind leave of you and in so doing tells you plainly that he does not claim that his lamp is perfect and hence when you use it you are at liberty to call it imperfect and to the degree you think it is so and although it be in reality catius that still will continue to talk with you through the persons   catius to the reader      xix in the allegory yet he would now ag his last desire request you to lose his present particular character in that of those he shall speak through he would have you so dispose your mind as to consider them each respectively in their turn speaking to and with each other and you listening to their

civil war i used to contribute articles to the new york sledger for pay during the war i wrote very little because i found that it did not pay much as fighting was above par and writing at a discount after a while i stopped altogether when the war ended i began again this is the reason why i began viz i received a note from mr bonheur proprietor of dexter and also of the new york sledger mr bonheur proposed that i should write a story if he had suggested that i should build an iron clad or carve a statue of his friend commodore vanderbilt i would have done it although i know nothing about either business so as he told me to write a story i of course made up my mind to do so at once and did so at once i do not pretend to write as well as wordsworth or tupper or crabbe or augustin daily or artemus ward or dickens or fanny fern nevertheless im some on a story as well as on a sermon at least bonheur think so he likes my style he pays his money and takes his choice if i had let myself out my story would have been so interesting that people would have read it through at a sitting to prevent this i let is come out once a week in the sledger and endeavored to make it as uninteresting as possible it was my desire that when my book came out people should read it through slowly and take it up at times to refer to again therefore i made but little plot to speak of or not to speak of and introduced a great number of characters who have nothing at all to do with what little plot there is the reader is therefore induced to reperuse the book in order to find out why these characters were introduced and thus my object is attained there is a certain largeness of moral feeling about the story and a corresponding largeness of size about the book itself considering the smallness of the plot i wrote this story in the summer my previous contributions to the sledger were considered some this effort is someer i call gnawwood a summer child i am the childs father gnawwood covered a large quantity of manuscript when i had finished writing the last line of the last chapter i wrote a note to bonheur the note is almost as good as the book itself it ran thus my dear mr bonheur gnawwood is finished i have done writing it when i began it i was sorry now that it is finished i am glad as i wish to advertise my father as well as you and myself and gnawwood and at the same time to puff my sermons i propose to relate an anecdote the anecdote is funny one day when i had spread myself more than usual my dear old father was trotting along home from church when an old lady complimented me on my sermon my dear old father was conceited enough to claim the compliment for himself for said he had it not been for me there would have been no henry warred and had there not been any henry warred you could not have heard this sermon this story is exceedingly funny but to make it more facetious still i would call your attention to the moral the moral is that gnawwood is my sermon i mean my childmy summer child and you are my father and gnawwoods grandfather therefore if anybody should be fool enough to like gnawwood you can poke him with your finger and remark bully for you if it had not been for me you never would have had my grandchild this is the end of the letter now i begin to talk again in the preface no one can imagine how true is the last paragraph of the letter i wrote to bonheur i regard him as the best friend i have in the world i love him like a brother this is the end of the preface introduction since the introduction of railways a very large number of travellers go to new england every summer many of them visit the cities only and therefore learn nothing about new england character this is because the city folks have no character at all the country people have character and characters too for i have introduced the latter into the story of gnawwood let me introduce the reader into the village of gnawwood i have introduced the word introduce so often here because this is the introductory chapter of the book look with my eyes dear reader upon gnawwood dont look with your own eyes or you may not like it quite so well it is in massachusetts and has five thousand inhabitants these inhabitants are divided into three classes there being one thousand six hundred and sixtysix and twothirds in each class the first class is higher than the middle the middle is lower than the first and higher than the third and the third class is low down and of no account gnawwood is so called because this was the place where wooden nutmegs were invented the people who bought these nutmegs found that they were sold and had to gnaw wood gnawwood has streets it also has a main street there are elm trees in gnawwood gnawwood or conway or lancaster without elms would be like christmas without eggnog hadly without elms would be hamlet with the part of the dane omitted hatfield or northampton without elms would be horrible springfield without elms would be a failure new haven without them would be as great a humbug as jupiter without his mustache and beard oh glorious elms grand elms magestic majestic elms beautiful elms graceful elms wide spreading elms tall elms handsome elms oh magnificent vegetable of the temperate zone oh elms elms elms elms oh elmtrees elmtrees elmtrees elmtrees let us now enter gnawwood through an avenue of elms elms elms elms elms elms gnawwood or new england life in a village first part of gnawwood before the war the first character in gnawwood that i am going to present to the reader is cathwagon his first name is aby aby was a farmer but if you had seen him on a bench any kind of bench you would have pronounced him every inch a judge his parents left him no money but that mattered not because he had never at any time in his boyhood had more than four dollars and seventyfive cents in his pocket he never saw a five dollar bill in his youthful days nevertheless when he was eighteen he bought his time from the old man for two hundred dollars cash up and no credit he was six feet in his socks carried his fathers blessing out into the world with him and wore a bran new suit of clothes cathwagon drove a team of mules and was a horse trader he loved horses and mules people tried in vain to buy his team but he would not sell he fed them on indian corn and other things he cleared two hundred a year for five years and then courted rachel loosecomb rachel was her fathers daughter and her father was a deacon she had a sneaking kind of fancy for cathwagon and he for her one day as they were walking home from church he made up his mind to pop the question to rachel so he pulled a flower from between the pickets of a fence broke it to pieces blushed and was confused he asked rachel how she liked the sermon she remarked that she liked it especially the text he then asked her to marry him and she said she would then both were silent neither party knew what to say cathwagon grew nearsighted he saw neither the trees nor the long rays of sunlight that were slanting across the fields he felt solemn he remarked rachel this is for everthen he repeated forever and said no more rachel said nothing at all they were engaged to be married cathwagon was a different manhe was not himselfhe was some one else altogether cathwagon married rachel they had several children that we have nothing to do with and two that we will have a good deal to do with in gnawwood one was a boy and the other a girl the boy was named barton the girl alice old ebenezer wentforth lived in gnawwood people called him uncle eb he was a religious man and went to meeting regularly he could talk like a book on theology and bothered all of the parsons in gnawwood he was so honest that any man would think it a pleasure to die just for the sake of making uncle eb executor of his estate he had a son named ruben says he to his son one day reub old fellow guess what i want you to be a lawyer says reub nary time says the old man a gold broker no guess again a segar store man not much a parson try it on once more a schoolmaster dont make enough money only fit for a woman no old boy i want you to be a doctor so reuben was an md and he took unto himself a better half and you may bet a half he had children the first child was a girl and they called her rose rose wentforth is the female hero of gnawwood rose wentforth was born under a cloud that is to say under several clouds she made her entrance upon the stage of life to the tuneful accompaniment of a clap of thunder and was a thundering girl especially when she joined the army as a nurse but i anticipate when the thunder clap sounded dr wentforth bared his head as if he heard some message when it was over he put his hat on again as if he was going out to mail an answer mother taft was in the house when the baby was born she was a kind of amateur midwife and a religious woman the gnawwood people were all religious and used to go to church to hear the sermon and talk scandal they made spiteful remarks about dr wentforths wife and called her old and ugly and envied her rings and called her proud when church let out they curried favor with her and promised to call and all that sort of thing judge pork went to church in gnawwood so did the miss marshes who were old maids so did mr nedwards and his sister and a great many other people hiram lager used to stand at the church door and devil all the young girls deacon brownstone was a gnawwoodite and had a wife named molly he had a housekeeper named agate bustle agate was economical she could buy a shillings worth of anything for a cent brownstones wife was a curious woman she never laughed in her life she went once to see mark smith in one of his funniest characters and wept copiously the whole time she attended prayer meetings as regular as clock work uncle tommy taft drank liquor and got very drunk sometimes he had one leg and was proud of the one he didnt have it was made out of wood and he thought it funny to call it old smasher it was not funny hiram lager used to poke fun at old taft and called him dotandgoonethis was not funny either tommy got talking philosophy one day to agate bustle but miss bchawed him by telling him that he ought to have died when he was small then he felt small but he didnt die parson gruel used to talk religion with dr wentforth in the first edition of my book i headed the part with this talk in it a sober chapter but some people found it too sober and dry so ill leave it out it had fine talk in it on both sides almost as good as my sermons if agate bustle had been born any where else but in new england could she have been called agate if so why not this is a conundrum she was a stern woman whose father died from the effects of hard drinking when she was thirteen years old she was savagely religious and meddled with rose wentforths bringing up in a very impudent and busy body style pete lumbermill is one of the low comic characters in gnawwood he deserves to have a carte de visite to himself he was six feet high and wore stockings instead of socks he was called lumbermill on account of a stupid remark he made one day when some one told him a funny story about a lumber mill that cut off a bears tail pete said that he could go through the mill and come out hunkydory bringing his tail behind him and so forth he could chop wood better than good old abe lincoln himself he caught a trout once with a mouse for baitthe trout smelt a mice but was caught nevertheless but its time to have some plot i want to begin the story several years have passed rose wentforth has grown up her brother arthur has been born and has grown up too barton cathwagon is a man alice cathwagon is a woman they all live in gnawwood still i am going to begin directly i wish to spread myself first on a description of a new england sunday a new england sunday is a big thing it can give any other sunday fifty points in the game and beat it all to smash a sunday in new york isnt a circumstance to a gnawwood sunday brooklyn comes nearer the mark but does not hit it in the bulls eye in gnawwood on sunday the sawmills stop working the carpenters are idle the blacksmiths knock off crows caw and other crows cawcaw in response the bobolinks sing hymns and all the birds join in the sun comes out and shines with extra brilliancy the hens cackle hallelujah and roosters crow in psalmtunes all of the gnawwoodites go to church when brother wentforth was a little boy and his papa asked him what is god he gave a funny answer but now he has grown up and knows better on sundays the wentforths and the cathwagons used to call on each other and talk church all of them were religious let us return to our mutton as i have before remarked it is time to have some plot an important event was now about to happen i must beg the reader not to get too much excited over it it created the wildest kind of a sensation in the two familiesthe wentforths and the cathwagonsand it was talked over so much that every body began to grow disgusted with it barton cathwagon announced to his mother one day the startling intelligence that he wanted to go to college dont get excited dear readertake it easy he announced it boldly in a calm and steady voice his mother was thunderstruck she said gods will be done as if her son had proposed to keep a faro bank and it could not be helped then she pausedand then he paused she then poked the fire and remarked that she would consult the old man the old man consentedand barton was first sent to school to a mr nedwards mr nedwards was tall thin with a large gray eye only one eye which was mild in repose but kindled like an eagles under excitement his face was white i mean to say that nedwards was not a nigger the time came for barton to go to college he had progressed well under the tuition of the white faced man was rose wentforth glad or sorry that barton was going to college she was glad did she love barton it would spoil the plot to tell this yet did barton love her yes he did this is the beginning of the plot of gnawwood as it will not do to have too much exciting plot all at once ill write a chapter now on mental philosophy which is to be read or skipped on second thoughts however i believe ill skip it myself and drive ahead with my interesting story barton cathwagon went to college he carried with him his fathers blessing his mothers heart a trunk of clothes a prayer book a hat box and some small change before he left gnawwood he had as good a chance to pop the question to rose wentforth as any man could wish for but he spoke in enigmas and made a fool of himself generally he began by hinting that he had an important matter to speak about then he added that he left her with god and so went off leaving her in a disgusting state of uncertainty as to his real sentiments in gnawwood religion is mixed up with everything even with courtingthe last named article is not improved by the mixing he saw rose once again after this interview and although she played the piano for himhe did not come up to the scratch she played one of beethovens pieces and the sabre de mon pere from la grande duchesse but still it was no go so she shut up the piano in disgust cathwagon swore that he would be true to his duty but he did not say how and be a man and accomplish somethinghe neglected to state what so help him god barton went to college and frank weasel comes upon the scene the plot thickens and its perhaps time that it should frank weasel was a painter from boston he came to gnawwood and fell in love with rose wentforth right off and then wrote a letter to his mother as followsthus my dearest mother i am a hero people here praise me so that i am half crazy with conceit it happened thus a horse ran away with a buggy in the buggy was the sheroe of my tale her name is rose the horse kept running but i grabbed the reins and brought him up short a man named hiram ale or hiram lager or something of the sort snatched rose out of the buggy her father is a doctor with a grand head i want to paint it her mother is a nice woman they both prayed and then invited me to the house im hunkydory and as happy as a clam at high water i wish you were in gnawwood i shall write you every day postage no consideration this was franks first letter in the next he informed his mother that he had made a discovery the discovery was that rose was his ninetyfourth cousin then he wrote some more lettersthen more again in one of these letters he hints that he is in love with rose and that he drinks liquor for says he i am strangely affected by miss rose as by no other person in the world she sobers me while frank weasel was having a gay old time with the ladies and assisting them in getting the tea things ready for a big eat and whilst barton cathwagon was in college studying his greek for the next mornings recitation parson gruel judge pork mr nedwards and mr brett all gnawwoodites and all religious were lying under a great elm elm elm talking about enjoying money pork opened fire by accusing brett of being mean brett was such a nervous man that his whole body talked as well as his mouthhe had a bad case of st vitus dance he defended his meanness and claimed to be charitable then gruel dipped in and went on bretts side then brett said it was not religious to indulge in luxuries then they all talked real gnawwoodite talk a mixture of religion and philosophy with money matters thrown into the dish to season it when frank weasel returned home lewis heswip a friend of his who had long hair and smoked incessantly poked fun at him about the change that had come over him and asked him what was up he did not acknowledge the corn and own that he was in love he got tired of painting and wanted to join the theatre his mother smelt a mouse and was in favor of the match he went back to gnawwood and the old lady went along with him this trip barton cathwagon was going to graduate he was coming home the plot thickens more and more when barton made his speech at the college commencement tommy taft applauded so loudly with his foot that its a wonder he was not put out rachel was there toocathwagons mamma when barton rose she thought it a vision was this her own son was this the baby that she had brought forth was this the child that she had washed and dressed and spanked so often was this the dirty faced little boy that used to work in the farm at gnawwood oh no it could not be of course not by no means and yet hold it was tis he aye tis he my noble dirtyfaced boy his voice however sounded strange in her ears she did not recognize it she scarcely heard what he said she grew hard of hearing not to say downright deaf barton delivered the valedictory and the entire audience shed tears after the show was over and the commencement had ended people congratulated barton also his father and mother and they were all proud and thankful dr gruels wife was sick she got worsethen worse still and she died on the day she pegged off her husband asked rose wentworth is she worse rose replied no she is better this was the gnawwood and religious style of saying she had kicked the bucket and dr gruel who was posted in this kind of talk understood it readily so he said god help me and god helped him nevertheless he did a foolish thing in fact one that bordered on insanity after his wife was as dead as a door nail he remarked eliza speak just one word speak oh my wife but she spake not she couldnt do it she was dead what was the one word her husband wanted her to speak this is another conundrum let us draw a curtain here tommy taft remarked that the death of mrs gruel was a greater loss to her husband in particular than to gnawwood in general no doubt it was barton cathwagon had religion on the brain and love on the brain at the same time and between the two he got obfuscated and sentimental so much so as to excite serious apprehensions in the minds of gruel wentforth and the entire crowd of old fogies he wrote stupid letters to himself in the form of a journal and full of the two brain diseases he suffered from in a letter to himself dated august st he states that a southener southerner named tom strawwood is coming to gnawwood enter tom strawwood again the plot thickens exceedingly thomas strawwood hailed from the south of mason  dixons line and he had a mother who lived there his aunt being out in gnawwood and tom had come on a visit to said aunt his mother and his aunt who was her sister loved each other a great deal tom was rich and healthy and had a good mind his head strange to say was not turned by the society of cultivated tivated people and stood quite well upon his shoulders he was not proud although he was one of the f f vs he liked gnawwood at first he put up at the mansion house but afterwards bunked at his aunts probably to save board tom had a brother named hal and being touched with cacoethes scribindi used to write as many letters to him as frank weasel wrote to his mother in his first letter to hal he remarked the nasal twang i am practising he soon learned to speak through his nose and to say apple sass like the yankees in his second letter he remarked that he liked hiram lager and that there was not a man like hiram in virginia he wanted to buy a horse and offered lager twenty dollars to find a good one for him hiram laughed not in his sleeve but down in his belly and thought him green strawwood was pleased with alice cathwagon and rose wentforth but im not going to let him marry either one because he hails from virginia tom used to talk politics he said it will be a terrible day for our country if the north and south should go to arms he was about right josiah tallowchandler toms uncle lived in gnawwood and was rich he hasnt much to do with the plot of gnawwood but i may as well mention him anyhow he had a mission his mission was to make money and keep it he made it and kept it he never speculated in gold or petroleum yet he grew rich he had a library and liked old books perhaps because they came cheaper than new ones im tired of tallowchandler lets leave him in his library he wants to read some plot is coming now a love scene frank weasel had made up his mind to pop the question to rose wentforth but she wouldnt let him one day as they were seated on a sofa frank was just on the point of letting himself out when rose remarked dont say it frank its no use old fellow i only love you like a brother only this and nothing more then roses voice trembled and her face was suffused with blushes she looked weasel square in the eyes and he saw that it was no go he however remarked one word miss wentforh and then she found fault with him for saying miss why said he you dont want me say mister do you not much i dont she replied try cousin rose and he tried cousin rose but was down in the mouth for he was a kicked man anyway you can fix it then there came a storm and frank went up to his room and sat by an open window in his night shirt he didnt mind catching a cold oh no not he he rather would have preferred an attack of pneumonia than otherwise a chill crept over him however and he put on a cloak but he was no warmer and so he did the most sensible thing he could do and what he should have done at the jump viz he shut the window and retired to his bed he had a livery stable full of nightmares and was sick all of the next day nevertheless he was not a broken man he was only cracked a little and he was never so strong as now he could hold out two bags of shot at arms length tom strawwoods aunt mrs chandler wanted tom to marry rose wentforth and tried to make up a match she said she was no match maker but she lied she pumped tom one day to find out if he was engaged to anybody in virginia he said that he was not engaged and remarked to his aunt in a very conceited manner that if he said snip to rose wentforth she would say snap he soon found out his mistake rose rather fancied barton cathwagon and neither tom strawwood nor frank weasel stood a ghost of a chance frank weasel packed up his traps and went home one day they all went out on a nutting expedition and tom strawwood fell into a pool of water he was only in the pool a moment but rose wentforth thought it an age nevertheless she did not love tom alice cathwagon did and fainted tom did not love alice strawwood was carried into the blue room and he felt blue and wet he got better one day whilst he was sick alice cathwagon sat by his bed he was asleep surely he moved remarked alice no he didnt his eyes are shut a few days after this he and alice had a talk the most curious thing was that he remembered all about the nutting but nothing more alice were you there when i pitched into the mud puddle i was was i climbing you were was rose climbing why no how came she to fall then she didnt come to fall at all how did i fall you slipped didnt she slip why no she did not she had nothing to do with you i am sure she had said tom which was extremely polite not to say giving the lie direct to the lady alice then grew disgusted with the conversation and so tom dropped the subject as he had dropped into the pool tom strawwood found that it was no go with rose wentforth so he let the thing alone he received a letter from his brother hal telling him that his father advised him to push for the south as soon as possible as a war was coming so he pushed and in the middle of february took a steamer from boston and went to charleston south carolina old tommy taft who lived in gnawwood took it into his head to die in gnawwood just to make this book interesting barton cathwagon had gone off and wanted to live in the west rose told this to old tommy and old tom remarked i shant see him agin tom knew that he was going to peg off rose knew it too and one day as she was bidding the old man good bye she said i shall never meet you again until we meet in heaven then tom was disgusted for although he had made up his mind to die he didnt like to have the thing thrown into his teeth in such a flatfooted and unceremonious style so he remarked what are you snivelling at i aint dead yet but he did die though and barton came back in time to be in at the death when he was dying he spoke funny things he said to barton stand up boy turn round there he is now im all right and so forth but he was all wrong he was on the last quarter stretch of lifes race course he invited through barton all the children to come to his funeral his last dying words were kiss me barton kissed him affectionately then he smiled and kept on smiling though no one saw where the laugh came in without sound of wings or foot fall he had departed on his last journey when people die as a general rule there are sounds of wings and foot falls but not so with old tommy taft he died without making any noise or fuss he was dead the old man was not there he had literaly speaking gone of requiescat in pace the gnawwoodites like funerals and so of course everybody turned out and went to old tommys the children all went too as old tom had requested the funeral was a big thing for gnawwood and old tom taft of course everyone that went to the funeral talked about religion in general and tom in particular they rather enjoyed it than otherwise dr wentforth and barton cathwagon had a long and interesting discussion which the reader can read or skip i believe ill skip it the reader may do as he pleases old tommy taft was put a half dozen feet underground he has gone to that bourne whence no traveller returns he has come to his end and the first part of my story of gnawwood has come to an end likewise part second during the war there was trouble ahead the people of south carolina had grown to be disgusted with the union and wanted to kick out of the federal traces if they had known beforehand what the result would be they would rather have borne the ills they had than fly to others and so forth major anderson had cut stick from fort moultrie and gone to fort sumter the people of charleston made up their minds to take fort sumter if possible general beauregard was then in command and some how or other tom strawwood got intimate with the general and was let into all his secrets when beauregard sent a message to anderson about evacuating the fort of course tom strawwood went along beauregard wrote to anderson to say that if he anderson would state the time when he would make himself scarce and promise that in the meanwhile he would not use his guns against his batteries unless his beauregards guns should open on sumter he would not fire upon the fort anderson replied that he would be compelled to pull up his stakes in a couple of days but added that should beaurys guns open on the fleet he anderson would pitch into said guns of course therefore beauregard was obliged to let out at once on sumter before the fleet could come in to bring supplies tom strawwood in his account tells half of andersons reply only so as not to spoil a good point in gnawwood and a popular one the point is that he wanted to say i was petrified i scarcely believed my senses on hearing that beauregard was going to pitch in at once he said so and when sumter was taken he grew disgusted and felt loyal to the flag wherefore he went straight to virginia and mirabile dictujoined the army on the confederate side let us return to gnawwood on sunday morning the th of april  it was known that sumter had surrendered the scales fell from mens eyes there was war the gnawwoodites were disgusted with drgruels sermon because there was no allusion to politics or war in it but he let himself out in the prayer and so made it all right on monday the th lincolns proclamation came out and was telegraphed to gnawwood and in fifteen minutes after the news reached this wide awake place there was a company at its head arthur wentforth roses brother aged  years was a member of said company they all marched at once to the front before starting cathwagon wrote a love letter to rose and sent it by pete lumbermill but pete got drunk lost the letter and never said a word about it barton had never told rose in plain english that he loved her though he had a thousand good opportunities of doing so in this letter he came up to scratch but she never got the note mrs wentforth was telling rose how handsome barton had looked in his soldier clothes rose was silent for a time and them with enforced naturalness asked did you say that barton left any word for me nario word said mrs w rose was unhappy and disgusted cathwagon was made a major in short order and as he was as brave as lion and fought like a couple of wild cats he was soon made a colonel and before the war ended was general cathwagon he was promoted as rapidly as the funny man in la grand duchesse young arthur wentforth was shot in the neck in the battle of bull run he was killed on the next day a telegram was received in gnawwood saying that he was dead i had him killed because i didnt know any better disposition to make of him in gnawwood agate bustle opened the telegram mrs wentforth came into the room what is it agate speak agate spake arthur has gone up said she slowlysolemnly and sternly though i cant myself imagine why sternly except that agate was a stern woman dead dead agate whose dead arthur wentforth is defunct how is he dead why did he die agate found these questions stumpers and answered not but kept on looking stern and even when mrs w fainted she still remained stern and as cold as an ice cream churn when dr wentforth heard the news he was intensely calm alice was excited but grew calm after a while she had expected to hear of her brothers death he had come to her in a dream and told her the news in advance the clock ran down at the very hour that the ball had hit arthur they ceased to keep time together the clock knew that arthur had been shot and so had knocked off work out of respect the real reason that the clock ran down was that it had not been wound that day but rose knew a thing worth two of this mrs wentforth and rose had doubts as to the propriety of going into mourning for arthurwhich was very stupid in them they spoke about the matter in whispers as though they were a couple of female burglars and were afraid to have their plans overheard old wentforth trotted into the room and rose opened fire on him at once father said she what is your feeling aboutthen she repeated about with a dash between and added our going into mourning dr w smiled which was highly improper not to say unfeeling and then made a joke he remarked that of course it is right to mourn when we are afflicted rose replied that the old man was deviling her and knew as well as she did that she had alluded to black bombazine dresses and those kind of outside arrangements and not to inside feelings then dr w replied to the question by quoting a text from scripture proving that white was more fashionable for mourning than black he went in for white mourning mrs w went in for black mourning and they had a discussion about it which i give black on white the old lady remarked that when you wear black people know that you too much with their calls and small talk dr w acknowledged the corn but did not think it amounted to a pinch of snuff he still held up his hand in favour of white mourningand his wife stuck to the black the doctor said that the smell of crape always disgusted him it made him seasick rose had joined in the debate on her mothers side but wentforth was one too many for the pair and came out right side up none of them wore black for arthur which was shameful just about this period rose wentforth began to entertain all sorts of nonsensical ideas and projects she first thought of going to the south or west to be a school mistress but the old folks put their feet down upon this project in so emphatic a style that she dropped it like a hot potato then she turned her thoughts on something still more insane she resolved to join the army as a nurse her parents had war on the brain and so approved of the plan agate bustle thought the army is not exactly the right sort of place for a young and pretty girl i think so too rose thanked agate for the compliment but was as stubborn as a female mule and said she would go agate gave in and said it was a go it was wednesdayrose was to be off on monday and agate was going along for company to look stern at the sick soldiers on saturday came alice cathwagon with the news that barton was a colonel and was in washington colonel cathwagon who would have thunk it alice told rose a great secretthe great secret was that she alice was going to join the nursing company in the spring mrs wentforth wanted to know if the nurses would knock off work on sundaysto which agate replied not much we wont frank weasel the boston painter was a lieutenant colonel in bartons regiment a big thing on ice for frank agate bustle got a situation as head nurse in a hospital in washington and rose was her right hand man they both nursed well but agate was so stern that she was more of a dry nurse than anything else they had not been on duty any time before agate had a big fuss with the head surgeon and threatened to pitch into him and jerk off his shoulderstraps the surgeon was disgusted and turned her out agate called on abe lincoln and let out on the surgeon old abe patted the stern woman on the back remarked bully for you old gal had her put back in the hospital and the surgeon was euchred on a lone hand agate thought lincoln a good man but not a good president rose talked gnawwood religion to the sick soldiers and they liked the preacher better than the preaching she was a female doctor too better even than agate the soldiers called her tea rose and japoncia and castor oil flower and gnawwood beauty and pet names in general the nurses got tired of washington and took to the field they saw some tall fighting one day rose was looking on whilst the surgeon was sawing off a mans leg when the leg was half way off a cannon ball came and took the surgeons head off in a neat and artistic style rose saw it then took up the saw and cut off the mans leg then the soldiers called her the daughtersurgeon what was funnier than the surgeonsdaughter which they used to call her before alice cathwagon came out as she had promised and helped in the nursing in the antietam fight a wounded confederate soldier was taken prisoner he was as gentle as a baby and alice nursed him then in order to wean himfrom all thoughts of worldly affairs she pulled out a gnawwood prayer book and a gnawwood psalm book and read and sang to him he asked her to tell what her name was she told him and gave her address in full then he grew excited and remarked that it was singular it was singular for he was henry c strawwood otherwise haltom strawwoods brother he died and the three nurses buried him and rose wrote a letter to his mother saying that he was dead when november came in  came also in gnawwood the renowned thanksgiving day the holiday of old new england from its founding in the beginning it was a day of fasting but in the end came to be a day of feasting at the start all hands agreed to eat nothing between sun up and sun downnothing between breakfast and supper no dinner but the gnawwoodites couldnt do without eating so long so between breakfast and supper they performed on crackers and cheese next they pitched into gingerbread and followed it up with doughnuts the reformed fasters then took to smoked beef and growing bolder branched off into cold chicken and even went so far as hot apple pie after a while they all ate their dinners and the biggest kind of dinners to boot and thanksgiving day was as good as fourth of july and compared favorably with christmas itself lee had entered pennsylvania and general cathwagon was going out to meet him on the road he met alice and rose he addressed the latter as miss wentforth but she objected to the miss as she had done in the case of poor frank weasel the boston painter she remarked call me rose and he called her rose and looked at her with a hungry look he was not hungryhe was only in love the entire party pushed on for gettysburg and fought and nursed whilst the fight was going on and the girls were enjoying themselves looking at barton who fought like a mad bull dog alice screamed as though she had had a tooth extracted by a quack dentist whats up now said rose i see him i see him i see him remarked alice rose asked if she meant barton not much replied alice i see tom strawood fighting like a sick tiger on the rebel side he has on a gray suit i see him i see him i see him rose told her that she ought to be ashamed of herself thus to think of tom instead of her brother barton rose was herself doing some tall thinking about general cathwagon pop boom fiz bang and its all up with tom strawwood tom is dead alice cathwagon stood over the corpse and remarked that she had loved it when it was alive and in gnawwood she also said that he would never speak again which was true and that he was oh how noble and beautiful he was certainly in a beautiful fix for he was as dead as julius caesars aunt then the women buried him as they had buried his brother and the sun fell warm in the very grave alice never spoke of tom but she never forgot him for one waking hour when she slept however she forgot himexcept when she dreamed before the gettysburg fight barton cathwagon had a presentiment that he would be killed and wrote it down in a letter to rose in which he spoke of his love and the other letter he had sent by pete lumbermill after the battle he was among the missing but rose got the letter it was worded as follows i have a presentiment rose that something is going to be the matter with me tomorrow i dont feel well at all if you get this letter you may consider it in the same light as though it had been written by a corpseas a kind of dead letter as it were ever since i was a boy i have been trying not to love you it was a failure i didnt succeed not to love you would be not to be myself and so i had to love you in self defence so as not to be some one else and have to pay another mans taxes i wrote you a letter and you didnt answer it still i went on loving you but i felt nasty now that im dead im going to talk out any how but no matter ill wait till we meet in heaven and then ill tell you all about my love amen selah yours after death etc etc barton cathwagon rose stood silent and motionless she said nothing at first but kept up a loud thinking then she whispered to herself for fear that some one would hear her he loved me he loved me always best to the last he told me of it when what letter and so forth said she in a pigs whisper you see she hadnt received the letter sent by the drunken old curmudgeon pete lunbermill when rose got tired of the pigs whisper soliloquy she called to alice and informed her that barton had gone up then the two girls walked out to tom strawwoods grave and cried for him and cathwagon at the same time rose asked alice if she knew that barton had been sweet on her alice remarked that any fool might have seen it then rose was disgusted with herself and came near having a fuss with alice because she had not told her about that lumbermill letter then alice cried and remarked of strawwood he is gone and added that her brother was gone also that in fact everybody was going and she wanted to go too as soon as possible rose then wanted to know if alice wouldnt feel more comfortable if tom had told her that he loved her and then died alice said yes whereupon rose inwardly crowed over alice and thought she had a big thing in the love letter from the dead man but the dead man was not dead barton cathwagon was alive and kicking though not exactly kicking either because he had been wounded in the leg pete lumbermill and himself had been taken prisoners but they had made their escape after having a very disgusting time of it and got back all right into the yankee lines frank weasel the boston painter but now colonel weasel remarked one day to rose wentworth that general cathwagon had been talking about her rose observed that the general was defunct the exboston painter replied that he was perfectly alive and not dead in the slightest degree rose then acted as though she had been caught up by a whirlwind and the whirlwind had got entangled in her hoopskirts and so forth she said not dead with an exclamation mark after deadthen she said it overthen she said alive with an interrogation pointand then remarked a prisoner which wasnt a bad guess she then said alive again with the same old mark and wound up by raising the biggest kind of fuss when barton next turned up he was on a quaker farm nursed by a couple of roses rose wentforth and rose hetherington the last named owned the farm dr wentforth was there of course and one night he told rose to go to sleep she replied i cannot sleep if i lie down so she slept standing like the fat boy in pickwick cathwagon got better rose was kissing him one day by the hour and the smacking noise restored him to consciousness he woke up and observed is       this        rose         then he said he meant his rose then corrected himself and simply desired to know what kind of rose it was that he saw before him rose spoke like a trojan owned up that she loved him remarked that she was his rose for him and his heirs and assignees and so forth for ever and ever it was all right barton cathwagon and rose wentforth were engaged to be married part last after the war this part is very short in fact only a kind of postscript or winding up to gnawwood the war had ended the confederacy had gone up the niggers were free barton cathwagon who was going to marry rose wentforth in a few days remarked to her that he had something to propose that was so cursedly stupid that he was almost ashamed to mention it she told him to own up and fire away no matter how stupid it was people in love are not expected to have good sense so drive ahead said she to barton and lets hear the secret i know youll laugh said he but please dont i have a bobtailed horse with a sore on his hind leg i used to ride him when i was in camp i love the bobtailed horse he loves me too rose i have an insane desire to get married on horseback on the back of that same animule what say you rose we can both sit on him and get spliced will you dearest a soldiers wife wouldnt get married in any other way said rose so barton cathwagon and rose wentforth both from gnawwood whilst seated on the back of the old bobtail army horse with the sore on his hind leg were declared by the gnawwood parson to be man and wife on the day of the marriage agate bustle grew to be disgusted with herself because she was an old maid in fact she got sick being sick she thought she would take gruel so she took parson gruel and he took her she won his heart by looking stern first she looked at him in her stern manner then he smiled in his turn forgot his dead wife and took a live one just as rose wentforth had come forth from the altar as mrs cathwagon dr gruell and miss bustle trotted up and got married in the coolest manner possible frank weasel the exboston painter and glazier is sweet on rose hetherington when dr wentforth looked around in gnawwood and saw so many people getting married he thought of poor arthur who couldnt get married conveniently because he was dead then he cried then he made some gnawwood remarks about arthurs spirit the rest of his exposition he made to his pocket handkerchief i dont mean to say he blew his nose he wept all of the gnawwoodites are as well as can be expected i thank you alice

i to what end did our lavish ancestors erect of old these stately piles of ours just as they came by the romanticlooking ruin on weirvins cliff the sun went behind a dark and heavy cloud and the landscape which had before appeared so charming was now though thrown into deep shadow of a caste more befitting the tale which hervey in low musical tones was reciting agnes with a slight sudden and a quick glace at the ruined structure drew her scarf more closely about her and said mr montiver was oakland manorhouse any thing like that ruin on the cliff hervey who had not apparently been observing what was passing around him now looked up and said hastily those clouds portend a storm and we must immediately seek shelter spurring forward to the guide he inquired the distance to the nearest hamlet and received information that the first mansion they should reach was yet eight miles before them what if we explore you weirdlooking pile said hervey pointing in the direction of the mouldering edifice his fine features animated by the thought of an adventure benton shall kindle a fire on the old broken hearthstone and by its light you shall listen to my ghost story till the flickering uncertain shadows on the wall seem like jibing demons and the trailing cry which the night wind shall blow in at the loopholes like the skeleton fingers of unquiet spirits oh indeed mr montiver said agnes whose cheek had been gradually paling with apprehension indeed i think we may reach the village before the shower is upon us if we but hasten surely you can not once think of going into that dark looking place well let us hear what the guide says benton speak to him about it benton returned in a short time with the countryman close at his heels who had come to beg the laird by all the saints in the calendar as he valued his life in this world and his soul in that to come not to venture near the spot indeed sir he made bold to add nor witches nor goblins never haunted castle more nor isleys grange hervey looked at agnes and then at the clouds from which some heavy drops had begun to fall well we can not stand here and get wet through said he a little impatiently benton do you too with this fellow fear to go into the ruin benton with a look of contempt at the clown moved his horse behind that of his master and replied i am ready to follow you sir agnes who was more afraid of herveys displeasure than of ghosts even made no remonstrance when he placed his hand upon her bridlerein and they were soon moving up the cliff chapter ii lightly we tread these halls around lightly tread we yet hark we have scared with a single sound the moping owl on the breathless tree and the goblin spirits ha ha we have scared with a single sound the old gray owl on the breathless tree and the goblin spirits such scenes had temperd with a pensive grace the maiden lustre of that faultless face had hung a sad and dreamlike spell upon the gliding music of her silver tone and shaded the soft soul which loved to lie in the deep pathos of that volumd eye well said hervey throwing his arm carelessly over the back of the rude settle on which agnes halfreclined too nervous to be at case what can be more desirable rain wind and darkness without and here is light warmth and cheerfulnessand he cast a playfully sarcastic look from the pale and disturbed face of agnes to that of the trembling guide then rising with a slightly impatient air he walked moodily to the window and pulling away the woodbine bine looked out into the night the wood which benton had piled high in the wide chimney was burning briskly and sending forth a broad glare though the large hall and the bats and insects which the fire seemed to have called into life were fluttering hither and thither apparently seeking to escape from its light yet fatally attracted toward it the hooting of the owls echoed and reechoed through the deserted rooms and at each cry of these dismal birds agnes would start and shudder as though fearful of the presence of some troubled and malignant spirit her soft golden ringlets were flowing loosely over her ridingdress of dark velvet and the black feather of her hat which had been broken in passing beneath a low arch was trailing upon her shoulder and contrasted painfully with the paleness of her cheek as hervey left her side she glanced anxiously after him and then began to weep silently hervey hastened toward her my dear agnes he said this want of courage in you is not womanlyit is childish in having urged you to come hither i sought only your well being as these walls however rude afford us shelter from the tempest which is raging without look up agnes he continued and tell me your fears are quieted and that you are only overcome by this days long journey agnes took her handkerchief from her eyes and said sadly i know hervey you will think me weak for though some exhausted by this days travel i must plainly tell you that the weariness i feel is not the cause of my emotion nor is it alarm for my safety for while with you she continued with a sweet sad smile and laying her hand trustingly in his that would indeed be idle since it is for you alone that i am anxious hervey replied silently by slightly pressing the hand he held today continued agnes while we were searching among the dust and rubbish of this lonely place i experienced an awe which i tried in vain to suppress and when you turned the shattered frame that contained the torn and faded portrait upon which i gazed so long a sensation came over me which even to you i can not find words to describe it was with great terror that i looked upon the blood bespattered wall and the deep red stains upon the floor which seemed to speak to me of a dreadful deed that years long years had failed to erase and when you bade me to observe how sadly the canvass of the picture had been rent as if by a sharp pointed instrumenta dagger perhapsand how mildly beautiful were the features of the noble lady there represented i felt an earnest earnest longing to behold the living face of her whose painted lineaments were thus illused and hervey you to whom i am so much indebted now that i have confessed my weakness will i trust allow me your forgiveness agnes my love said hervey with kind earnestness i fear you have suffered a morbid sensibility to take the place of reason yet after the fatigue you have this day endured it is not strange you should indulge in these odd fancies the proprietor of this place i have been told is a dark pensive man who on the sudden decease of his wife left his native land never to return the mansion thus deserted by its rightful owner and left to decay has since become the subject of many foolish rumors in which i trust my agnes has too much sense to believe mr montiver said agnes gravely the abbey in which by the kind care of your uncle i was reared is too far distant from this place to ever have been reached by the idle tales of which you speak and yet there are enough to relate the like reports could they but find credence and attention that you should ever have been influenced by absurdities like these said hervey do not i pray you think i have for a moment supposed and still the romantic incidents of your early life and the strict seclusion in which you have since lived has i am inclined to believe tended to impress your too susceptible mind with ideas that may justly be termed visionary and inconsistent and are these thoughts which you call fanciful said agnes mildly of a character to lower me in your estimation so far as to cause my company to become distasteful to you hervey who with his exuberant spirits was utterly averse to any thing inane or commonplace hastened to reply indeed agnes if a neglect of duties the most imperative in order to seek your society be an evidence that it is unpleasing to me then must i plead guilty since by no less sacrifice have you had proof of it in holding your duties thus lightly said agnes while an arch smile curved her lips do you not merit the just displeasure of sir reginald dear agnes replied hervey that my uncle has sufficient reason to be angered is true yet could he comprehend the allpowerful temptation that is presented to me i feel he would overlook every thing in which i have proved remiss and for any future negligence on my part grant me his free pardon after a short pause hervey resumed and agnes you may remember that though it is now three years since first we met i have never fully learned the details of your history do i presume too much in asking you to relate them to me agnes mused for a few moments and then said at what time of my life do you desire me to commence oh answered hervey tell me every thing as far back as you can remember some few scenes of my infant years began agnes are ever present to my memory and yet though always distinct they seem more like happy dreams or pictures of the imagination rather than reality there are bright skies and balmy breezesdistant mountains and smokewreathed cottagesluxuriant vines and women with tall baskets gathering their producedroves of cattle and flocks of sheep driven by herdboys yet best of all do i remember of walking by the shore of some wide and bright expanse of water a tiny child that could scarce peep over the back of a huge and shaggy dog which kept always near to me a large pleasantfaced woman whom i called nurse attended solely to my wants and kindly answered my childish questions but ever before us moodily strode a tall dark man who sometimes paused to look steadily at the sea and sometimes to speak to the woman who held me by the hand and gravity would always settle upon the countenance of the woman whenever he addressed her and at such times she would often raise and place me in his arms with my little hand on his broad shoulder i would look up to the large piercing black eyes and wonder they were so seldom turned on me and when his strong arms held me so tenderly that he should never speak and have you no recollection of the manner in which you fell into the hands of angerford asked hervey none replied agnes the first time i remember to have seen him was this it was in a strange low room and a black woman was holding me upon her knees angerford entered the apartment and speaking to the woman he approached and taking my chin in his hand looked sternly almost fiercely into my face his hand was not rough neither was his touch ungentle yet his look startled me and i crouched and trembled with fear when a grim smile passed over his countenance i afterwards learned that the room in which this interview took place was the cabin of a vessel of which angerford was commander i saw him often in the cabin and upon deck yet i can not recollect that he ever again took notice of me while i was with him on the water the black woman i have mentioned had charge of me i suppose as she was always by and though she took no pains to procure any thing for my amusement nor gave attention to my inquiries for nurse and papa still she was never unkind and even lifted me about with a degree of carefulness which i am now disposed to think was something unusual in what manner or at what time i was placed among the rude people with whom your uncle found me i have never learned angerford who often visited the gipsy camp was certainly the one who placed me there and i also believe it was he who separated me from my father agnes paused for a short time as if in thought and then resumed a child of about my own age the granddaughter of an old gipsy woman was my companion and playmate her name was zephy and though she was willful and sometimes overbearing my life among the gipsies would have been intolerable without her she was lithe and agile with flashing eyes and black elfish locks falling over her shoulders she seemed utterly fearless or unconscious of danger and in her laugh which was loud and wild yet musical there was something at once alluring and derisive the favorite and plaything of the gipsies they failed to do nothing that could add to her comfort or gratification and being always petted and indulged she was naturally wayward though seldom passionate her attire was ever pretty yet fantastic a lowcrowned hat covered with wild flowers and ribbons of crimson or scarlet was either swinging from her arm or placed carelessly on one side of her head her frocks were of red or purple or yellow cashmere and she invariably wore a jacket of black velvet with rows of gilt buttons these last were solely for ornament as the garment they adorned was never fastened but hanging loosely disclosed her silken girdle to which by a small chain was attached a small poniard the old woman her granddame ugly and illtempered as she was was doatingly fond of zephy and to the influence of this fay alone do i attribute the leniency shown me by these crafty and capricious people zephy delighted to array me in her prettiest dresses and to deck my neck and arms with trinkets of these she had a large supply yet i never saw her wear any of them except a rich gold chain to which was fastened a locket set with precious stones this she wore constantly about her neck and seemed coy about showing it to me together through the woods we sought wild flowers and berries and acorns and the redcupped moss together we built bowers of fern and pine boughs and played in sunny nooks or with the bright pebbles in the stream as time passed i experienced an affection for zephy which i had reason to believe was returned and i was not unhappy the wild and wandering life we led was not without its charms still at times i felt strange intense yearnings for i knew not what zephy who was full of life and gaiety could not endure i should be silent or reserved and whenever a fit of abstraction came over me she would grow sullen or indulge in passionate illhumor one fine morning in early summer zephy called me to the door of the tent and pointing to a knot of trees that stood at a little distance from the camp she said look agnes at those pretty waving trees do you not see that though the fields the meadows and the hamlet yonder are all covered with the beautiful sunlight this little wood looks sombre and dark while you were yet asleep i came out here to look at the dewdrops and to listen to the birds and then in glancing away over the land i spied that cluster of pines i am going there to spend the day will you go also we will call it twilight grove as i never failed to consent to any of zephys propositions she went to acquaint the old gipsy woman with her intention and to ask her to prepare our luncheon we were soon ready and with willowbaskets on our arms containing coarse bread dried meat and fruit we began our little journey and before the sun had half reached the meridian we were in the deep shadow of the pine trees till noon we busied ourselves in constructing a bower and in plaiting wreaths to adorn it and then when the wind had almost ceased to stir the leaves and the birds were weary with singing we sought a little bubbling stream and sat down to eat our dinners let us stay here for the rest of the day said zephy and not go back to the bower see there is a beautiful mosscovered rock and all those green brakes and here are so many sweet flowers yes zephy said i i would much rather stay here it is not so dark and lonely the sunlight has found a window open and is creeping in through the trees and this little brook is laughing with joy to see it do you call that rippling noise laughter asked zephy yes answered i it is a low pleasant laugh such as i like to hear then you dont like to hear me laugh said zephy but you say the brook is glad because the sun is shining upon it if clouds were over the sun so that its beams could not come through the trees at all the brook would keep bubbling just the same then i answered its laugh would be changed to a sad murmuring sound as if it bewailed the absence of one it loved zephy was silent for a little time and sat pulling the flowers from her hat by and by she arose and stepped from the bank into the stream after wading a short distance she called me come agnes she said i am searching for the pretty pebbles that make the brook laugh come in here and help me to look and she indulged in a burst of merriment her own wild peculiar laugh that made the woods ring and startled many a drowsy bird from its nest in the thick bushes no said i i am tired and will stay here till you find them she kept on walking slowly down the stream stopping occasionally to pick up some smooth round stone that had attracted her gaze i watched her for a few moments and then my thoughts wandered and i became insensible to every thing around me i was aroused by a touch on the shoulder and on looking up perceived zephy standing by my side she looked at me rather sharply and said there you were dreaming again now agnes i know you are going to be dull this afternoon didnt you hear me calling to you to come and look at the little spotted fish i had found no i am sure you did not you stare at me as though you had just come down from the clouds and were surprised to find yourself in this place and with such a one as i talking to you why did you wish to stay here and not go back to the bower it was just because you wanted to go into one of these fits again i might have known what was coming when you began telling about the brooks being sad because the one it loves was not by now i want to know if thats the case with you you dont love me thats certain nor any of us and i wish you would go back to the place whence you came i dont care any thing about you and she walked angrily away when at a short distance she stopped abruptly and turned toward me agnes she said deliberately if you do not promise me never to have any more of those spells i shall do something you will not like she knelt down and taking the locket from her neck placed it upon a stone do you see she said if you refuse to do what i ask ill break this miniature in pieces and she held a large stone over it but i can not perceive if you do destroy the locket in what manner its going to harm me said i with some persistency no you dont see returned zephy pettishly well i will show you she came near and holding out the locket bade me look at it it was the miniature of a man in the spring of life the eyes were large dark and earnest the features fine the head well shaped and the expression of the face noble and commanding as i gazed upon the picture a strange sensation came over me and i think i turned pale have you ever seen this before inquired zephy i do not know returned i well i am sorry i have shown it to you said zephy in a softened tone but you are so provoking she sat down beside me and passing her arm around my waist was silent for some time at last she spoke do you remember a strange man who sometimes comes among us he is very pale with fierce eyes and long black hair and he wears a great many knives and pistols in his belt the one they call angerford i asked the same replied zephy oh yes i remember him well said i i was with him once upon the water but it is a long long time ago indeed said zephy in surprise i did not know it it must have been a great while since for it seems as if you had been with us for many years i am eight years old now and am not any larger than you but what were you about to tell me of angerford well returned zephy one day last summer he came to me with this miniature in his hand and holding it up so that i could see all these pretty stones sparkling at once he said he intended it as a gift for me you may believe i was glad enough but as i had seen him talking very closely with grandmother a moment before i wanted to know very much what it was about so i pretended not to care to have the locket and told him i must first ask grandmother if i might take it he laughed aloud when i said this and called me a true gipsy but he afterward told me the locket was worth a great deal of money and that grandmother knew all about it and was willing for me to wear it around my neck as long as i wished well said i i will wear it if you will tell me the name of the one of whom this picture was painted he said i would not know the one if he told me no matter said i you must tell me something about him or you may take the locket away then he looked very wicked and taking hold of me made me promise never to tell you nor any one what he was going to say i was some frightened and after he had told me i promised very sincerely never to make it known to any one living zephy stopped suddenly and after waiting some time for her to speak i remarked and you have nothing further to say about it all this time zephy resumed i have worn the locket and have neither shown it to you nor said any thing about it but now i am going to give it to the one to whom it belongs for i have not been happy in keeping it away from her and she arose and put the chain about my neck i was much surprised and asked her meaning zephy replied this it was what angerford said to methe miniature is of the father of agnes a man whom i hate and now continued zephy her eyes flashing angerford may kill me as he said he would but i can no longer keep this from you i was greatly shocked and instantly attempted to take the miniature from my neck but zephy withheld my hand saying agnes i beg you to keep it if you do not i shall throw it into the stream and you will never again behold the likeness of him whose absence you mourn seeing me still filled with apprehension for her she continued if you will keep it from the sight of all angerford can never learn that i have made known to you the secret as she ceased speaking a peal of thunder resounded through the wood and we were startled on finding that a shower had come upon us unawares the wood then became dark indeed and the pines that had so lately stood in solemn silence began to sway to and fro and to toss their branches and in weird whispers seemed to express their dread of the coming wrath of the tempest the thunder that like a voice of doleful warning had told us of the approaching conflict of the elements now rolled above our heads and the vivid flashes of lightning followed each other in quick succession the thick branches of the trees were riven apart disclosing the murky heavens traversed by forked tongues of fire terrorstricken yet with awe for a moment i contemplated the dread workings of nature and then tremblingly turning to zephy bade her lead me from the wood to my surprise she stood gazing steadily upward while an expression of intense pleasure rested upon her face the mad writhing of the trees the wild whistling of the wind the dazzling flashes and deafening roar of heavens artillery appeared to have filled her with a rapture which to me seemed strange and fearful i besought her to return with me to the camp at that moment a fiery bolt descending struck one of the tall graceful pines that stood at a short distance from us on the opposite side of the stream and in an instant the lovely tree was shorn of all its beauty and grandeur presenting only a shivered and darkened trunk from which every waving bough was riven with an exclamation of delight at beholding this work of destruction zephy clasped her hands and bounded across the brook but ere the loud crash that succeeded it had ceased another blinding arrow of flame sped downward and i knew no more for a few moments agnes remained silent but at last perceiving hervey was regarding her intently as if deeply interested in her narrative with a sigh she resumed there is but little left to tell and the recollection of zephys violent death is so painful to me that i could wish it might never return when i regained consciousness i found myself lying upon a pile of mats in the tent of zephys granddame or mother verduraine as she was called the old woman was not present but on one side of the tent where stood our little bed was a group of gipsies and on every dark countenance there was an expression of deep grief i crept to the bed and there beheld my bright my pretty zephy the pet the idol of the gipsies a stiff and blackened corpse mother verduraine had gone mad they said and afterward ward when i would see the old woman sitting apart moaning and mumbling to herself i would try in my childish way to serve and comfort her all my attempts at consolation however were received with indifference and though offered in sincerity they could i am sure have been but slight for i was never entirely able to overcome certain feelings partaking of fear and aversion with which i approached any of the tribe at length mother verduraine died and the box which contained zephys dresses and trinkets the chief of the gipsies presented to me saying i should need them soon as we were going to tramp to the city not long after this we went to paris and it was in the rue du temple while with the woman genifrede that sir reginald first observed me the loathing entertained by me for the life i then ledthe life of a street musicianwas equalled only by the joy the gratitude i experienced on being separated by your noble and benevolent uncle from my vagabond companions in the abbey of stmargaret and under the guidance of the good lady abbess and the holy sisterhood i have passed the last ten years of my life years of tranquility and quiet happiness such as can never come to those who mingle with the world the instructions and wise counsels bestowed upon me i trust have not been thrown away indeed it had been the height of ingratitude to have neglected the duties given me to perform and could the debt i owe to sir reginald heathwood be in any measure repaid i should be happy in remembering that by me his slightest injunction has ever been closely observed do you not recollect with what disinterested kindness he endeavored to discover my parentage and though all attempts to learn aught of the original of this picture have proved unavailing and my life is still involved in mystery for him who has so greatly befriended me i must still cherish the deepest feelings of gratitude and reverence agnes finished speaking and with a sigh of weariness involuntarily removed her ridinghat forgive me said hervey quickly for having been thus selfishly unmindful of your comfort he arose and throwing his cloak over the couch on which agnes was seated begged she would try to take some repose something of the awe with which agnes had entered the ruin was perceivable in the glance which she threw around the hall before yielding to herveys entreaties but when wrapped in the broad folds of his cloak with her face shaded by its wide cape she forgot to listen to the hooting night birds and her closed eyes no longer beholding the spectral shadows on the wall her mind grew calm and then as one who drifts out seaward sees the dim shore receding slow hears the voice of waves call to him fainter all at last grew vague and so she fell into a deep yet tranquil slumber chapter iii methinks before the issue of our fate a spirit moves within us and impels the passion of a prophet to our lips stand or i fire these startling words were addressed by hervey to a dark figure that had suddenly appeared at an entrance on the right of the hall and toward whom he had quickly directed the point of a pistol a low and rather contemptuous laugh was the only reply he received and the figure which appeared to be that of a tall and wellproportioned man advanced into the apartment young man put by thy weapon said the intruder calmly what wilt thou fire upon a peaceful traveler who but seeks a shelter which is apparently as much his as thine hervey who in the short space of time that had intervened had closely scrutinized the stranger instantly put up his pistol and replied i was too hasty and beg you will receive an apology for my abruptness the stranger answered only by a bow and approached the fire the guide who had long been slumbering heavily was now sitting up against the wall and staring wildly about him while benton who on the first appearance of the unknown had seized a large club of wood no doubt with hostile intentions now that he observed his masters returning tranquility let it slip gently from his hand to the floor a stormy night amicably remarked hervey to the stranger who was quietly removing his hat and cloak the unknown assented and hanging his dripping garments upon the stags antlers that branched from the wall drew a seat to the fire he was soon engaged in conversation with hervey and having learned the latters destination he replied in answer to herveys inquiry as to his intended route that he had spent many years abroad and now having returned to his native britain he had wished to revisit that portion of the country in which he then was but for what reason he scarce knew the frank and earnest manner of hervey seemed to win upon the stranger and by degrees the reserve which seemed habitual to him melted away for though he hated not his fellowmen yet from their close companionship he shrank still his converse with the young heir of heathwood for such was hervey was easy and familiar and though in his tone there was an occasional sadness and in his manner there was something which left the impression that he had suffered from a deep and lasting affliction he seemed to enter freely into descriptions of the scenes of his early life and to engage readily in a discussion upon the political subjects of the day hervey was filled with admiration of the strangers powers of conversation and the elegance of his manner and inwardly confessed that he had never met with so charming a companion as the night wore away lyndhurst for by this name the unknown introduced himself began to appear more desirous of entertaining his auditor and when the latter gave evidence of weariness he roused him to new animation by the exceeding eloquence of his discourse which now excelled in arguments of amazing force and clearness and now sparkled in narratives of strange and exciting adventures herveys eyes flashed and his intelligent face expressed the deep interest with which the strangers words inspired himwhen suddenlyin the midst of a relation brilliant with shining scenes and incidentslyndhurst paused as if struck by some painful and apalling recollectionthe benignant expression of his bold and handsome features changed to one of anguish his dark brows contracted and raising his clenched hand above his head with a muttered exclamation he sprang into the middle of the apartment and began pacing the floor with rapid and unequal steps hervey watched the singular being with an astonishment not unmixed with awe and at last saw him throw himself into his seat as if exhausted by his emotions young man said lyndhurst and his voice was deep and husky you see before you one whose manhood was blasted whose happiness destroyed whose very existence poisoned through the hatred and malevolence of another a heavy sigh checked his utterance and he remained silent for several moments then the cloud of stormy passions which had come over his countenance passed away leaving it calm and gentle and beaming with a holy tenderness i was unworthy one so good so lovely and so beautiful he said softly oh she was fairtoo fair for earth but to perish by the hand of violenceto be torn from me in a moment and by so terrible a fatalitythis was too muchtoo much and lyndhurst beat his brow with his clenched hand oh he continued in the most agonizing tone of voice while the gloomy rage which writhed his features subsided oh that i might behold thy angelic face once more that i might once again clasp thy loved form to my aching heart for this i would endure an age of misery alas this raving avails not yet the thought that thou are gone for ever distracts meto know that the bright beaming of thine eyes is quenched in deaththat i may never more behold thy loving glancemay never hear the music of thy voice nor feel thy gentle touch upon my brow oh this is madness and lyndhurst clasped his hands with the frenzy of despair at length he became calmer and rising walked slowly to the window the storm was over and the moon was shedding her peaceful light upon the wild and picturesque landscape stretched out before him again his form shook with the stormy emotions that agitated his soul but by a powerful effort he controlled them and turning from the window as though the objects without too deeply harrowed up his memory he returned to the rude chair which he had left mr montiver he said and his voice betrayed the conflict that had been passing in his heart in me you behold the owner of isleys grangeand the remembrance of the terrible scenehe stopped abruptly i am aware my lord of lyndhurst said hervey with a profound inclination that there is a deep mystery connected with this domain which for years has been the subject of strange rumors and the meeting with its master here tonight i shall ever consider as an incident not a little remarkable listen to the tale which i can tell of this decaying mansion and its unhappy possessor said lyndhurst and commenced as follows blessed with youth with health a princely fortune and a wife so good so beautiful that all in knowing loved her you will believe the lord of lyndhurst happy and he was yes he continued in spite of the gloomy forebodings that so often came over me chilling my heart and dulling the energies of my brain i was happy for her presence cheered me and her soothing influence chased away these odious presages as the morning sun dispels the mists of the valley from my childhood i had been the object of the jealousy and resentment of my only brother geoffrey lyndhurst he was the younger son and by the right of eldership on the death of my father i succeeded to the estates geoffrey receiving merely a legacy of ten thousand pounds he had expected more and directly after the reading of the will he sought a private interview and sullenly demanded of me to double the amount he had received i complied and on the day of possession gave him the necessary papers which he received without thanks and left me with a lowering brow three years passed during this time rumors of his extravagance and dissipation often reached me but there had been too little love between us for these reports to cause me more than a passing uneasiness if thrown into difficulties or danger he solicited no help from me and no direct intelligence from him ever came till this letter lyndhurst handed a folded paper to hervey who perused it by the flickering light of the fire its contents were these have you not enough does not the entire possession of my fathers broad lands satisfy you that you must crave more happiness by what right do you exclusively enjoy all the good that fortune can bestow while i consigned to a younger brothers portion must be restricted buffeted and repulsed oh but thou art good my saintly brotherart principled brave generous maledictions on you i hate i despise you and i say you shall never enjoy the possession of that you now seek listen not content with usurping what should be mine you would rob me of the hand of the only woman i have ever loved but beware so sure as she acceptsso sure as you wed with the lady annabel as certainly shall ye both feel the deadly vengeance ofgeoffrey lyndhurst soon after the reception of this continued lyndhurst i married lady annabel raymond and removed from lyndhurst castle to isleys grange which i had previously purchased then followed a year of happiness the most tranquilthe most profound such as i can never hope again to enjoy the lady annabel possessed a strength an energy of character which seemed at variance with her slender figure and gentle face but words would fail me were i to attempt to portray one half the noble qualities that adorned her mind or the beauty and grace which endeared her to every heart she was all virtueall lovelinessand my affection for her was such that i was happy only in her presence days months flew by in uninterrupted happiness and when at last a sweet babe was laid within her arms i believed my cup of joy filled to the brim and trembled lest it should be dashed from my lips ay my fond heart foreboded that these the objects of my tenderest solicitude must ultimately be wrested from me still when the rose again bloomed on my annabels cheek and the fire of intelligence sparkled in the eyes and the glow of health reddened the lips of our darling child my fears gradually subsided it was at the close of a mild sunny day in the autumn of  and soon after our return from hawking with a party of guests that had assembled at the grange that i entered my wifes apartment and found her standing by an open window which led out upon the terrace her face partly turned from me was pale and agitated and her gaze seemed riveted upon an inanimate object lying at her feet over which she was slightly bending i approached and to my surprise beheld a beautiful king charles spaniel of which my wife was particularly fond but which that day from some slight cause had not been permitted to accompany us stretched in death and lying in his gore i raised him every particle of life was extinct he was cold and had apparently been dead some hours for his eyes were thickly glazed and his black silken hair was entangled and clotted with the blood that had ceased to flow from a ghastly wound in his sidea wound which had been given by a steady and practiced hand and one that had instantly penetrated his vitals the astonishment which the servants manifested when summoned convinced me they could have no knowledge concerning the perpetrator of the deed and after all traces of the occurrence as far as possible had been removed i endeavored to drive away the dismal thoughts it had engendered come edward said my wife who had for some time been busy with her toilet do not let the fate of poor feather trouble thee the loss is mine and see how well i bear it and she playfully tapped my arm and bade me readjust my dress and join the guests in the hall but the vague suspicions that tortured my mind could not be so easily displaced and the evening was passed by me in gloom and anxiety sitting apart silent and dejected i scarcely noted the passing hours nor heeded what was going on around me when all at once i was aroused by an exclamation and the following words what has happened to the picture of lady lyndhurst i sprang forward with a terrible foreboding busy at my heart a group had collected in front of my wifes portrait which was suspended between the southoriel windows i thrust them aside and gazed earnestly at the picture it was pierced in several places my eager eyes examined every gash here this one in the center is larger than the rest the others are triangular and their edges are deeply stained with a redhued liquid but this one is round as though the instrument by which it had been made had been writhed by a fierce vindictive hand my eyes fell to the floor directly beneath the portrait and glowing in the light which fell upon it lay a poniard and seizing it i recognized the dagger of geoffrey lyndhurst fiend i muttered wouldst thou wreak thy despicable vengeance on a paltry pictureon a miserable brute regardless of my guests i paced the floor a prey to the most bitter contemplation still holding the naked weapon in my hand a loud shrill cry the cry of a woman in terror and distress smote upon my ear my wife my annabel i cried she was not present and with the swiftness of despair i flew to her chamber with one blow i burst open the door and found her struggling in the grasp ofmy brother like an enraged tiger i bounded forward firmly clutching the gleaming dagger i poised it above his headit descendedoh god i had plunged it into the bosom of my wife geoffrey laugheda laugh so diabolical my blood ran cold to hear itand shivering i knelt by the side of my dying annabel slowly the lifedrops trickled down and quenched the fire that quivered in the jewels of her vest her golden hair covered my arm like a flood of light oh how i loved each shining tress her eyes so blue so tender for a moment unclosed and her sweet lips moved faintly i bowed my head edward my beloved she murmured cherish our dear babefor my sakeandkiss medearest one look of loveone short spasmand all was over oh the desolation of my heart oh the anguish the misery that racked my soul when i felt that her pure spirit had for ever forsaken its frail yet beauteous tenement that the form i held was but dust and must perish from my sight and he the guilty cause of this where was he he had fled again my blood boiledmy brain whirledand i rushed madly forth to seek him the sound of receding hoofs reached my eari shouted and franticly waved my sword above my head but the echoes alone answered my cries and at last as the overwhelming knowledge of my bereavement again came upon me i sank down insensible for days i raved incessantly at times calling despairingly upon the name of my beloved and then pausing to break into the most wrathful invective against the one who had wrought her destruction till wearied by my efforts i would fall back in a state of complete exhaustionmy violent words sank into incoherent ramblingsand sleep the soother of all ills came to my relief i recovered but the face of nature seemed changed earth for me had lost her brightness the suns warm rays penetrated all things yet failed to dispel the shadows that enveloped my chilled and lonely heart i shunned my fellowbeings the sight of their enjoyment was odious to methe sounds of mirth jarred dissonantly on my ear such is the selfishness of grief chapter iv and years had passed and thus they met again with my young child continued lyndhurst i left my native land for everas i then thoughtand wandered hither and thither without aim or object thus three years passed and i wearied of my roving life yet dreaded quietstill for the benefit of my child i began to think of rest and proceeding to lombardy i lingered awhile in one of its splendid cities and then sought to stay my wanderings in one of the peaceful mountain hamlets found in that picturesque and fertile region it was a charming spot the village of arguaso rich in its sublime and varied sceneryso blessed in its benign atmosphere and salubrious climate and interesting too as the last residence of petrarch and hallowed as the spot where lies the dust of the illustrious poet still with the restlessness of sorrow i could not long remain even in this delightful place and recrossing the appenines i journeyed onward till reaching a beautiful retreat on the lago maggiore i again paused yet the following autumn found me at the sea coast in a marine villa at a short distance only from where the beautiful arno mingles its waves with the bright waters of the mediterranean here my mind began to assume a slight degree of composure and my fondness for the prattling innocent dependent on me for care and tenderness seemed daily to increase alas as the tide of paternal affection swelled in my breast and hope again cast a gleam of light upon my dark despondency fears for the safety of my hearts only remaining treasure scarce permitted me to lose sight of it for a moment as a miser guards his gold so did i watch over my darling child and so anxiously solicitous was i to preserve it from every danger that it had nearly fallen a sacrifice to my too great tenderness before i discovered my error forgetting my incapacity to ward off the insidious attacks of disease i had too closely shut out from my little one the warm sunlight and the healthgiving airs of heaven and too carefully restrained the little limbs that had scarce known a moments inactivity and when illness came so great was my alarm and distress that i had surely run into the opposite extreme had not its nurse whose place since our residence in vi had nearly usurped asserted her rights and retaken the child under her more judicious care from this time i contented myself with the knowledge that it was in health and receiving every thing necessary to promote its infantine happiness though as before my boding heart felt always a pang at its absence yet with all my doating fondness for the little being that had just begun to lisp the name of father in my deep fits of abstraction i would nearly forget its existence and almost feared to take it in my arms lest in my mental wanderings i should bear the treasured burden less carefully thus by degrees it became less accustomed to meits parent and with the wretchedness of jealousy i perceived it was scared by my abruptness and that its little gambols and childish prattle were ever checked with awe on my approach so weeks glided on till one day i was summoned by urgent business away from the villa it was with the greatest reluctance i departed and not till i had again and again returned to the couch whereon lay my darling to take one last fond look and to reassure myself that the slight indisposition with which it was that morning affected was nothing serious then to charge the nurse to be unremitting in her care and to admit no stranger into the house and also to keep hero my faithful st bernard ever near my child mounting my horse i sped away with a heavy heart inwardly determined to return as soon as it was within my power it was late at night when i again reached the cottage a group of persons had gathered beneath the porch lights were flitting to and fro and the sound of confused voices and hurried footsteps conspired to fill my mind with the most intense alarm the crowd before the door immediately separated to enable me to pass and rushing into the house i looked eagerly around for my child its little bed was unoccupied and the disordered drapery about it bespoke a hasty removal upon the floor and weltering in his blood was my dog which on recognizing me dragged himself to where i stood and licking my feet seemed to crave the attention my mind was too distracted to bestow the nurse was walking up and down wringing her hands and weeping aloud and to my agonized inquiries i could learn nothing further than that a short time before my return the servants had been aroused by the loud barking of the dog which was followed by a struggle and that on proceeding to the room whence issued the sounds the door flew open and a man in a large cloak and slouched hat rushed past them and before he could be arrested had left the house and was seen to mount a powerful black horse and ride rapidly away it was then found that the dog had been stabbed and my child abducted without a moments delay i proceeded to adopt every possible measure that could be thought of and to put in practice every scheme how wild soever that presented itself for the recovery of my lost one but morning came and found me still anxiously awaiting the moment that should restore her to my arms it is useless to speak of the days the months of torturing suspense that followed or of the years spent by me in a search the most diligentthe most painful that can be conceived all my efforts have proved unavailing and still with the deepest sorrow do i mourn my loss lyndhurst was silent for some time apparently indulging his melancholy reflections at length he resumed chance drew me to constantinople experiencing no desire to witness its magnificence i shunned those districts remarkable for their handsome and showy appearance and leaving the wherry at a quay of the meanest pretensions sought lodgings in a street that could boast of nothing bright or gay day after day as i threaded the streets of the capital i failed not to scan with interest each child which met my gaze still faintly hoping that in its lineaments i might trace some resemblance to my lost darling and this course which had begun in the eagerness of expectation was now continued mainly from habit in one of these rambles i strayed out into the suburbs and slowly ascending the hill of st demetrius found myself at the entrance of the greek hospital there with my usual listlessness i entered yet not with the same indifference did i behold the misery which surrounded me yet even in this disgusting yet really charitable abode there were grades of wretchedness drawing near to the most pitiable object i had ever seen i laid back the filthy coverlet in order to examine his face it was that of a man apparently not old in years yet so pallidso shrunken were the featuresso emaciated the formthat it seemed disease had done the work of time as i pushed back the black hair that lay matted upon his forehead a slight spasm stirred the frame of the sufferer and his eyes slowly unclosed on meeting my gaze a glance of intelligence and recognition shot from them and in an instant i became consciousthe wretched being before me was my brother you know me he faintly articulated it is geoffreyi replied he again essayed to speak but failing i raised him that he might breathe easier when he whispered me to send for a confessor his wish being complied with he seemed relieved and pressing my hand murmured his thanks and prayed my forgiveness for the wrong he had done he was deeply penitent and i forgave him when suddenly remembering my child i eagerly inquired if he could tell me aught of her his countenance was rapidly changing and he seemed conscious of the approach of death yet he strove to put back the moment of his dissolution and in tones of humiliation and remorse told me how that in learning my great affection for my child he had determined to separate it from me how he had watched the cottage and seen me leave the villa and how he had carried my darling with him to france and placed her among the gipsies he could tell me no more and i left him alone with the holy man who had arrived my brother was dead when the priest retired and after seeing that the last sacred duties for him were performed i left the metropolis again my search was renewed with vigor yet with no better success than before my daughter if she yet lives must be eighteen years of age still the hope of ever discovering her is nearly extinguished indeed should fate restore her to me at this time perhaps i could not esteem it a blessing had she been reared among gipsies as lyndhurst finished speaking he arose and walking to the casement ment looked forth at the eastern sky which the dawn was coloring with gorgeous hues then leaving the hall he proceeded to an outbuilding where his steed had passed the night and began making preparations to recommence his journey agnes whose slumbers had been uninterrupted awoke refreshed and observing hervey deeply engaged in thought she quietly left her place of repose and busied herself in arranging her attire occasionally she paused to look at him and marveled much at his abstraction at length he raised his head and perceiving her said abruptly is it with youthe miniature here it is she replied with some astonishment as she placed the locket in his hand for a moment hervey looked fixedly at the picture and then said with vehemence yes it is he agnes would have inquired the cause of his unusual emotion but at that instant her attention was arrested by the sound of approaching footsteps and turning her head she beheld a stranger advancing toward her it was lyndhurst who had come to take leave of hervey before going on his way as his glance met that of agnes he stopped suddenlyhis countenance assumed the hue of deathhis dark eyes seemed starting from their socketsand stretching out his arms he muttered the words my wife and fell senseless to the floor it was long before he was restored to consciousnessand not till hervey had convinced the weeping agnes of the relationship which he believed to exist between the stranger and herself bending over him with his hand pressed to her bosom she besought him to return to life and to look once more upon his child and as his bewildered mind slowly comprehended her endearing words his eyes lighted up with the beams of paternal affection and clasping her to his deeplystricken heart he called down blessings upon her head and thanked that gracious being who had at last given back to him his longlost daughter the broad glare of day was over all the earth when the travelers resumed their journey yet before midday they had reached the village in which it had been herveys intention to have passed the night and after partaking of some slight refreshment and rest they again went forward at length they arrived at heathwood the place of their destination and sir reginald embraced his wards and learned with amazement the events that had transpired and that lord lyndhurst the tall dignified stranger who stood by the side of agnes was no other than her father happy home womans rights and divorce happy home womans rights and divorce by s w clark minneapolis minn author of from the sublime to the ridiculous chicago ill  entered according to act of congress in the year  by s w clark in the office of the librarian of congress at washington introduction having spent a number of years in colorado and the rocky mountains and being with old hunters and trappers a part of the time i gathered from them information which gave rise to the subject of this story the life of edward gayloyd farnham buckskin ned and minnie c dunbar the heroine sheriff shows a striking instance of genuine true love and a happy home hoping that the moral contained within these pages may make a good and lasting impression upon the minds of the public i leave the reader to judge of its merits preface there is nothing so essential to mankind as a happy and loving home a home of parental devotion and filial affection where all of the family blend together in unison and harmony but there is an epidemic in the land called womans rights which has crept into many of our loving homes and spoiled our doves making hawks of them divorce steps in cuts the bonded cord and leaves the home in ruins author happy home womans rights and divorce happy home womans rights and divorce it was during the year eighteen hundred and seventy when womens rights were in full force in the territory of wyoming that a heroic woman was elected sheriff and even wielded a sceptre of influence and power over a small railroad town on the union pacific near six hundred miles west of omaha before giving you a history of her daring deeds and wild adventures i will describe that novel embryo town which was named in honor or rather after a bloodthirsty band of redskins called cheyennes who roam from their reservations killing buffalo elk deer antelope or pale faces indiscriminately uncle sam donates them blankets guns ammunition and provisions the government agent or some one else sells them poor whiskey gets them drunk takes advantage of their ignorance then who gets the cream of the donation nothing is said and all goes lovely until we are reminded of these free gifts by some horrible bloodthirsty indian massacre and even then some will say it was nothing but poor lo whose untutored mind snuffeth up the east wind cheyenne is situated on a high plateau or table land near the western verge of the great american desert to the west and southwest your vision beholds a long line of snowcapped mountains with long peaks in their midst seemingly penetrating the very sky as though she were keeping sentinel over a brood of lesser peaks around her towards the rising sun you can see nothing but a vast sea of naked plains once the happy home of indians buffalo and prairie dogs cheyenne was laid out and built near its present size in  during its early history it was a large trading point being a focal centre for idaho montana utah colorado and new mexico long trains of mule and ox teams left daily loaded with goods for the mines and various government posts these trains were generally owned and propelled by dusky mexicans who massed together and moved in large trains as a protection against indians and robbers they were prepared at all times to fight the red skins or straggling highwaymen while cheyenne was yet in its infancy it was in full possession of armed banditti ditti robbers and blacklegs it was even dangerous to be safe and not safe to be a man of principles law and order was unknown honest men were shot down in the streets hung up to trees and their bones left to whiten and dangle in the midnight air but time makes changes there must be a law for the lawless and a speedy execution of the law every dog must have his day so this border town had had its day emigration began to pour in vigilance committees were formed outlaws were caught and hung holes more black and damning than the infernal regions were closed up soon law and order reigned supreme and this frontier town began to wear an aspect of civilization emigrants continued to pour in and in a few years the surrounding hills and valleys were dotted with flocks of sheep and countless herds of cattlethe result of untiring industry and stern perseverance but i must return to the principal actor in this story the heroine sheriff or as we will call her minnie c dunbar during a certain session of the legislature of the territory women suffrage became a law the gentler sex had a right to hold office vote hold the plough drive mules lick their husbands and wear the breeches generally if they saw proper to do so at a certain election held in cheyenne for electing county officers miss minnie was unanimously elected high sheriff she was a large muscular woman athletic in frame well proportioned auburn hair intermingled with red and yellow and hung in wavy tresses upon her shoulders she had a daredevil eye but withall rather a pleasing countenance and a determined look as much as to say i can catch a thief she was well selected from her sex and got an overwhelming vote in her favor her election was a great novelty among the boys and on several occasions petty thefts were perpetrated and the woman sheriff sent in pursuit the culprits were generally brought back in irons and duly punished for their supposed fun but sport of that nature soon fell to zero minnie had a man of the male persuasion for a deputy so all moved on safe and lovely her skill as an officer was tested almost daily she soon became an adept in the business and even a terror to lawbreaking citizens but the scene is soon to be changed life is full of stirring events especially among female sheriffs early one morning in july minnie was informed that a store had been broken into and robbed a horse also had been stolen and tracks in the soft sand were seen making off in a southerly direction towards denver she hurriedly buckled on her revolver and knife took a pair of handcuffs mounted her surefooted horse and was off in pursuit with the fleetness of the wind she had rode on several miles before the thought came into her mind that she was all alone she had in her hurry forgotten to summons her deputy and she would need his help in catching so formidable a thief if she returned for the needed assistance the fugitive would be out of reach and past taking for if he should get across the river he would be among low timber and underbrush and have a much better chance of escape so on second thought she put the spurs into fleetwing resolving that she could and would take the thief alone at the end of ten miles she rode up to a dilapidated stage station with her horse in a white foam of sweat she inquired of the keeper if he had seen any one riding past on a dark bay horse he said a man rode by on that description of a horse had passed not more than thirty minutes before and enquired if the water was high at the ford on on she pursued with lightning rapidity it was only ten miles to the river and she must overtake him before he reaches the ford or he would dash over and make into the jungle minnie capturing the thief at the ford of the cachealapoudrewomans rights on ascending a hill in the road and looking down towards the river she clearly saw the absconding thief not more than onefourth of a mile in her advance he was on the lookout and saw her about the same time that he was discovered it was now only a trial of speed who should win for he well knew if he could reach the ford first and get safely over to the opposite bank he could get into the thicket and soon hide himself from his pursuers for he supposed her deputy was close in the rear and he would be an easy prey in the hand of two so well armed he reaches the waters edge and dashes into the turbulent stream but ere he reaches the middle of the foaming river she is at the waters edge calling out in a commanding voice hold on thief stop or ill shoot you down in the water he looked back to see from whom the command came and unfortunately for him his foot slipped from the stirrup his horse stumbled and threw him sprawling into the water he caught hold of a snag and managed to get on his feet again just as minnie rode up to him his pistol had fallen from its scabbard into the stream and she had no trouble in making him her prisoner she put on a pair of handcuffs and marched him to the opposite bank where his horse had already gained the shore and was quietly grazing with the pack of stolen goods firmly lashed to the saddle it was now nearly midsummer and extremely warm not even a gentle zephyr moved the leaves of the adjacent thicket but she must rest before returning with the prisoner so she lariatted out both horses in a fine patch of buffalo grass and then marched the thief to the shade of a friendly oak and seated herself near by her captive was a large portly man he wore a full suit of buckskin from head to foot his beard was unshorn his hair long and hung in ringlets or rather in a knotty mat upon his neck one would have thought he had been beyond the border of civilization for a century however there was an expression of countenance which reminded her of some old friend it looked familiar yet strange she now with the dignity and face of a fairy queen and the power of a high sheriff demanded his name calling her by name he said minnie c dunbar my name is edward gayloyd farnham my old home was charleston south carolina on hearing these words she flew to his arms and there never was such rejoicing in the wilderness beyond the mississippi his shackles were thrown off and there alone twenty miles from civilized life she had met the one she had long sought after one whom she dearly loved one with whom she had played in childhood and had gone to school with while in her teens in his younger days gayloyd was a noblelooking and promising young man he had taken a collegiate course in a well known institution of the south and was well off in this worlds goods he owned a large estate and had many slaves but the rebellion came on his slaves were set free and his large property confiscated which left him a penniless pauper but still his inmost soul was carried away with minnie he loved her fondly and she returned it as in his brightest days of prosperity they were finally engaged and the day set for their marriage friends were invited and all was in readiness for the happy union of two loving hearts but a dark cloud had already begun to dim the horizon which was to send thunderbolts on the coming event since gayloyd was now poor minnies parents took decided measures to break the intimacy and the coming wedding they did not want her to marry a poor man while her own parents were reveling in luxury but true love cannot die he met minnie one week after this and they pledged their love until death he said he was going to seek his fortune in the far west and when he had a fortune he would send for her and they would yet realize many happy days she agreed to the plan and with sealed vows a hearty shake of the hand a kiss and a tear they reluctantly parted promising a faithful correspondence gayloyd now left his old charleston home went to new orleans thence into texas where he meandered up the brazos to the western part of the state here he bought a few head of cattle and went to stockraising his herd increased and in a few years he had cattle upon a thousand hills he was now wealthy dame fortune had smiled upon his labor and he longed to consummate that vow taken on that memorable eve when he and minnie parted in charleston he wanted her to enjoy with him the fruits of his toil for he was full of joy and overflowing with pleasurable emotions of thought but when amidst our brightest hopes our excessive joy is often cooled down to zero so it was with gayloyd as i have before said he was far up the brazos he was also on the border of hostile indian grounds the comanches and arappahoes had often made raids on the frontier ranches and drove off their entire stock killing the herdsmen and taking their horses it was early one morning in july while seated alone in his adobe cabin that he heard the wild whoop of indians and the heavy tramp of horses a large band of mounted comanches had broken into his corralls made a stampede and his entire stock of cattle were headed towards the open prairie followed in a semicircle by the yelling indians who were soon lost in clouds of dust he watched the red skins until they descended from a high plateau and were lost behind the western hills he returned to his cabin and was for the second time at povertys door dejected and thoroughly disheartened he fastened his cabin door and made his way to a stage station some forty miles distant to see if there was not a sweet missive from his dear minnie a letter was handed him but it was not backed with the usual familiar hand he tore the wrapper asunder and drew forth a note which read thus charleston s c june   mr gayloyd farnhamsirour dear minnie has sickened and died was ill but a short time was buried in the family yard yours truly s wentworth dunbar this sad news came like a deathknell to his already bleeding heart it palsied his limbs and he sank unconscious to the ground restoratives were given him and in a few days he was around again finally he became calm and resigned but concluded not to go back to his cabin or even to charleston but left on the first westward bound coach for santa fe firmly resolved that he would spend the rest of his days far from civilization in some lone retreat in the rocky mountains he reached santa fe in safety from there he went up a mountain valley northward to taos in new mexico where he fell in with old kit carson the renowned hunter trapper and guide kit told him of his many adventures and hairbreadth escapes from hostile indians and wild beasts but now he was too old to follow the chosen vocation of his younger days and had come to this quaint old spanish town to spend his last days in quietude he had married a spanish woman of some beauty and had a number of children at this place gayloyd joined a band of trappers who had for several years trapped up and down the eastern slope of the rocky mountains from las animas north to south pass during these several years of mountain life they had encountered many hardships privations and hunger had had many narrow escapes from hostile tribes of indians and mountain grizzlies gayloyd was with these trappers for a year and a half when they were finally disbanded and separated and left the country but gayloyd still chose to remain in the wilderness in solitude for the last six months he had camped near the headwaters of the cacheala poudre cash la pou on the very stream where he had been taken by the woman sheriff he had built him a neat cabin and seldom left its immediate neighborhood except to go to some remote outpost or stage station for ammunition and provisions but now the great continental railway was completed to cheyenne which was not more than fifty miles from his cabin so he had for some time done his trading at this important point it was while on one of these trading trips to cheyenne while he was laying in a winters supply and ammunition and flour that he saw the wellknown female sheriff and at once recognized her as his old betrothed and loved minnie he did not make himself known but took a small package of goods from a store so as to get her on his track and when fifteen or twenty miles from cheyenne and all alone he would make himself known and the more would minnie be surprised and it was as i have before described that he made himself known to her five years had passed and from the welldressed edward gayloyd farnham of charleston he was entirely changed to a mountaineer having assumed a buckskin suit his comrades called him buckskin ned which name is yet familiar with old rocky mountain hunters i have now been at some length in tracing the footsteps of gayloyd from charleston s c to his cabin home on the cacheala poudre of his discovery of minnie in cheyenne and of his capture by her at the ford i will now give you her history her escape from home and how she had meandered from charleston from civilization crossed the mississippi entered the american desert and finally settled in cheyenne at an early date of its history after gayloyd had left his old carolina home minnie received letters from him regularly for a number of years but all at once the correspondence was dropped and she heard no more of him was he dead or had he forsaken her she could not think of either minnies father had done the mischief as the sequel will show mr dunbar did not want his only daughter to marry a poor man true worth had nothing to do in this case nothing but a consideration of greenbacks would do the old gentleman so to throw minnie off the track he wrote to gayloyd that minnie was dead as a result in after life it proved his own minnie was now cast down gloomy and sad she longed once more to see the one she loved so well she sat one evening in her room all alone and while thus meditating she made up her mind to roam in hopes of once more seeing his familiar face if he had died in the far west she wished to plant an evergreen and drop a friendly tear upon his grave minnies father was a wealthy cotton planter and she the only daughter and at no distant day she would be sole possessor if she wished for money all she had to do was to ask for it she had free access to his safe and when she wanted a few hundred dollars she only had to give the amount to the bookkeeper so he could keep his cash account right by this means of securing money she took one thousand dollars and told her parents she was going to atlanta georgia to visit some cousins instead of going cousining she made direct for new orleans and into texas in search of gayloyd she ascended the brazos for five hundred miles and after a long and weary search she found the ranche and the little adobe cabin where gayloyd had spent three long years in accumulating his large stock of cattle she broke into the cabin and found everything as he had left it there stood his rude table and old chair where he had written many a line to his faroff minnie in one corner was his cot as he had left it near by stood his stove a perfect wreck one would have thought it had come over with the pilgrims in the mayflower for its age was unmistakable on a shelf she found a package of letters all being backed by her own familiar hand she left reluctantly closing the door after her the one she was seeking for had gone she knew not where she looked about her but could see nothing but naked plains and herds of grazing cattle the brazos went bubbling by and its smooth surface dazzled in the noonday sun she was told that the comanches had run off his stock and when last heard from he had gone to a stage station taken a coach for santa fe and from an old trapper she learned that he had joined a band of hunters and was many miles away to the northwest it was useless for her to pursue him any further in this direction for she would have to pass through hostile indian tribes and be in danger of perpetual captivity among the savages her courage was yet good and she resolved to tack in another direction retraceing her steps to the mississippi she took a steamer for st louis and from there up the missouri to old fort leavenworth in kansas resolving to trend her way either by wagon train or union pacific to some point near the mountains and in this way she might accidentally hear of her long lost gayloyd as a trapper he would in all probability come out to some of those points to sell his furs and procure ammunition and provisions at leavenworth she joined an ox train going out to south pass and salt lake it was composed of sixty wagons two hundred men women and children they were going there to settle therefore took along their flocks and herds she made an arrangement with a mr raymond to take her to south pass for fifty dollars he had a wife two daughters and a small boy was from eastern tennessee and wanted to make himself a home somewhere in the great salt lake valley the train was soon fitted up and in readiness and the long line of prairie schooners moved westward day after day they plodded on being constantly in clouds of dust at night their wagons were drawn up so as to form a hollow circle or artificial barricade or it might be called a temporary fort against the indians after the stock had grazed sufficiently they were driven within the enclosed wagon corrall for the night at nine oclock a guard was thrown out and the rest rolled themselves up in their blankets for the night on the eleventh day out they reached what is now called south platte city here the train remained over a few days to recruit themselves and stock south platte city is a genuine young america an embryo rail road town gotten up and thrown together in a hurry for speculative purposes the city was composed of a few adobe huts a temporary hotel and a station house although it was situated in the midst of a fertile prairie country and destined at no distant day to be a place of some importance after a full rest the train moved on following the windings of the platte in a westerly direction sometimes near the rail road and at other times remote from it they were now nearing the indian country where bloodthirsty cheyennes and arapahoes might be encountered with at any time on even a moments warning but a few days before the rail road had been torn up and a car thrown off and several of the passengers killed outright the train now moved compactly slow and cautious corralling their stock early and making careful preparations for any intruding enemy on the th day of june as they were bringing in their stock for the night a lone indian rode by at full speed this seemed to the wagon master as a premonition of coming danger every preparation necessary was made for an indian raid minnie put her revolver in ship shape and buckeled it on carefully putting her knife in the sheath of her belt she was determined to sell her life as dear as possible her cartridge box was laid under her head and she rolled up in her blanket for the night but no sleep came to her eyelids a sense of danger had taken full possession of her midnight came and the long wakeful hours of night passed wearily all was still as a death knell save the low moaning winds and occasionally the yell of a distant wolf the second watch was now on and it was three oclock she had just fallen into a doze when the guard fired their guns the indians were upon them and in an instant every man was at his post the yelling of the savages seemed as though pandimonium was let loose and all the combined tribes of north america were upon them but as i have before said they were well prepared for the redskins their wagons were good baricades and they returned the fire with deadly aim causing many of the indians to kiss the dust it was now daylight and still the fight went on the whites had the advantage of the ground being on a slight eminence but an unseen trouble threatened their doom in the affray their stock had broken from the enclosure and were pouring out upon the plain if the red devils should get their cattle they would in a measure be powerless but an unseen providence was at hand soldiers who were stationed on the railroad for its protection had heard the firing and on this critical moment came dashing in upon the scene of action almost unpreceived by friend or foe the cheyennes made instantaneous flight hotly pursued by our mounted cavalry and in less than ten minutes nothing could be seen but clouds of dust on the distant prairie they now ventured beyond their wagon barricade to view the battle ground there lay their dead enemy in their gore they had killed twentyone cheyennes and eleven ponies having no use for scalps their carcasses were left upon the ground for ravens coyetts and wolves the stock had not gone far was soon collected together and the train moved on again as usual as they moved farther west the country became more sterile barren and desolate it was rather on the order of high table lands interspersed with high cliffs with now and then a lone tree game became more plenty especially deer antelope and buffalo prairie dogs became as numerous as bed bugs in a hotel but were not so fierce and ravenous as some i have become acquainted with by the way i have a good bed bug story to relate which sadly came to my knowledge some years ago at a hotel in denver but i will not relate it in full for it might keep emigration out of colorado on my first night at this place these little brutes followed me to the register took my name the number of my room and were there en masse when i entered the apartement ready for active business and they meant business too for it was a long sad night the number of regular pitched battles i will not relate i shall keep that a profound secret suffice it to say that i came off victorious and left the enemy in their gore upon the field dear readers i have solid information enough on the habits of this animal to fill a large volume it is the only carniverous little fool that inhabits the whole globe dr kane found him near the north pole on floating cakes of ice captain cook was killed by sandwich islanders and afterwards eaten up by bed bugs i was once in the mammoth cave and when at the extreme end of the cave near ten miles from its entrance what did i discover but a genuine bed bug moving gracefully along the dark cavern towards me i was indignant mad i took up a boulder and spoiled his physiognomy and that ended the life of one of the most ignominious salamanders that ever lived i have somewhat strayed from the path of this story i now proceed it was on one beautiful evening in august when they arrived at cheyenne near six hundred miles from leavenworth it was then the western terminus of the union pacific road they were informed here that it was very dangerous to cross the laramie plains on account of hostile indians that the railroad surveyers had to keep armed cavalrymen for their protection minnie had had fortaste enough of indian massacres for a while at least so she choose to remain in cheyenne as it was full of life and business at this time the train however moved on and made salt lake without any serious difficulty a description of this place i have already given suffice it to say that minnie remained here a number of of years became well acquainted with her leading citizens and took a deep interest in her education and politics the question of womans rights and her inalienable right to vote became the leading topic of the day it was talked of on street corners in drawing rooms in adobe cabins in public halls and on house tops it became an epidemic throughout the territory finally that august body which composed the supreme rulers of wyoming had an attack of this pestilential scourge and before the scab was entirely scratched off womans suffrage became a law it was a joyful day for minnie for she was now in her glory her prairie home was an earthly paradise if she had wings she would have flown away to realms on high and told her sisters that had gone before that heaven was now established on one spot in this mundane sphere she was elected to several offices and filled them with perfect satisfaction and finally was elected to high sheriff and by performing her duty led to that happy meeting of gayloyd under the friendly oaks in a far off wilderness five years had elapsed and passed away but time had not caused either to loose their untiring love and true friendship which was as fresh and green as ever after a long and protracted conversation their plans were completed for a second time which was to proceed at once to denver and there be joined in the holy bonds of matrimony then return and live in gayloyds cabin on the beautiful cachealapoudre for they both had learned to love a wild mountain life the sun was fast sinking behind the western snow caps and its lurid crimson lay upon the distant crags when suddenly the rumbling stage started them to their feet it was now getting late so they leaped into their saddles and rode off towards the queen city of the plains stopping for the night at the first stage station the next morning when the coach came in bound for cheyenne they sent back the stolen goods without even an explanation and the citizens of cheyenne knew not the fate of their heroine sheriff till more than a year afterwards after breakfast they rode on towards the golden gem of the west it was a delightful summers morning and the sun shone forth her genial rays upon all animated nature the birds gave them their sweetest songs the surrounding country was one grand panorama of natures loveliest scenes to the right lay a long chain of white capped mountains seeming to kiss the very sky to their left lay the great american desert a treeless dreary waste of sand once the bed of a vast ocean towards their advance they could see nothing but the winding road and empty nothingness they arrived in denver the same afternoon and in the evening were made one by the aid of a methodist parson whose lengthy nose reminded them that he would be a profitable man to hire on a farm he would be so handy to use in digging potatoes and gathering apples the next day by hard riding they reached gayloyds cabin late in the evening nearly wearied out and ravenous hungry a hasty meal was eaten and they retired to their couch to peaceful sleep natures sweet restorer morning came and the sun peeped into their happy abode ere they awoke the cabin was built in a small grove of timber on the river bank at a point where it emerged from the mountains one could see the water foaming and tumbling over jaded rocks far up the steep canion near by was a natural cave where gayloyd had stored his amunition and provisions it was also a safe retreat from the indians for one man could defend himself against an attack of five hundred successfully in this cave the cachealapoudre was a beautiful stream being formed by melting snows it coursed eastwardly fifty miles and empted into the river platte it was so named by a party of early french trappers who at a certain time buried a quantity of powder on its bank catche to bury and alapoudre meaning powder buried powder pronounced cash la pou the happy pair were now fairly settled down and had nothing to do but hunt fish and ramble at their leisure in all of these excursions minnie took an active part she was a deadshot with the rifle and many an antelope deer and buffalo did she bring down with her trusty gun she believed in womans rights and therefore took care of her own horse and they both shared the work in the culinary department she believed in voting holding office and taking the place of a man fairly and squarely if she choose to do so her liege lord could not see matters exactly in this light but was willing for her to exercise her own judgment on that point while with him in their forest home so far from civilized life but if they should go back to charleston he would want a recognition of the sex or he might be taken for mrs farnham gayloyd could not agree with her exactly on the subject which led to a long debate on the question says he i want to take a rational view on the so called womans rights and if you will listen to me for a few hours i will give you my views on the great topic of the day in the first place woman noble woman should have her inalienable rights and her whole and full claims in her own sphere but what and where is her sphere of action is it the same as that of man verily not it is far different god specifically made the dividing line and if you should split a hair into a thousand pieces you could not persuade the creator to change the variation adam was placed in the garden of eden to till and dress it that it might bring forth fruit in abundance for the sustainance of life god saw he needed a help meet so he caused a deep sleep to come over him while he took a rib from his side and formed woman for a companion for a help meet she was taken from his side to be his equal not to be trodden down or to be above him not equal in strength and endurance but socially man has a much larger and stronger physical frame and calculated to perform the rougher and harder work of every day life such as cutting down our forests tilling the soil making rail roads digging canals building cities forming governments and ruling nations woman could not do this for she would be out of her sphere of action she has not the bodily strength to do this if she wished to her mode of clothing is not suited for this class of labor how would an intelligent and refined woman look holding the plough chopping down large oaks building houses digging in the canal by the side of pat tim or john and as to holding office she is not calculated or suited for that no lady of refinement would want to be a lawyer justice or judge if she was a town constable she would capture more hearts than prisoners there are exceptions to all rules a few women of your own muscular strength and daredevil self confidence might fill an office with apparent satisfaction you have had the suffrage law in wyoming but it soon will die out for want of public patronage whether the woman question or the chinese question is greater it makes no difference both like a mushroom are of today but may stay before us until settled we may remember also that nothing is ever settled until settled aright the embarrassments of the woman are peculiar for if a man dones his armor and walks forth as womans knight he is exposed to the suspicion of letting his gallantry run away with his judgment if he opposes the wild crusade he is quite sure to be accused of neglect or cruelty will it be endured if we mention this view taken of it is the clearest proof that some women are not reasoning creatures her faculty of reaching a conclusion is instinct intuition inspiration or whatever superior thing you may please but it is not reason if we are to reason upon a subject the reasoning must be something better than merely saying because etc when women propose to discuss with society the great hobby of rights which they claim are denied them they must first be willing to put the matter upon its merits and give up all considerations before given them by virtue of their sex it is not necessary to say that if woman desires to obtain rights to the full extent claimed they must not expect distinctive privileges and courtesies also if woman are to become equal with men they cannot ask to be more so the thousand and one ways which men now yield to women as being weaker are inconsistant with the claimed inequality of the sexes if woman deny that they are the weaker they must not look for a continuance of favors given them decidedly woman cannot unite in herself incomparable qualities to be sure she may do some deeds of daring skill in the face of all the world and win deserved admiration but she cannot at the same time sustain the character of a modest shrinking creature no no she may build a greater than a pacific rail road and do it all with the labor of her own hands but then we cannot give her the place of a tender gentle being this seems plain but the feminine advocates do not yet publicly admit it or rather they will not the sticking point is right here some women are mad because god almighty did not make men of them as to society religioa art and literature woman rule in these fields as much as they deserve and dare and how shall any direct reform help them as to politics a very little black paint will leaden a large quantity of white and afterwards the addition of white seems powerless to whiten the mixture the mire of politics would soil our doves and make hawks and owls of them in some things women are absolutely wronged they should have control of their own property and their person they should not receive less pay for their work because they are women but if women attempt to do mens work they will find nature made differences in the sexes which no resolutions or revolutions can remove again how would a man look as milliner and dress maker a wet nurse or how would a lady look as a lawyer in a court room filled with tobacco smoke and loafers pleading a case of bigamy it would simply be rediculous no decent refined women in the united states except a woodhull could do it and it would turn her stomach without it was lined with cast iron all married woman are supposed to have a home and family cares and it is her imperative duty to preside over and keep that home it is the mother who guides the pratling feet of youth and through her influence they are good or bad of course it needs the hearty cooperation of the father but still it is the mother in the main that makes the child the man washington franklin lincoln john webster and many others of our great men had noble mothers and they never even had a sympton of the so called womans rights it was unknown in the days of ben franklin womans nature is more tender and she has a finer sense of feeling and generally more taste than her liege lord therefore she is the more suitable and capable as a house keeper and if the house is kept in a neat and tidy way in an economical ship shape manner she has done much towards the comforts and happiness of the home and family let a man take her place and the house would soon look more like a sty than a human habitation why simply because he is out of his sphere of locomotion if women are to take the place of man hold office go to congress build railroads climb trees race horses pump thunder and go to war let them decorate the american stage and prate womans rights and gable about her wrongs it is getting contagious these poor ill used creatures will lecture night after night if she gets nothing but money for her trouble if she should take a vote from her own sex nine out of every ten would say i have my rights now but the agitation must go on and so long as the american stage is decorated with the roses of sharon so long will stantons browns and woodhulls slash away at womans rights if she must come down to a level with man in all of the vocations of life let her go and join some savage or half civilized nation such as the chinese turks tartars hottentots or even our american indians here she can have the privileges of taking the place of her husband or brother woman of these nations are trodden down and made slaves of by their husbands in the hartz mountains woman carry heavy burdens upon their backs over precipitious mountain paths the circassian woman are sold to turks as slaves squaws vote and do the drudgery would you like to take her place if so wade in but among civilization and civilized society woman should have her inalienable rights and that is to perform her whole duty in her own noble sphere which god has given her to fill minnie had listened long and attentive to this confab on womans rights and readily fell in with the argument saying that she hoped he would carry out the plan which he had represented if they ever got back to civilization and domestic life but while they were in that wild romantic region she wished to act the part both of a man and woman and sail in her own canoe gayloyd noded an assent and suiting their words to immediate action they sprang into their saddles and dashed out upon the plain for a hunt they had not gone far when they discovered a fresh indian trail gayloyd got off to see in what direction they had gone from all indications they were a band of cheyennes on the war path either with some tribe of sioux or some frontier white settlement they now quietly hastened back to their only safe retreatthe cave no sooner had they reached the spot and made temporary preparations than they saw them coming around the bend of the river and directly towards the cabin which they perceived was inhabited by the barking of their dog which they had neglected to take into the cave with them the cabin was immediately surrounded and old pont was the first one to fall a victim from the hands of the red skins this enraged gayloyd so he sent a death warrant to the same indian and he fell from his pony stonedead the cave was now discovered and they surrounded them with terrible yells and their war hoops died away in doleful echoes on the distant mountains gayloyd and minnie poured a steady volley into the enemys ranks every the cabin and cave gayloyd and minnies wilderness home time they came in front range of the cave they had plenty of amunition and could stand a months siege night came on and the firing ceased they kept up a continual watch for they well knew indian stratagem which would be to dash in upon them at day break and take them by surprise their predictions were true for at the first peep of day the cheyennes made a sudden dash upon them yelling like very devils but they were as before ready for them they both had remington rifles and minnie could shoot with deadly aim for in less than thirty minutes they killed thirtythree of the noble red braves the rest were terror stricken run for their ponies and were soon seen making rapidly across the plain they now ventured out cautiously but none of the enemy were in sight the ponies of the slain warriors were still picketed out as they had left them the night before gayloyd cut them loose and let them go for he had no use for them the dead cheyennes were buried in one common grave being thirtyfive in all months passed by and they were unmolested in their cabin home on the cachealapoudre they hunted and fished as usual and spent many a happy day in the sports of the chase it was now autumn and the leaves were dry and rustling on the ground and chilly winds went whistling by with low and pensive sound yes the yellow foliage told them of the coming winter it was also the usual time of laying in a winter supply of provisions and amunition minnie had long thought of writing back to charleston and learn if her parents were yet living so one beautiful evening she penned her father a short note telling him of her whereabouts and of her marriage to gayloyd farnham stating that her address would be cheyenne wyoming territory in due time they went to cheyenne and found a letter in waiting for minnie g farnham from char leston it was opened with a trembling hand and read thus charleston sc oct   dear daughter minnie your letter came like a thunderbolt to me for i long thought you dead your father died more than a year ago and i am living all alone on the old homestead the property shall be willed to you when i am no more come home dear minnie and live with me you and gayloyd shall have a welcome home while i live the past shall all be forgotten hoping to see you both soon i remain your affectionate mother it was sad yet joyful news to minnie the subject of going home was well discussed that evening and the conclusion was that they would quit their mountain home and go to charleston the next day they returned to their cabin only to find it a black mass of smouldering ruin and their cave had been sacked of all its contents it was undoubtedly the work of some passing red skins darkness came on and they resorted to the cave for the night hazarding all danger it was however a long sleepless night but morn came at last to their relief and the sun streamed in her soft beams of light as beautiful as it had but a few days before they ventured out to see if there were not some of the enemy in sight when on looking above them there sat a huge grizzly bear on a projecting cliff above the cave at a given signal both fired and bruin came tumbling down the jaded rocks and expired at their feet after eating a scanty breakfast preparations were made to leave the dear old spot for everthe place where many happy days had passed in that wild wilderness solitude getting into their saddles they took a long last farewell look on the cave and smoking embers of the cabin then dashed away towards cheyenne which they reached the same evening gayloyd still wore his buckskin suit and minnie with moccasins on and macinaw blanket and tanned face look more like indians than anything else minnie was not recognized by her most intimate friends in cheyenne she was so thoroughly changed in appearance they now procured full suits of clothing in the latest style of american custume and were ready to take the evening train east which they did and arrived in charleston four days later however before leaving cheyenne minnie disclosed to her former deputy who was now acting sheriff how she had so miraculously departed and her marriage of the prisoner she had taken of her cabin home on the cachealapoudre also narrated their many fishing and hunting excursions their fight with the war painted cheyennes their cave retreat and many other incidents which happened while in solitude she related to him but a short time before taking the cars for her old home in the sunny south now she was in the home of her childhood her mother as she had written made them a welcome home her father had died of pure grief for his long lost daughter he had sought far and wide but to no purpose finally pined away and died her mothers wrinkled face and gray hair also told a tale of sorrow which had nearly shipwrecked her physical frame it seemed greatly to renew her age to have minnie at home once more but true love will have its course in defiance of consequences it can never die if all marriage contracts contained that true undying love which existed between gayloyd and minnie there would never be any divorce cases in our courts marriage would be as from divine writ what therefore god hath joined together let no man put asunder gluttony is the great and first cause of intemperance debauchery and unhappines in all of its phases and finally divorce we as americans are gross gluttons eating double what our bodies need for health and it is this gormandizing and overloading ourselves with rich stimulating food which keep our bodies in a heated fever a constant craving for something stronger and under this intoxication and bodily excitement the boy craves for a cigar and finally strong drink which may carry him to a drunkards grave ninety per cent of the ills of our country is the direct result of gluttony look at our sour soreheaded dispeptics and weep a majority of our marriages in modern times are not consumated in true love it is nothing but a union of the baser passions causing the opposite sexes to unite in what is falsely called marriage it is not a union of living hearts blended in one as it is with this heroine woman such love is worse than poor skim milk hence the cause of separation and divorce they came together through an inflammation of the baser passions caused as i have said by some form of gluttony this is not the case of all but a majority could we glance behind the curtain of every domestic home in the land we would find that not more than one family in ten lived in connubial happiness could you creep in the closet and listen you would hear an unkind word from the husband a scold from the wife an uncalled for jealousy on one side and a real cause on the other so it would go from bad to worse until even their skim milk love was all gone then comes a row a separation and finally a divorce is granted and each is at liberty to form other partnerships only to be involved again mothers dont urge early marriages for fear your daughter would be unmarketable before they are out of their teens there are occasional cases where it would be adviseable for parents to urge their daughters in marriage at fourteen or fifteen but this is only rare a great many mothers in modern times think all her daughter needs is a refined education can talk french german and latin can dance sing and play the piano and bankrupt her father in her wearing apparel when she can pride herself that she has never washed a dish made her own bed or even made a pan of biscuit then she is marketable yes and so she is in one sense of the word for there are plenty of young men who have a passionate love for these guilded butterflies and even marry them he marries her good looks fine clothes musical attainments and knowledge of hog latin she marries him for his bank account stove pipe hat gold headed cane and brainless cranium both have what they purchased and no more all may go lovely for a while but reserves come the country is panic stricken banks are broken stocks become worthless gold headed canes are useless the plug is exchanged for a straw and from fine clothes to common wear he is deadbroke yes flatter than the ancients supposed the world to be it is hard for him to come down to the common vocations of every day life in fact he will not do it and his wife knows nothing about a domestic life she cannot cook even the simplest form of a meal what can they do they must come down to it sink or swim is all that will save life the once gaudy peacock is nothing but a buzzard she is peevish cross discouraged and disgusted her husband is worse he growls frets jaws rips and tears and finally becomes a sour soarheaded dispeptic a goodfornothing whelp the last act in the play is fight pull hair separation and divorce the cause of so many divorce cases can be summed up in a few words marrying for good looks fine clothes and lastly but not least gluttony i have said enough on this subject and will now return to minnie and gayloyd after they had lived on the old homestead one year and a half minnies mother died and was buried in the old churchyard by the side of her dear father a monument was erected and a jessamine planted to commemorate the sacred spot the old home now seemed dismal and forsaken minnie could not bear to live there since her mothers death the estate was sold for fifty thousand dollars and with this little fortune they moved into new york city where gayloyd invested his means in a lucretive mercantile business and is now one of the millionaires of the great metropolis minnie was always supreme ruler of her own household duties and if necessary she could cook as good a meal as the steward of an atlantic steamer and much more hygienic what came upon her tidy table was not tedious and tasteless she was economical prudent and graceful she could entertain a common beggar or the bonton of society with etiquettical precision her education with common sense and early training was now being used to good advantage occasionally gayloyd would dress up in his wild mountain buckskin suit and minnie in her novel squaw attire to the great merriment of an evening party i must now bring this little volume to a close and before doing so must say that that youthful love which existed between edward gayloyd farnham and minnie c dunbar was still burning with a livid brilliant flame and there never lived a more happy family for they were blessed with three bright eyed boys and a little girl with golden tresses which they called minnie hoping that this may teach its many readers a lesson of true love womens and mens rights in their right place which will be a benefit to them in all time to come a history of the

expedition preface the publishers of the following work feel assured that its great scientific importance will excuse the lack of an extended introduction the great narraticon exploring expedition was an undertaking of such magnitude that the public cannot fail to be impressed with a deep sense of its immense value it was subject to the reverses that attend all vast enterprises but these once surmounted a brilliant success crowned its efforts that any one should doubt the veracity of its details or smile at the toils and misfortunes of the lavigators is painful no less than incredible attention is called to the copious and valuable index which has been laboriously prepared the engravings are believed to be executed in the highest style of art no expense was spared in their production an apology is perhaps necessary for the typographical execution of the work impressed with the necessity of encouraging home manufactures native rather than foreign talent was engaged the result is not what we were led to expect and we crave pardon for the errors that exist the publishers correspondence swedesboro jan th  capt cook sir an intense wish to perpetuate a chronicle of

remote from the noise and bustle of commerce where the tasseled corn plays gently in the southern breeze and the purple foxgrape grows luscious neath a southern sun sparkles the narraticon its golden water ripples over graveled beaches kisses meekly the feet of the cold gray bluffs runs laughingly beneath the overhanging larches plays gentle music on the grassy slopes darkens beneath the shadows of the wooded hills and hides its sparkles in the cool deep coves its banks are green with life the placid lake lends health and vigor to the noble trees that seem to bend their arms to softly touch its silver surface its waters teem with merry members of the finny tribe for midst the clustering lilies sports the minnow here and there the sunfish darts and then his sides flash crystal in the noonday sun while lord of all the solemn old pahdunkie neath a stone lies watching with a jealous eye the lazy pollywog a the skylark shrilly pipng out his morning song is mirrored in its depths the blackbird at the scorching noon comes chirping to the cool shade of its wooded bank and when the hovering shadows of the night creep down upon its peaceful surface then the herons mournful note is echoed from the deep dark coves where he has made his home how many suns have smiled on narraticon none can tell b years before the white mans tread was heard within its forests the mildeyed deer has waded in its cooling streams oft has the indian maiden pensive gazed as if to penetrate its depths and seen her own sweet face reflected back the growling bear has lapped a cooling draught and grim old braves have laved their feet in narraticons waters prior to the great exploring expedition of  the condition of the natives was truly distressing they lived principally upon fish and berries roaming up and down its banks in clans and acknowledging neither law nor restraint sometimes they were peacefully inclined and then at other periods they would break out in a lawless warfare against all civilization c their ignorance was pitiable indeed one of the prominent aborigines was known to ask  for a leaky old canoe and still despite all opposing arguments persisted in his idea that a solid gold watch could be bought for fifty cents many were seen with beards descending far below their waists while some were clothed in merely a jacket and a cap their mode of warfare was curious original and effective d their toes were armed with sharp strong nails and screaming out a loud uhall they would button their jackets tightly about their breasts balance themselves upon their heads and dash their toes violently into their opponent who if unluckily standing on his feet would receive the murderous attack in his face denizens of the deep their mode of fishing was truly ingenious a glowworm impaled upon a sharp stick entices the stately pahdunkie from his bed among the reeds and as he opens his wide jaws to take in the delicious morsel the fishermans toe is thrust within his mouth and in an instant the mighty fish lies on the green sward gasping his life away their fire they procured by the primitive method of ignition by friction and after rubbing two sticks together for the space of two hours obtained the desired spark for the benefit of their weakerarmed brethren an enterprising tribe kept one hundred captives rubbing night and day two large trees together and from the sparks produced by the abrasion any one was privileged to light his pipe on the payment of a pahdunkies eyea shilling among these curious people among the most famous of their dishes may be mentioned a sort of mincedmeat of bullfrogs beads and turtles legs saturated with snakes blood and stuffed in an old celskin it is then buried in a moist soil for two weeks when baked it is eaten with raspberries and pronounced extremely good having a flavor like strong cheese or asaftida another far more common than this and one which the author will long remember as most grateful to the palate

met the effortits failureall that transpired up to august th in the early part of august  the arrival in swedesboro of messrs allen and cook revived the flagging interest felt by the citizens to know something about the people inhabiting the shores of the mysterious sheet of water that lay so near their town emboldened by the encouraging promises of the citizens messrs allen and cook conceived the bold project of an exploration their determination was no sooner made public than they were the recipients of the most flattering offers of aid mrs ira allen generously donated provisions for a twodays cruise mr ira allen loaned implements for digging g mr c s westcott of phila furnished valuable suggestions for navigating mr william black nullified his edict against trespassing so far as to allow the expedition to pass through his possessions mr charles paulus offered his services as scout a grizzly esq kindly furnished a craft suitable for navigating while to mr j keen of swedesboro the explorers were greatly indebted for data and traditional lore after careful preparation early on the morning of the th of august every detail had been looked to most carefully and all was announced as ready for the start the beautiful craft the jolly polly gaily dressed in flags and manned by lieut puddles with a stalwart crew lay bathed in the morning sun upon the bosom of the heauteous narraticon at  min past  a m the word was given to dip oars and amid the loud huzzas of the citizens and the soulinspiring strain of hail columbia these bravehearted men started out upon their perilous mission the start they crept slowly up the western bank and beheld for the first time the varied scenery of wood and dell cove and beach for which narraticon is so noted absorbed in contemplating the beauties of the scene about them they were startled from their   dream of happiness by the sudden snapping of a tholepin which threw capt cook into the bottom of the boat and the whole crew into consternation this accident occurred near the three buttes finding it impossible to remedy the unlookedfor mishap they landed and on discovering a spring proceeded to encamp h all hopes of going further on this day were at once abandoned moreover the crew becoming dissatisfied with the division of the provisions the officers thought it best to retrace their course and shortly after  oclock they embarked for home i thus was the first effort to explore narraticon frustrated and the expedition that had started under the most favorable auspices at  oclock returned the same day in time for dinner chap iii the

caused a feeling of gloom to spread over the whole scientific community so much had been expected from the explorations that its failure could hardly be credited both allen and cook were subjected to much undeserved censure while the crew and lieut puddles were openly accused of mutiny such was the condition of affairs until aug nd when these bravehearted men despite public opinion and their past failure determined to again visit the mysterious narraticon j about noon on the nd without any demonstrations from the citizens they set sail following nearly the same course as before they passed the first and second willows skirting close beside the three buttesthe scene of their former mishapand silently proceeded up the coast they soon arrived at doctors point and landing held a council upon its bold promontory it was here decided to proceed up the northern coast of battentown branch and explore the hidden wonders of its upper waters embarking they proceeded slowly along the shore watching closely for hidden snags and the fierce natives who were said to roam the bleak summits of doctors bluffs k meeting with no accident and perceiving no natives they soon reached the head of the brauch here a party under allen landed and moved cautiously inland they discovered davidsons creek which empties into the branch near their landing along its moist shores the first traces of the natives were discovered traces of the natives being unprepared to meet them in any force and finding the traces increasing in number allen concluded to retreat to the boat l setting sail they skirted the head of the branch to the southern shore and turning eastward proceeded to follow its beautiful windings they had already left the wooded tops of jimmies hills behind them and were rapidly nearing the mouth of the branch when the sudden careening of the boat threw overboard a valuable and very important hatchet belonging to ira allen esq of swedesboro m this sudden occurrence for the moment paralyzed the crew a hurried consultation was held and it was determined that under the circumstances the farther exploration on that day would indeed be unadvisable with saddened faces the crew turned the prow of the jolly polly homeward thus was the second like the first attempt ruined by a sudden freak of fortune the hidden mysteries of the upper narraticon were still concealed from civilization and mankind virtually the second expedition was not a failure a large sweep of coast had been explored traces of the natives were discovered the mouth of davidsons creek was undeniably located and the exact position of jimmies hills was defined still in the face of all these triumphs we are sorry here to record that the citizens refused farther aid to these intrepid explorers and they were obliged under the force of this difficulty to curb their impatience to reach the headwaters of the narraticon and remain inactive chap iv determination of allen and cook to explore the

lieut puddles shed tears of vexation at the resolution of his beloved commanders and asked but a chance to share the perils of the expedition alike deaf to the entreaties of their devoted crew and the scoffs of the citizens these intrepid explorers spent their time in careful preparation for their meditated voyage on the morning of the rd all was announced as ready for the start accompanied to the waters edge by the crew a few friends and lieut puddles they embarked proceeding slowly up the western coast they passed for the third time the three buttes steering thence for doctors point this after some time they reached and landing crected a flag embarking again they pushed off and going to the head of the branch landed and crected another station near the mouth of davidsons creek they then started down the southern coast passed jimmies hills and neared with thoughtful hearts the spot where the hatchet had been lost landing they proceeded to crect a monument n at this point too a station was fixed and from it across the branch might be descried the bleak summits of doctors bluffs the monument setting sail they rounded the point into the main waters of the narraticon and with stout hearts ventured to explore that wide expanse of mysterious waste suddenly passing the bold promontory of kingfishers roost they beheld for the first time the sweep of swedesboro bay rapidly crossing its wide mouth and following the windings of the shore beyond its southern boundary they plunged quickly into the overhanging shadows of perch nook leaving its cosy precincts behind them and rounding the jutting headland beyond the explorers glided silently into the still waters of pocket bay here a scene of tranquil nature met their view the struggling sunbeams scarce could force a passage through the thick foliage of the overhanging willows gentle breezes drew rustling music from the quivering leaves but scarcely rippled the glassy surface of the cool deep cove nourished by the pearly waters of a murmuring brook the grass grew tall and green above the treacherous quicksands on its shores the brush and undergrowth was thick and strong and served a screen to hide from day the still deep pools extending inland that are the homes of frogs and tender pollywogs with noiseless oars our navigators cautiously stole away from its drowsy limits and weathering nelladnakooc point bore straight across the wide sweep of water between them and a jutting headland far beyond gaining this they landed crecting a tall flagstaff they called the spot range station embarking they struck boldly out for the middle of the lake passing cape lookout far to the westward and proceeding rapidly forward until arriving nearly opposite herons perch the navigation became suddenly very dangerous hidden snags seemed to threaten the destruction of their noble craft and frequent shoals proclaimed to the hardy explorers that they were rapidly nearing the goal of their ambitionthe head of the narraticon before them lay a low sandy island while far beyond arose the wooded hills of meleys possessions to the eastward was a thick impenetrable forest in the west a meandering creek lost itself in the green meadows landing on the island our explorers looked about them and discovered many very interesting relies of antiquity discovery of the relics among the most valuable of these may be noticed a sapling placed horizontally upon two uprights along the bank of the creek upon this no doubt long ago the indian braves have sat while washing their war the cool waters that flow beneath it p after making these investigations they proceeded to crect a huge tripod upon which they unfurled their flag its symbol so inspired them that they determined to explore the creek for this purpose a   channel across the island was cut but it being late in the afternoon upon its completion they determined to abandon the enterprise for the present they then took formal possession of the land under the name of tripod island and called the channel they had made allens cut embarking they steered for the eastern coast striking it in the immediate vicinity of buzzards delight keeping close in shore

higher ele vations bordering the county of orange where he stopped to gaze enchanted by the beauty of as fair a landscape as mortal eye ever rested upon a plateau of many acres in extent girdled by a range of hills lay before him there were farm lands under the highest cultivation a homestead the face of which looked a hospitable welcome          eanxnre st ok it was nearly surrounded by noble shade trees and luxuriant foliage of fruit and vine  the house fronted a beautiful lake which bore upon its calm breast shadows of clouds and trees bathed in hues of sunset the wellstocked farm and adjacent sheds were in convenient proximity to a farmyard filled with numerous broods of fowl of many sorts and among them the goldenplumaged bird originators of the famous crevecceur  of our day there were families of animals  feeding or lazily chewing the cud after their  kind a  little aside nearer the garden which was wondrous wild but beautiful  i wot with its gorgeous belt of autumnal  blossoms and beds of sweetscented herbs stood long rows of hives denoting the home of the bees with plentiful woodbine trailing above which furnished them sweets i fortheir store  immense tracts of improved lands bounded  the house domain on every side stretching away were fields of ripening corn and   g bearded wheat waving and undulating in             rannie st on       the sweet evening breeze all ready for the reapers sickle the thrifty farmer leaves no stone un  turned on a patch of stubble ground hard by active measures were already afoot for the coming season a plough drawn by a team of superb horses was guided by a  gentleman evidently the owner of the team on a chair fastened by a screw to the beam of the plough a small boy was seated  enchanted with the novel carriage he shouted and laughed in the highest enjoy  ment now addressing his father in gleeful accents again bestowing his entire attention upon a great mastiff that bayed and bounded along the freshturned furrow answering so the gay challenge of his little master the exuberance of spirits evinced by the merry party was quite infectious and the tired traveller was moved to advance and introduce himself without delay he was greeted with a hearty welcome and a mu  tual recognition took place between the farmer and the young man           fnaie st ong a they had met previously in new york  and were delighted now to renew their ac  quaintance i little thought said the visitor  while contemplating from yonder eminence the  beauty and happiness of this rural scene to  find a nobleman ploughing his own land and why not my dear sir replied m  de crevecoeur what more noble occupa  tion the instant i enter on my own land the idea of property of exclusive right  of independence exalts my mind what  should the american farmer befor al  though i am a foreigner i have so thor oughly transplanted myself that i have taken root on this soilwhat should we  be without distinct possession of the soil it feeds us it clothes us from it we draw our best meat our richest drink the very  honey of our bees comes from this privileged spot no wonder we should thus cherish its possession no wonder that so many europeans who have never been able to say that any portion of land was theirs cross                    i   fannie st ohnn      the stormy atlantic and face its perils to realize that happiness

plough and let them loose to seek their j pasture the boy leaped from his seat and after the manner of boys dashed off with his dog when began a series of ground and lofty tumbling wonderful to behold

struct ure it was situated in the midst of a large domain of park and wooded hills and pre secnted a picture of grandeur and stateli ness not common in the new world there were colonnades and a vestibule whose mas sive mahogany doors studded with silver opened into a wide hall where tessellated floors sparkled under the light of a lofty  dome of richly painted glass underneath the dome two cherubs carved in wood ex tended their wings and so  formed the centre frolm which an immense chandelier of cut glass depended  upon the floor    fa nnie st ohan    beneath the dome there stood a

combinations of painted birds and fruits and flowers abounded every where in rich contrast with the delicate blue tint that prevailed upon the lofty walls the state rooms were covered with per sian

ths recital of monsieur m st john de crevecceur commences at the point of his reaching his paternal mansion at ostend after an absence of twentyeight years dur ing which time he had resided principally in america a few idays after my arrival at ostend begins m st john i learned that five strangers had disembarked in great peril from a small wherry in which they had crossed the straits of dover and landed at a village near by  on visiting these per sons upon the shore i found them    to be           fannie st ohn american gentlemen who had escaped from an english prison  i instantly took them to the house of my father where we spared no pains to con vince them that they had landed upon a hospitable shore and in order to revive in their hearts the sweet hopes of fatherland we dressed them in proper garments and procured for them every succor needful to their situation providing a carriage to take them to the orient an american vessel that we learned was about to sail from a neighboring port for boston since my own departure from  new york i had not been ableto hear one word respecting my family notwithstanding all the letters i had written them this silence afflicted me deeply i was often agitated by presentiments that some terrible mishaps had befallen them and be lieved that all were lost it should not be wondered at that my imagination carried me into excessive grief when i suspected that the war was the   fannie st ohn      cause preventing news of my wife and little ones from reaching me encouraged by the present favorable circumstance i wrote to my wife to the governor of the state of new york to the sheriff of the county and i implored these gentlemen now my guests in the name of the cause for which they had suffered so much not only to take charge of my letters but to send them to their destination rest assured we will do so they said as soon as we arrive but we advise you to direct your communications to the care of captain gustavus fellowes who is a father among us and a brave and noble man write to him and believe we shall commend the carrying out of your wishes with as much zeal as you have shown in our interest i did as they advised fearing however that a stranger one who had never even heard of me and so remote from the place to which these letters were addressed would scarcely take so much trouble as to send them to their destination    i       fannie t s ohn foreseeing the depreciation of paper  currency i sent to my wife a bill of ex change thinking the amount in silver and gold might be more useful to her and by a happy forethought made the order payable i to gustavus fellowes in accordance with   their advice to put matters in this gentle mans hands so we bade farewell and they set sail in the orient in the month   of october i i  months passed not only had i the grief of not receiving any reply to my letters but had not even the consolation of hearing of   their safe arrival in boston my sorrow and embarrassment on this score were bit ter in the extreme in i just eighteen months from the  time of the sailing of the orient i was i appointed consul to new york where i  arrived on the gth of november of the same year exactly five days before the english troops left the city which had re mained the centre of their power during seven years l    fannie st john      as soon as i landed i sought my former acquaintance of whom i eagerly inquired for news of my family  a presentiment that some fatal secret  was about to be disclosed haunted me night and day to a hurried question he replied  your wife no longer lives a stranger i came and claimed your children and took l them we know not where this announcement of so terrible a  calamity fell upon me like a thunderbolt  i should have fallen to the ground but for  the support at this instant of my friend  mr seyton who had come to conduct me  from the french vessel to his house i ac companied him with difficulty my mind  being absorbed in the deepest sorrow  permit me to draw a veil over this sad picture suffice it to say that in this accu mulation of misery it was seventeen days before i heard that my children were in boston in the mansion of one whose name my informants did not know but my mind instantly reverted to mr fellowes although           fannie st hn how he had become so much my friend or by what means the children had been trans ported thither i could not comprehend it must be that in some constitutions the principles of life are so strong that even l   the most violent shocks are powerless to disunite them in the midst of the losses with which destiny had overwhelmed me i experienced a ray of consolation in knowing that my children  my precious little onese that had been so long the objects my dreams conjectures and inquietude were safe i could not set out at once to seek them as i ardently desired not only on account of feebleness of health but severity of weather it was one of the most cruelly inclement winters that had been known for many years  the snow lay upon the ground to so great a depth as to prove an impassable barrier to such a journey it would bb vain to attempt to describe how much my intense impatience in all these circumstances augmented the anguish of my mind and pains of my body lo nn ni   fannie st yohn  as soon as the roads were passable i set out to behold once more the dear rem nants of my family from whom the fortunes of war had so long separated me i felt a great longing also to unravel this singular problem of humanity and to press in my own the hands of that unknown friend to whom  i owed such extraordinary obliga tions the nearer i approached to boston the more vividlyi my children were present to my mind and now i seemed to see and recognize them but such was the weak ness of my nervovu system that i had not strength to enjoy even in imagination the happiness that destiny had in store for me the desire to behold them again agitated me almost as much as had the fear that i had lost them forever twas twilight when i arrived in bos ton obtainiig the requisite information respecting mrpellowess residence i soon discovered the street the house in which breathed the beings dearest to me on earth        i  it was at this moment that the spiritof their mother seemed to smile upon me and to rejoice that her children from whom death had so cruelly separated her in the midst of the terrors of war were now about to regain a father who tenderly loved them i knocked at the door and inquired with trembling lips if this was the house of gustavus fellowes and if the children were there  yes they were there i en tered the parlor and beheld my daughter seated by the side of the lady of the house engaged in needlework scarcely had she looked on me when she grew pale closed her eyes bowed her head and was as one dead my dear fannie cried i embracing her here is thy father whom heaven has permitted to see thy dear face again after these years of separation  soon my little louis came in whom i  recognized by his resemblance to his grand father for he was scarcely three years old when i was forced to leave him i em    a nnie st oh      braced him pressing him again and again to my heart and taking him on my knee seated myself beside my daughter who having recovered manifested the joy of her heart by her affectionate caresses asking i  many questions of my misfortunes of my  sojourn in france and of the commission  i  with which i had been honored i durst not ask a single question fear ing to diminish the precious emotions which the sight of these dear children inspired in me a few days since said my daughter in looking over the newspaper i saw an article dated london announcing that a person bearing your name and formerly a resident in the county of orange had just been appointed consul to new york the paper fell from my hands i appealed to  captain fellowes to enlighten my doubts imagine my father the joy of your daughter when assured that you still lived and that   it was indeed you to whom the article re ferred i cut out the notice and put it in          fannie st  n my portfolio see here it is  and today i behold and embrace you   heaven be praised my heart went out in silent thanksgiv ing to god for the happiness of this hour i then addressed this new friend this brother whom providence had raised up to succor my children in their days of calam ity i pressed his hands with all the energy of deep emotion and gratitude i saluted his worthy consort and kissed the children for the whole family had assembled in the parlor at the news of the arrival of fan nies father at seeing the evidences of the tender care with which my children had been treat ed my feelings could only manifest them selves in tears i could find no words to express my heartfelt thanks overcome finally by the fatigues of the journey ex hausted by the sad pleasure aild painful re membrances which this scene had recalled i retired to my chamber to recover from all these agitations    fannie st hn     early in the morning my children came to see greet anl caress me it was now four years since we had enjoyed this happi ness which would have been greatly en hanced could my dear alex who had been left in france have shared it with us anld now what frightful details what terrible descriptions my daughter gave me of all the evils to which our part of the country had been subjected during those hostile daysof the death of her poor mother of the burning of our house by the savages of the destruction of our cat tie and all the abundance with which i had left them surrounded what pictures she drew of the sufferings and privations to which she and little philippe louis had been exposed at the house of a neighbor who had likewise lost nearly everything by the war breakfast being ready my child ren left me and i soon followed them v what was my astonishment on entering the parlor to see my daughter seated upon the knee of mr fellowes who was tying up her curls            fannie st yo h  my mother said fannie always wore curls in this way tied up with a ribbon mr fellowes observes smiling this is my daily task fannie likes it and i love to render her these services though not quite in my line we love her as our own since these children came not a cloud has overshadowed the peace which reigns in our home my wife and myself have perceived this for a long time that in becoming more numerous we have become more happy i can give but a faint idea of the har mony existing in this domestic circle cthe good father watches over the cheer fulness of the family god has bestowed upon him with the deepest interest as soon as he perceives a shadow of gloom or sadness among the members of his household an order is quietly given the sound of the viol is heard he leads them out and dances with them till serenity and gayety are re stored in the evenings especially these little parties are formedto which the sons and daughters of the neighbors are invited     fannie st h     to this picture of domestic happiness we must add that of economy order neat ness and industry such is the family into the bosom of which providence has conducted my children and where i resided for several months i said to captain fellowes one day what induced you to undertake the perils of a journey in the rigor of winter and in the midst of war to carry to the family of a stranger letters from one of whom you had never heard until the arrival of your five compatriots what motives could have in duced you to pity my children to befriend  them in their unhappy situation and to bring them here without knowing that you would ever be reimbursed for your advances there is nothing extraordinary in all this answered he it was your generosity toward our unfortunate countrymen it was the letters they brought me from you the reading of which produced a singular effect on my soul it was the trust you reposed in me in passing your letter of credit to my o m          fannie st hn  order it was a desire to return good for  good  but my dear friend said

finally delivered to me seventeen days after the english had left the city of new york when all the letters remained in the postoffice this cruel blank formed a space of nearly two years i shall pre serve the original of this letter as long as i live and in my will have especially ordered my children to consider it as a most precious relic  as an act of humanity and generos ity unparalleled  as the ideal of a protect ing providence to which two among them owe their preservation in this life and i the happiness of having found them again  boston           dec   to monsieur de crevecoeur i have received your letter of the  th     e     a fannie st john of september conveyed to me by the officers  of the vessel protector the reading of it made so deep an impression on my mind that i immediately took all necessary meas  ures to obtain information of the state of  your family but my efforts were useless the war having interrupted all communication p when i saw this i resolved to go myself to  the county of orange i conferred with my i wife who approved the plan it is only just said she the family of this poor i gentleman is perhaps in affliction the savages and the english people say have committed many ravages in those parts let us do for his family in america what he has done for our friends on the coast of normandy seven days after my departure from boston i had the happiness of meeting on the borders of the hudson river the sheriff of orange county who as colonel of militia occupied with his regiment the barrack of fish kill lthe letter that i gave him from you was the first intelligence he had received since you left the prisons of new york    qfi   n     fannive st john    he asked me one hundred questions regard y ing your fate and that of alex     upon questioning the condition of your  family i learned of the death of your wife the deplorable state to which your children  were reduced through the devastation of j the savages and the famine resulting from it i shuddered with horror at the details i resolved immediately to snatch them from this unhappy state and take them home with  me happily though the snowh was deep the paths were well trodden the sheriff approved my resolution isaying you cannot render better aid to my friend and neighbor st john since  the destruction of the time has ruined our schools and god knows how we shall in  struct our children from this moment i thought only of  the means of transporting them to boston as comfortably as possible the subject of clothing being of special importance for tunately this want had been foreseen and provided for by my wife before my depart         zfannie st jh on ure from boston for so great had been the destruction in orange that not a piece of flannel or any other material suitable for clothing could be obtained since they are with us we have taken the same care of them as of our own little people we have a girl and a boy of nearly the same age with them they live in the most perfect har mony if we give any preference it is to your children as they need it more by hav ing been more unhappy my wife and my self have received them as children that we had lost and had found and if i should be so unfortunate as never to hear from you again we should still continue to treat them with the tenderest care not knowing what your religious principles may be we take them to church with our family andthey will offer to god the same worship with us when you receive this letter will you inform us of your wishes upon this subject and they shall be complied with before leaving the sheriff mr wood hull who had taken me to his house i in  fannie st ohn    quired what might have been the expenses of your children since the death of their i mother and offered to deposit forty guineas i in his hands he did not wish to receive  them and assured me that the sale of some  estate horses and cattle that escaped de  struction had proved sufficient to defray all i expenses which judging from the deplora ble state in which i found them could not have been much as to your plantation and lands i advised him never to sell them with out obtaining your consent i received the amount of your bill of exchange and shall employ it for the benefit of your children  i shall address to you a copy of this letter by every opportunity until i receive an answer  gustavus

pseudonym the name of one who lived a useful and honored life and whose memory is fondly  and reverently cherished by his descendants  he was a graduate of one of our colleges a man of refined tastes agreeable in per  son and attractive manner nor was the difference in their years greater than ought i to be between husband and wife no one need be told that where there is no dis parity of years or

at any rate the word was  spoken and fannie with blushing cheek i and downcast eyes bade her lover not de  spair and thus the spell of the magician  was thrown over their young hearts and i they

to her revealed her new hap piness mrs fellowes whose affectionate  heart and fresh feeling made her give to her child the largest measure of sympathy i saw yet a lion in the path and feared that in this case as in many others the course of true love would not run smooth and i so it proved m de crevecoeur had come before the  world in the literary character of an amer i ican farmer and had expended no small  amount of time writing upon the theme but in his heart of hearts he was a french  nobleman vvith the blue blood of his norman ancestors coursing through his asssafeealsbes          f annie st ohn veins the thought of his daughters mar rying a yankee schoolmaster and passing her life in boston was repulsive to his aris tocratic spirit and he resolutely set his face against the hopes and wishes of the lovers  vain were the tears the caresses of the daughter vain was the manly pleading of  the lover but still he was a man of sense and had seen a great deal of the world he knew that in america he could have no legal control over his daughters action and that the lovers if driven to desperation might marry without his consent and that the tie would be indissoluble he knewthat he must rely upon fannies strong sense of duty and that deference to parental au thority which is an instinct in the french nature and in which she had been reared  he therefore said to her

something to wear  and prove how that insignificant trait to some others more important doth relate and show how those ladies with clothing enough can battle with fortune either smooth or rough how this one little straw conclusively shows the channel in which their real ambition flows that a miss who has something to  wearl of a habit of idleness will beware         something to v ear and not her life in sheer indolence pass through with such senseless complaints as nothing to do  nor when married her husbands wishes defeat with excusesf having nothing to eat  nor from his caresses turn

carry my poor rhythm right through and frankly fairly and truthfully state the difference between a one and the other trait and as i proceed oh glory ye bright fair that from your ranks came one  with something to wear  who lost not her character or position and fulfils on earth a real useful mission and yet retains a sufficiency of pride as  charity and fashion can be alied the goddess of fashion so hardly reviled around many an artists hearth oft hath smiled ft   something to wear     with the coveted gift of  something to do to produce from his genius something quite new although proud

lifes comforts or human pitye in the fireplace there smothered an unfed on the floor stood a table upon it no fare wherewith to quench a stomach s cra ing desire and nothing to cheer a poor mortal was

find ourselves minus ill abruptly close with a sweet little finis the devils race course a legend of baltimore by e h docwra entered according to the act of congress in the year  by henry taylor in the clerks office of the district court of maryland baltimore published by henry taylor  the devils race course a legend of baltimore by e h docwra baltimore published by henry taylor  preface legends have at all times been recognised as containing highlyexcited historical accounts of incidents connected with certain localities springing into existence from some facts which are not wholly devoid of truth nor merely creations of imaginationsuch recitals are more or less interesting on account of their local nature they are generally of a wild and superstitious character yet nevertheless entertaining and sometimes instructive when well told all countries have their legendary lore much of which has been preserved from oblivion and as there is a legendary character impressed upon the ground mentioned in the following narrative which may be interesting to some of our good citizens i have thought proper to let it appear before the public originally preserved but for my own amusement a friend has prevailed upon me to allow him to publish it the locality is a well known spot to many citizens of baltimore who will recognise it as a place to their boyish days once deara place where they have spent many a saturdays afternoon enjoying the sports of bandy ball and racing and i trust that it may not be devoid of interest now that the scenery of the locality is fast passing away i think there is a morality contained in it which may make some amends for its otherwise hard and wild character it is a trifle to be sure probably not worthy of being recorded but such as it is and under the above circumstances it is given to the public the devils race course introduction one sunday afternoon of a beautifully clear autumn day and many years lang syne my old familiar friend tom and myself wandered amidst the woods that then skirted the south western suburbs of this good city of baltimore the atmosphere on the day in question was deliciously refreshing and our lungs respired with a freedom that seemed to infuse our system with a new life for it is a blessed relief on a quiet sabbath day to quit a town and all its working day cares and seek in the country tranquil nature and worship natures god the trees were decked with all those rich and partycolored vestments which render their appearance so peculiarly attractive to the eye and for which americas forests are so justly celebrated in that delightful season of the year we had passed the afternoon in the full enjoyment of those glad feelings which accompany a rustic walk and which sensations can be appreciated only by the dwellers of a city when they escape for a time from the avenues of bricks and mortar which in cities seem to wall in and contract the pure airs of heaven and to limit the expansion of the soul being slightly fatigued by our ramble my friend tom proposed that we should seat ourselves and rest ere we directed our feet towards the neighbouring town on looking around for a congenial spot we perceived through the openings of some trees that stood a few paces from us a circle of clear land which proved to be the devils race course for by that cognomen my friend designated the place as we stepped upon its precincts this was a spot well known to many of the honored residents of our city whose heads now rest quietly beneath the clods of the valley and it still is remembered by numerous of our adult citizens now living often and again has the man now in the prime of his life when he was a boy and let loose from the restraint of his school upon a saturday repaired to this place to engage in boyish sportsand perhaps if he was not very scrupulous in regard to his duties to the master he may have hied hither upon some truant expedition at other times but to the readers own conscience i leave the latter application however for the information of those of my readers who may never have visited the devils race course i will add that it was situated nearly opposite to the old carroll mansion which is familiarly known as mount clareand it occupied a gentle elevation of ground that rises on the north west of the baltimore and ohio bail road it was a circular clearing of about three hundred yards in circumference and at the time the following legend was related to me was surrounded by a thick woods the earth was covered with a short dark green grass which was thick beneath and refreshing to the feet the sun was upon his decline and the entire area lay in shade the surrounding tree tops swayed gracefully in the breeze and presented a gay spectacle in the horizontal sunlight we seated ourselves beneath the branches of a giant oak and a superstitious dread of some undefinable fear stealthily crept through my nerves as my friend remarkedand you never saw this place no i replied i was not aware that so lovely a spot bearing such a dreadful name was in this vicinity well he continued there is a legend connected herewith which possesses high romance and by your leave i will relate it whilst we rest ourselves under this old tree i should like to hear it proceed he began in the following words the legend although the grass here is now rich and green yet i can well remember when nothing but strips of dry withered vegetation enclosed this area every little green blade was blighted as soon as it put forth its verdant spire to attempt to refresh and beautify the earth those persons who were superstitious attributed this fact to the influence of satan for he has been seen upon this very ground for a long period of time this pretty spot was held by the vulgar in such dread that it was shunned as being in the exclusive keeping of evil spirits such however had not always been the case for before the incidents which i am about to relate occurred this was a favorite place of resort for the few inhabitants of the neighbourhood and was styled the forest ring there lived towards the close of the eighteenth century in a log hut that stood near the north shore of the middle branch of the patapsco riveror what is more familiary known as the spring gardens that beautiful sheet of water which we see glistening off youder an old negro whose name was sam jones this old fellow resided alone with no companion but a faithful dog and spent much of his time fishing and crabingand some of his time hunting in the woods his hut a rude bed some few cooking utensils a little furniture a skiff some fishing nets and tackle and a gun comprised his worldly wealthoften would he start out when the sun was setting for a hunt in the woods and not return till morning in which excursions his dog and gun always accompanied him and it was upon one of his night excursions and when he had been out in search of racoons that the following adventure befel him he had been out many hours without meeting with the least success and had nearly reached home in an ill temper when just as he neared this place his dog started a large coon which immediately ran into the centre of this circle and seated itself upon that charred stump of an old black oak tree the dog instead of following the chase as he was wont to do suddenly stopped upon the verge of the enclosure then gave a piercing and affrighted howl and ran away as fast as possible sam called after him but he heeded not his masters voice which circumstance served to make his ill humour greater because of such untimely desertion he loved to witness the sport of a coon fight and never fired his gun but when his dog could not get at the animal therefore venting a curse or two after his canine friend he raised his gun to the shoulder and took a deliberate aim at the coon which continued sitting upon the stump as unconcerned as if it was surrounded by friends and allies looking the old negro full in the eye and with an impudent stare aha massa coon me shall hab you for certain sure inwardly exclaimed samthen clickflashbangand away strode the negro through the smoke to pick up his game for he thought that he had made certain of his mark judge his consternation and terror when he saw the animal still sitting calmly on the stump unmoved as though nothing had taken place a burst of wild laughter rent the quiet night as the coon addressed the old negro thus so ho mister sam jones you expected to have me eh but never mind old boy you only made a mistake in your aimhowever i am glad to see you although you did shoot at me sam sank to the earth almost paralized with fear and at the same time nearly stifled by the sulphuric atmosphere which surrounded him the moon which had been shining all the night very brightly suddenly became obscured by heavy cloudsso much so that intense darkness pervaded the scene in another moment a bluish flame shot out from the old stump and cast a ghastly light around sams tongue clove as it were to the roof of his mouth as he vainly endeavoured to utter a cry for help be quiet and get up sam jones harshly exclaimed a rough voice near himor ill send you down to shaking with affright from head to foot the old fellow arose found himself close to the stump and beheld an awful object near him this was the devil it is unnecessary for me to describe him for he has been so often painted that i have no doubt you are familiar with his portrait suffice it that it was the very old boy himselfold sam was positive of the fact and never denied it the negro was a courageous old darkey and scarcely knew what fear was but he could not bear such an interview unmovedwho couldtherefore he felt terribly alarmed for his safety both temporal and spiritual as he saw the devils eyes glowing upon him like red hot coalswhilst from his distended nostrils a stream of pale blue sulphuric flame was being continually emitted now jonesspake the demon addressing himself in that familiar style to sam you know william gruff the fishermanwho lives in this neighbourhoodacross the river i have a letter for him and have been waiting for some time for an opportunity to send ityou shall be the bearer my fine old fellow and here it isproducing at the time a dirty packet which was sealed with an enormous black seal and superscribed in blood red characters which he placed in sams handadding as he did so and as you value your life and eternal safety be sure that you deliver it to him before daylightaway without giving the negro time to replyeven if he had had the inclination so to do which i much doubt the devil flourished his long tail in the air for a moment and then gave sam a cut with it over his haunches as if with a heavy coach whip which started him off smarting under the blow with the speed of an affrighted buck as soon as he cleared the circle he cast one hasty glance behind him and saw the whole area filled with grinning demons who were dancing and capering around the place in the exuberance of their infernal glee away from the proximity of that place of dreadful meeting he found himself again in the clear moonlight and proceeded to make the best of his steps towards his hut on reaching which he found his runaway dog in waiting at the door william gruff the person to whom old sam was delegated to convey the devils letter lived on the opposite shore of the spring gardensand on the edge of a very secluded and almost hidden cove he bore a bad name in the neighbourhood and was generally known by the appellation of surly bill physically he was a powerful man and in disposition he was so sullen that the residents of the vicinity all shunned intercourse with him he was much feared on account of the ill temper which he habitually shew when brought in contact with any of the neighbours and by reason of the immense strength with which he seemed gifted to sustain if necessary his bad dispositionconsequently none of the inhabitants of that locality held any further communication with him when he appeared among them than the nature of business transactions necessarily required yet there was a mystery around this man that all were anxious to solve but there was no person who wished to cultivate his acquaintance and endeavour to learn it he lived as it were alone in the worldwith no companions save his own bad thoughts uncaring for by and evidently uncaring for any one now to sam it was any thing but a pleasant idea to think that he was to go over the river to gruffs at such a time of the night and upon such an errand as that wherewith he was charged yet he feared to disobey the devils order for like most country negroes of the old school he was tinged with considerable superstition therefore after considering the case for a while he resolved at all hazard to execute his sion and accordingly went to the place where he had moored his skiffon his way thither he recollected he had left his favourite gun in the forest ring but he did not dare to return for it it fact he rejoiced at his easy escape from the evil one and nothing could have induced him again to have approached the scene of his misfortune on reaching the skiff which was moored to a log he cast her loose jumped in and began to scull across the river once from the land and gliding through the tranquil water the old fellow regained something of his selfpossession the radiant moon gentle river and refreshing air calmed his feverish brain and caused him to begin to think that he had only been dreaming acting under the influence of such reflections he rested upon his oar for a little while and then determined to turn his boat toward the rearward shore go home and retire comfortably to bed but instantly upon altering the course of his little vessel a forked stream of bloodred flame ascended high above the tops of the distant circle of trees which he had in terror so lately quitted he felt that it was a sign of admonition warning him to do his errand and he then knew thad he did not dreamhe knew also that he was fated to cross the river and fulfil the instructions given to himor to use his own emphatic languageoffend de debil and be dd with a heavy heart he reheaded his skiff to the southern shore and propelled it into surly bills cove it was past midnight when sam landed and he proceeded cautiously towards the cabin which gruff had erected for his habitation he reflected as he went upon the best manner of approaching the person of whom he was in quest arriving within a few paces of his place of destination he suddenly became alarmed by the sound of an unearthly song or chaunt and the next step forward disclosed to him gruff himself engaged over a fire in the front of his cabin stirring a liquid which he was boiling in an old iron pot the strange sounds which frightened the old negro proceeded from gruffs lips and were an incantation sams first thought was to retreat but the advance of his footsteps had been detected by the quick ear of the fisherman who seized a large knife which laid upon the ground near him and sprang towards the intruder with his weapon poised and ready if necessary to strike good lor hab mercy massa gruff dis only old sam cried the negro more than ever alarmed because of the threatening attitude of the other and what the devil brings you here was the surly demand a demoniacal laugh spread through the woods as the name of the evil one fell from the white mans tongue which laugh was answered by an hundred echos both fisherman and negro were alike startledafter a minutes continuation the horrid sounds seemed to die away in the distance when sam recollecting his commission presented the letter to gruff remarking at the time that it was gib to me by de d by a gentleman who told me to fotch it to you afore de day do broke the white man snatched the packet violently and began eagerly to peruse its contents whilst a sardonic smile played around his lips and gave a terrible expression to his hard featured face he clutched his knife convulsively and moved a step nearer towards sam as he read blood only now is wanting for the charm but he stayed his course as the next line read yet must thou not my messenger do harm tomorrow night at midhour thou must come to the forest ring unarmed and all alone sam departed without ceremony whilst gruffs thoughts were riveted to the letter regained his boat pushed off for home with all the strength which fright lent to his brawny arms and entered his own cabin just as the cock was heralding the approach of aurora and her smiling train overcome by the fatigues and excitement of the passing night the old fellow threw himself upon his humble bed and slept till noon this is a queer story said i yes replied tom but it is not finished well i continued i cant conceive why the devil made so strange a use of the old negrowhy didnt he send some of his imps of darkness to gruff or go to him personally what was the use of going to so much trouble when it could have been all avoided my dear fellow you dont understand these matters answered tometiquette etiquette you must know is observed amongst spirits as well as among men and it would have been a breach of the devils rules of society to have gone or to have sent any of his own proper subjects to gruff at that time for he was not sufficiently far advanced in his incantations to have a personal interview with old sin or with any of his satellites and you must learn further that before the devil can meet a white man face to face some black messenger must act as a gobetween to open a channel of communication between them and sam being the first negro that the old boy entrapt into his service of course he had to go it was for no other reason the devil entertained no ill feeling towards him individuallyany other black man who had been situated as sam was would have been made use of in the like manner your explanation is sufficient i replied you may have the case as you please for i shall not dispute with you upon the subject but let me call your attention to the fact that the sun has gone down and i am not particularly anxious to hear any more of your infernal story here let us hasten to the city and if you will sup with me i shall be pleased to hear the remainder of the legend in my own room beside a cheerful fire over a glass of good old sherry and with a fine havana my dear fellow i accept your invitation allons night found my friend and myself comfortably seated in my apartment at mine inn and in the verbose language of the law beside the aforesaid cheerful fire and over the hereinbefore mentioned sherry and with the above referred to havanas to wit segars between our teeth he that is to say my aforesaid friend tom did then and there at the city of baltimore aforesaid and in the above mentioned apartment of the said inn and at that particular time of the day to wit night take up the broken threads of his legend and tic their ends together thus for some eighteen months william gruff had resided at the place of our introduction to him none knew who he was whence he came or aught concerning his former life professedly he claimed to be a fisherman and did occasionally exercise that calling and attend at the city market with his fish for sale yet many of his neighbours hinted and said that they thought surly bill was no better than he should be who is and that what little fishing he did was only done to cloak his bad deeds however gruff was evidently both pleased and alarmed with the contents of the letter which we left him reading there was more in it than we can ever learn for old sam being the only witness to its perusal abruptly left the fishermans presence as we have seen ere the same was half read if you are not satisfied with what you know you must tax your imagination to supply any deficiency when gruff finished the perusal and reperusal of the contents of the letter he dropped it into his iron pot and eagerly watched it as it slowly dissolved hissing the mean while like an enraged serpent in the boiling liquid that the pot contained for some seconds a densely black and suffocating mist arose from the cauldron then all traces of the paper became lost by its incorporation with the other ingredients of the vessel gruff now put his fire out and carefully removed his pot and contents into his cabin and sat in deep meditation for hours the fact is that gruff had been one of a gang of buccaniers who for a long time were the terror of traders in the gulf of mexico and among the west indian islands once he was taken prisoner but managed to escape from his captors a variety of circumstances led him to this vicinity and thinking that the seclusion of the place where he built his cabin would afford him concealment he had determined to make that spot the locality of his abode to all appearance he evidently was poor and certainly he did not earn the means of subsistence by his limited operations in fishing he would often absent himself for weeks at a time from his home and these circumstances gave the gossips grounds of conjecture that there was something wrong about this surly neighbour he had become possessed of an inordinate desire for wealth and seemed to think that if he could amass riches he would be protected by them from all dangerfor he lived in continual fear of having his misdeeds sooner or later discoveredtherefore he had made his mind up to obtain gold at all risks be it even at the hazard of his souls salvation and determined to invoke the assistance of the prince of darkness having often heard from the desperate and wicked men with whom he had been linked in infamy many strange stories respecting the rites and ceremonies to be observed to induce the fiend to hold communion with man he gathered together the fragments of such knowledge as he had gleaned from those sources and with drugs and herbs and cabalistic rites and conjurations laboured unceasingly for months in vain attempts to call the devil forth at length his efforts seemed upon the eve of being crowned with success for the letter received by him at the hands of the negro contained the information that one ingredient alone was necessary to complete his invocation and that desideratum was blood and the letter further directed him to repair at the following midnight hour to the forest ring and there he would have such information communicated to him as should ensure the means of gratifying his wishes also that until he had so visited the designated place he should not approach any human being but must keep himself secluded from the world impatiently gruff waited the appointed time and slowly the intervening hours seemed to pass at length night came and twelve oclock found him standing alone upon the verge of the forest ring the moon shone beautifully bright the clear water lay sleeping in the distance not a breath of wind ruffled even a leaf of the old trees and no sound was heard save the rustling made by the footsteps of the man as he trod through the autumn leaves which thickly bestrewed the earth on such a night one would have supposed that no person could have entertained feelings but of peace nature lay in repose and seemed to court man to follow her example the very inmates of the wood had so done for not even the tiny voice of an insect disturbed the quiet of the airyet heedless of all such soothing influences which were as naught to the heart of this bad man he had stridden with painfully rapid strides in his eagerness to reach this place from his boat until he stood upon the edge of the circle willing and nerved to face any thing be it of earth or of h he had anticipated witnessing something terrible and had accordingly prepared himself for any sight but judge of his disappointment as he stood looking into the ring to find nothing he was beginning to think that he had laboured under some delusion and stamped his foot in a fury of despair at this moment he entered the circle and on approaching the stump perceived a gun leaning against it wondering at such a strange circumstance he raised the weapon and saw a letter in the grass and directly in the spot which had been covered by the but of the gunthis was the same gun that old sam left behind him when he affrightedly quitted this place the night beforegruff picked the letter up and found that it was directed to himself he opened it and nervously read as follows if thou hast courage take this loaded gun get blood of some one who hath murder done a magic ball is charged within its womb which fired therefrom will tenant the dark tomb the blood thus shed procure and mix it well that with thy pots ingredients it may swell and i and mine will answer thee from hell the reader shuddered at the conclusion of the above for the last lines were enough to make the stoutest heart quail the beautiful moon and the far off twinkling stars seemed as if they were watching the earth like guardian angels yet gruff did not feel their mild influence a raging desire maddened his brain and engrossed his thoughts get blood of some one who hath murder done he repeated aloudthen after a few minutes deep reflection he exclaimed vehemently i have it yes captain jack reefer you shall be the sacrifice and i will have my long hoped for revenge you little think in you fancied security that danger is nigh it shall encompass you with this gun and magic ball i hold your life in my hand and by g i will have it murderer you are once you betrayed me and then i swore to repay you for the treachery when the time should come that time has come and i will be revenged ere the morning dawns i will be on my way to seek you a long distance lay between us nevertheless you are not the less beyond my reach thus soliloquising he threw the instrument of death across his shoulder and moved rapidly towards the river upon gaining which he crossed it and soon reached his hut the remainder of the night he occupied in preparing for a long journey first he buried his iron pot and its contents deep in the secret recesses of the wood then completed his arrangements fastened the door of his cabin and left the place before sun rise gruff was absent for some time yet his presence being undesired by his neighbours his absence created no anxiety or care none ever visited him or wished to receive him within their own doors a month passed ere he returned bringing with him a small bottle which was filled with blood the murderer and his victims blood had been connected for many days and nights what a horrible thoughtthe idea alone was enough to have struck the terror of discovery into the heart of any thing humanand to have caused the feelings of the man so to revolt against the same that he would have dashed the crimson witness of his depraved soul to the bottom of some oblivious pit and have hidden himself from the countenance of nature but it was not so with gruff the influence of the devil was within his brain and he experienced no feeling of humanityno fearhis whole soul was engulphed with his one ideaand he panted to put that into execution near the atlantic shore of the state of south carolina and upon a small island to the south of cape fear a dreadful murder had been perpetrated in the broad sunlight of heaven the victim was a certain captain reefer who resided with his family upon the island his body was found upon the beach that faced the main land and a gun lay near it shattered into fragments the inhabitants of the vicinity were horror stricken and an immediate search was set on foot to discover the murderer the search was ineffectual for no trace of him could be met although the entire island and neighbouring main land were scoured all was wrapped in a silent dark and fearful mystery as soon however as the first excitement which the tragedy caused had in a measure subsided little sympathy was felt for the murdered man in fact he himself had been a shedder of blood and although he lived secure from the law and seemed to revel in great wealth yet he was shunned he had been tried a few years previous to his death in a neighbouring state for piracy and murder on the high seas and only escaped conviction because of a defect in the indictment the evidence against him was conclusive of his guilt yet the indictment afforded a loop hole of escape through which his wily counsel successfully drew him and now this bad mans neighbours thought that he had received a just retribution for his misdeeds and their indignation for his murder became merged in the idea that his fate was only a righteous judgment you may readily guess that the shattered gun was the same that old sam lost in the forest ring that gruff was the murderer of captain reefer and that the blood which the miscreant brought with him was obtained from his victim to be used in his infernal incantationswith it he renewed his efforts to summon the devil into his presence and with success for upon the third night after his return to his hut and whilst engrossed in his diabolical pursuits a fearful storm swept over the city and neighbourhood of baltimore cleaving the over burdened clouds asunder the lightnings leaped through the heavens and around the earth the thunder broke over land and water with such dire confusion as seemed to threaten a chaos of every thing terrestrial whilst the rain and hail in torrents rattled down and the wind sweeping through the woods uprooted split and prostrated the largest forest trees and shrubs and briars and vines were scattered in wild dismay it was a fearful night and in the highth of all the storms violence and when the lightnings flashed keenest when the thunder pealed loudest and the tempest waxed heaviest and amidst a perfect whirlwind of confusion and of noise caused by the splitting and uprooting of trees and rocks and earth and the contention of the elements then high high above the rage and tumult of the storm a wild cry of agony ascended from the deluded man which was heard upon the other shore at that moment repentance came and the affrighted wretch would gladly have relinquished all the hopes which he had so arduously striven to realize and cheerfully have welcomed poverty so that it came without crime but it was too late he had gone too far to retreat he had raised the fiend he was unable to exorcise him and he stood horror stricken in the presence of the devil and his infernal crew the eyes of the prince of evil were riveted upon his own and pierced into his brain as if they had been needles of red hot steel he felt their steadfast gaze dart hissing within him and he shrieked in an agony of despair too dreadful for and beyond description as old sam lay in bed at home he distinctly heard the appalling cries william gruff said the devil as he stept close to the rash mans side and at the same time laying his hands upon graffs arm your rites are answered you have summoned me in due form to appear i am here with my train of subordinates to satisfy your desires we shall serve you for five years faithfully i know your wishes and during that period of time you shall be supplied with gold to your fullest desire and that without again being troubled with our personal presence until the end wheresoever you go our supply of wealth shall follow you take no heed therefore for yourself for your wants shall be anticipated i shall keep my covenant and so shall you keep yours but remembera satanic smile curled the devils lips and his countenance became awfully impressivethat on this night at this very hour five years hence we shall be in waiting for you in the forest ring it will be useless for you to attempt to escape me distance cannot aid you for in whatsoever quarter of the earth you may journey you shall surely meet us then and there so sure as it is that i reign in h from this moment you are mine body and soul so until the end enjoy yourself and your wealth as to your own will shall seem best yet ere we now separate i will place my signet on your brow to mark you as mine own at these words he traced his forefinger transversely across the wretched mans forehead saying till we meet againadieu but forget not this hour five years hence at the touch of the evil finger gruff fell to the earth as though he had been struck by a cannon shot and remained for some time in a swoon when he revived the storm was overthe clouds were dispersed and again the moon clear round and peaceful shone upon the scene all was silent but the evidences of the storms power lay scattered every where around gruff arose and looked about him he was alone aye he was indeed alone and he felt an oppressive solitude that he never before experiencedhe asked himself have i dreamed all this but then as he raised his hand to his brow he felt the mark of satan thereon and the touch stung him as if an adder had bitten into a vital part agony oh despair the iron had entered his soul he fled old sam told the story of his adventure to his neighbours who received it as such stories generally are received some of them said the niggar was crazed some that he had been drunk others believed him in part and a few implicitly for the old negro was highly respected for his truthfulness the latter parties were induced to credit him from the fact that they thought gruffs mysterious disappearance and non return was in some way connected with that dreadful tempest however whether the neighbourhood was willing to believe the old fellows story or not the spot where he had met the evil one became haunted ground in the inhabitants minds and few there were who afterwards visited it even in broad daylight which facts laid the foundation for this legend well i asked what became of gruff patience my friend replied i have not concluded he first went to europe as he could not bear to remain upon the same continent where his fearful connection with the devil began and in the gay capitals of england france germany and italy sought enjoyment from excitement for there was no peace for him in repose his efforts were all fruitless for although supplied to any amount with riches which he spent and squandered as if they were things of no value he was miserableif he attempted to mix in society he was received with coldness and aversion there was about the man an undefinable something that caused men to shrink from him and yet when alone his misery seemed enhanced by his solitude which he now feared more than he had ever before courtedhe strove to have continually near him a number of attendants he dared not sleep in an apartment alone yet his slumbers were so dreadfully disturbed at times by awful dreams that his servants would fly appalled from his bed side he could not retain any one in his service long although he endeavoured to do so by giving enormous wages scarcely an attendant remained with him over the first week he sought for some one to whom he might confide his horrible secret with a hope of finding relief in sympathy it was in vain no human being regarded him with compassion none shew the least feeling of friendship for himhe could not even purchase the semblance of it a thing which is an every day matter of bargain and salehe could not meet with a dog to love him or follow himas other men could do there seemed no sympathy no happiness no rest for himisolated from the countless mass of human beings amongst whom he stalked abroad every day bitterness mingled with every respiration that he drew and agony accompanied each pulsation of his heart his very wealth appeared to mock him for he strove to divest himself of it faintly hoping that could he exhaust the supply he might thereby rescind his awful compact but no it flowed to him from an inexhaustible source he passed from europe into asia he courted danger by sea and by land he was impregnable to the common ills of life he stalked fearlessly through cities that were reeking with the plague breathed the foul and pestilential atmosphere thereof visited the sick attended the dying when all others fled from them in affright and burried the dead when no other man dared to look thereonhoping that the plague might infect him and that he would die before the expiration of his allotted five years and thereby break the devils covenant yet the plague would not touch him he wished for death but did not in all the hardihood of his character dare to turn his own hand against his own lifedeath coming naturally ere the five years should have passed away might give him some hope of safety from his impending doombut death came not to him at times when he sought the excitement of wine the mark upon his brow would become so swollen and so intensely red that it often affrighted the revellers from the table he gambled deeply and ever wonwinning at last lost its charm for it became monotonous and yet he could never lose he endeavoured to stupefy his mind by deep draughts of intoxicating liquors but could not attain a sufficient state of inebriety to obliviate for one moment the one awful thought that haunted his aching brain at length finding all attempts fruitless to obtain that pleasure and security from care which he had thought the possession of wealth would bring his feelings settled into a fixed melancholy he knew that he was doomed and experienced the fact that there was no way of avoiding his fate there yet remainded six months of the allotted five years when he found himself in his wanderings at the cape of good hope in africa for he had striven to keep as far distant as possible from his old home suddenly he experienced an irresistible impulse to return to america and quitted the cape as hastily as if he had been called thence upon important business he embarked for england then crossed to france and into the deepest depths of the dissipations of the cities of london and of paris he descended seeking relief from the gnawing of the worm that preyed within him his cares had so worn upon his nervous system that his former robust frame had wasted until it became a mere skeleton his hair had turned grey his forehead projected heavily over the lower parts of the face and across its numerous furrows that fearful line of sin was ever visible his eyes were lustreless and deeply sunken behind his heavy brow his cheeks were hollow and of a ghastly yellowish hue the nostrils had become frightfully distended his mouth exhibited such a rigid and vain attempt at a smile that was repulsive to look upon whilst his unshaven chin was covered with a long neglected beard altogether an expression of such intense suffering pervaded his whole countenance that no one could look thereon without turning from the man with pity yet could shew him none such was he when he again reached america once and only once during the whole time of his absence from his country had he attempted to enter into a place of worshipand that was when one day whilst strolling through the streets of old rome curiosity led him into saint petersat the moment of his entrance an aged priest was saying mass it mattered little to the man what words were uttered by the reverend prelate for the ceremony being in latin gruff understood no syllable thereof but the truly religious feeling which a contemplation of this stupendous and magnificent evidence of the genius of michael angelo produces upon the mindthe reverential appearance of the aged priest who officiated at the great altarthe sweet voices of the choir commingling with the volume of solemn harmony which flowed from the grand organ together with the general sanctity of the place impressed upon him so strongly a feeling that he was eternally separated from all holy things that he shrieked in the agony of his soul and flednever before nor since was cry so dreadfully discordant and unearthly heard in that place of worshipthe people sprang to their feet appalledthe music of the choir suddenly ceased and the aged priest fell upon the steps of the altar for the moment paralyzed with fear but satan could not triumph there and soon the religious exercises were resumedyet that wild dread shriek was long remembered in rome after his arrival upon the shores of his native land he gradually approached his old home without possessing the power to resist the inclination to avoid it at length his feet once more trod the streets of this beautiful city five years had considerably changed the place the progressive age was on the march and strode rapidly through its streets and lanes and over its commons building in its advance commodious warehouses extensive shops and stately dwellings and extending largely over its suburbs the evidences of the times when gruff witnessed the many changes that had taken place during his absence he entertained a hope that the citys growth had extended over the forest ring but no that still remained untouched unaltered by the hand of time he crossed to the southern shore of the spring gardens and there found his hut going to destruction in truth a superstitious dread had surrounded its locality and few persons ever visited it its door had been broken from its hinges and lay rotting near the frame the tall rank grass and noxious weeds had overgrown its sill and were spreading themselves through the interior of the hut the window panes that had filled a small sash were broken the chimney and fire place were falling to decay and the few articles of rude furniture which the room contained lay scattered and broken about the floor and half buried in the sand and dirt which had been driven into it by the winds and accumulated therein by the neglect of years whilst the hut itself had become a tenement for bats and owls forest vermin and loathsome toads and snakes what a feeling of gloom struck into this bad mans heart as he stepped across the threshold of his old home his entrance disturbed the disgusting occupants thereof and whilst numbers of the winged tribes flew whirling and screaming around his head several slimy reptiles crept hissing past his feetbut scarce heeding such a sickening reception to his own hearth he sat down in the midst of all this desolation deeply absorbed in heavy thoughts the old negro sam jones still resided in his log cabin on the northern shore of the river and five years had whitened the wool that covered his ancient head yet he forgot not the dread occurrences of the fifth preceding year which in the interim had become from his lips an oft told tale however we have now reached nearly the close of this legend for it was the night of the th of september of the year and precisely five years after the night when gruff had had his fearful interview with the fiend the day had been very close and sultry and towards night huge masses of dark angry and threatening clouds piled themselves one upon another until the blackness of annihilation seemed to overhang the world and when the hours of daylight had been counted and were passed the low rumbling of distant thunder was heard as if to give the signal for the impending storm to burst the very domestic brutes by the instinct of their natures sought not only shelter but companionship with man the fisherman had been all day at his miserable hut deeply darkly sunk in melancholy and apparently heedless of the surrounding incidents about eleven of the clock p m the gathered storm broke and raged in fury over the scene it was just such a tempest as five years before had passed over the place the old negro lay in his bed unable to close his eyes in sleep the atmosphere was very oppressive and he became restless and arose opened his solitary window and stood looking out upon the storm the usually placid sheet of water before him was agitated into a swelling sea lightnings skipped from wave to wave momentarily illuminating all around by one very sharp flash he saw tossing over the troubled waters a small boat in which a man hatless and coatless stood erect and with his hair wildly streaming in the wind at each lurch of the frail bark it seemed as if it would be engulphed beneath the foaming waves yet onward onward it came in the very face of the wind and tide in another instant the boats keel grated harshly upon the beach and the voyager sprang ashore passing within a few rods of the old negros dwelling or on he sped towards the circle in the woods and in horror sam recognised him to be surly bill the fisherman onward onward and onward continued gruff until he reached the forest ringhere the evil one and his satellites were seated round the old black oak stump awaiting the arrival rival of the victim who without staying his course for an instant sprang into the midst of the horrid crew at that moment the storm swept over the vicinity with increased violence the air was filled with rended trees and branches with sand and splintered rocks and earth and water the lightnings seemed to wrap the world in flames and the thunder to shake her firm foundationthen then at that fearful moment william gruff was clasped in the devils arms and the unearthly shriek which burst from the lips of the doomed man broke frightfully upon the negros earhe ran to the door of his hut and looking towards the north west was nearly blinded by the keenness of the lightning it seemed to rend the woods assunder for the border of trees which enclosed the distant circle appeared to open for a second and he saw therein the whole troop of devils and the fisherman in their midst dancing with infernal glee on the next morning curiosity led some of the neighbours to whom sam had related the above incidents to visit the place there they found the dead body of william gruff burned and charred almost to a cinder laying beside the decaying stump whilst a circle of scorched and withered grass surrounded the spot which from that hour became known as the devils eace course castine by edward edgeville southern field and fireside novellette no  new series raleigh wm b smith  co  entered according to act of congress in

place of skullsa bed of dead mens bleaching bonesa rock whereon many a ship of human life has been wreckedthe gulf that has swallowed up hopes as bright as my own fond dreams were five years ago i wonder how these men looked when these skulls were animate with thought and speech and sight savage must be the hand that has torn them from their rude resting places and mounted them upon these dead stumpsdead as the human trunks which bore them in all the vigor and pride of manhood once but the cruel foe has been hereand here is no deed too vile for his doing the foe is it not strange that men immortal civilized refined should be not only the worst foes to themselves but the worst foes to their brothers yet what comes of this philosophymy own heart is as bitter as gaulmy whole being is absorbed by the worst of demoniac desires revenge for five long and painfully fruitless years i have hunted him through cities over railroads lakes seas oceans countries islands continents everywhere i have tracked but no where found him i know his rank i know his regiment and while i watch at this ghostly post tonight with yonder serene and silvery moon shining brightly down upon these armiesliving and deadthat lie asleep around me there is a something that whispers to my burning soul tomorrowtomorrow and thy sisters wrong shall be avenged ah lester lester let the mornings lurid dawn find thee not asleep but let its balmy zephyrs well laden waft thy earnest prayers to heaven for the destiny of thy wicked soul is near at hand jennie my dear sweet angel sister the villainous brute that sent thee mercilessly to thy untimely grave shall soon lie as low stark and cold as thee captain waterfield in his capacity of aiddecamp had spent a busy night after a long and tiresome march on the th of july  the brigade to which he was attached had reached the old battle ground of manassas the weary armies in position for the morrows deathwork were sleeping as soundly as if no raven drooped its shadowy pall above them here and there a guardian picket watched the twinkling of the stars and listened for the cracking of the brush near him or the lumber of the enemys artillery taking position in the distance it was about three oclock in the morning when capt waterfield dismounted and threw himself upon the ground to snatch a few minutes sleep thoughts of the coming day and its probable events crowded upon his mind so thick and fast however that slumber was driven from him he lay thinking and listening footsteps yes he heard footsteps near him some one probably of his brigade was availing himself of the bright moonlight to look after some well remembered locality in which he had been one year before the footsteps ceasedthe soldier paused and capt waterfield lay still and listened at the soliloquy given above as the speaker ceased capt w rose and approached him and to his surprise found sergeant walter larksly leaning meditatively upon his musket in the midst of the golgotha he had heard him describe in his soliloquy walter larksly was a youth of about nineteen summers delicate in frame and effeminate in features with a head of full long fine cold black hair and large black talking eyes notwithstanding that shakespeare reckoned not upon an effeminate man in time of action sergeant walter as he was familiarly called by his comrades and officers had proven upon more occasions than one that he was brave as well as handsome gallant as well as neat and tidy in his dress he came to the regiment a recruit hailing from tennessee soon after the regiment had taken the field in the outbreak of the war his good conduct under fire in camp on the march and upon all occasions coupled with his exceedingly modest and unassuming deportment soon secured for him the esteem and confidence of all who knew him as well as the tender of various promotions of the latter he persistently refused anything higher than a sergeantcy he said he would not accept any position which would take him from the ranks and his musket sergeant walter was a favorite of capt waterfields the captain approached walter saying kindly i beg pardon sergeant for intruding which i would not have done had you not so greatly excited my curiosity by that strange soliloquy which you spoke so loud that i could not help hearing it as i lay just in the bushes there trying to sleep i thought captain replied walter that these dead mens heads were my only companions i fear that this horrid association has made me think and talk wildly and rudely o not rudely walter but i must confess your language did sound wild to me but come walter my dear boy to tell you the truth i believe that i have unwittingly read a page of your hearthistory that is not known to many fear not it shall be sacredi shall never repeat it you are a good man captain you are very kind to me but walter will you pardon me if i ask who was jennie that you spoke of jennie is the sweetest of all names to me many years with many a blighting storm have swept over my lifebark yet there is one memory always fresh and dear and i call that memory jennie ah captain you will run me mad do net talk to me of jennie the name may be sweet to youbut it is both nectar and wormwood to me why walter is it possible that one so young should feel so much sit down upon this log captain listen and i will tell you of my jennie she was my dear sweet sister we were orphans she was to me both a sister and a mother we lived with an uncle in tennessee we were poor sister jennie and i she was a good patient affectionate girl i was wild restless unsatisfied in my nature yet we were not unhappy a tall handsome man with light hair and blue eyes very much like yours captain came and loved and wooed jennie they were to be married another camea lord of wealth and fashion with black glossy hair and sparkling black eyes he wooed fondly and earnestlytalked of his elegant establishment in a neighboring village his fine horses and splendid drives but jennie declined his offer he would not hear her refusal and persisted in his attentions to the mutual annoyance of jennie and her betrothed he came one evening and took her riding and alas poor jennie never returned scandalmongers glutted the market with a tale of love and wrong but jennie was dead in a moment of desperate frenzy the wretch had taken her life because he could not win her love from its sacred pledge to another he concealed her body by a hasty burial in the dense forest and fled the country all the ardor of my youthful soul all the strength of my boyish frame all the recklessness of my desperate spirit all the fire of my ardent affection for my sister all the unshaped destinies of my opening life concentrated in that one word revenge i was but a boy fourteen years of age but i paused not i crowded my scanty wardrobe in a carpet bag and while my uncle and aunt lay asleep at night i bid the kind home they had given me farewell i left it with the terrible oath upon my lips that i would never return to it that i would never tire or cease in my purpose until the villian should pay with interest into my hands for the life he had taken if home is not home without a mother what was my home to mei had neither mother sister brother or father i felt that i could lie down in the beds with the wild beasts of the forest and find them as warm and comfortable as the cold charities of the world on that dark and dreary night five years ago i started on my search after my sisters murderer and from that hour to this i have hunted him with a hot trail and tonight captain something of an inexplicable intuition or the guardian spirit of jennie tells me that tomorrow i shall catch the gametomorrow this suffocating load that i have carried within my heart so long shall be lightened who walter who are you asked captain waterfield trembling with emotion and greatly agitated nervously grasping walters arm and jerking him suddenly around so that he could look square into his boyish face he looked at him scrutinizingly and wonderingly for a minute or more in dead silence loosening his hold he continued there is a mystery here boy a strange link in the chain of human affairs that i must learn more of this tale of yours seems but an echo from the murmur of the memorybillows that beat and roll with a ceaseless and pitiless fury upon the barren rock within my own bosom i must compare the sounds again but not now it is day and therethe enemy has opened upon our left goodbye walter i must to my duties goodbye captainand i to my revenge chapter ii capt waterfield mounted his horse and dashed up to his brigade head quarters and joined his general the brigade was soon formed and ordered forward sergeant walter having been duly relieved and ordered in moved with his command towards the flashing of the guns the brigade moved up handsomely within musket range of the enemy and delivered a withering opening volley then commenced on that part of the line a terrible and unremitting rattle of musketry and thunder of artillery that made the rocky hillsides shake and the treetops tremble with the music in the air suddenly and unexpectedly the enemy opened a heavy battery from a knoll upon the right flank quick it seemed almost as thought the brigade changed front and with a shout and a yell rushed like a torrent of fury up to the guns of the enemy who received it with a perfect sheet of flame and death it seemed impossible to advanceit would have been certain destruction to retreat the brigade waveredits gallant commander had fallen wounded with a soul full of fearless heroism and daring patriotism sergeant walter rushed forward with a forlorn hopehis company then his regiment and then his brigade followed and the enemys line was carried and the battery captured together with the most of its supports of two brigades ah cried sergeant walter clubbing his musket as he bounded over the works and rushed upon a tall dark complected yankee captain you are my manmy hour has come at lasthenceforth light lie the cloud on mirkland lawn and heavy lie thy sins upon thy guilty soul i beg for mercy sir said the yankee captain dropping humbly upon his knees i am a soldier under the united states flagand entitled to be treated as a prisoner of warand know nothing of mirkland lawn you dieyou base cowardly wretch you know nothing of mirkland lawn  you have forgotten jennie bates  whom you murdered because she would not marry youyou have forgotten castine  you have forgotten the happy home that you made miserablebut i

she at   street new york city she is my wife you villian hold cried a voice near by as a strong hand grasped castines arm and stayed the knife that trembled with eagerness to sink into lesters breast captain waterfield had been standing near and overheard the conversation that revealed sergeant walters character and sex and he had thus interposed a timely interference to save castines excited hands from the crime of murder placing himself in front of castine he continued is it possible sergeant waltercastinethe sister of jenniecastine the brighteyed happy girl that i knew five years ago at mirkland lawn and are you captain said castine the same william waterfield that gave me that beautiful little ring with clasped hands upon it the same and there said castine extending her hand palm down is the same ring you will find engraved inside as when you gave it me the name castine but let us take care of our prisoner said capt w most of the prisoners are already on their way to the rear and our brigade has advanced and left us a guard was hunted up to take lester and start with him to join his companions already en route for the libby they had hardly gotten out of sight and captain waterfield and castine the latter of necessity still retaining her character as sergeant walter had but started towards the front when a brigade of the enemy emerged from a woods near by and in spite of their efforts to escape both were taken prisoners chapter iii sergeant walter for as such we must know castine yet awhile and captain waterfield in due course of time after a weary march arrived at a receiving prison in washington city the day was just breaking as they reached the city they were accompanied by about two hundred other prisoners and a heavy guard arriving at a large old brick stuckoed building a pause of half an hour or more was made in the street near the doorway which time was spent by the prisoners in the most comfortable positions they could place themselves upon door steps curbstones and sidewalk sergeant walter and captain waterfield rarely separated for now captain waterfield felt that the great task before him was to manage the escape of walter so that the real and true character of castine could be at once resumed but a womans wit rarely fails her in an emergency where sagacity or quick consummation of plans will assist or relieve her and while waiting near the prison door walter tell into a whispered conversation with an irishman belonging to the same company as walter patrick oconner true to his native instincts was a personification of loyalty to his causeand an ever ready and trusty soldier and withal had traveled and read considerable and was quite intelligent walter felt that oconner could be trusted so he said to him familiarly patrick do you want any money yees sir and aint ye talkin right now but hear me patrick through a friend i sold just previous to joining our regiment a little tract of land a portion of that left me by my uncle in tennessee from the amount realized i have drawn as i have needed when we were captured yesterday i had upon my person  in goldan amount that i always carry in order to meet any probable emergency that

heroismhave you thought that your whole scheme turns upon one very uncertain chance i have measured the distance captain and i will make the march for your own sake i pray you may succeed while this conversation continued between walter and captain w patrick was not idle the new guard was put on and he scanned each one of their faces closely finally he selected a man who looked like he might have been in days when yankee drafts were unknown a new york auctioneer of the peter funk order he approached him and said me friend and ye look like ye might be me friend how are ye off for greenbacks weell i cant say that im flush with just sich men as yourself to stand guard over me it strikes me im to remain here a long time and i guess youre about right replied yankee hince i must have some clothes a pipe or two and one swate glass of whiskey kape your eye upon me as we inter that deer and upon the next relafe you come to me and fifty dollars shall be your own upon the spot do you mean it do i mane it and what in the divil do you think im talkin for very well ill come and just here the door of the building was opened and the crowd of prisoners commenced moving in pats quick eye caught the sight of a large hogshead in the broad old hall that had been used for a coal deposit and turning to the yankee sentinel he had selected for his work who followed near at hand in order to kape an eye upon him as per agreement he said mate me at the big black barrel o k said yankee with the money fever getting higher upon him the prisoners were allowed free access through the rooms upon whatever floor they were assigned pat lingered near the big barrel at the appointed time the yankee came having passed the guard with a forged permit from the commandant of the prison which directed that the bearer special messenger c be admitted to the prison for specified purposes pat met him at the hogshead and said into the big barrel with ye or bad luck be upon ye hold on said yankee you are too rankbe careful let us lean upon it a minute then sit upon it and then slip in me faith on your cunning said pat as he threw himself lazily against the hogshead the yankees suggestion was observed and in a few minutes they were both head and ears out of sight in the hogshead now said patrick as they both squeezed themselves down into the bottom of the hogshead there is no time to be wasted so whatll ye take for the dirty slip of paper that brought ye in here but replied yankee how am i to get out again and never ye mind about thati will return it to ye by three oclock this afternoon what surety have i that you will return at all the best surety in the world by me faithgold here is twentyfive dollars and but interrupted yankee that will not do well i will leave fifty dollars with yeforty of which you will return to me own hands when i replace your pass at three oclock say two and a half oclock as i must go on guard again at three good the bargains made provided you will now exchange outer garments with me so that i can go and come without having your own oath of allegiance poked at me around all the strate corners yankee accepted the proposition in full and soon they emerged from the coal hogshead dusty and dark with the powdered coal patrick presented his pass and his bluely arrayed person to the sentinel at the doorway and was allowed a ready egress yankee played substitute with a bridled tongue patrick oconner made a hasty and tasteful use of barber and clothier and in an hour his own mother to use his words would not have known patrick oconner taking a hack with two large new boxes each of which were marked provisionsperishable he drove back to the prison in the meantime he had effected a new bribe in the highways of washington sufficient to have secured permits properly and genuinely signed and approved for himself sister and brother to travel anywhere within the limits of the united states and with a special permit for each separately to visit the old capital military tary prison with the privilege of taking two boxes of provisions to friends thus armed and equipped patrick presented the special permit for himself and provisions to the sentinel at the prison door and was permitted to enter amid the handsomest military courtesies these boxes were conveyed to sergeant walter and captain waterfield each containing outfits as walter had directed and one of them contained the yankees uniform also of which patrick had divested himself at the clothiers where he had bedecked himself in all the latest new york and parisian fashions the boxes were unpacked in a small room in the presence of captain waterfield and walterpatrick took the yankee his uniform to the hogshead he found the yankee in waiting and though yankee did not recognize patrick in consequence of the change from a ragged rebel to a fashionably shaved and dressed gentleman patrick insisted upon the redemption of his money with the little old crumpled paper which he had obtained from the yankee as a pass the business was at last ended with the yankee and he was allowed to repass and resume his duties as a guard as patrick entered the room of sergeant walter and captain waterfield their surprise need hardly be told at beholding a pennsylvania avenue dandy made out of patrick oconner after being repeatedly assured by patrick that he was pathrick oconner himself castine said why patrick you did not do as i told you did i not request you to bribe a yankee to make these purchases and and do you think replied patrick that he could have made more ilegant selections or that i was going to miss a chance where i might be afther putting myself outthe divil trust a yankee and argued walter we are all now in danger of our necks because you did not make the one you engaged an active partner in our enterprisehis interest was merely passive and now he will betray us all betray us cried patrick and wouldnt i like to see him do it be ye not unasyive saled his mouth but i am uneasywe are certainly in danger i will be responsible sargant fix yerself like a lady while i go and keep an eye upon the manuvres of the sintinel who traded clothes with me and then you must advance at my signal in about half an hour capt waterfield was arrayed as a reliable gentleman from washington city and presented in fact a graceful and dignified figure and in an elegant suit of black looked like anything else than a rebel prisoner it was well for him that men are so easily deceived by the external appearance of their fellow men in sergt walter the change effected by a careful toilet and from male to female attire was so great and so perfect that even capt waterfield who alone was in her secret would not have recognized her had he met her abroad in the worldupon the streets of the city her long black hair was tastefully dressed down beside her forehead and ears much or nearly all of the smoke of battle and the bronze of wind and sunshine had disappeared from her smooth face beneath some magical charm her small hands looked well in a neat glove and when the bonnet and scarf were on sergt walter became sergt walter no longer but castine in appearance as well as in spirit and in fact patrick or rather mr oconner it was now mr waterfield and miss castine bates convened boldly in the open hall and held a council of war patrick assured them that he had well arranged everything for their escape in proof of which he produced written ten evidence in the form of the passports he had secured from the war department he presented the one for castine to her the one for waterfield to him all of which were of course made for assumed names but which is best should not be made public as patrick had succeeded well in his labors so far he was deputed as spokesman for the great ordeal which lay now near before them in attempting to complete their escape taking waterfields arm castine pulled her veil over her face and accompanied by patrick they advanced boldly to the sentinel at the door the sentinel was quite ready to permit patrick to pass out but he said he did not recollect that he had admitted the lady and other gentleman a cold shudder passed over castine as she leaned upon the arm of capt waterfield she apprehended that the yankee employed and already paid had betrayed themrather had told all that he knew although he did in fact know nothing of their designs for patrick had outwitted him so handsomely that for once a shrewd yankee had been thoroughly hoodwinked yet castine almost trembled for fear he had caught an insight into their plans the sentinel paused and reflected stammered and hesitated but at last after a careful and minute examination of the passes of official authority which they presented he begged pardon for detaining them guessed with patrick that they were admitted to the building before he went on post and allowed them to pass outout into the streetout to go wherever they wished in the limits of the united states chapter iv as the party passed down the street castine could not refrain from saying in a low tone oh captain what unspeakable pleasure there is in breathing the fresh air of heaven when we compare it to the impure atmosphere upon which we seemed destined to live for some months to come in the pent up walls of a prison thank god we are freefree as we can be in this despotic country and now we must loose no timeor at least imust proceed to new york without delay and i will know before i rest what truth there is in that villian lesters statement when he told me that jenniemy loved and longlost sisterstill lives and atthere i have forgotten the number but i have not replied capt w and i will pull the bell at   street new york within fortyeight hours but alas castine there is something that whispers to my heart that she is in factin lawif not in lovehis wife she is lost to mei hope that you may yet be happy with her time has not lightened but has pressed down and shaken together the measure of sorrow that her mysterious fate meted out to me the world castine looks on at the myriad of heart malestorms around them and like a child in a dream smiles at the vapory mist of desolation as it rolls its weeping shadows to the skies true true captain but let us pursue with unfaltering steps the line of destiny that outstretches itself before us be its windings and course ever so vague or uncertain certain until jennie has been found or her fate avenged there is but one plain chart of action for me nothing shall daunt or sway me in my purpose then castine when the secret is unveiledwhen the truth shall be knownwe must let it be it good or bad make no deeper the wound within our heartswe have suffered let us be strong capt waterfield turned to patrick and said patrick will you go with us to new york or will you proceed at once to return to dixie and by me faith captain i would be plased to be with me comrades but it is not patrick oconner that is going to desert ye in an inemys counthry i will go with ye and our sargant lady accordingly the party hastened to new york they arrived there at seven in the evening and took quarters at the st nicholas hotel being greatly fatigued by their dusty and exceedingly uncomfortable travel castine bade capt w and patrick good night soon after supper and retired capt w and patrick walked down in front of the hotel where they continued in conversation until they had consumed two good havana cigars apiece when they also retired entering their chamber and carefully locking the door they whispered over an outline of their plans for the morrow bouyed buoyed by hope or stung by something akin to despairas the hidden flame of a long long lost love flickered in its heartsocketcapt waterfield could not sleep patrick said he was afraid the walls might have ears and preferred to spend the night in sleeping rather than in talking one more request patrick said capt w and i will not interrupt your drowsiness again i feel patrick as if i were this moment standing upon the very verge of my doom with you i have faced death a thousand times but never has my spirit shrunk back from the task of duty however bloody it has been like it shrinks back now from an unknown something that lies before mea terrible something i know not what with which i must meet and earnestly contend with the utmost might of both body and soul i feel it i know itit is comingand therefore i request that you will remain constantly with me it may be deathand the monster makes cowards of us allbut if it should be promise me that you will be a brother to our sergeant whom we call castine until you are both back among the noble people of the south and ififyou should find jennie the sister of castine tell her that i have been true to her tell her how much i have loved her silently but true for five long years tell her even if it be in the presence of her husband lester how my memory has painted and repainted a myriad of times the outlines of her beautiful form the round plumb arms that tapered down to the sweetest hand that ever electrified man by a touch of his brawny fingers the soft fond eyes that always seemed to swim in a riffleless sea of heavenly love the lips that would fret the richest rubies fresh from their ocean cradles into envy those velvety cheeks whose flush through ivorytinted skin would shame to death the first reddamasked rose of springtime even while it blushed forth its softest hues through the sparkle of the morning dew from a lilaceous bed tell her that my desolate life has been but an outrage of the purpose of heaven when it created our souls for each otherthough the law has given her to another god has given her to mei am hersshe is mine there is in spite of us a divinity that creates reveals and blends the congeniality of souls into a resistless fellowship which begins wherever and whenever the two beings meet and endsnever listen listen captain said patrick interrupting and do ye hear thatthe bellsthe firecastineand by the holy virgin we shall ba burnt to dith before we can say a snatch of a prayer and out sprang patrick and capt waterfield into the floor looking out at their front window they saw the fire a little distance up town castine had also been aroused by the bells and never having seen a fire in a city the leaping and shooting up of the huge flames excited her so that she was soon dressed and she sent a servant to the room of capt w and patrick to know if they were going to the fire and asking if there would be any impropriety in her going capt waterfield and patrick were just ready and met her at her door and with hurried steps they all started to the fire the fire was in a large magnificent block of brick and granite residencesthe mansions probably of merchant princes it was early in the nightnot more than ten oclock our triocapt waterfield castine and patrickwended their way eagerly through crowds of peopleladies and gentlementhat elbowed and jostled each other as they drifted on with the current of excitement the little boys dodged hither and thither hallowing fire fire to the utmost capacity of their vocal powers while the brazen bells changled and jangled out of tune in a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire yet these stirring scenes did not remove from the minds of castine and capt waterfield their thought of jennie and the morrow turning a corner which brought them near and upon the same street with the merciless element that roared and crackled and lapped its luried tongue high in the heavens capt w enquired of a stranger the name of the street and was politely informed the same street said jennie to the captain that lester said jennie lives upon oh suppose this fire should be near her home i trust not replied the captain but it is possiblelet us hasten to the scene and i will make enquiries about the occupants of the neighboring buildings they were soon at the place and turning to a gentleman at his side capt waterfield asked who lives in that fine stone building adjoining the north side of the one on fire mr richardson was the reply who in the one on the south side mr ansell pardon my inquisitiveness said the captain but be pleased to answer me what i should have asked firstwho are the unfortunate occupants of the building now on fire captain lesters family my god said castine aloud almost turning capt waterfield around as she gave his arm a quick excited jerk it is jenniesjennies home captain richard lester inquired capt w again turning to his polite informant yes i believe that is his name castine could not refrain from promptly asking in anxious tones that betrayed great feeling have the family made their escape from the building i am told that they have notin fact there goes a ladder to one of the third story windows now the stairway has been on fire several minutes and the lives of the inmates are now dependent upon the prompt efforts of those brave firemen take care of castine patrick said capt waterfield as he rushed through the crowd to the foot of the ladder the fire had began to break through several windows of the second story of the building and the hope of saving the wife that was said to be within the building grew weak approaching the firemen who were holding a momentary consultation at the foot of the ladder capt waterfield said is there not a greater chance of saving the life of that poor woman than there is of loosing the life of him who attempts the rescue it is exceedingly doubtful replied a voice from the group if you will hold the ladder i will risk the attempt said capt w as he sprang upon the lower rounds it shall be safe at the bottom but the danger is that the fire from the windows of the second story may burn it in two before you can find the woman and descend but if you will go be quick and up he went while about midway the ladder the fire from a window near by leaped out and enveloped the daring man in its hissing flamefor a moment he was lost to view and the hearts of thousands who gazed anxiously on stood still with a horrible dread but he moved upwardsthe fire did not seem to weaken his strength or slacken his efforts and in a minute more he disappeared from view through a window of the building he had entered what seemed to have been once designed as a nursery but everything in it seemed so neat and trim and occupying its proper place that he concluded it was never occupied and that it was not there he should find the object of his search and hurried to open a door through the partition on his right and passed into a camber the bed was smooth and whitein the centre of the room stood a centre table upon it lay an open biblebeside the stand stood a lounge and upon this lounge lay a woman as still and pale as death these things and this situation were observed by capt waterfield as the flitful glare of the bounding fire fell upon them there was no time to be lostthe floor upon which he stood was already hot and in a few minutes more the fire would certainly break through yet he paused bent low over the pallid face and closed eyes of the being who reclined upon the loungedanger life death everything were for a momentan instantforgotten by capt w as he peered down into the faceit might be the cold clayof his long loved and lost jennie probably he could not have recognized the features but she had around her neck the little chain fastened with the same little heart clasp that he had placed there six years before he perceived that her heart still beat and raising her quickly yet tenderly in his arms he rushed out of the chamber into the nursery and to the window through which he had entered taking jennie around her waist he eased her down upon his hip supported her helpless fainting frame entirely with his right arm leaving his left hand with which to hold to the ladder as he descended he placed himself in the window with one foot upon the ladderthe thrilling pangs of joy and dread doubt and hope that darted in lightning shocks through the earnest determined heart of castine as her eyes fell upon the two beloved objects at the window with the fire roaring and cracking beneath them and around them the world will never know and could not half realize or appreciate were it told there are sensations of the human heart that can by no human means ever be revealed to mens common understanding they may be electrically transferred from heart to heart but they die come forth still born whenever we undertake to bring them into this vulgar world such were the spirit phantoms that held riot in castines bosom as she gazed up at capt waterfield and the form of her sister whom she had mourned as dead and it was the same electrical feelings that thrilled all hearts of the vast crowd of spectators and rent the air with a loud spontaneous shout capt waterfield knew his danger and appreciated his responsibility he apprehended that the ladder had been charred and weakened by the fire that so repeatedly enveloped it he tried it with his footbore down cautiously and shook it and with a terrible crash it parted in twain and fell upon the pavement great god have mercy and help them exclaimed a thousand voices but castines dauntless nature rose with the tide of danger as it swelled higher and higher around her and she said leave me patrick and run for your life and hurry them up with that other ladder a little time only elapsedbut the terrible suspense made it seem like a yearand another ladder was put in position at capt waterfields feet grasping his charge stronger he leaped upon the ladder and down through the flames that seemed wild with their thirst for blood he descended to the ground and laid poor fainting jennie into the arms of castine restoratives were applied and jennie was sufficiently revived for her friends to know that she still lived but not enough to arouse her from the painful stupor into which the consuming fever of excitement had thrown her she was unconscious of surrounding circumstances and took no notice or recognition of her friends a carriage was obtained and she was taken accompanied by castine capt waterfield and patrick to castines room at the st nicholas hotel chapter v in accordance with the directions of a physician who had been called to jennie she was placed quietly and tenderly in bed in castines chamber she lived and was awake but her eyes shone with an unnatural glareshe stared wildly at everything and at nothingknew everybody and yet recognized no one aright she required quietude and rest fortunately she soon fell to sleep alas the rose had faded from her cheeks her lips were thin and pale and her sunken eyes looked much like they had been the fountain of many bitter tears the bright sunshine of life had fled and given place to the wanworn spirit of unrest her sharpened features told a truthful tale of her heartsorrow and yet she was beautifula halo of unearthly sweetness rested upon her countenance castine capt waterfield and patrick watched anxiously by her side while she slept it was a lifegiving refreshing sleep about three in the morning she awoke opening her heavenly eyes she asked where am i castine leaned over and imprinted a kiss upon her brow and said among friends my dear sister sister cried jennie who calls me sister am i dead and in heaven at last where are my long lost loved onesmy childmy sister castine andandbut i have not called his name in so long a time i fear to call it even herewilliam william and castine are with you jennieyour child i suppose is in heaven you are still upon earth castine william here with me said jennie great god how i thank theemy prayers are answeredtake me now to thyself and my child thus they met it would be mockery for pen or tongue to attempt to describe the meeting of these three people that here took placeit was a scene in which only souls filled the casteand humanity is dumb ten days more and the whole partycastine jennie capt waterfield and patrickleft new york and started on a perilous trip to the south without following them through philadelphia baltimore over the potomac and elsewhere suffice it they reached richmond in seven days after leaving new york taking temporary quarters at the spotswood hotel upon their arrival it was but a proper courtesy from capt w to offer to accompany jennie the next day to the libby prison where her husband capt lester was probably confined and it was an offer that could not be declined although capt waterfield and jennie had now been almost constantly in each others company for seventeen days not a word of love or allusion to past lifeexcept a broken sentence or two that were uttered under the wild impulse of their first recognitionhad passed between them it was evening they were alone in the parlor patrick had gone to the theatre castine had retired early must the heart never speak was it wrong let us see jennie said capt waterfield let me call you by that dear old name it must have utterance or it will kill me could my heart unfold itself to you with the same unrestrained freedom that the rose unfolds itself to the balmy air of spring time and sunshine of summer you would then learn and appreciate how much more than impossible it is for my feeble tongue to speak what my burning spirit feelshow weak would be the strongest terms of which our language will admit in attempting to paint even the most vague outline of the picture of loveimpassioned devotionupon which i have dweltupon which i have lived from year to year from day to day and from hour to hour since last i saw youhow my spirit has truly and constantly yearned to commune with your warm lifegiving soulhow my whole being has reached forth over space and time and supervening obstacles to blend itself with yourshow i have wished for you while awake and sighed to pillow my thoughtweary brow upon your breasthow i have dreamed of you while asleep and in visions of rapturous joy folded you body and soul close to my idolizing hearthow my will has said to my heart love this being less and how my heart has as often impulsively and defiantly replied i will love hergod has framed my existence of love and created this beautiful being for me to lovei will love her even if in the ardor of that love i consume and make desolate all my gilded pleasures beside this is real pleasuremy soul leaps and bounds with youthful vigor in its enjoyment and would freeze into deathly dotage without itand i will love her but our hearts interrupted jennie must be kept under strict guard and subjugated perhaps my heart would say go onit is sweet to listen at this tale of love that brings back the happy evenings and long shady walks and arbors of mirkland lawn but fate saysand i am its obedient servantnot now perhaps never this side of heavenmy ears must be deafyour lips should be dumb your will shall be my pleasure my dear friend forgive my impulsive heartit shall sin no more let us talk no more of this subject captainlet us talk less and pray more goodnight and she was gone capt waterfield soliloquized are all the flowers of my soul even the feeble bloom of feelings ings told whose death i know comes with the first breeze that kisses its opening petals to be nipped in the budwell well i will suffer and be strong chapter vi the morrow came and after a pleasant breakfast at nine the whole party set out for the libby it was reached and admission gained patrick went forward and enquired as directed for capt lester finding the man who answered to that name he informed him that visitors desired to see him who are they enquired the prisoner yer wife her sister patrick had before leaving new york been made acquainted with castines true history and character and captn waterfield captain waterfield said capt lester with emphasis yees sir said patrick capt william waterfield yees sir wait a moment and capt l reached down into a little box that was concealed under his pillow and took therefrom something which he conveyed to his breast pocket so quickly that patrick could not see what it was new tell them that i will see them said the prisoner as a furious scowl seemed to pass over his face patrick returned and informed them accordingly they approached the meeting between mrs lester and her husband was painfully cold and formal waterfield and castine and patrick were introduced he cast a vulturous eye at waterfield and gazed at castine with a quizzical look which seemed to ask are you the little devil that would have killed instead of captured me waterfield and patrick wandered off as though they wished to examine the prison quarters but in fact that they might not overhear any private conversation that might pass between the prisoner and his wife castine remained near her sister many things were briefly spoken of jennie related the destruction of their house by fire and alluded to her own narrow escape who was the heroic knight that saved you inquired lester capt waterfield she replied william waterfield said he bitterly the same what business had he at my house at that hour of night he demanded furiously i knew not that he was in this worldmuch less in new yorkuntil after the firei did not know who rescued me from the flames and should never have known had i not been told afterwards your rude insinuation is unkind mr lester said she bursting into tears then that is kind said he suddenly striking a powerful blow at her heart with a huge knife the blood streamed and she fell fainting or dead to the ground castine was not unprepared the little dagger that she had worn so long about her person over weary marches and in prison had not been forgotten and she had seen blood beforeshe was not dashed by its sight quick as thought she drew the burnished weapon from its hiding place and with a well aimed blow as he expected it not she dipped its point in the mean hot blood of capt lesters heart saying and that is kinder stilli bless the world with one villian less lester fell without a groan dead at her feet seeing the prisoners running towards the place capt waterfield and patrick hastily returned the two bodies lay upon the groundjennie was not dead she was conveyed back to the hotela surgeon was called and her wound though a frightful gash in her left breast was pronounced not dangerous castine accompanied by patrick and an officer of the guard the latter of whom had observed all that had transpired was immediately taken before an officer of the law here she was detained but a few minutes was released from custody and complimented by all tongues for the heroism she had displayed and the quick vengeance she had visited upon the fiend lester the wheel of time rolls on and one year more has dropped over into the wasteocean of the past patrick has long since rejoined his command and is doing noble duty for his counthry the wound in jennies breast has gotten wellthe one in her heart has healed and she is at last the bright happy bride of william waterfield the grand old trees of mirkland lawn are gonethe old mansion has been removedthe place has passed into strange hands but one mile east of it and adjoining the same plantation lies a little farm upon which stands a cozy cottage embowered amid elms and ivey it is the place that was given castine by her uncleits gardens and walks and shades have been laid out like the old homeplace and its happy inmates are capt waterfield and his pensively sweet bride and castine the maid of mirkland a prophetic abstract from the proceedings of the trojan society for the retardation of science for the year of our lord  troan soci ety for the    year of our lord eiortid by l emmons under p teispectuftjfo tebia to the american ssociati for the avai   troy n y wm  young  blake  and  fir              a prophetic abstract of the proceedings of the trojan society for the retardation of science the annual meeting of the society having been promptly called to order by the president at half an hour after the time appointed the exercises were commenced with a prayer b the rev mr longwynd whose remarks occupied most of the forenoon at last his exhortations were cut short by a rumor of dinner and the assemblage adjourned temporarily upon coming together again the society notably increased in weight since the morning went through the usual preliminaries of organization and closed the day by listening to an address from the retiring president and another from the new incum bent to the same office the latter address was especially edifying for it treated of all branches of science known to the reporter and many which were unknown to him and it gave the audience generally much astounding information mainly to the effect that they had gathered together for the love of knowledge which he the speaker was ready and willin to impart the following day the society divided into sections dev ted to the reading of various scientific papers and the discussonl of various scientific topics some of these papers the repoter has given in full others which would not be understood by most people although perfectly clear to the aforesaid reporter he has merely given in abstract or mentioned briefly by title in section a the first paper read was        new information about alaska  by a particuarr friend of mr dall i have been asked to state abstractedly my opinions about alaska therefore i will give you some which are wholly b      new having been made expressly for this occasion they are based chiefly upon what i didnt see and modified slightly by what i saw and will be found trustworthy by those who regard them as reliable i propose speaking of the climate which already exists of the natives who try to exist of the vege tation which ought to exist and of the fisheries fur trade and mines which are expected to exist in our newly acquired territory at some future time upon the first head the climate experience compels me to speak with enthusiasm it is remarkably even in character though somewhat dependent in its minor features upon the temperature the winds and the clouds the heat is rarely excessive never reaching the maximum temperatures of the tropics and consequently cannot be looked upon as debili tating alaska will make a fine summer resort in the winter the ice crop is a little more reliable than it is in new jersey and may be depended upon in future as a great source of profit being a spontaneous growth it is doubtful whether the ice of alaska would need or repay cultivation i am aware that the prevalent idea is that the new territory is a cold country but during my stay there i never knew the thermometer to fall so low as to compel the natives to dress in frieze in fact they clothe themselves chiefly in dirt and rarely change their costume this dress being put on in early childhood is re markably convenient growing naturally with the skin so that when the wearer dies he carries his grave all ready made with him this is true economy and renders burial unnecessary funerals are cheap in alaska this habit of preparing for death proves the descent of these indians from the chinese who as is well known devote their early savings to the pur chase of coffins the alaskans merely carry the same principle a step farther there is nothing like improvement       of the vegetation of alaska much might be said notwith standing the popular notion that the chief botanical produc tions of the territory are small potatoes i saw a great many palms there but as for grain the produce is nearly all in your rye and of course cannot equal the wheat crops of illinois but we must not expect everything from a country i am glad of this opportunity however to speak of the fruit of this favored land during all my sojourn in the country i did not see a single orange tree bearing less than two thousand oranges at a time nor did i find a pineapple which weighed less than fourteen pounds mines as yet do not exist in alaska the natives have no use for ores as they prefer paddles but there is plenty of room to sink shafts and i have no doubt but that any enter prising mining company will be able to find plenty of anti money gold is said to exist in the country and in fact i carried some there myself moreover i can sincerely and truthfully affirm that the smallest nugget which i dug in alaska was at least as large as any i ever exhumed in central park if the natives didnt have religious scruples against washing they might find some too the fisheries i am not familiar with although i am sure that most species of fish are scarce upon the mainland but i did not explore the mountains of the interior and cannot say how it might be there alaska is generally supposed to be a fur country but when i was there i found it close by so this statement is partially untrue seals abound there nevertheless and i used to send specimens home on my letters but for practical purposes the seals of alaska have little value as you can only skin them olc this may be remedied in time however by the estab     lishment of an agricultural college in the territory and the introduction of improved methods i tried to bring back specimens of the natural productions of alaska in order to exhibit them here i had some superb samples of the climate the native customs and the aurora borealis but they were unfortunately spoiled in the transit i did not pack them properly i had intended to continue my remarks a few hours longer but i see that every sensible person in the room is asleep and i do not care to address the others besides snoring annoys me and puts me out so i will go out naturally the p f of mr d having subsided prof agssz arose to enquire whether the last speaker believed in darwin the p f replied that he hadnt the honor of mr darwins acquain tance and would like to know where the gentleman referred to preached the professor then briefly but emphatically alluded to an individual by the name of shaw and sat down dr brt g wldr then rose to learn whether the alaskans ever were troubled with abnormal digits where upon the aforesaid p f replied wildly that he quite agreed with the last speaker a few more questions from various members of the society were aimed at mr dalls friend which finally resulted in reducing that unhappy individual to a con dition of complete insanity and caused his removal to a place of retirement after that dr wldr tried to ascertain whether any person present had abnormal digits but was unsuccessful this disturbance having subsided prof agssz again took the floor and with heroic determination imprinted upon his countenance sternly asked whether any person present believed in dalrwi but no darwinianl cared to cope with the professor   and all remained silent whereupon the speaker went on to say with dignified but glowing accents that he did not believe in darwin that his grandfather was not a monkey and he did not choose that any other man should lay claim to such an cestry one man he thought had as much right to simian relatives as another and in a land where all were free and equal he did not wish to be excelled by any he resumed his seat amid great applause and it was evident that he had won a triumphant victory over all believers in darwin the next paper read was a botanical one by prof gry he said that he had often noticed the trees leaving in the spring time but that he had never been able to ascertain when they returned the recommended the subject to all botanists as a fruitful one to investigate immediately after the conclusion of grys article a long haired eager looking individual whose name the reporter could not catch read a paper entitled animal magnetism as developed in the cimex lectularius or bedbug this mag netism he said differed greatly from that produced by most living beings for while that of man puts its subjects to sleep that of the cimex renders sleep impossible in section b several papers were read of greater or less interest chiefly the latter the first one was by mr mry the celebrated authority upon the tides upon the existence of water in the atlantic ocean although purely theo retical its positions were triumphnntly sustained the next paper was by prof hrsfrd upon an analysis of sausages and was too elaborate in technical details to be fully reported here it treated chiefly of the bark of this interesting product of germany prof prc then delivered a remarkably lucid address upon      the triangular functions of elliptic circles and their relations to the cycloid hypothenuse and in it proved be yond all question that twice two equals four the learned professor received a vote of thanks from the assembly for having settled this vexed question n b confidential no one understood the professorexcept the reporter after the audience had recovered from the bewildering effects of prcs mathematics they were entertained by prof gstvs hnrchs with a paper upon the atomic con stitution of s t  x this was remarkably vigorous and was well received its facetious character restoring the assemblage to good humor and even merriment several other persons also wished to read papers but as their views ran counter to those of sundry scientific men just at present they were very properly promptly and summarily squelched and the days work was concluded with a paper by a starr hunter esq descriptive of a remarkable meteoric shower the gentleman stated that on the previous evening feeling very tired after his scientific labors he had been in company with several friends relaxing his mind with punch returning to his hotel by starlight at nearly  a m he noticed a very remarkable appearance in the sky the stars seemed all in motion and the moon which was just rising was accompanied by several mock counterparts of itself so much like the original that he had great difficulty in deciding which gave him the best light to go by while he was trying to dodge the light of the extra luminaries in order to avoid confusion he lost his balance and fell and just as his head struck the sidewalk he noticed a remarkable shower of shooting stars much more elaborate than any he had ever seen before although they were unusually large and brilliant   the display was but momentary and therefore the speaker thought it might have escaped the notice of other observers if he had only had with him a glass which he had left but a few moments previous he thought he might have made obser vations of value at the conclusion of hunters remarks the society adjourned till the next day the third andlast day of the campaign was opened in section a by a gentleman from indiana who gave a most interesting account of some strange habits of the birds in that state while in other regions the male and female of most species of birds were noted for their constancy to one another in indiana they had lost that virtue entirely and he the speaker said that he had known a single robin to have no less than six different mates in one season the cowbunting which lays its eggs in the nests of other species was very abundant in indiana the speaker having concluded a nervous gentleman who had screwed his courage up to the point of publicly believing in darwin called the attention of those present to the fact that the birds of indiana were only imitating the human beings around them and were probably undergoing a devel opment into a higher more humanlike order of existence he was immediately crushed by agssz the famous author and naturalist mr anonymous next read an article upon sonme new points in the natural history of the dog he was very cursory in his remarks curtailing them as much as possible but was rather too dogmatic he divided dogs into two species quadrupeds and bipeds desig nating the first as dogs proper or proper dogs and the second inferior species as puppies the paper was chiefly devoted to       pointing out differences between these species and was of the most interest when it touched upon their behavior in the tem perance question for the speaker said although both dogs and puppies indulge in whine the former take it rem edially as whine of bark while the latter use it as a bev erage but we must not deny to dogs the possession of high spirits when their tails are whiskey much else of an equally interesting character was brought forward by the speaker but space forbids its insertion here next in order came the celebrated  t brnm with a paper upon the natural h istory of the hum bug mr brnrm began as follows gentlemen or rather if i may call you so my learned friends although it may surprise you to see me here intending to address so eminently intelligent a body i am doubtless well known to all of you as having long been interested in collecting objects of natural history and the history of naturals with a view towards combining in struction with amusement and affording moral recreation to old and yo ung and you are also all aware that i have devoted much time to acquiring a practical knowledge of that branch of entomology which is hinted at in the title of my paper and that i have assiduously collected specimens of the insect i am about to describe without regard to the expense or difficulty i have laughed at obstacles risen superior to common sense and conquered i can safely say that my late lamented museums in new york have contained at one time more and finer specimens of the genus than all the other cab inets of the world combined and that my opportunities for studying the habits of its species have exceeded those of any other living man popular clergymen politicians railway projectors brokers broadway belles eminent publishers and          mediums have all visited my collections and no one has yet attempted to dispute my preeminence even the cardiff giant has bowed to me and grg frncs trn has sent me telegramshaving thus got fairly lunder weigh mr brnm next went on to the subject indicated by the title of his paper he stated that the insect he was to describe oc curs in many foims many different species but they all agreed in being parasites upon human beings like the tri china trickina they make their way into the system by being swallowed the swallower himself being paradoxically taken in at the same time but unlike the creature just men tioned instead of acting injuriously they afford valuable nutriment before beginning operations however the insect always puts out its feelers some writers say there ant any and makes a loud but pleasing noise which is rendered easy for it by its prodigious strength of jaw further than this the speaker mentioned many interesting facts but after a while stopped abruptly saying that he could not describe the hum bug more fully without specimens to use for illustration therefore he said that his paper at present incomplete would be continued in his next museum where he would be happy to receive all present at the usual termschildren half price his performances would there be illustrated with specimens which alone would be worth the price of admission and the habits of the insect would be dramatically elucidated in the lecture room without extra charge having concluded his remarks mr birnm disappeared abruptly leaving his en raged audience in the greatest confusion it was thought that the speakers impudence deserved no less a punishment than solitary confinement for life in one of his own sells the days session in section a concluded with an interest ing article upon        his gloomy treacherous mischievous eyes his rapidlyagitated feelers had a horrid look enough to make one fancy him re ally a spirit of the damned a very devil he advanced upon me as it is their fashion waving his  wings to balance his huge body while they gave out a dull hollow sound like some bassl rum with skin of ox hide the  breeze from them twisted up young saplings by the roots like a tornatlo then wrinkling his enormous antenna at the sanme time he made the forest ring with his tremendous hum the refrain of which is singularly like the loud muttering of thunder the earth really shook under my feetthe noise was frightful i have heard lions roar but certainly the lions roar cannot be compared with the hum of the musquito i stood my ground for at least three long minutes before the great insect was near enough for a safe shot during this time i could not help thinking that i had heard that a man had been killed only a few days before and as i ooked at the musquito in front of me i thought that if i missed the insect i might be killed too but i was not afraid at last he stood before me at a distance of six yards once more he paused and i raised my gun as he again began to hum and wrinkle his antenna and justas he took another step forward i fired and down he fell almost at my feet  dead but i emptied my pocket pistols before i approached  him  how huge he was my tape measure was worn out before i had taken half his girth i tried to photograph him but could not get him into the camera he was too vast to bring away so i left his body on the spot contenting myself with the tip ofone of his antennae i deposited it with my friend mr brnm and it was destroyed at the burning of his       i i        preparing to make them he was having a grand meteoric  shower made to order for the express benefit of the chicago people and a number of new comets were in active prepar ation moreover in order to raise money for scientific pur poses the professor said that he purposed giving a weekly exhibition of an eclipse of the sun and that in order to increase the effect of the display he was having that luminary enlarged and in view of these advances the professor expected that soon chicago would be the centre of intellectual activity for the whole world when mr s had concluded one of the many learned gen tlemen from boston arose and expressed himself delighted to hear of the progress being made in chicago he had long watched with interest the growth of that village and still although amused at its precocity could sincerely wish it suc cess if it would only keep on in the right path he said it would soon be large enough to be annexed to boston and so become as professor sffrd had prophesied at least a part of the centre of intellectual activity with regard to prof ss plans for advancing chicagoan astronomy the boston gentleman was happy to vouch for their correctness as he himself had seen the comets and the meteoric shower in process of construction upon boston common and had learned that the sun was to be enlarged by inflation with gas from the boston gasworks he then went on to speak of some remark able enterprises about to be undertaken at the harvard observatory stating that prof wnlck had succeeded in capturing several stray comets and harnessing them to a new asteroid upon which he purposed making a journey towards some of the more distant heavenly bodies partly in the interests of science and partly with a view towards dis covering a suitable location for the proposed boston park      chicago wilted and the audience remained silent and awe struck after the assembly had recovered from the blow it listened to a chemicomineralogical paper entitled the effec is of heat upon gunpowder by asinus nincompoop ph d ddoctored philosophy a few months ago an agent whom i had sent forth to col lect minerals and fossils for the school of ecclesiastical geology over which i have the honor to preside returned from pennsylvania with a large number of specimens of hicksite israelite and other well known species and also brought me a singular meteorite whichsome seven years ago fell in great numbers in the vicinity of gettysburg and was colloquially known to the dwellers in that region by the name of bumshel it consisted of a spherical hollow mass of iron remarkably rich in carbon crystalline rather brittle coated with oxide and containing no nickel the cavity in the interior contained a considerable quantity of a granular black powder semicrystalline in appearance and of brilliant lustre this my agent informed me is locally known as gunpowder although i am unable to find any authority for such a name either in the hebrew latin or greek tongues and comstocks elaborate work on mineralogy contains no mention of such a mineral but the name being quite unes sential i prefer for the present to adhere to the common ap pellation of the substance at least until science shall furnish me data for a better after carefully noting the physical peculiarities of the min eral my first step of course was to attempt a preliminary blowpipe assay of it but here i at once encountered a re markable hindrance for the substance when heated either by    itself or with fluxes deflagrated with the most intense vio lence in fact the deflagration was too violent to admit of ascribing it to the presence of either a nitrate ora chlorate further than this the blowpipe told me nothing for i could obtain no beads  upon attempting a wet assay i found the mineral to be insoluble either in water or acids and in consequence i en deavored to reduce it with fluxes thinking perhaps that the deflagrations which had annoyed me with my blowpipe e periments might be due to the direct contact of the flame with the substance under examination however upon placing about forty grains of it in a platinum crucible with the requi site fusing mixtures and heating gradually i again found my work impeded by deflagration although i left off the cover of the crucible to permit the free escape of all expansive gases not caring to be baffled however i again placed a portion of the substance in my crucible carefully luting down the cover in order to resist the deflagrations and thereby prevent the mass from being thrown out of the crucible and lost having done this with the utmost care and heated the crucible almost to redness i was suddenly astonished by a tremendous explo sion which shattered the crucible threw me back violently upon the floor and did much damage in the laboratory now all methods of analysis having failed what could i conclude plainly thatthe substance could not be analyzed and was necessarily a new element as it was insoluble in acids i could not regard it as a metal and its explosive character served to distinguish it from all other metalloid and to establish it ads a new substance at present i prefer to call it by its colloquial name feeling that when i shall have ex amilned the character of its compound i shall be better able to classify it intelligently and to christen it accordingly     in the evening the two great sections again united and the whole society met to listen to a distinguished german savan who was traveling il this country and who had been invited to express his views upon the condition of science in america the reporter regrets his inability to furnish a verbatim report  of herr donderkopfs interesting and instructive remarks but excuses himself upon the ground that lie is not accustom ed to take notes of words of over thirty syllablesa limit which the speaker often exceeded iowever he the reporter offers a brief abstract of the more important points made by our german friend he began by expressing himself honored by the privilege of addressing so respectable a body of learneds hoping that he should be able to instruct them and feeling that he should regard himself as more highly flattered by their condescending and grateful applause than he could be by the plaudits of any class of students in germany and if he could encourage any one present to devote his life to science and to follow the glorious subjective paths of ideal ismus he should indeed feel that his time had not been wasted and that future generations would look back upon him as the founder of science in america just here the reporter began to lose the thread of the gen tlemans remarks because the violent snoring firom all parts of the house rendered it difficult to hear plainly however this period was devoted by the speaker to what he called an     overthrow of  materialismus soon a word of eightythree syllables was used which woke all the sleepers up and startled them so that they involuntarily rose to their feet thinking there was an alarm of fire this motion was inter preted by herr donderkopf as a tribute to his eloquence and when order was once more restored he continued more vigor ously than ever he went on to urge the importance of a true philosophy in science and quoted all the authorities who are named in the encyclopedias to show how necessary it was to be thorough in investigation and ceaseless in meditation he alleged that there was a want of thoroughness in america that people attempted too much as for hrmselt hie had to studying the eyelid of the clam forty long years devoted and was proud to say that he knew less about it than ever and if he a german with his intellect could so gloriously fail in that how could any mere american reasonably expect to com prehend the philosophy of the entire mollusc in his country they would laugh at the idea here he held up for emulation the thoroughness of the surgeons of arkansas who devote their lives to studying the wounds produced by a certain species of knife known as the bowiesuch thoroughness he said would raise all present to as high a position as that occupied by his pupils at home and fit them to receive higher instruc tion from his own mighty brain about this time the pro fessor waxed more eloquent and like the first raindrops of a shower german words began to drop from his lips soon they fell in torrents drowning out the sober english tongue and baffling the reporters attempts to catch them entirely the latter person looking disconsolately around him then discovered that the rest of the audience had disappeared and so without disturbing the speaker he quietly slipped out also      six hours afterwards when the janitor went to close the hall he found our teutonic friend still speaking with his eyes ecstatically closed and an expression of idiotic happiness pervading his features and extending even to the seesaw gesticulation of his arm the janitor interrupting him broke the charm and restored herr donderkopf to indignation and consciousness the meeting never adjourned for there was nobody left to adjourn it elizabeth masters the doubly affianced being the life of a

trouble the reader with the details of my family history or the chain of events which placed me at the age of nineteen a student at the university of virginia sufficient to say that such was my position at the time i am now about referring to about two years after my advent at college i formed a strong attachment for a young fellowstudent by the name of mauricea generous frank and kind fellow a more perfect young man in truth i never knew with one of the strongest frames he had almost feminine delicacy of appearance so nicely proportioned was each muscle and limb his heart was as tender as a womens with the spirit of a tiger and his features bore the stamp of rectitude of principle and an honorable mind we were both passionately fond of country rambles and it was frequently our custom to ride abroad on horse back seeking and finding adventures which a sober denizen of either a city or town might envy it was one sweet march morning the rough burly wind swept shrilly through the branches and boughs of the yet leafless trees a heavy dew hung on the grand green sward glittering in the glad sunshine and the songs of birds trilled in wild delight rang merrily through the meadow copse and wild springsmiling pretty springwas dancing in her earliest unfolding loveliness flowers peeped out from their frosted trance and welcomed their mistress as she pressed each bud and blossom the busy bee stole out from its almost storeless hive and recommenced his busy thrifty task things that loved the summer hailed the herald of their joy and revelled in natures freshlydecked beauty we had ridden several miles from the university grounds when we suddenly came near to an indian mound so common in that part of the country and were somewhat surprised at seeing a lady sitting alone upon it attired in a green riding habit and holding the rein of a beautiful white horse cropping the grass at her feet there was something strange in the expression of her features as we met her gaze although more beautiful mans eyes never rested on her dark thick brows arched above a pair of hazel eyes that flashed again as they seemed to penetrate the object of their regard and her complexion rivalled the halfblown rose that she was carelessly pulling leaf by leaf to pieces and letting them fall scattering to the wind her figure was tall and slight but the tight habit showed a bust exquisitely moulded and there was something inexpressibly strange in her intense and almost fiery glance which fixed our attention upon her who can she be exclaimed maurice heaven only knows replied i but there will be no difficulty in learning im only astonished weve not heard of her before heard of her before repeated maurice involuntarily she cannot reside near or we must have heard of her continued he portraying by his manner an extraordinary interest in the fair stranger here comes somebody who doubtless can inform us said i seeing old nixon the wellknown purveyor of the university approaching aye returned maurice that old fellow is acquainted with every one from the minister to the bellringer within a circle of thirty miles we will sound him upon this subject continued he spurring his horse toward the old man good morning gentlemen said nixon taking the cap from his bald and frosted head and saluting our approach a beautiful wind from the south only a leetle too much of it gentlemen theres a young lady dressed in green sitting on the mound yonder said maurice pointing to the spot where he had seen her perhaps she will join us in our ride do you know who she is know who she is sir said nixon that i do there can be only one of her sort in this country what do you mean i enquired i havnt much time to talk about her replied he pulling out his watch but ill tell you her name it is miss lizzy masters and a nicer lady never lived anywhere although some folks think her rather odd in her ways and perhaps they are seeing that they are different to most ladies she lives about five miles from here in a very old queershaped building and is quite her own mistress being without father and mother ever since her childhood and no one ever seeing after her except an old woman provided by a gentleman called her guardian i believe miss lizzy doesnt visit many of her neighborsfolks say because she cant sing play and dance like other young ladies of quality but gentlemen continued nixon turning his eyes to heaven if youd only heard her sing as i have heard her sing as i have once or twice at sunrise youd say it was really angelical however its quite true she doesnt go to parties or give any but keeps herself to herself and seems to think of nothing else but doing all the good she can to everybody everywhere theres not a poor person anywhere round here that knows what it is to want her bounty never comes to a check but is always the same on a right scent and then her riding but if shes going your way youll have a sample o that gentlemen she goes like a pigeon is she on a white horse inquired he yes replied maurice ah thats her maresilverbeamthat is rejoined nixon and a most splendid animal she is too only a little shy for the lady at this moment to our surprise squire jones came suddenly in sight and without hardly deigning to bow to us went and saluted miss masters she thereupon mounted upon her snowy horse at the same time causing the squire to laugh immoderately at something she said to him shes a wonderful favorite of the squires said nixon in an under tone bearing his head and bowing as the two rode toward us well nixon said the young lady in one of the most musical voices i had ever heard and looking archly at the old manshall we have a pleasant ride today is the ground too dry or too wet or is the wind from the frigid north or which of the many ills to which blank and bloodless days are prone may be ascribed to this not one i hope maam replied nixon smiling and the mare i hope she will behave herselfthough pon my word i am sometimes afraid of silverbeam when i see you ride pshaw exclaimed the lady shes as gentle as a lambshe knows the gait of her mistress and switching the animal into a racers pace she almost flew from our presence theres a diana exclaimed the squire delighted and spurring his horse after her hold hard my flower continued hegive us time to overtake you in a few minutes we had joined the squire in the race high on her haunches silverbeam reared as she fretted and pulled upon the checkingrein but it when it was slackened away she bounded with her fair mistress with the speed of a bird on the wing of sudden and ecstatic freedom miss masters glancing back and occasionally catching a glimpse of our party made her laugh fairly echo far and wide and waving her hand beckoned to the squire in derision but on she still went thats what i call reckless riding said the squire spurring his horse to urge the animal to a still greater speed a light laugh came from the lady in response and switching silverbeam she made a still greater distance between us and herself as if determined that none should cope with her beautiful white steed hold hard hollowed the squire as miss lizzy left loose her horses head on the verge of a dangerous precipice which he was aware we were approaching to the rightto the right dont go near that side waving his hand to beckon her away by st denis continued he with terror expressed in his voice and features the mare cant turn thereshes lost gentlemen it was true enough straight as an arrow from a crossbow her horse took the fearful leaprising in the air like a bird springing for its flight for a brief moment and then over they went without even ringing a clink from silverbeams ironed hoofs my god exclaimed maurice pale with fear for her safety both horse and rider must be dashed to pieces the squire was too frightened to utter a single word in fact he seemed to be perfectly paralyzed for at that moment without even looking over the precipice he asked maurice to ride for a doctor for my own part i involuntarily sprang from my horse and almost instantly gained a winding lane which commenced a deep descent on the right it was so thickly studded with bushes and brush that i could not see a yard ahead and but for the fact that i knew i was descending i could not have imagined whether i was going right or not for more than an hour i wandered in the intricacies of this crooked path trying alternately to regain the summit of the hill or to find some definite road to the bottom at last as i turned one of its abrupt corners my heart leaped to my throat at seeing silverbeam stretched dead in the road the sidesaddle with its broken pummel was twisted under her the crupper snapped and her briddle dragged from over her ears it was too obvious that the worst had occurred and that in leaping down the dizzy height she must have entailed destruction on her fair mistress as well as herself expecting to see the confirmation of what i feared i looked tremblingly about the road and saw within a few feet of the horses head a few drops of blood and upon a bush close by some small pieces of green cloth which hung on the thorns these were sufficient proofs of what had happened and almost palsied with horror i directed my course in the only direction the unfortunate lady could have been borne should she have been discovered which was the one i was pursuing down the hill i had not gone far when i came into a fair road and presently i saw maurices horse tied to the gate of a farmhouse groans and sobs saluted my ear before i reached the threshold and as i was about flinging open the door maurice ghastly white hurried out and seeing me exclaimed my god shes killed and rushed past me upon entering the house i discovered miss masters stretched upon a bed in an inner room surrounded by a group of weeping children and a woman the latter was almost frantic with grief continuing to ring her hands beat her bosom and between her sobs and groans exclaim lord have mercy on us the poor young lady is killed sorrow to all sorrow to all the sight was truly heartbreaking with hair dishevelled and streaming down her pale features scratched and torn in rude gashes lay miss masters without a symptom of life remaining her dress was severed into rags and tatters and the terrific violence of the fall was portrayed in every part of her disfigured person do you think she is quite dead said i as i pressed my fingers on her pulse i could discover no fluttering in this index of life but gave immediate directions for the loosening of her dress and other triffling orders preparatory to the doctors visit which was momentarily expected as i continued to watch anxiously for a sign of returning life the neighboring farmers wives stole silently into the room and whispered their grief and forebodings one to the other while tears of sincere sorrow coursed down their cheeks in streams shes gone mrs melville said one choking with grief shes gone our friends in heaven god be merciful to her added another the flowers nipped in the morning of her life lord have mercy on her some knelt by the bedside and prayed fervently for her restoration others whose grief was beyond their control wept like their halffightened halfsorrowing children and all evinced an intensity of grief for their beautiful generous and illfated friend in about twenty minutes which appeared to me the slowest that were ever ticked in the balance of time the doctor entered the room taking a glance at the inanimate lady he shook his head despondingly and said i fear all earthly aid is futile say not so sir say not so ejaculated a voice in the deepest consternation it was squire jones pushing his way through the throng congregated in the room i fear such to be the case sir added the doctor taking a case of instruments from his pocket but this room must be cleared added he i can have no one present but those who are necessary for my assistance all except myself maurice and the squire who although incapable from his agitation to render any assistance could not be persuaded to leave the apartment raise her gently in your arms in a reclining posture said the doctor to me quickly running his fingers over her limbs and body he twiste a ligament round her exquisitely moulded arm and forcing a lancet into the vein a crimson drop or two reluctantly came from the would but that was all the doctor gave a look of entire hopelessness and motioned me to place her in her former position when as i moved to do so a clear current trickled from the opened vein and as her head rested on the pillow a sigh broke from her lips cheering symptoms cheering symptoms exclaimed the doctor we shall save her continued he the squire clutched the doctors hand and saida thousand thanks for that hope theres not a limb fractured continued the doctor and i begin to think no bone but we shall see that presently added he thank god there are sparks of life remaining amen amen replied the squire theres a great crowd outside observed maurice scarcely able to remain there such is their desire to hear how the dear lady is shall i inform them of our hopes by all means replied the squire scarce had maurice gone from the room when a murmur like the hum of bees was heard and a suppressed but audible shout of joy i should feel said the squire that the sun had set forever if any thing took from us miss masters ah indeed mr jones added the doctor shes the sunshine to many hearts and may god restore her to them he will sir returned the squire confidently and rising from the edge of the bed to take a closer view of the sufferers pallid features he will sirhe will i am sure the blood had flowed freely for some seconds and the fluttering pulse like a flame kindling from smothered embers flickered beat and stopped and then throbbed againas if impatient of its newlygained action at length the ashy lips separated from being firmly fixed and the silken lashes of the eyes gradually became untwined until the eyes were once more visible a faint smile spread itself ever her countenance as miss masters endeavored to raise herself but the doctor instantly checked her and said now gentlemen i can dispense with your presence for that of the good woman of this house if you will send her to me the squire pressed the hand of the patient and then followed us from the room after about the lapse of an hour the doctor joined us and said he had left his patient in a most refreshing sleep and that there was nothing more serious than a slight concussion of the brain and some severe contusions then you deem her out of danger said the squire out of all immediate danger was the reply and there is nothing to make me anticipate any although from such an accident we cannot form a hasty conclusion when do you think she can be removed home asked the squire i hope in the course of tomorrow replied the doctor but i shall remain here during the night and attend her in the double capacity of nurse and surgeon aye do my good fellow rejoined the squire and should anything occur be sure and let me know by sunrise continued the squire i shall be here myself taking leave of the doctor who appeared one of the most interested of the party we mounted our horses and turned their heads toward home how did you find the poor young lady asked the squire of maurice it happened that a woodman was passing below when the leap took place said maurice i was hailed by him and directed to the spot where she lay i discovered miss masters lying in a bush on the opposite bank which doubtless broke the violence of the fall and silverbeam in the middle of the laneas i have since learned with his neck broken without the loss of a moment i hastened to the spot and raising miss masters in my arms bore her instantly to the nearest house in the course of our journey home i put several questions to the squire concerning miss masters and learned from him her history shes one of the most extraordinary girls living observed the squire but her eccentricities have been as they generally are in most people created by the peculiarity of the circumstances in which she has been placed it may now be sixteen years since her father and only parent came from the city of new orleans and purchased a large farm of eight hundred acres within a short distance of mine for a series of years the house and old ruinous place had been untenanted and i was much pleased at the prospect of a new neighbor but all advances to become friendly were rejected not only to me but to every one who made them ill health and an irritable temper occasioned by an impaired constitution made mr masters ters avoid all society and with the exception of his daughterlizzywhom he suffered to grow up as wild as the flowers of the forest no one and nothingnot even a dogwas the sharer of his melancholy existence except on the very warmest days in summer he never stirred from his roof but occupied the whole of his time in smoking and in watching the play of his beautiful selfwilled child but without joining in it but notwithstanding this sullen disposition he was liberal and kind to his farming men and was never known to turn a deaf ear to the calls of charity without a companion teacher or instructor of any kind lizzy continued to while away her hours by coursing the butterfly or the hummingbird and so shy was she of meeting anybody no sooner did she catch a glimpse of the approach of a stranger than away she would bound with the fleetness of a fawn often did i attempt to waylay the timid pretty child but her ears and eyes were as quick as those of a fox and i never could succeed in stealing within a short distance of her footfall thus slipped away some four years and at last the hermitas mr masters was calledno longer excited curiosity speculation and wonderment he pursued the same monotonous life and at length the old house was as little thought of and as little visited or inquired about as previous to its being occupied at last one morning brought the intelligence that mr masters had suddenly expired in a fit of appoplexy being the nearest neighbor and knowing the lonely situation of his orphan mrs jones and myself hastened to his house and there found the child maddened with grief at the bereavement of her father we used all our powers of consolation and finally that sympathy which she wanted she found in my good lady and after some coaxing and persuading we got her to accompany us home this was the commencement of our intimacy which has lasted uninterruptedly until this day and now i should like to know added the squire proudly if any one can show me a better christian or more lovely girl on this earth i know continued he that she has many peculiarities among others theres the fire of old nick in her veins ive not seen her roused more than once or twice in my life but when she isheaven and earthshe can look a man of common courage white ive seen a lawyer who is the only executor and guardian under the will tremble as though he had the ague when she had bent her fiery glance on him does miss masters still live retired and alone then inquired i yes replied the squire she has imbibed her fathers taste in not visiting or being visited by her neighbors for besides myself self and mrs jones no one ever enters her house except her domestics and she will meet no one at mine and now gentlemen added the squire as we arrived at a branch of a road which lead to his home you have the history as far as i know it of miss lizzy masters whom i fervently trust we shall soon see again in her wonted health and beauty with this he bade us farewell and took leave of us this lady fair is a very strange sort of character observed i to maurice after mr jones and quitted us as the squire says replied mauricecircumstances have rendered her different from the generality of her sex but it would have been more strange if they had done so considering the peculiar way in which she has been treated total neglect of her education and abstinence from all social association appear to be the passive causes of her singularities returned i but then how beautiful she is like a wild uncultivated flowerfresh and blooming in all its natural lovelinessunnoticed uncared for unseen and yet superior to all that art can train never was there such captivation in a woman before i looked at my friends face his cheeks were flushedhis eyes sparkled as he spoke and i saw that the unfortunate lady had made an indellible impression on the following morning maurice and myself proceeded on horseback at an early hour to the farmhouse where we had left miss masters and had the satisfaction of learning that she had had a night of tranquil rest and was so far recovered as to have been removed to her home about an hour previous to our arrival we therefore determined to proceed thither and make some personal inquiries concerning her after keeping a crosscountry road for a few miles we entered a tall rustylooking gate as directed and wended our way up a wide path flanked by thick and widelyspreading maple trees on emerging from this avenue we came in sight of a substantial but ancientlooking edifice which had defied the winters blast and summers sun for many a year the whole scene around looked so old and so solitary that we gazed in silence for some time previous to clanking the brassheaded lion as a summons for our entry a welldressed indian girl answered it readily and confirmed the statement of the morningthat miss masters was progressing rapidly and favorably we were about taking our departure on the receipt of this intelligence when mr jones hurried from the house and requested us to dismount nothing loath to do so we gave our horses to a servant and followed the squire into a spacious and handsomely furnished room i am commissioned by miss masters said he addressing both of us after we were seated to express her deep obligations for the great kindness and attention she met with at your hands yesterday and am desired to add to you mr maurice said he laughing that she will hold the future at your disposal being satisfied that she is indebted to you for her life the assistance i was enabled to render her replied maurice was purely accidental and therefore no obligation is due to me she thinks otherwise returned the squire however i care not which way it is in a short time we shall again hear her merry laugh and theres not a scratch on her pretty face thank god i would submit to have a scar an inch deep carved in my own rather than she should have the shadow of one returned maurice a gallant declaration said the squire and one which i shall not fail to convey to the lady the doctor gives hopes of a speedy convalescence observed i enquiringly not only hopes replied the squire but certainty i have his professional word that she shall be out again in less than a month it is now necessary that i should speak of myself and refer to some past occurrences which although triffling in themselves are indispensable joints of my narrative soon after miss masters recovery which took place within a month of receiving her injury maurice and myself became constant visiters at her house and to speak the truth we appeared to be far from unwelcome ones occasionally we used to meet the squire and his wife there but no one else and thus a strong intimacy arose between us immediately that maurice had the opportunity he undisguisedly evinced the passion which he had entertained from the first moment of seeeing the beautiful girl whose life he was chiefly instrumental in saving and although she sometimes received his attentions with great favor there was a fickleness of manner about her which continually left him between doubt and hope from a cause hardly to be explained and yet not difficult to be conceived this subject of allengrossing interest to himself was never mentioned to me either directly or indirectly although the friendship existing between us became daily stronger than ever miss masters from a portrait by frankenstein but suspecting which was the case that he had in myself a rival in feeling although not so expressed by word and i hoped not by look or gesture lizzy was tacitly a subject never alluded to by either of us it may appear strange that any thing like a good understanding or even common civility could exist between two men thus situated but so it was and in the belief that my friend was the favored one and in every way the most eligible i yielded to his superior claims without the faintest struggle for precedence more than once indeed i was staggered with an expression from the ladys sparkling eyes as they met my own but not dreaming for a moment that i found an answering spirit within them the sensation was like the fleeting sound of something thrilling and unexpectedly touched to say that i did not envy maurice would be to declare myself more immaculate than every other man could be placed in such circumstances but to declare that i threw in his way every facility in my power to insure him speedy success and that he was the constant theme of my sincerest commendation is to say no more than is strictly in accordance with the truth the eulogy sounds but ill from me but i hesitate not to assert that deeming my own feelings totally disregarded by the object of their solicitude i was sufficiently generous to assist my friend in succeeding to win the prize he so ardently longed to call his own little progress however seemed to be made for no sooner were his attentions favorably received than the next dayperhaps the next hourproduced as opposite a change the squire who took as much interest in the proceedings as if he had been her parent was a decided advocate to our cause for such i may call it and rated lizzy soundly for her waywardness and fickleness as he called her conduct so things went on for some two months when one morning i was startled at sunrise by maurice rushing into my bedroom in a state of great trepidation holding an unfolded letter in his hand fielding said he ive this moment received an unwelcome letter from home and a tear dropped as he spoke the most so continued he that i ever received in the course of my life my mother is at the point of death and desires instantly to see me will youas i shall have made my arrangements for departing within a quarter of an hourproceed early to miss masters and as i promised to be there before noon tell her the cause of my unavoidable absence my return must of course depend upon circumstances but you may also add that i shall take the earliest opportunity of fulfilling the appointment and that a letter will herald the keeping of it expressing my regret at the cause of his hasty departure and exchanging friendly grasps of the hands with a promise to obey his instructions we parted from the time i undertook to convey maurices message to miss masters i felt an irresistible inclination to bend my steps towards her house almost daily the attraction was as the needle to the magnet a force beyond opposition imperceptibly our hearts became entwined and our sympathies folded within each other without even the knowledge of either of the most ardent temperament equally ignorant and careless of the conventional rules of society lizzy portrayed at length in every look and gesture the pleasure she experienced in my undivided society early in the morning i met her in the fields brushing the dew from the daisy cups and it was not often till the nightingale had piped on the thorn that we separated thus weeks were past without my hearing a word from maurice and in the enjoyment of my daily intercourse with lizzy i had almost forgotten him or if remembered it was only as one i had now entirely supplanted neither did i reproach myself with the cause or the effect indeed i was too devoted to care perhaps by that means i had won the affections of miss masters but at the same time i was conscious of not using any treacherous ones or other than i was fully entitled to employ thus matters stood when a morning post brought intelligence of maurices intended return on the following day then and not till then i determined to propose in form for the hand of miss masters for although my advances had been met with too decided a favor to admit of any doubt as to the result i had not yet spoken of that which was nearest and dearest to my heart with the intention of putting this resolution in force i mounted my horse and proceeded to her residence it was a sultry evening late in august the distant rumble of the thunder was now and then heard and the black heavy masses of clouds rolling heavily from the west tinged with the purple light of the sinking sun betokened a coming storm hurrying forward i just managed to gain the portal of the house as the tempest burst in all its gathered violence lizzy expecting me was at the entrance and as she took my proffered arm to conduct her within a crash of heavens artillery roared above our heads and reverberated from hill to hill miles distant flash after flash of the forked lightning succeeded and then a deluge of water spouted on the earth bubbling and hissing as it fell roll after roll of the warring elements succeeded and the heavy clouds floated slowly on spouting forth their overcharged contents tis a dreadful storm observed lizzy yes replied i but from its violence it cannot last it appears that extremes can never last in any thing rejoined lizzy such seems to be one of natures immutable decrees returned i i hope notsincerely hope not said lizzy excitement kindling fire in her eyes i would not think so for ages of certain happiness hereafter and why not inquired i because she added the thought would insure me rack now a refinement of torture to contemplate and yet said i we should never fear to think of what must be there i differ with you replied lizzy it seems to me but poor philosophy to think of and thereby anticipate many disagreeable and inevitable certainties for instance decrepid age infirmities or premature deathconsequences attendant upon life but twould be far more agreeable to dwell upon closing scenes of our drama and foretaste their bitterness previous to the allotted period we are taught otherwise rejoined i and are bid by thinking of them to prepare against their visitation and our stern teachers with their proselytes may enjoy the study but it shall be none of mine returned lizzy tis sufficient occupation for me to render the present as pleasurable as possiblethe past is gone and the future is a mystery none can solve but we should be like mariners at sea continued i equally ignorant of latitude or longitude without helm or compass were it not that the experience of the past guides us to the future and in the like manner when sailing before the wind buoyantly and joyously we should strike upon some hidden rock or quicksand and when least expecting it become a hopeless wreck ill not deny but that you have the best of the argument she returned but still i might be able to puzzle you however continued she as i might perhaps suffer in your estimation by confessing my peculiar ideas concerning this sublunary existence well permit the subject to drop now and forever the storm by this time had abated the last rays of the setting sun shot from the verge of a frowning cloud and streamed gladly on the saturated ground the air stilled from the songs of birds while the tempest raged was now filled by them the cricket chirped merrily from his grassy bed and the locust sung in concert creeping insects crawled from their flooded homes and their enemies took advantage of their migration on the border of the lawn to the right of the house was a grove of thick maples so dense were they that hours of continued rain could scarcely penetrate to the serpentine walk which wound for a considerable distance between them thither as had been our wont for some time we proceeded to take our evening walk at the end of this path was a rude uncultivated bower formed of wild hops clinging to the boughs and stems of the overhanging trees the vines had been cleared in the centre of one thick clump and a seat roughly hewed from the solid trunk of an oak was placed within it upon this we rested and after a silence of some duration i told the tale she had read before in the silent language of the heart and long and passionately did i plead my cause never were words to me so apt before at length i paused without much fear to learn my doom eagerly i gazed upon her eyes as they were lit by a moons ray stealing between the leaves i saw the tear of joy and love floating in them in a moment i snatched her to my breast and the reciprocated affection and consent were murmured in kisses upon my lips all nature was hushed the wind toyed with the leaf so softly that it scarcely flapped in his gentle breath and every thing seemed calm and at peace the next day maurice returned and although i felt that the communication i determined to make without loss of time would give him poignant anguish i was totally unprepared for the expression of intense and indescribable horror and surprise which was displayed in his features when i informed him of my becoming his successful rival he looked at me as if in doubt of my sanity or the correctness of his own senses silently he continued to gaze while all the color forsook his cheek and his lips became pale and ashy yes he at length muttered it seems and sounds impossible but tis true you could notno your tongue would refuse to utter an untruth i have heard of such things before continued he bitterly but my god my god theyre monstrous and incredible calm yourself replied i although i can feel for your disappointment i dont think there is sufficient cause for the disappointment and anger you express miss masters was not affianced to you and if it is any consolation i may say never would have been not affianced exclaimed maurice not affianced and his amazement increased tenfold no returned i and i repeat never would have been give me your hand continued he holding out his own i wronged you in thought forgive me you did not know thenbut it matters not at this moment breaking off thus suddenly he hurriedly paced the room clasping his hands and looking the very picture of despair after a short time he became more composed but still was greatly excited and continued to exclaim against the cruelty and heartlessness of women in general at length he said ive a request to make and although it may appear unreasonable and one decidedly i have no right to make still i hope you will grant it to me it is granted replied i before being made then go not to her to day returned he but wait till i have seen her once again i need scarcely say it will be the last visit i will pay as you please added i but saying i should not see her throughout the day i bet that you will explain the cause of my absence i will said he accept my thanks for your abstinence from so much pleasure continued he smiling sarcastically and leaving the room i almost repented of having complied with maurices request and after he quitted me began to think i had acted unwisely in permitting him to seek an interview alone with lizzy at such a moment however as i had done so i of course did not attempt to recall it his look as he parted struck me as being full of turbulent passion and his previous portrayal of it all tended to increase my uneasiness at his going and here i will pause in my narrative to confess that which i believe the majority of men entertain in like circumstances although few perhaps would acknowledge it since the scene of the last evening in the fir grove lizzy had become to me an altered being the flower was bruised and sullied and no longer offered its former attractions i thought of her as of one that i must make my wife not as of one that i wished to make so if honor did not so sternly decree love had vanished and duty now usurped his post to save her reputation and my own i never thought of doing other than performing my plighted word but had there been a choice i would have retracted it with more ecstacy than i had pledged it notwithstanding however this revulsion of feeling i became more disturbed in mind as the hours flew past without maurices returning at length i could not restrain the inclination of seeking him conjuring up in my imagination a multitude of horrors crowding upon each other like colored forms in the kaleidoscope but just as i was issuing from my room i heard his step approaching never shall i forget the impression his appearance made upon me he reeled toward me like one intoxicated with a face so distorted that it was scarce possible to trace a single feature his lower jaw dropped from the other as in a corpse and his eyes had the dull leaden look which showed the fire of life was nearly extinguished not a tinge of blood was in his cheeks and he seemed a dead though breathing man gracious heaven i exclaimed what is the matter are you ill veryi am very ill he replied in a moment i assisted him to a couch and was about hurrying away for assistance when he motioned me to stay do not leave me he whispered do not leave me i have something to say to you and but a short time to say it in let me at least send for medical aid i rejoined he smiled faintly and said im not in want of it listen i have seen her and learned that which i believed beforethat you did not wrong me intentionally but what will you think when i tell you that she was betrothed to me by her own consent freely given as she is now to you what exclaimed i astonishment thrilling through my frame betrothed to you aye solemnly betrothed to me returned he in a tone not to be doubted so help me heaven in broken sentences and occasionally gasping for breath maurice recounted to me the particulars of his last meeting with lizzy and that during his absence he had sent several letters to her but with the exception of the first he had received no answers and although this neglect occasioned some surprise he supposed indisposition or some such cause had prevented replies to his communications but continued he i now know too well the reason and may god forgive her broken vow as i do if i had been acquainted with this returned i believe me maurice neither for her nor any other woman breathing would i have been the instrument of injury to a friend or the cause of a solemn plighted word being disregarded as though twas less material than the air which gave it birth i tremble to think of it from my soul i believe you replied he but think no more of it that which is one mans loss is anothers gain take herand may heaven bless you both fielding continued he raising himself on his elbow and looking earnestly in my face it is a dying mans blessing and one which emanates from a heart bearing no malice nor hatred toward any living creature dying repeated i surely it is but the temporary effects of excitement and distress of mind ah my friend added he sorrowfully and an expression of pain convulsed his features both mind and body are poisoned what i exclaimed poisoned and i clutched a bellrope hush hush fielding he returned be not alarmed on my account bring no one here on my account bring no one here for heavens sake say added i are you a suicide replied he certain and and irremediable as quick as thought with terror to urge me i flew for assistance in a few minutes a crowd of friends and attendants rushed into the apartment and as i returned i saw in the middle of the throng the doctor on his knees pressing a hand on maurices heart by his side were various instruments and his fingers held a vial marked deadly poison tis useless said he rising the quantity would have killed a dozen men and is he dead inquired i pressing forward quite sir was the reply and i felt my heart withered with it there he lay a few hours before in the exhuberance of youth strength and manhood now a scathed and unsightly mass his limbs were drawn up and cramped in the agonies of death and his face told how hard the struggle had been in the forcible separation between soul and body with surprise horror and the deepest sorrow i was followed from the apartment by our mutual friends and all i remembered afterward ward on this dreadful night was finding myself waking as if from a deep sleep and the blood trickling from an opened vein in my arm confused as if some terrible dream had been racking my brain through the long and tedious night i awoke early the following morning weak and feverish i can scarcely describe my feelings faithfully as the incidents of the preceding day flashed with all their cruel truth on my memory i began to suspect that lizzy might be part the slave of passion and a thousand revolting images reared themselves in my mind with distrust sorrow anger and a mingling of sensations impossible for words to represent but leaving a most disordered frame of mind i proceeded to her residence lizzy in anticipation of my visit was sauntering in the avenue some distance from the house and seeing my approach hastened toward me never did she look more beautiful her long black tresses were sweeping down her shoulders as carelessly and unconfined as the tendrils of some wild vine her slight but beautifully moulded figure was robed in a simple white morning dress and around her waist was tied a string of large jet beads which hung to the ground on the inside of a close cottagebonnet a fresh picked rose was placed but it would be difficult to say which looked the freshestthe flower or the cheek on which it rested with a light step she bounded to my side and as she came a ringing laugh of joy and of love burst from her lips as my welcome but when she arrived close to me and saw my pale and haggard face the color forsook her cheek like transient breath from a mirror mutely she gazed at me as i dismounted from my horse and staggering to a neighboring bench almost fell as i reached it tell me she said clinging to me and with deep emotion are you ill has anything happened speak in the name of heaven oh lizzy i exclaimed unable to conceal my mental anguish an instant longer why did you conceal from me thethe i could say no more my gorge rose and threatened to choke me with grief i know what you would say she returned but upbraid me not he was here yesterday and performed that part to perfection but surely you must have thought continued i how wrong how unjustifiable it was for you to admit of my advances and then not to acquaint me with the secret but let in reveal itself in all its bear reality indeed lizzy there is too much cause to upbraid you for me to pass it over in silence if the truth be no justification replied she i have no other advocate give me your patience for a few moments from the hour i first saw you the germs of as true and warm affection were planted in my bosom as ever sprung from the heart of woman your apparent want of sympathy and coldness of conduct were constant sources of torment to me and my pride was daily and hourly wounded by the general indifference of your demeanour i confess admitting occasionally of mr maurices addresses solely in the hope of creating a feeling in you which i trusted might be raised from the spirit of rivalship in this i was disappointed nothing could fan the spark i so longed to see reared into a flame and at length tired with the ceaseless attentions of the one and in dignant at the want of them from the other i in a moment of mortification reluctantly permitted my tongue to consent to that which my heart denied soon after this i discovered my error and god is my witness how i at once rejoiced and sorrowed at the discoveryrejoiced for the consummation of my hearts only desire and sorrowed for the hasty barrier i had raised against the possession of it still this was but a feather in the scale against the attainment of my wish and i determined to defy all censure all reproach to become your own in the conviction that your stern sense of duty and observance of the conventional automaton rules of society would at once decide your resolution in the event of learning my engagement with your friend i was resolved if possible not to let you know it until she paused and hesitated to proceed until no choice was left me you would say returned i until you were equally disposed to set aside such a cold calculating code added she regarding me with a lowering brow and fiery glance then learn replied i that i am as much disposed now to obey the edict to which you refer as i should have been in the first instance had i known what i now do you have deceived me you have deceived yourself and one who is now oblivious of your wrong and cruelty yes lizzy continued i he who loved you as well as i and who was far more worthy of a pure requital is now a corpsea suicide heaven have mercy on me she ejaculated heaven have mercy on me and falling on her knees she clasped her hands and poured forth a prayer in agony of supplication for forgiveness i watched her with less emotion as i heard the choking sobs heaving from her bosom and saw the tears streaming down her cheeks i forgot the wrong and saw only the penitent evil recoils upon itself she murmured as i proceeded to raise her but as my hand was extended and ere it touched her she sprung to her feet and retreating from me saidit shall never touch me more no and throwing her hands wildly out she muttered a vow so solemn and irrevocable that i was silenced by its awful affirmation never to become my wife your words were she said bitterly while her eyes glared with passion like an infuriated tigresthat i am as much disposed now to obey the edict to which you refer as i should have been in the first instance had i known what i now do then in the name of heaven obey it she exclaimed ill be no obstacle to its fulfilment i endeavored to soothe the ungovernable passion which possessed her but my words fell like drops of water into a sea of fire away she said begone and let us never see each other more let me entreat said i not if angels knelt and backed the petition with their tears interrupted shenot if torments everlasting were threatened thicker than the gentle drops of rain from heaven then must we really part asked i ay and forever she replied deliberatelyforever can you make no allowances for my hasty observation said ithink of my deep deep sorrow for my friends lamentable fate is it possible i should forget it for a single moment of my future life rejoined she pressing her hands upon her forehead is it not forever branded here stamped with torture added she between her clenched teeth dissolving of all superficial thought and leaving nothing but the bare truth a hideous skeleton yes continued she i see in myself a guilty wretch and in you she paused and coming near me she shook her head reproachfully less in anger than in sorrow the words found an echo in my heart i could make no reply instead of the accuser i felt the accused farewell she added farewell and as we were so let us henceforth bestrangers i sprung forward to catch her in my embrace impelled by uncontrollable impulse no no no remember said she pointing to the clear cloudless sky i have that registered there which truth shall seal once more farewell and turning she left me with one long sad look years and years flew past without my hearing anything of lizzy masters for soon after this sad event i left the university and sought a forgetfulness of it in other and distant lands where i resided amid extravagant and dissolute scenes for many years i returned to my native land at the request of a favorite uncle who promised me fortune and fame would i but embark with him in mercantile pursuits i now remembered the painful events which occured on my quitting the university only as a dream and i had not the least desire to visit the scene of them it happened however that my business called me to columbia south carolina it was just after the new state asylum had been put in operation and when passing to that town i was persuaded by a friend to visit this institution for lunatics i had scarcely entered the building when good heavens could it be possible my eye caught the form and features of the once lovely miss masters there indeed she stood twining her long and wasted fingers within those of a sicklylooking child whose constant unmeaning smile and vacant stare told the brains disease she was so changed that i even hesitated to believe it was once the young the beautiful the gay lizzy but it was too true there she was the demented mother of an idiot child old wrinkled and witheredthe wreck of passion and the ruin of beauty i turned away horrorstricken and from that hour to this have sought to know nothing more of her fate james e fielding natchez miss feb   the above narrative was found in the trunk of james e fielding who was unfortunately stabbed in a fight in a coffeehouse on the levee on wednesday evening of last week from the effects of which injury he died the following morning it is made public in accordance with his dying request miller townsend coroner i was totally unprepared for the expression of intense and indescribable horror and surprise which was displayed in his features when i informed him of becoming his successful rival i hav heard of such things before said he bitterly but my god my god theyre monstrous and incrediblepage  a christmas story dr

 one morning to my widowed sister as she sank into an arm chair in front of my library fire and heaved a sigh replete with exhaustion and sadness  what is the matter  enough or a woman william but of

to give out stores to one girl soap and starch to another  candles and linen to the cham bermaid and orders to the coachman and even then i haveno peace  for no sooner do i sit in the nursery hoping to derive a few minutes comfort from a quiet sew than my ears are filled with the dissatisfaction of one girl the complaints of another the threatenings to leave of another and the   quarrels of all i declare william i think it was too bad in you to insist on our leav ing that comfortable boarding housewhere we lived so much cheaper and had no trouble it was there with my small family that i appreciated the freedom from care that you old selfish unsympathizing bachelors enjoy  and no wonder you laugh at us the fact is you dont know any thing about it  you  my dear mary i repeated you have said enough i only ask for a few minutes to put this matter in a new light and in time you yourself will be convinced  thats all very well william but whats the use of talking to you men i  never convinced one in my life no sir man is an animal that never acknowledges either that he is wrong or that a woman is right i tell you servants are the bane of my existence you cannot make them happy do

leaves and ashes my boots williamthe very pair i had given jane the day before         i  well what did you do  do why as soon as i could recover i called her to me and asked why she had     thrown

large and strong cabana to lend zest to my courage and prepared to make one more effort for victory gradually subsiding into a few occasion al chromatic giggles mary looked through her beautiful eyes glistening with tears of fun and said in a smothered whisper  well and what would you do do i repeated  let me have the reins for one month and i will show you there it was out and i felt relieved but

mentally groaned at this humiliating nonsense  i might want l him you wont forget will you sabi na  no marmn is there anything else i having now made herself prim and taken a quiet survey of the

it leaked through is dinah in  yes iarin  ask her please to come here sabina tripped off with a satisfied air and fivetenfifteen minutes elapsed and no ellen i took out my memorandum and quickly wrote down a few valuable plans or the coming campaign the clock struck half past eight and my sister opened the entry door and listenedthe kitchen door soon shut and somebody ceme up stairs slowly with a waiter full of some thing is that you dinah  yes inarm  why didnt you come before  i dont know mum  didnt sabina tell you i wanted you  no mum she told me you wanted to know how many were down stairs and i counted seventeen  take care dinah youre spilling that milk  i cant help it this pitcher leaks  wheres the childrens bowl r i dont know mumi think its broke broken why i bought a new one yesterday taint my fault   hopelessly resigned my sister mary po litely requested her to put down the wait er and explained the nature of a witnesss duty  we acknowledged our signatures i and dinah wrote out her name in a neat hand then picked up the waiter and walk ed out of the room with the air of an in jured innocent i jumped up kissed my sister informed her that for the next three months she was to he a passive observer asked her to retire locked up the contract and gave the bell one pull that brought half the household to the door part ii mans plan i as the servants rushed into the library they found me quietly reading a book and puffing at the pages i slightly raised my eyes to this back ground of faces on which might be seen surprise anger imperti nence curiosity and excitement i slowly placed my book half open across my knee  with my hand resting on the cover and with the other taking my segar out of my mouth knocked the ashes off into a little glass tub elevated my eyebrows and asked in perfect astonishmentyet measured tones  whatisthemacter  thats what we want to know  sir exclaimed the cook a little let down by my coolness  nothing that i know of i replied ex cept that i took the liberty of ringing my bell increasing in volume as i spoke  we thought some one was sick sir said sabina  i dont want to know what you thought  i rolled out in emphatic base i want the   waiter which is tthat neuter cut them to the heart  but they rallieda revolt was immi nent i had lived in the family one year with my sister as housekeeper and had never made a remark to the servants it being my habit in lite to submit to what was not my business or clear out but nownow with imprimatur on my fore head a clutch in my mental fingers and a hungry longing to rule free ha

mar is unfurled hemmed in by swelling indignation whisperings and sullen looks i jumped up and yelled in stentorian voice  leave my room how dare you an swer the waiters bell send me the wait er and clear out every one of you and with a sweeping wave of my hand i stalked towards the door reader did you ever see the sun chase a big cloud right off a green field and with no respite drive it headlong away over beyond the horizon such was the rapid departure of my stupe lid retainers on reaching the door i slammed it to with a violence that echoed through the hushed and palsied house oh the benefit of a good slamnnot a pushnor a quick shutnor even a bump all oft which show still a want of firmness and decision but a good oldfashioned bang  as though it had got into your throat and

offender slammed at at once subsides from rage to fear the mental barometer fallsand ap prehensiontre requiescatis a dont know what is coming next a bona fide aban doned slam is a domestic earthquake  next sat down on my mexican chair and waited fbr the rapid hatching of the egg a regster led up from the kitchen     into mny room and though never used formed one of those abominable listening tubes that might be truthfully called family talehearers this time however i had the pleasure of overhearing the following fragmentary evidence of a reaction  he must be crazy  did he drink much after dinner i say you have been here longer than i have have you ever seen aim so betore then a giggle and some one saying  is he married sabina aint you ashamed to laugh poor thingwont staygallows then silence and in a few minutes one after another of the visitors passed bv under the window on tiptoe and almost immediate ly a soft knock and a pause i thought     and acted  come in said i in one of those gen tle and subdued voices that no one but a passionate man can possess  the door gradually opened and there stood susan the devoted aunt i had placed a volume of engravings be fore nv eyes and was busily engaged in drawing some plan on paper as she en tered i went on for a little while in si lence when she said ji understood sir  i said  wait a minute and went on rul ing one entire side with double lines in perfect forgetfulness of her presence when she spoke again did you send for me sir i would have answered at once for i felt awfully at appearing such a tyro but the case was a desperate one of i long standing and required heroic treat ment i kept her waiting at first as a les son that her imagination might take wings and fly to the uttermost realms of unhappi   ress the second aime  thought i de tected a little impatience in her voice so i said taking a pen and dipping it in red ink  wait one moment susan and went on lining and interlining this was not read ing studying nor writing it was what she i very well knew i could do any time so i it told on her each moment her valor oozed out and as soon as i felt that the cup of bitterness was pretty well drained i proceeded to offer up this victim as a sacri  fice to peace  susan how is your sisters child i looked straight into her there was no sternness or smartness in my expression but the gaze was mathematical  i was measuring her candor and analyzing her mind she colored up and said  hes no better sir  and theyve given him up but the doctor says good nursing will do wonders  i think so too go back to your sis ter and stay till he is better i will supply your place ths puzzled her but she could say nothing i meant go and she went there was no delayi saw her walk by the window almost at once and overheard the whisper  who next i now rang the bell and dinah came to the door saying before she knocked the i waiter is out sir so i answered your ring  do you know where thomas lives  yes sir  then tell him i want him now yes sir she disappeared oh the benefit of that slam in half an hour in walked thomas  never do you enter my room without knocking it is a piece of impertinence i will not put up with l    i did not mean anything by it sir well dont do it again and always take your hat off when you come before a gen tleman or lady such ignorance might lose you a good place his wages were high i knew it was also winter and he gave in he stood still with his hat in hand and waited  thomas i want you to bring the close carriage to the door with the two bays  yes sir but the off horse cast his hind shoe yesterday and i am afraid  you need not be the ground is covered with snow i shall want the carriage in fifteen minutes  yes sir but   but what  i left the carriage this morning at the blacksmiths to have a new tire put on iti sir  who told you to nobody sir  then never do anything of that kind again without first reporting it to me  yes sir moving slightly towards the door as though it was all settled now what other vehicle haveyou got in the stable the phaton sir the open box wagon and the carryall  very well then bring the nigh horse round in the carryall  he never went in single harness since i drove mrs  well then put the other one in nor him neiter sir  humph it looked a little black  well where is the other horse the gray tthat your mistress always drives when alone    he is at the veterinary surgeons sir i took him there last monday and he is to be blistered for two weeks off and on sir s well thomas as the coachman of the family i ask you what can be done  i must go out tonight can you sug gest anything  nothing but to hire a hack sir  thats a very good idea how far is the livery stable from here  just next to where i live sir i can get one in a minute sir oh so cheerfully very well thomas just harness the two bays and ride down there and put them to one ell the livery stable keeper that i i wish it and will pay for the use ot it i  but sir it is  thomas i would advise you not to be lung you ought to be ashamed to call i yourselt a coachman and have what is un der youre charge in such a condition the  idea ft a horse two days without a shoe  it isnt my    not a wordgo and do your duty in future i shall expect you here in halt an hour he backed out of the room longing to to say something what it was i dont care but completely at sea as he paased under my window though i have not sworn for many years i am pretty sure i heard sev eral full sized oaths at the appointed time the bell rang and i went out and got into the carriage the horses looked very warm and though the night was cold one i was covered with foam i said nothing but told him to drive to susans sisters on arriving at the door i heard sounds of very lively music for a dying child and saw the house all lighted up      oh i understand it is one of those hi bernian wakes poor thing and i began to pardon susan feel sorry for the coach man and made up my mind to give io towards the sepulchral expenses as i entered the house surcharged with benev olence and overcome by a repentant feeling i caught sight of susan and a strapping man whirling round the floor to the tune of the irish washwoman i approached her and said i i hope he is better she uttered a scream and ran out of the room the next morning after having gone over everything in the house i sent for each servant and told them quietly but firmly that my sisters health was not very good and that i was housckeperthat as they had engaged to fill certain positions i should take it for granted they understood their business that i had neither the time nor would i take the trouble to overlook their work but that as soon as i saw any thing wrong they would hear from me if they wanted anything i was the person my housekeeping hours were from  till io a m no more if they could not take the trouble to ask for what they wanted at that time they could go without till the next day i should not tell them what to do or when to do it but if it wasnt done they would certainly leave that i allowed no company and gave them certain nights to go out but if anything special and true was the matter i was ready to assist  and now said i no quarreling down stairs each one to their work and no complaining the moment you are discontented come to me and you can go at once if you choose i do not want any notice ever except where a baby is concerned this done i then ad vertised for a cook the next day my   cook down sitairs came up to me quite flushed and wanted to know if i intended to turn her away i said no i had no idea of it but thought i was a very good plan to have two in the house  that i intended making the new one a waiter and then it anything happened such as thesud den departure  of my cook i said look ing right at her  for you know they are quick tempered why then i have one on hand she colored up and retired after going through a great deal of nonsense about the words help an d  servants i at length got what i wanted and all went on smoothly for a time my plan for detecting neglect in the cleaning of a room was to stick halfa doz en pins in different places about itsome on the walls in the window and other places that ought to be wiped if i found  them there after the cleaning i became suddenly very disagreeable during my sisters administration i had i been obliged to wait sometimes three weeks  before she could find time for her servants  to put a button on my waistcoat now when i wanted anything done the first  person that passed my library door was stopped no matter what htr work might be at the time sent for a clothes brush needle or hammar and tie thing was done at once it acted like a liarm and all went on well at first they objected only si lently but i told them plainly that i hired them for my benefit not theirs which generally followed and that though their work was specified to a certain degree they must on all occasions answer any calls and pay always for breakage this last saved twentydollars a month for hardly anything under those expensive circumstances fell   out of their hands and i noticed the plea of  sudden change of weather or  some one must have disturbed it or that hor rid cat has been among those dishes and upset them or  twas cracked before be came as worn out as aphorisms of the past i was always very attentive to them when sick this tells in the long run on ser vants for they are very susceptible to a kind act out of placeindulgence howev er is soon forgotten i always made it a habit too to pay each servant something more a month than any one else that also acted wonderfully like a retainer but i distinctly told them i wanted my work done because it was paid for i asked no favors two other rules saved me much trouble when a girl said she couldnt do any set job on account of no time no mat ter what it was i always said  why thats all nonsense it only takes five minutes and not infrequently have i irritated them into doing almost impossibilities i never valued any cheap article under five dollars another great mistake is to find fault with a servant before any one have they done wrong go to your library and ring ioudlythat is half the battle then tell tie waiter to call the chambermaid and  ltnen speak you will find everything easy they have had time to reflect to weigh the pros and cons and have half thought themselves into submission never argue if you have the right exert it but never be unjust and above all believe me when i tell you that their feelings are exquisite on the subject of neglect let them once feel i a respect for you yet know you are deter mined to have anything done and a simple remark will lie like lead on their stomachand   i you will hear them talkinigof it down stairs e and using the bow anchor of firmness  he said so until it is done never change i your mind i remember once during that memorable interregnum of three months and in fact i the only time in my life did it happen  i had invited some very pleasant agreeable t and talented friends to spend the evening i ordered my supper in the morning and it t commenced to snow  i continued giving orders and it continued snowing and we kept at it very close on to each other  if anything the snow was a little ahead but i went on in the same way at the proposed time the gas was lit a lantern was placed on the piazza snow swept off the side gate unhung by the waiter man and a path made the snow piled high and the do nmestics began to give in or out i dont know which they doubted the proba bility of any one venturing out that  dread tful night a little later they began to talk among themselves of the improbability of any one coming i immediately ordered the gas turned up in full  the candles lit and the supper table laidevery dish put in its place empty to be filled at the proper timeall for discipline i had said it was to be done in the morning i then went up stairs and dressed my sister who had gained five pounds every week since her abdication met me in the drawing room dressed elegantly and with an encouraging air pressed my hand she did not dare to make a remark or the contract would have been violated but i thought i could de tect in her eye an acknowledgment of my success as i sauntered through the bril liantly lighted rooms rather depressed at     the nonarrival of my guests the waiter said thomas would like to speak to me i im mediately went to the star chamber and took an easy position  a knock this time  come in in walked thomas with his hat in his hand and bowing respectively he said  j have just come from the stable mr daubrey and thought you would like to know about the storm sir  what storm i exclaimed oh ou mean the snow storm yesis it still snow ing at that moment the window was crackling with the hail  yes sir and i thought id tell you that no one could come out tonight for a horse without a wagon could not walk one hun dred yards  thank you thomas give the bay mare more corn tomorrow and call henry henry the waiter came in expecting or ders to put away the clean things and lock up for it was ten and not a soul had arrived  order supper henry at eleven  for whom sir  for mewhat are you waiting for  how much sir said he in a bewilder ed air  all of it he looked anxious he could not clas sity me but discipline must be carried out so mary and i sat down to enough for     twentyfive persons who had never known the pangs of dyspepsia as soon as we had finished i ordered a large portion of it down stairs for the benefit of the servants and retired they all looked pleased and i was satisfied mrs phillips had the night mare at about two oclock before i took charge the allies of my i   d household were accustomed to cotne in at  all hours and sit up till they were toosleepy  to go to bed lboking the next morninglike wet blotting paper but that was soon stopped for the morning of my address to them i stated that the house was shut up at ten p inm and now and then it wasamus  ing to hear the door open as the clock struck  one night at about twelve as i was sitting at my desk in the library i heard someone trying to get in i knew it was the waiter who had slipped out without leave so i tuned out the gas put my head out of the window and said i know it must be a robbe for they are all in and seeing his torm i fired off my revolver overhead no servant ever tried again to enter by stealing in after hours when my sister kept house i suffered much for want of dishes during many days in the week there was very little variety sundays we had only potatoes and cold meat why i asked they must go to church my dear brother mondays one fry not even a roast it was washing day all the heat must be turned off from the oven for the boiler t he cook wouldnt have it roasted in front the only true way so no dessert could be baked tuesdays i could have no company for it was ironing day and the irons filled up the range and nothing extra could be made i submitted to my sister but now i had soup every day and whenever i saw anything very good in market i ordered it home and had it cook   ed strange isnt it with the sme range and the same cook before my reign we could not breakfast till nine the cook said that the milkman came so late during my reign we breakfasted at eight punctual ly for i supgested to her the propriety of rising at six instead of seven and letting him in on his first trip instead of taking the milk from him on his return my sister was obliged to tell her two or three days before hand that she was going to have company that she might have time to get j everything ready for dinner i frequently brought home two or three guests withfish and game in the sanme carriage and ordered it as the fourth course while partaking of soup on one occasion i brought in par tridges twenty minutes before dinner i went down stairs knowing she would be roused this time and flanked her by saying hannah you wont have time to pick those birdsso just draw them and skin them j want them roasted before she recov ered from her astonishment i had depart ed whenever a quarrel down stairs took place i never interfered as long as they did not talk loud but the next day it i noticed any one in the sulks or a tendency to let things go by i had the iurniture of one room changed to another this required i  all hands to work together and i made t them fly round so that when it was done they were only too happy to go to lunch r and rest and i could hear many a joke and a pleasant laugh rise from the kitchen table o one rainy evening as my sister and my  self were sitting in front of the wood fire is exactly two months since the famous con n tract and very much in the same position a   e and talking over everything but it a tind e knock was heard i said come in an d sabina entered looking very healthy and neati cannot say pretty though she had a good figure   i never asked questions on these occa sions i always made it difficult for them to talk in this to them gloomy room rthey had to stumble through themselves    can i speak to you sir  ertainly sabinago on j  have come to say sir thatthati have came to say sir that  a pause she lookd very guilty  thats right sabina you have come to say thati understandbutwhat have you come to say  i have come to say sir thatl have come to go sir i controlled myself she was an excel lent chambermaid understood my ways thoroughly and did her work well had  always been respectful to me and was very steady it would be a great loss but dts cipline must be preserved and my mind was at once made up ny sister looked surprised and sorry right out  well sabina when do you wish to go  on saturday sir oh how my sister wanted to speak but i looked at the tin box that held the con tract and she bit her lip very well sabina you have a perfect right to go when and where you please and i will take great pleasure in writing out an excellent character for you let me see dooking at my account book that is two weeks wages making   never make presents but as you are goirfg here is a ten dollar bill where would you like     your trunk carried tell me and i will send it by thomas saturday morning oh it isnt that sir said she  but but sir with the tears flowing rapidly  why what is the matter sabina the first question apart from business i had ever asked i dont want to leave you sir well that is strange then why do you business question im going sirim going sir tobe married and she burst into tears i congratulated myself on being a bach elor it conjugal affection produced such an effect oh thats it said  dryly well  hope you will be happy  but youve been so kind sir you lthere now stop i have only tried to be just said i looking exultingly at my smiling sister who took off a little gold stud and gave it to her with many wishes ot a happy life everything went on regularly as clock work there was a place for everything and everything in its place when the bell rang during dear marys sway it continued to ring ana on one occasion a friend niet me in the street and said  why william have you moved i replied no that we were very corn fortable where we were  why do you ask sthats very strange said he  we call ed yesterday at one oclock and rang for twenty minutes no one coming we con cluded you had left for europe  no i said feeling rather confused the waiter i believe is subject to sciatica   at times he is taken suddenly and cannot move and the reason we did not hear the bell i looked away as i said so his cries of pain are such that you cannot hearyour i self speak  now the door is answered before the first ring stops sounding for i arranged it so as to vibrate long enough to give a per son time to go from any part of the house in exactly tw minutes and no man of the world rings oftener than once every three minutes i would not have written all this but my blessed sister soon entirely followed out my retormation and is fairly convinced as she says that when a man sets about ay miatter he is very tlhorough clear headed and above all not easily llut down oh it all womnen thought so eh mr caudle i knew one learned gentleman who only desi ed pence and good food hs wife never allowed him to ofler a suggestion she called him a genius and made him mind formerly mary rose thoughttful with the pressure of business on her brain at meals she was abstracted often wor ried and at all times the repository oldo mestic troubles hei healthy organizal tion was altogether too mesmerized by the petty warfare below  stairs she was nevcr idle and yet rarely accomplished anything foi herself her position in the household might have been called that of grand finisherll she planned work and waited for its completion in vain fi nally she would bring it into the library and stitchstitchall through the pleas ant evenings i knew this for i laid a plan   one april i asked  her to   work me a pair of slippers on cloth i presume a clever woman undisturbed could have delivered them over to me at the end of the week now no one is more clever than my sister  yet i did not get those slippers till december and then she handed them to me in sadness and said with an attempt at cheerfuiluess  dear william i worked one myseltf but my duties are such that i gave out the other to that poor woman whose husband is at sea hasnt she done it well now i lind her reading paying visitsand often  of an evening she comes to me and says i william wouldnt you like some new handkerchiefs embroidered or cant i mend anything for you i have just fin ished miy music and have nothing to do on another occasion while she was mendingnot making readerbut mend ing her childrens clothes i offered to read one of ik marvels revaries of a bachelor a special favorite of mine she thanked me and i proceeded onfinishing one of his admirable paragraphs i put the book down and exclaimed  isnt that capital she said at once  no i think it is very  discolraging di scouraging why what in the i world do you mean mary  excuse me william but i wasnt lis i tening the fact of it is there has been another row down stairs and i do think that girl ought to be ashamed of herself to treat susan so  and then for one hour t a tolpographical and analytical history of i the entire household was gone into with t a con anmore spirit which lasted through i two segars and a glass of water i never t spoke on these occasions they dont t   i want you to talk only to listen they  say in a weet nd confidingmanneu t now i have no one to sympalthize with me  and offthey go like the recitation of topels homer made by some school girl iwho has been sentenced to ruin through so many lines   i sliped the reveries into their place so that she would not be hurt and i do assure you that when she  had got through i believe if you had asked hei suddenly    ho discovered america shle would have eplied  an irishman i thforget his lname formerly  thiere was evei a business igraiity asbout her  now she alweys p peared with a sweet smile that lit up her teomintenanne as though it had

to outlast six of those in oldentimes     when i first took charge of the kitchen the cook laide one strugglebut only one thte iely to her question indicated uelic iglnomi a e or inldifference on my part that everything suggested in future was served as directed and well done having or deied mamny dishes one dayi dont know whether it was washing or ironing day i never used to ask i also gave the

portance of one who had much to do and no time to lose i was greatly angered by his rudeness but feeling very like a wet rag was obliged to submit in silence strength having for saken me when he had filled his basket with shoes bones and pieces of calico tak ing a long bag from his shoulder and opening its mouth he seized me very roughly with my companions and forced us into it as it was very old and presented the appearance of hav   ofp a latin reader     ing been used for many years my reader will not be surprised at hear ing it was my good fortune to be pushed half out of a hole in the side which though it rendered my position very uncomfortable gave me a fine opportunity of seeing everything that transpired the old man having filled both basket and bag proceeding on his way for some time at length turned down a narrow alley where some dirty children halfnaked were playing in the gutter with some small pieces of wood which they had made into little boats passing on a few steps he entered a large brick house where i heard a great noise as if some machi nery were in operation  here he deposited me with my companions on        t hi e a o uti obr o ox   ah y the foor and receiving his mdoney left on looking around me i saw many other rags near by and immediately began to question them with regard to the house what it was and why i was brought there they told me we were to be thrown into the machine i heard thundering with so much noise which would make paper of us and then we were to be taken to a printing iestablishment they said they knew no more and that they had obtained this information from an old piece of newspaper that had been picked up in the streets with them for when it saw the machinery immediately recog nizing the place it told them with a shudder and in a whisper what   of a latin reader      their fate would be as it was evening when i arrived there nothing particu lar occurred but the next morning i was selected with my companions who were of the same color white and was brought before the fearful monster who in the course of a few minutes cut us into very small pieces we were then put into an elliptical tub and water was poured on us in order to wash off the particlesof dirt and render us of spotless purity after this a large hole being made in the tub by removing a plug we were very soon carried through it by the water into a reservoir and from that drawn off into a vat then a large cylinder covered with a fine wire cloth stopped our progress with            the autobiography its sharp claws and turning round the fibrous particles adhered to it and as the water ran off being pressed between two woolen cloths we became paper we were then hung out on a line until we should become dry after remain ing for some time in this situation we were taken in reams and put in a cart which carried us to a printing office where we were left more dead than alive   of a latin reader      chapter ii my education i do not think that i ever suffered as much agony in my life as when i was cut in pieces i have been cut by my friends and have suffered considerably from it but to be chewed up by ones enemies without being able to defend ones self is almost too painful to be borne on the day that i was to be printed i was taken up with a great many other papers and placed on a stand near the printing press which as far as i was able to judge con sisted of some wood work around a cylinder which was covered with        the autobiography types i knew that in a few minutes my character would be formed and my course of life truly marked out but as to what i would be i could form no idea i had a great desire to be a book of deep research that would be con sulted by the great men of the times fill the young mind with useful infor mation arouse the weary influence the old and do honor to my country while on the stand near the printing press i fell into a revery of a peculiar nature i thought if i came out a novel there would be a very large family of us numbering about one thousand the first generation of course we would be purchased by rich and poor young and old  alas how eagerly the poor who often deny   of a latin r eader     themselves the necessaries of life to procure novels having purchased one of us go into a corner of their old shanty and there having sat down upon a broken stool spell out the words day after day until they have read from cover to cover two or three times this is often done by poor persons instead of laboring honestly for their food and when affliction and destitution approach with fearful strides they rouse themselves as if from a trance surprised that they are in such want again i  thought of the rich who can afford the money for novels but not the time riding to a book store in their carriages they ask if there are any new novels out        the autobiography and having received an answer in the affirmative purchase the book and return to their homes to waste hours in the perusal of a work that can do them no earthly good but on the con trary corrupt their hearts by infusing what may be justly termed moral poison as i was thinking what good i might do if i were a history the machinery seized hold of me and in a moment i was turned round and round that huge cylinder reader imagine my astonishment when hav ing received a stamp my brain was instantly filled with latin verbs pre positions adverbs and conjunctions my knowledge of roman antiquities was extensive fables i knew by the hundred and as to anecdotes i could   oof a latin reader     repeat them by the hour i now felt happy that i was printed for a higher class of persons than novelreaders i felt proud of my situation our family consisted of about five hundred and we were destined for all parts of the united states having ascertained that my title was to be latin reader i began to look about me to see how the characters of my friends had been formed one had become a latin grammar i therefore determined to cultivate his acquaintance another a novel by dumas i scorned such company and tried to get out of the way but could not considering it far beneath me to associate with persons of such a low character to describe the different changes that had taken i       the autobiography place among my friends would be tire some as well as superfluous suffice it to say some had become histories others arithmetics mythologies etc my young friend you talk of trials in your bright and sunny days you complain of the difficulty of learning to read you call your kind teacher all sorts of names because forsooth owing to your own negligence you have not at the proper time prepared your lesson but what can you say now think of my sufferings while unable to move think of the agony i must have endured while in the jaws of that giant masticator what say you to my feelings when informa tion truly of great value was literally crammed into my head willing or not   of a latin reader     by the mammoth press some day when you have time visit one of his dens listen to his roaring breathing and unearthly hissing see with what a sudden clutch he grasps his prey and in one moment whirls him round and round until exhausted he falls lifeless on the heap of other victims when you return to your cheerful home make up your mind to cease from imagining that your lot as a schoolboy is the hardest in the world conclude that there are others who have more to bear and less to be thankful for and endeavor to cheer those around you treating every com panion with consideration though it be only a latin reader having remained in this condition       the autobiography for several days on a side shelf in one corner of the room i was roused one morning from a drowsy feeling that had come over me by seeing a little man with a very large head enter the room coming up to where i was with my companions he shouldered us and went down stairs to a side door out of which he emgrged and pro ceeded on his way through curious lanes and filthy streets until arriving at the cellar of a large house he entered and laid us on the table full of anxiety but in better spirits than when confined in the dreadful cage of the rageater     oaf a la tin hread deit   chiapter iii my tailor and boardinghouse i very soon ascertained that this place was a bookbinding establish ment and rejoiced inwardly that i would soon be dressed in a nice suit of clothes it would take too much time and would also be very tedi ous were i to enter into all the details of binding suffice it to say that after undergoing a great deal of beating sewing and pasting i found myself bound in very neat cloth and surrounded by other books dressed       t h r a u ot o t i ap th y likewise in a very respectable style we were then taken upstairs and given to the clerks of the establish ment who arranged us il different parts of the large and spacious room i had the good fortune to be placed by the side of my old fiiend the latin grammar and was also near some works on geography  this pleased me greatly for whenever i felt lonely by conversing with my companions i would thereby derive not only amuse ment but information of all my fiiends i considered my neighbor the latin grammar as the most inseparable and useful for whenever i did not know how a verb was governed or why a certain noun was in the dative case upon asking my friend i received   the a utobiography     the answer that was necessary to explain it day after day i remained in the store never hearing my name men tioned by any one until finally i began to give up all ideas of ever leaving it this was not because our owner had no customersfar from it for with his clerks he was kept busy all day packing up and selling books but it was because i was not the kind of book in demand the taste of the public differed from mine many and many a time have i seen my scorned associate dumas noved put up in white paper and sold to all classes of society until i almost envied his situation and would have been willing to have given myinformation and superior education       of a lati n reader for this work for a day but what was my delightmy rapturewhen one afternoon just as the gas had been lighted and the streets were becoming deserted by the busy people a little boy with an open countenance and pretty features on entering the store asked the clerk if he had any latin readers his reply was in the affir mative whereupon taking me down from the shelf he showed me to the little fellow who requested him to put me up in paper saying he would take me the clerk asked him if he did not wish a latin grammar also as they generally went togethei he said no that he had one at home and picking me up left the store   the autob iograp hy    chapter iv my new home while my little owner was proceed ing on his way i beganto think in what manner i could repay him for his kindness in rescuing me from that dull shelf where i had lain so long but before i could arrive at any conclusion he ran up the steps of a very hand some house and taking a key from his pocket opened the door and went in my little master appeared to be in fine spirits at the idea of studying latin for with a glistening eye and proud step he entered the library and sitting down by the fire on a little ottoman             i       of a latin reader began to examine me when the bell ringing for tea i presume he jumped up and putting me on the table left the room  now having plenty o time for observation i determined t look around me and see where i was and in what respect this room differe from my former residence the first object of interest that caugh my eye was the oldfashioned fireplac with tiles and the andirons of polishei brass seemed from their aged and wor appearance to have supported man a pine knot during cold winter and t have lighted up the countenances  laughing children on christmas ev while hanging their stockings on tl fender to be filled with goodies an toys then again what a fine lar    the a u tobiography     chimney for santa claus to come down it appeared to be just the one he would choose so nice and warm and so spacious that he might descend without even soiling his clothes or breaking his toys and as the fire cast glimmering shadows on the wall it occurred to me that this was the room for ghost stories or spinning yarns on looking up above the mantlepiece i made out by the uncertain light of thefire a picture of a wreck there was the storm at sea the raging bil lows threatening to engulph in an instant the little boat with the surviv ing crew a  flock of sea gulls was hovering overhead with wondering eyes now darting down with sudden sweep now shooting by as if in w       the autobiography sport a shark here and there mov ing with his cold and slimy body waiting for his evening meala rare treatgood flesh and blood  the clouds themselves seemed anxious to conceal the spectacle from mortal gaze a little infant clung as if by instinct to a huge newfoundland that was looking with a tender zeal for one he could not find his master the dis masted vessel at a distance was sink ing and all was gloomy what a vast difference thought i is there between that scene and the one before me there misery and a cold cold yawning grave and here every com fort and a warm fire books to in struct and amuse ease and elegance for mind and body a cheerful twink t   of a latin reader     ling and suggestive firelight ashes and cinders that would assume any shape to please a thoughtful intellect or assist a romantic contemplation how thankful ought those persons to be who enjoy such blessings on turning round to see in what manner the room was furnished i be held a long row of oakcolored book cases filled with rare and choice works bound in different styles and as i looked i thought that the possessor of such a study must be a man of learning and of taste and i earnestly hoped it would be my good fortune to be placed in the company of such books while thus cogitating i was roused from my dreamy mood by the r        th e au tobiog aphy voice of my little owner who came into the room with his father and taking me up showed me to him the old gentleman for such he was and one of the old school too having taken a seat placed the candle nearer to him and after looking at some of my anec dotes put me back again on the table and said to his son arthur you know that your pa rents have at length decided that it will be better for you to study in the country than to stay here and attend day school for there are so many temptations and besides as your sister is going into company this winter your attention would be drawn from your studies and you would not make as much progress as   of a latin reader     at a boarding school and moreover my dear boy going to boarding school makes a man of you and you will learn to take care of yourself very well dear father said the little boy im willing but where do you intend sending  me  do send me on christmas a nice sledge and get uncle john to have a pair of skates for me on new years my dear boy we have at length concluded to send you to mr birchs school where you will be taken care of and wil receive a good education and now if you will tell me what things you desire i will purchase them for you you will start tomorrow afternoon in the boat and will arrive there at halfpast seven oclock in the       the autobiography evening write me word as soon as you get there arthur enumerated all the things he wished having talked together for some time his father finished by tell ing him to study hard all the term until the holidays and then he might surprise the family by the extent of his knowledge he also told him to try and resist all temptations he  should meet with arthur promised faithfully to fol low in every respect his fathers kind advice andc bidding him a affection ate good night left the library to seek repose on his downy couch   of a latin reader     chapter v arthurs schoolprospects soon overcome by fatigue i fell into a pleasant sleep in which condition i remained until i was awakened in the morning by the waiter coming in to open the shutters and dust the room nothing particla happened during the morning when about  oclock my friend came running into the room and taking me up went up stairs to his bed room where the servants were packing away his mother giving many directions the little canaries singing as it were a fond farewell and arthur busy doing nothing but think       the autobiography ing great things full of the conse quence of a young traveler having ascertained that there was nothing more to go in his trunk he put me in closed the lid and locked it leaving me to get on as well as i could in the darkness as it was very com fortable where i was and as i knew in a little while i should be exercised frequently and handled very roughly by my owner  moreover as i was con fident it would require great strength of constitution to go through so much fatigue i determined to take every opportunity of laying in a good store of health and therefore went to sleep i am unable to say how long i slept but when i awoke i found myself in a small chilly room with a double bed   of a latin reader     and a cot three chairs a basin stand i should say the remains of one a pitcher without a handle and a basin with a piece knocked out which hole seemed to show high water mark the window was small consisting of six panes of glass which were so dirty and one especially was so patched with strips of brown paper that it seemed to me that the window had been combating with aeolus and one of its limbs being broken in the en gagement the poor schoolmaster not having funds sufficient to justify him in sending for a chirurgeon to ampu tate the shattered fragments and sub stitute another in its place was there fore obliged to plaster it himself endeavoring to make it heal by the       the autobiography first intention there was no carpet on the floor but a small rug lay by the bedside it was early in the morning when i awoke and seeing no one i concluded that the boys were at breakfast it was not long however before my little friend came in putting me under his arm with a slate and geogra phy he went into the schoolroom it was a large room filled with rows of desks a peculiar murmur could be heard keeping time with the fluttering hearts of the little scholars every thing looked like business there was nothing that seemed at all calculated to distract your attention one would almost study to relieve his mind from dreams many maps were hanging nc   of a latin reader     the walls and a large blackboard stood near the window where the teacher with many excited gesticula tions was trying in vain to explain a problem to a thin boy who with a look of despair agreed with him in every point but when it came his turn to explain it after making many use less marks on the board with his chalk was sent to his seat marked deficient leaning against the wall behind a large mahogany desk sat a little with ered man with red hair a pair of green spectacles on his hooked nose a rod in his hand hearing some little boys recite ihis was no less than mr birch the lord of the creation monarch of all he surveyed arthur the moment he cast his eyes        the autobiography on his highness trembled and going up to him presented his fathers letter the clouds that had gathered on his brow disappeared and in their place a smile came which contrasted with the mans visage seemed to me no less than a contradiction of his real character my little friend would you like to know exactly how this learned tyrant looked well i will tell youdid you ever see those little india rubber men whose faces you can squeeze into any shape such was his full of flesh no expression save dull anger in other words mr birch thought it best to secure his prey first and then he could do as he pleased so having asked arthur how he had slept during the night and telling him to take a   of a latin reader     seat he read the letter having fin ished the perusal he asked him if he understood latin and whether he could read greek receiving an answer in the negative he seemed surprised at first but instantly checking himself said never mind if you apply your self to your studies you will soon un derstand them having set arthur a lesson in the latin grammar he put me in the desk which my owner was to occupy i remained there i should think for nearly three months seeing daylight only when the desk was opened by my owner to get a history an arithmetic or a spellingbook but i did not however waste this time in sleeping i carried on many conversa tions with the arithmetic who having       the autobiography been kind enough to introduce me to his friend the slate by whose aid i was instructed in mathematics i thereby gained a great deal of infor mation on that subject   of a latin reader     chapter vi my sufferings one day arthur took me to his master and a lesson being set he began to study it was not long however before he found out the difficulty of the construction of latin i date my misfortunes firom this day not being able to find out the derivation of a certain word instead of quietly looking it out in my dictionary if he could not find it out instantly he would throw me on the desk turn over my cover write and draw all kinds of pictures on my fly leaves and end by pitching me  o        the autobiogr aphy headforemost into his desk which i am sorry to say was in great confusion the treatment i received ren dered my appearance hideous in the extreme my selfrespect had vanished my interest in surrounding objects no longer called forth investigation and i longed for retirement no matter where could i but be fieed from such abuse once while i was doing my best to assist arthur in his classical pursuits a tall thin haired pale boy came up to him and began to teaze it was very hot in fact so excessive that my stays had nearly given way arthur tried to send him away but not succeeding in either removing this nuisance or making out a sentence seized me and with a sudden hurl vanquished his   of a latin reader     enemy at my expense sending me fly ing to the end of the room i now ceased to care even for my owner my life did not pay while on the floor i saw a fly playing tag with its companions in the sunshine why oh why had i not been born a fly envy sorrow  desperation over came my  selfpossession and i remained senseless i know not how long it would not do were i to relate all my trodbles and state the different abuses i received from my little owner but i will assert that when the summer vacation arrived  had lost one cover my back had been broken and my pages were so dirty and dogeared that i was fain com         the autobiography paring myself with what i was to exclaim with eneas hei rili qualis erat quantim mutatus ab illo hectore   alas poor boys  i was a boy once and can feel for you there is indeed no trial in a students life equal to the first effort of making out that cartbeforethehorseconstruction of latin it seems impossible though you may understand every rule to comprehend the idea that a writer in his sound mind can intentionally write backwards forwards and some times not at all arthur previous to his leaving mr birchs for the summer having ascer tained that he would no longer need   of a latin reader      me but that in the following fall he should study csesar took me  one afternoon down a side street in the town and selling me for a mere trifle to a bookseller who kept a stall at the corner of a street left me to my fate without seeming to feel the loss of so valuable a friend as i had been to him such is gratitude poor me my mode of living now changed i n o longer felt a desire to mix with the world or vie with other works  my spirits if i had any left were entirely crushed and my appearance being anything but pre possessing i felt that it was doubt ful whether i should ever leave this stall so perched upon the top shelf i determined to watch the coun       the autobiography tenances of those who came to pur chase and form an idea of their char acters and habits of life in my mind the stall was attached to the side of a house in one of those crooked by lanes crossing a main street by this means i had an opportunity of seeing everythingbut a policeman  the first set of features i made a study of were those of my immediate owner a redfaced scotchman whose heavy boots and cutaway coat seemed to have formed a conspiracy to abandon a lonely pair of rough dirtcolored corded pants that in their turn made up their mind to shrink within them selves and leave others to their fate there was no waistcoat but a shirt of any hue but white clung from ap   of a latin rea be     parent weakness to the soggy form of this rough old fellow i was much amused at his hat a sleepless piece of pasteboardfor the nap had long  since left itheld together by a band of crape this hat never left the head of the same redfaced man at least i never saw him remove it save to unfurl a huge variegated mutually redfaced hand kerchief it was a curious sight to see how the scotchman would change the position of his books to catch the eye of some stray pedestrian strange the manner in which he would empty a shelf as though the books had been sold absurd the way he pretended to read with shortsighted spectacles when a visitor approached as though        t it ni u t o i o  i a y not at all concerned after a while i liked the old man lie exhibited talent hie seldom got angry but he never took off his price for anybody punctual to the striking of the old church clock he took down his shut ters and  aired his books as i have heard him say moreover the great est care was taken of even the oldest work you would have liked him per haps you have seen him if you know him buy one book for my sake i mean for his he has two sick children his wife is dead and he himself could find use for the little you might bestow   op a latin reader     chapter vii visitors one day i saw approaching with a feeble gait pale and careworn visage sunken cheeks and a wearied eye a country clergyman with a book under his arm and umbrella in his hand addressing my owner lie asked him if he had in his possession cecils re mains and if so whether he would be willing to exchange it for the book which he showed him and a small amount of money the manner of this gentleman and the longing look he gave to his old friend caused me to suppose he was not rich enough to       the autobiography keep both books and having gleaned all the information he could from this work was obliged to part with it in order to procure that which might aid him in writing his sermons having settled with my owner to his satisfaction he passed on and gave place to a customer quite the reverse in appearance and manner with a firm noble countenance clear eye and elastic step coming up to where mr redface stood i never knew his name this gentleman aked in an independ ent though polite way if he had among his collection any voyages or travels on hearing that he had plenty on hand he asked to see them and bought acerbie lithgow carver anson and dambridge and telling   o i  l a t atin reade   my master to keep for him all the voyages and travels he might meet with took out a handful of money paid him and left i could not help thinking asi saw this gentleman depart how strong the contrast was between the poor parish clergyman and himself  how  one devoted all his life means and intel lect to converting sinners and in return received barely enough to live on while this young man free from cares and troubles could purchase books of travels return home and sitting probably in front of his fire in his study would read of mariners and of unfortunate beings wrecked on desolate islands without sufficient to support them for a day hearing his       t he autobiogiraphy dinner bell ring he would go down to a sumptuous repast leaving the ship wrecked to exist on half a biscuit and a pint of water how curious is the dispensation of providence how differently persons are placed in this life oh how thankful ought we to be in hearing the same invitation for rich and poor young and old what a comfort truly to the poor man unto whom much is given from him much shall be required  n p p   of a latin reader     chapter

blessings one rening i never shall forget it after had been locked up and bound in r shutters and bars i heard the fire ring ri rinring and in a few oments windows were raised and rsons inquiring where the fire was ssed by with hurried steps soon       the autobiography the engine was heard and that dread ful cry of fire was sounded in front of my stall presently the crevices of the shutters were lighted up and the flames crept in and out like snakes darting hither and thither with frantic twistings in one corner of my berth i heard a deep groan emanating from a burning book in dying agonies it crumbled and rolled down i looked and beheldthe envied novel writh ing in agony and contrition i shut my eyes and shuddered  water at length deluged my little place of abode and a crash followed my stall being shivered to pieces by a falling wall i lay on the pavement until the following evening half burnt and soaked with water my memory nearly   of a latin riade  gone a little boy passing quietly by picked me up and carrying me to his fathers house laid me on the table telling his brother he intended to make me into a tail for his kite but the next morning before he was up the waiter coming into the room tore me in pieces and rolling and twisting me with his hands built the parlor fire with me and it was during the fol lowing night that i wrote my life with my ashes on the

his tongue contracted in his mouth he did merrily warble itat the same time placing his two medicinal fingers in his mouth against either jaw he did clack them together very melodiously chanting and chirping after the manner of swans and other fowl so that all they present were greatly pleased and marvelled thereat thinking that by these sounds he did mean to convey and give them to understand

pray you good counsellorl hereupon interlocuted the chief justi ciar i think we comprehend you fully in this matter and albeit   it would be matter of delectation to hear you further herein i  think you may now make an ending of your discourse for we  have already consumed much timeso make an ending i pray  you hereupon the counsellor on being thus interlocuted by the chief justiciar did assume a very dolorous visage at the same time ghibbering anti shivering with his chaps as apes use to do when in cholerfor he was mightily aggrievedbut albeit think ing better of the matter he thus spake by way of ending well then i submit myself to your worshipful lordships good pleasure and volitions herein and will pursue mine argument no fur ther though i might say much more and to the point but in good sooth i think that i have spoken plainly of the letter and history of the factum and made myself sufficiently clear and perspective in properly placing the case before you and of a verity it lieth all as it were in a cocoa nut as plain an it please your lordships as flies in a milkpot and therefore my lords i do most humbly require that by your lordships there may be without further re moras or hindrance said and declared upon the case what is rea sonable with costs damages and interests for we are here at great charge and then a day was given to the parties aforesaid to hear in open view of all the people the definitive sentence and judgment of the said the lords justiciarn      at which time and place came the parties aforesaid with their friends retainers solicitors counsellors and advocates and the constabularii and tipstaffs having administered the estrapado to such of the commonalty as had intruded too tumultuously with in the precincts and sacred enclosures of the said court of jus tice the said lord chief justiciai owlet accompanied by the mem bers of the worshipful judicatory did thereupon rising up say unto his compeers coadjutors and assessors as follows well my masters ye have heard read and spoken the ac  cusations mandates delegations replies triplies grievances denunciations declinatories anticipatores arguments and  other suchlike conceits and spiceries both of the one and the  other side in this dissension and debatewhat think ye then of the various and seeming contraries in law that are  laid claim to and advanced by the suitors and pleading parties and they made answer unto him  we have in truth heard them andhave well sententiated and pondered thereupon but  have not so much as understood one iota scintilla or corpus  culum of this whole matter therefore then we do beseech  you una voce to lighten our labor in this behalf and such  judgment to give therein as to you seemeth meet  well my masters responded heas i do not truly find    the case so difficult i will obey your behest and will no longer  delay defer prorogate or shift off the definitive sentence in  this process and i do well hope that all will be content and notincensed irritated and exasperated to a higher point of discord and polemicity than ever they were at before and thereupon the said chief justiciar did doff his cap and salute the company with such majestic grace as became a person of his paramount degree and eminency ahid walk a turn or two groaning profoundlyand did sigh exceeding heavilyat the same time blowing like a goose with the intensity of his ratiocination and then having returned he sat down and did lift up his eyes heavenward and then turned them into his head again like a she goat when ill at ease and at length began to pronounce sentence clearly and stentoriphonically having well considered and patiently digested the law gallus     the law quinquepedem the law vinumn the law mulier bona and the law nulla bona the law si quis and the law quidquid and the law chawquid the law auromercuriale the law digitalis the law of seizen and the law of reason the law meum and the law tuum and lastly having well and truly analyzed and considered the bearing of the codus or code hereinat which last of a truth my brains were metragobolised and confounded i do hold by an abnegation of both extremeswith father hippothadeus and doctor rumbellicus that as to so much of the plaint as chargeth the respondents with attempting to usurp the functions of the c primun mobile or exasperate the influences of the dolor in its vacellations and variations in its peculiar orbit that the same is unproven and cacodoxical and that the respondents may go thereof without day but that such part of the case as pointeth or hath reference to the respondents neglect of the laws meum and tuunm and their proclivity to the law asinaria and such part as treateth of the capacites of bellua cornuta to wax oleaginous or mucillagenous upon seaweed in the mare clausurn and not the mare turgido or turbato is severally substantiated and well taken and found testing also the truth of this matter by hydromancy le chinamancy reputed of old among the assyrians and feminofancy held of such account by the emperor heliogobalus and by the scratching of my own left auricular and the pricking or titillation of my two thumbs or polices as jehorax king of mesopotamia was wont to do dum venerit judicarei do fatidically conclude that egiptianus although philospohically nihil yet is legally su perior and morally less putrescent than oswindleman the hi bernianand his opinion in this matter entitled to more consid eration and weight i do further hold that the promovents were justified in the proposition by them adduced and advocated that by the disuse of spectacles the ocular propensities of the testudo or lobster were substantially impaired and that the maxim of confucius  ubi jus ibi remedium in such case is pertinent and applicable for non constat saith foster in his treatise on fleabites but that crustacea may require such adventitious translucency or artificial paraphanoptic application as doth the homo qui ex humo producitur which said decision and opinion having been pronounced there       arose from the midst of all them there present as well as of the law as of the laity a great murmur of approbation and assent such as had never before came to passin any court or tribunal so were they ravished and delected by this so admirabled and pellucid decision and disposal of this so long protracted matter and the altercation and heat of the promovents and respondents beingmuch abateddeclining from their former strife they did instantly come to a firm accommodation of their differences while all the multitude retiring from the presencegat them to their homes marvelling at the wisdom of the great justiciar and with one consent confessing that there was no exercise sport game play or recreation in all this palatine palatial or parliamentary world more aromatising and fragrant than a suit or process well vanned and winnowed tossed and canvassed precisely narrowly and neatly garbled

fountain and the station house it was between two and three oeclock in the morning the heavy swell of the vast sea of new york city life had subsided into a calm and its restless waves of bustle labor and feverish excitement were for a moment still the streets were deserted and no sounds broke their silence save perhaps an echoing footfall of some pedes trian overcome with surprise at the lateness of the hour and hasfening anxiously home or the clear ring on the pavement of the club of some policeman faithfully on the watch at his post on the sidewalk in park row opposite the fountain a solitary person was standing with his eyes fixed in eager inquiry on the illuminated clock which surmounts the       the fountain and the station house top of the city hall his features were pale and a shade of despair seemed to pass over them as turning his gaze from the scrutiny of the hour and suffering his head to drop on his breast he muttered to himself home i cannot go it would be in vain i cannot wander in the streets and yet there is a fearful mystery about me which brings me a rude repulse whichever way i turn but necessity knows no law and i will try once more and the young man for he was evidently in the flower of his life turned his steps towards one of the many hotels which surrounded the spot where he stood the doors were closed and with a tremulous touch he pulled the handle of the bell after a few moments de lay the bolt was withdrawn and the young man found himself standing face to face with the halfawakened por ter who even through the mists of sleep cast a suspicious glance on the visitor if you please said the youfig man hesitatingly j should like to have a bed for the night the eyes of the porter had by this time dilated into full consciousness and taken in the whole form and fea ture of the person of the applicant nohavnt any room besides when i look at you i know youyoure known all over new york you cant come in and with this gruff salutation the por ter gave the young man a shove more remarkable for its force than its politeness and which placed him on the wrong side of the door to discover at the same instant that it was slammed in his face   the fountain and the station house      again i again exclaimed the young man as he rushed across the street  what does it can it all mean what is the mystery which marks me for its victim and entering the park he threw himself on a bench by the fountain and buried his face in his hands halloo neighbor get up and move home said a burly personage with a brass star on his breast as he came up to the bench and roughly shook its occupant hands off answered the young man springing up and for the first time evincing some spirit i have com mitted no offence have a right to stay or go where i please and am a gentleman thats a good one returned the bearer of the star with a broad laugh a gentleman indeed when you are as well known in new york as trinity church stee ple i know you my man so come along with me for your impudence its my belief from your appearance that you are prowling about for no good with a groan of despair the victim of a mysterious mark which seemed to brand him as with fire yielded to his fate and five minutes afterwards was thrust into one of the dark cells of the station house the moments seemed ages as he tossed in agony on the wretched pallet of his prison officer i for the love of heaven let me out of this horrid place he cried aloud shut up and keep quiet or it will be worse for you was the only response the gloom of his prison house deepened thicker        the fountain and the station house around the air became more stifling and overpowering and the victim sank senseless on the floor daylight streamed into the station house and the offi cials began to stir themselves halloo i rouse up here and come along said one of them opening the door of the cell and looking in the victim of the mysterious mark had recovered from his swoon and was now sitting in a halfupright position he arose without making a reply and followed the offi cer with some twenty other prisoners of the night it was a large square apartment to which the officer led his train the main characteristics of the room were dingy walls and a dirty floor the upper end was divi ded off by a wooden railing behind which on a lowplat form rose a long counterlike desk flanked by three arm chairs covered with leather in the middle chair sat a portly wellconditioned man on whose broad and rubi cund face the rays of the morning sun streaming through the window fell red and mellow a person of less mag nitude of bulk and flower of feature was seated at a smaller desk placed on the floor beside the platform the large man was a magistrate and the small one was his clerk the open space without the railing was crowded with a heterogeneous mass of men women and even childrenthe refuse of the streets of new york which the police had swept up during the night the air of the room was redolent of every other perfume but that of roses and the confusion of tongues was as loud and discordant as that of babel thus was the morning   the fountain and the station house      justice of new york seated on its throne and thus was the misery and crime of the night arraigned before it to hear its mandates the eye ofthe magistrate fell first on the victim of the mysterious mark officer what is the charge against this man said he covering at the same time the victimwith a scrutinizing glance drunk principally and taken up on suspicion gener ally answeredthe officer with reference to the intoxication your honor the charge is false meekly replied the victim as for taking me up on suspicion the officer is undoubtedly right for he had no other ground however unjust that may be on which he could pretend to molest me  i am a respect able man keep a store at no  in  street my name is    i have committed no offence and i ask to be discharged my friend returned the magistrate cc there is a cer tain mark about you that would justify any officer in ar resting you by night or day i have recently heard of a number of men of your description about town the fact is they are too prevalent in this community at the present time for their own or the public good however as this is the first time you have been before me even if you were a little elevated as the officer says you may go officer bring up the next prisoner the victim went forth into the street his breast tor tured with agony on account of the indignity and suffer         the fountain and the station house ing which he had undergone during the night and his brain in a fever of excitement in the endeavor to imagine what could be the fatal mark of mystery and misfortune which seemed to be fixed upon him   chapter ii the landladythe cutand the theatre the victim of the mark hastened with nervous steps to his boarding house the landlady a maiden of some fifty years with features of a geometrical description in which acute angles prevailed met him at the door fine time of night to come home was the greeting she gave him but no matter youll do me a favor to find another boarding house i can accommodate you no longer the rest of my boarders declare that if a man with such a mark about him as you carry remains any longer in the house theyll leave thats all i have to say thats quite enough mrs smith answered the vic tim assuming a dignity which he forced up with effort from the deep well of his mortification i never stay where i am not wanted i disdain to ask you what is the mark to which you refer although i am unconscious of possessing any repulsive or evil one send your boy        the landlady the cut and the theatre to my store at eleven oclock with your bill and i will settle it and he ascended to his room the victim washed his hands with deliberation or rather with desperation packed up his wardrobe returned again to the street and called a carman two hours af terwards he had arranged the attic of his store for his bedroom and determined henceforward to take his meals at an eating house the day was fine and bright and after paying with an air of satisfaction the little boy who waited with mrs smiths bill the victim left his store and walked towards wallstreet he had not pro ceeded two blocks when he met a hale welldressed old gentleman whose whole appearance gave evidence that wealth and ease had taken him into their embrace good morning my dear sir said the victim reach ing out his hand and accosting the old gentleman with the concentration of cordiality beg your pardon sir but you have the advantage of me have not the honor of your acquaintance or of any person of your appearance and the old gentleman drew himself to his full standard of height and passed on the victim looked after the retreating form in blank astonishment is it possible he exclaimed to himself striking his forehead as if to drive from it the solution of the mystery  that man is in my store every day has bought hundreds of dollars worth of goods from me and now in the street he gives me the cut directwhat can be the accursed and proscribed mark which i bear and the victim again in despair returned to his store    the landlady the cut and the theatre  he had not been there ten minutes when the identical old gentleman who had cut him in the street entered greeted him pleasantly and asked to look at some cloth for a coat the victim was a cloth dealer the goods were produced and while the customer was examining the cloth the seller alluded incidentally to having met him in the street the customer remarked that he had no recollection of such meeting the only person he recol lected having noticed was a man who presumed to claim acquaintance with him on what ground he knew not and who was one whom from his appearance even lad he known him he could not possibly have recognised in a public thoroughfare without risking his reputation as a gentleman blacker and blacker grew the mystery around the vic tim of the fatal mark and in the tumult of his agitation he cutoff five instead of four yards of cloth for his cus tomer it was night and to drown his bitter reflections the victim took his way to the theatre the house was crowded the play was sterling the actors entered into the spirit of the scene and the victim resting his elbows on his knees resigned himself to the illusions of the play he was aroused from his pleasing reverie by the loud and ominous cry from the pit of  hustle him out hustle him out and he soon became aware that he was the person meant for a sea of eyes was turned towards him and the rough shake of a hand was upon him he remon strated at the outrage words ran high again a brass star     the landlady the cut and the theatre made its appearance and before he knew it he had much against his will and by no means leisurely accompanied the star into the street and was there told to go about his business   chapter iii the attic and the maiden the victim sat alone in his attic his dress disarranged and his features wild and haggard from the rough and insulting treatment which he had received at the theatre the candle burnt low in its socket and the flickering blaze cast a gloom around the apartment but it was a tri fle compared to the gloom which filled the breast of him who sat in its midst like despair upon a monument thrust from a hotel locked up in a station house cut in the street by a customer and hustled out of a theatre he muttered to himself what shall come next from this fearful mystery he paused a moment a shade of comfort seemed to pass over his features and he continued a beautiful young woman with hair and eyes as black as the raven cheeks like the rose of summer lips like the luscious red cherry and a voice like the soft sighing of the evening breeze has been at my store fifty times has never noticed this hateful unaccountable marl of mine which others          the attic aed the maiden see and has asked me to visit her she says she is the only daughter of an aged father and is her own mistress fool that i was not to think of it before ill go and see her tomorrow ask her to marry me and in the joys of wedded life forget my troubles and with a flush on his face called up by the glowing picture which he had drawn of his future bride he threw himself on his bed and slept the morning came and the victim of the mysterious mark after arranging with his clerk the business of the day sallied out to the house of the lady of his sudden love he found her at home and entered the parlor in the style of the ton with his hat and switch cane in his hand the maiden was alone seated at a frame of embroidery and the first flush of the morning was not more beautiful than she the maiden looked up with astonishment on the entrance of her visitor but before she had time to speak the visitor with the desperation of one making a last leap for life jumped at once into the middle of what was uppermost in his thoughts and said good morning miss brown from the first moment i beheld you my heart has been consumed with love i can restrain the feelings of my heart no longer will you be mine i have enough of money for us both i love you madly consent and make me happy sir answered the young lady rising with dignity  i know not for what reason i am thus insulted the servant told me that it was a gentleman of my acquaint   the attic and the maiden       ance in   street who wished to see me you are a perfect stranger to me and i beg you would withdraw or i must ring the bell and she moved toward the bell handle as she spoke stay a moment for heavens sake cried the victim laying his hand on her arm what mean you i am that gentleman of your acquaintance in   street do you not recognisej me as such no sir you bear some slight resemblance to him but he is a gentleman and you are not besides if he bore about his person the disgusting mark which i see about you i should although i now esteem him highly deem his addresses an insult as i now do yours again i demand that youwithdraw maddened and almost crazed the victim rushed from the house into a neighboring restaurant where since his expulsion from his boarding house he had obtained his meals and called for a glass of brandy the barkeeper handed him the decanter in a hesitating manner and with an equivocal look the victim poured a glass half full and drank it at one draught then laying down the change on the counter he turned fiercely to the bar keeper whose strange look was still upon him and ex claimed angrily well what do you see four times have i been here and although i owe you nothing you insult me with your impertinent looks is there any thing about me that does not betoken a gentleman if there is what          the attic and the maiden is it and without waiting for an answer he flew like a wild man again into the street as he hurried along a large placard caught his atten tion it was headed in immense letters with the words mysteries explained and set forth in glow ing language that a celebrated magician in a certain street was ready at all hours to reveal all secrets past and future a ray of hope fell on the soul of the victim and a gleam of satisfaction shone in his eye as he turned his steps towards the indicated street   chapter iv the magioian and the solution in a large and vaulted apartment sat the victim and the magician the beard of the latter white as the driven snow reached to a golden girdle at his waist which confined around his person a flowing robe elabo rately embroidered with cabalistical characters a mir ror reaching from the floor to the ceiling stood in the centre of the room and strange to say it gave back from its polished surface no reflection either of the furniture or the persons of the two occupants of the apartment you would have unfolded to you said the magi cian the mystery and the secret of your late mishaps you would know your fatal mark i would answered his listener then be silent and behold placing a silver censer before the mirror he dropped into it some herbs then taking a wand from beneath his         the magician and the solution robe he drew a circle round mirror and censer in a moment a volume of smoke ros up from the censer spreading a fragrant perfume through all the room the face of the mirror became agitated white vapory clouds passed over its surface and the sound of soft and distant music fell upon the ear the magician now waved his wand the clouds disap peared from the face of the mirror and disclosed a scene at night in front of an hotel where a man was in the act of being thrust from its doors again the wand waved and the same man was at the park fountain with the hand of an officer on his shoulder again and he was before the justice again and he was being borne out of the theatre again and he was before a lady of dazzling beauty again enough cried the victim jumping from his seat where with dilated eyeballs he had watched the changes of the mirror enough i see it all magician here it is fool dolt idiot that i amit was this confounded sh ocking    bad   hat i had it on when all my misfortunes occurredi had it in my hand when my love was spurned and re jected the mystery then is unfolded answered the magi cian but behold the remedy  again the wand was waved and clouds overspread the face of the mirror only to pass away and disclose a spac iocis store surimointed on       the magician and the solution     its roof by the figure of a golden hat and bearing on its front the broad sign of the no park row new yorek no gentleman is perfect continued the magician without a faultless hat he may have money as you have but he must have a faultless hat which you have not and the hatfinishers union is the only place to get it this union is a combination of journeymen hatters who have formed a company for the purpose of supplying to the public a hat of the best quality at the cheapest price and at the same time securing to the mechanic a fair remuneration for his labor it has been attended with such complete success that certain individuals envious of its prosperity have stolen its name and thus sought to impose on the com munity but the true original hatfinishers union is at park row whither we will now descend as the magician spoke his robe seemed to melt from his person the mirror dissolved in air a mist spread through the apartment and in the next moment our hero victim of the mysterious mark no longer found himself standing in a spacious store lined on either side with         the magician and the solution hats of every size quality and style and in the presence of a gentlemanly man who addressed him with this is the hatfinishers union sir shall i suit you with a faultless hat that is exactly what i want answered our hero and in five minutes he walked out of the store happy and joyful with as perfect a model of a hat as ever came from the hatters block before he reached his store he met the porter of the hotel the police officer the justice his customer the old gentleman and lastly the lady of his love each made him a low bow and putting it all to the credit of the hatfinishers union he entered his store a new man reader look at your hat and if it is at all rusty or worse for wear

us uttered with a sigh and a groan both of which were the fruits of pain as any one who knew mrs larrabee would aver she was not given to sighing or any other outward manifestations of grief it may prove a blessing in disguise aunt linda we are all needing rest and your accident will oblige us to take it if grace malthys words were commonplace there was soothing mu sic in the tones but her aunts nerves had been so ruthlessly jarred they could not at once accept the tuneful healing even if it is only a sprain i may be obliged to stay at lucerne a month it was suchan awk ward thing to do i really believe if some one would scold and fret about it i could bear the pain more heroically indeed its a pity you shouldnt have every solace within our reach mrs larrabee  what could have tempted you to scramble up that hill in advance of your party and the carriage and then like a sentimental girl of sixteen rather than a sensible woman of forty you must needs climb the bank for a flower  you might have known both stones and turf would be treacherous after such a fall of rain theres your scolding   a spray from lucerne  but the flower was our own clematis and how could i know the stones were wet and loose be sides such a bouquet as this repays one for bruises and pains and then despite the suffering of one and the anxious concern of the others the three ladies laughed merrily at sight of the wilted bunch of clematis heather blue harebells and wild pan sies which had been the innocent cause of so much pain and grace malthy thinking only of diversion for her aunt quoted  and deep in the moss gleamed the delicate shells and the dew lingered fresh in the heavy harebells the large violet burned the campanula blue and autumns own flower the saffron peered through the wild rhododendrons and thick sassafras and fragrant with thyme was the delicate grass and high up and higher and highest of all the phantom of snow  mrs larrabee  and her niece grace malthy were making the grand tour alone but for economys sake had taken a postchaise in company with mr and mrs simmons to cross the briinig pass front interlaken to lucerne  and the ladies choosing to walk when the ascent was most steep and difficult for their horses and mrs larrabee clambering up ragged banks and crumbling rocks for the delicate wildflowers slipped  and was a sprained ankle the only fruit       a spray from lucerne the tower and spires of lucerne its noble moun tain heights mirrored in the lake and the hoary head of rhigi like a grim sentinel overlooking all were a welcome sight to the party and even mrs larrabee lost for the while her consciousness of physical suffering as the magnificent landscape glowing with sunset flushes burst upon their view aunt linda well find a room whose windows shall command a view of this lovely lake and these mountains and then if you are obliged to rest here for a month there will be amusement enough in studying the scenery this was said in a cheery voice just as the carriage drew up before the bel levue house you are always looking at the sunny side and for your sake i will try to make the best use of our detention now if you can make the porter under stand that a chair must be brought to the carriage and that two strong men must carry me to a sunny room that has a cheerful outlook   just be quiet and not try to move or even to think for yourself and mr simmonf and i will manage everything for your comfort and thanks to miss malthys excellently spoken french and mr simmons american energy and yellow napoleons a cheerful room with a lakeside   a spray from lucerne       view was secured and considering the slow pul sation of european life mrs larrabee very soon after the arrival of the carriage found herself on a couch and under the skilful dr steigers hands  only a bad sprain and a lacerated muscle madam but absolute quiet will be necessary and strict compliance with my directions this was the physicians slowly pronounced judgment after a careful examination of the injured ankle  how long shall i be a prisoner that depends on your obedience and this young ladys nursing well hope a couple of weeks will make you all right but strictest attendance on dr steigers part combined with tenderest care from miss malthy did notfind mrs larrabee able to move in two weeks nor even in four their travelling companions lingered at lucerne nearly a week until boating and mountain pic nicking had become monotonous and then departed to finish the alps after the fashion of tourists grace malthy was more than willing to assume the undivided cares and bent all the resources of her sweet healthful nature to the task of nursing and amusing her aunt and the sunshine and the          a spray from lucerne scenery were powerful auxiliaries as she had pre dieted the invalids couch was daily wheeled to the windows that she might watch the varying effect of light and shadow upon the landscape the de parture and return of the little steamers whose decks were crowded with indefatigable english and american tourists bound for weggis and mt rhigi fliielen altorf and the bay of uri and sometimes as a reward for her patient waiting mt pilatus unveiled his head and made clearer to her finite vision the purity and infinitude of that love which is likened to encircling mountains and such rocks as those gray pinnacles which pierced the clouds i believe travellers make grave mistakes aunt linda in trying to see so much territory grace said one evening when they had silently watched the shadows creeping stealthily over mountains and lake now if we had remained no longer than most people do we might not have seen old pila tus once and we certainly should not have become familiar with the wonderful changes wrought by the rising and setting sun and the charming ef fects of clouds you are very thoughtful and cheerful my dear              a spray from lucerne      grace always showing me the bright side of our misfortune but i cannot forget that my awkward fall will prevent you from seeing many portions of switzerland that were in our programme  let us never mention the fall again or if we do only as a reminder of the old adage  man proposes and god disposes i am more than content with what ive already seen and there is some new charm for me every day here look at the pinkish purple clouds which are winding in and out amongst the gray peaks and then as if not satisfied twith their home on those glorious heights they make the water blush apd glow with their mirrored beauty oh it is all too fair and lovely for words but it sinks down deep into my heart they gazed in silence until the purple light slowly faded from the skies and lake and then the elder lady spoke the study of this landscape fromi my window sometimes quite reconciles me to our detention and sometimnes fills me with a strange peace it never wears the same aspect but like gods mercies is new every morning and fresh every evening grace gave an appreciative clasp to her aunts hand and then ringing for lights took up the book      a spray from lucerne she was reading when the sunset glories proved more absorbing it was a small tauchnitz edition of  vmra and the girl smiling and hesitating said  i have an emotion of half hame or guilt when i touch this book aunt linda and im going to tell you why when we were in the parlor of that wretched inn at the grindelwald i chanced to pick it up from the table and turning to the flyleaf i read this sentence written with a pencil left by somebody for anybody and without a moments thought i instantly jappropriated the book and have fancied the act a petty theft ever since almostand yet i think the selfishness of the act its worst feature of course i reason that the book was left for me as definitely as for any one that after reading it i can leave it upon some hotel table for the benefitof another but then comes back the remembrance that i seized it and thrust it into my bag when no one was look ing i did not give the others a fair chance and i concealed the possession of it from you until our necessities obliged me to bring it forth only one of the party could appropriate it and the others impressed me as persons who would not appreciate v ra im sorry if the slightest   a spray from lucerne  shadow rests upon your conscience but im grate ful to the stranger who left that temptation in your path the book has been full of sweetness and consolation for an invalid let me look at the writing please miss malthy brought the book and knelt down by the couch and both ladies scanned attentively the sentence  a strong masculine hand wrote that and strength delicacy modesty and generosity are the dominant elements of his character you are the boldest clairvoyant auntie in all europe tell me how you draw such astonishing inferences you will notice in the first place he used a nicely pointed pencil and cut his letters neatly and firmly  there you see delicacy and strength his modesty shows in the concealment of his name his generosity in leaving the book for the use of a fellowtraveller he might have exchanged it as is the habit of tourists miss malthy laughingly declared her aunt a magician and added  if the mysterious somebody who left the book should reveal himself and we should find him pos sessed of the traits you ascribe to him i shall       a spray from lucerne fancy you are a direct descendant of the witch of endor and then after a minutes thought she asked have trifles sometimes seemed to you freighted with a deeper significance than intrinsically belongs to them i have noticed this that a seeming accident and a trifling act are often made the rounds of the ladder by which we ascend aunt linda i cannot touch this book without fancying that in some way the finding of it will be one of the rounds to the ladder of which you spoke if it only leaves on my life a faint color of veras faith and purity and the princesss beautiful re ligion it will have wrought a good work the possible stands by us ever fresh fairer than aught which any life hath owned and makes divine amends mrs larrabee repeated softly and in her eyes there was a calm trustful light which assured the belholder that her soul had received divine amends for her lifes losses i think you may wash your conscience of all stain as regards the book by your patient reading of it to me and possibly its pure lessons would not have fallen upon more gratefully receptive soil i     a spray fromlucerne       than our hearts if some other person had appropri ated it can you finish it tonight easily in half an hour the reading was resumed but often interrupted by an amiable and intelligent discussion of the books merits and thus the days of their detention were sown with seeds which would perhaps burst into bloom and enrich other lives the sabbath dawned in beautiful lucerne as calmly bright as when our fair earth first awoke beneath his smile who pronounced it good and george herbert would have seen in it new reasons for affirming that sundays the pillars are on which heavens palace arched lies miss malthy leaving her aunt with a book and the window for companions went out to find an english church service the streets were filled with strange sights and sounds for a girl accus tomed to the hush and decorum of a new england sabbath venders of fruits confections meats and in fact all sorts of merchandise temptingly or repel lantly displayed were busy at their stalls women with bare feet and hard tanned faces dragged      a spray from lucerne their carts of milk vegetables or fish often shar ing their burdens with dogs rudely harnessed to the carts young girls in quaint costumes whose faces were not quite so worn and hopeless as those of the middleaged women were at work in the vineyards and fields while others were bringing in their boats laden with fruits and vegetables from the small arable niches which were crowded be tween the rugged crags overhanging the lake peasants in holiday attire their hats bedecked with wildflowers smoked and sipped their wine and beer and ate their brown bread and cheese sitting on rude benches by the wayside graceful little shallops slipped from their moorings bearing pleasureseekers to and fro upon the silvercrested waves the small steamers came and went their decks crowded with those who were too intent on seeing the alps to give an hour of quiet thank of fering to him who weighed them in his balance old men and women bent and rheumatic and beg gars of all ages making capital of their repulsive deformities followed miss malthy supplicating alms even to the church door and all this hope less poverty anddesecration of the sabbath under the shadow of gods most glorious creations where it would seem mans nature should approach nearer                      i   a spray from lucerne      the divine because of the lavish beauty and noble majesty of his surroundings miss malthys thoughts were so busy in trying to bring this muddy current of human life into some shadowy kinship with the glorious lake and everlasting hills which were the natural birthright of these countrymen of tells that she went me chanically throughthe service scarcely noting who officiated until the text uttered in a musically clear bass voice arrested her attention and then she recognized wlith a blush of pleasant emotion a young american whom she had met upon the rhine and again at geneva she knew now that the prayers and hymns had been read by a gray haired english clergyman but the text walk in wisdom toward them that are without redeeming the time fell from the young mans lips with such a delicate mingling of authority and persuasion as to give pauls exhortation new significance and power he spoke of the dignity and beauty of the christian faith which enabled its possessor to walk wisely and so to bear himself toward them who are without that they might recognize and strive to obtain the uplifting influence and he dwelt with great earnestness on the necessity of seizing every      a spbay from lultcerne minute occasion for the exercise of christian char ity for doing good unto all men and thus redeem ing the time it was such an impressive sermon miss malthy said in reply to her aunts questions while she la id aside her hat and mantle it almost seemed as if the minister knew all about my long ingfor something to do and wrote that sermon expressly to show me that i must not wait for great opportunitiesbut redeem each day by the faithful performance of its humblest duties and then she quoted the text and gave her aunt an epitome of the sermon it would be singular if your life should receive a new impulse from a strangers chance sermon mrs larrabee remarked after noting the deep serious ness in miss malthys eyes and i may as well say here that grace had fine eyes they were large and dark soft and changeable in expression and their effect was enhanced by rich masses of light curling hair worn in a simple becoming style as unlike the artificial fashion of the day as a blue violet is unlike the passionflower of conservatories perhaps miss malthy was a trifle longer in folding her mantle and disposing of her hat and gloves than neatness required and whlen she turned to   a spray from lucerne      ward her aunt there might have been a slight in crease of the delicate color in her face which was always paling and flushing and in her voice an undertone of something not revealed in her words aunt linda the minister was not quite a stranger you remember the mr hilliard whom we met on the rhine  very well somehow that river seemed to catch a rhythm from his welltimed quotations and again when we chanced to meet at geneva his knowledge of lake lelmans poetry did not lessen its charms perhaps his coming will be another reason for contentnment with our detention here if i can only learn how to redeem my life from its monotonous commonplaceness i shall count mr hilliards sermon as another round in the ladder of which we were speaking last evening can you tell me aunt linda what a girl of only ordinary education and but  a year can do to redeem the time what do you understand the apostles injunc tion to mean until this morning i supposed it meant the performance of some great charity some act of heroism or selfdenial to be the leader in a be nevolent enterprise to write a book or to do       a spray from lucerne something so that ones days shall not be all alike when paul wrote to the saints which were at colosse enjoining upon them the text you have quoted he could not have expected them to wait for great opportunities the saints of those days were not rich in this worlds goods they could not build model lodginghouses for their poor nor erect elegant churches nor endow colleges i doubt if paul expected one of the sisters to write a book or even an epistle and i think we have positive evidence that he wouldnt have regarded a political career or public lecturing as walking in wisdom you ask what a girl of your small means can do and i answer  the wise and true crave not for lofty tasks but turn the small to greatness by the great heart doing all for god if i had parents brothers and sisters or poor relatives to whomlll i could be useful i think i could  turn the small to greatness  by lovingly and faithfully serving them but im so alone in the world and my income will not allow me to give generously and i havent any particular gift that can be made useful  excepting a remarkable tact for nursing in   a spray from lucerne      terrupted mrs larrabee you forget how nec essary you have been to me since my home has been desolate how many hearts have been cheered by your sweet voice and how helpful and courageous you have been whenever occasion offered you know pascal says  the power of a mans virtue should not be measured by his special efforts but by his ordinary doing you will find work enough in gods good time after a short period of silence which both ladies occupied in reading though miss malthys eyes  had often wandered to the window as if in search of an answer to her thoughts she said aunt linda mr hilliard asked if he might call on you this evening then you have spoken with him yes he is a friend of the lady who sits next me at table the lively little mrs sage we were walking back from the service when mr hilliard overtook us he came last evening and is stopping at our hotel miss malthy did not speak with her usual graceful spontaneity and mrs larrabees quick ear noticed the slight hesi tation but she only said  you may ask mrs sage to bring her friend to see me i am hoping dr steiger will allow me       a spray from lucerne to walk as far as the parlor before the close of another week after that sabbath mornings sermon and the evening call lwhen mr hilliard manifested such delicate concernhfor the invalid and made an hour so short by his agreeable talk the days of slow healing and patient waiting for mrs larrabee and her niece received a new element of grace the young clergyman conversed with remarkable fluency he had a rare knowledge of history poe try and art to draw from and he also possessed that rarer tact of never permitting his superior cul ture to seem  obtrusive or dogmatic his polite deference to the opinions of others encouraged an interchange of thought and  miss malthy often found herself talking with a freedom belonging to an acquaintance of years rather than of weeks not a day passed after dr steigers permission was gained for mrs larrabee to leave her couch that a  drive was not considered essential to her continued improvement by her newly made friends and   there were plenty of charming excursions planned with most benevolent intentions if mr hilliard was drawn to lucerne  only by a  desire to become acquainted with its wonderful beauty he must have been a more painstaking ex          a spray from lucerne      plorer than are americans usually for he seemed in no haste to depart indeed there were some books which he fancied could be read only here with a true comprehension of their meaning and with illustrations from nature  mich for example as schillers william tell and owen merediths lucille   not that a knowledge of these poems was necessary in the preparation of sermons they were simply graceful blossoms whose fragrance would steal over the deeper and broader fields of thought he might have regarded a prolonged stay under the shadow of these mountains as essen tial to a right understanding of the prophets ex clalmation how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringetlh good tidings that publisheth peace and where beside could a bibli cal student learn so well why gods love and care are symbolled by mnountains and mighty rocks why he chose to commune with   his servants upon solitary heights why mt sinai received such honorand why his most favored servant wras taken to the summit of mt nebo for his burial and if miss malthy  saw new beauty in poe try if the landscape wore a more subtle and del icate charm since the coming of mr hilliard if      a sptay from lucern  the breath of ripening grapes and the mist upon  the hills seemed like the incense and the wings of prayer the fact was scarcelyrecognized and if placed before her in the ordinary language of mor tals would have been denied i this party of four thrown together by seeming  accident but miutially attracted eby similarity of tastes and pursuits explored the lake and moun tain scenery and drifted contentedly upon the fall tide of beauty and gladness whichllsummer hads poured upon this alpine district not a woodland path or mountain chfilet but had soe charm esnd pecilly its otn  o making it worthy a visit no where else did flowers bloom so lavishy and graces ad a most natural wish to preserve foral  looedbtso this holi  ae h l    w mementos of this holidays and fortunately one of the young clergymans many accomplishn ents cbras a knowledge of botany flomers gathered analyzed and pressed under such favoring circued hostances would take with them to her american home something besides color and form and more than the sweet intangible breath of summer it was no  marvel that to grace the whole world looked                     i i  wrt  one great loving thought  written in ierolyp ils of bud and bloom    chapter    ii i opened the doors of my heart and behold trhere was music within and a song and echoes did feed on the sweetness repeating it long jean ingelow  m hlliard   removes all obstacles to our enjoyment with such care and skill that im con stantly wondering what talisman he carries can you tell me grace asked mrs larrabee    on their return from a visit to the ruined castle in ikuiissnacht only kind thoughtfulness for every ones pleasure but his own answered miss malthy with assumed carelessness of tone not raising her eyes from the arranging of her ferns and mosses there are few men no matter how kind their  impulses who could secure without noisy words so many comforts as mr hilliard does for instance the chair in which i was carried to the ruins to day was so easy and was borne so steadily and carefully by the men that after the first five min utes i gave my eyes and thoughts to the charming x ka  nvijl luucerne landscape forgetting that a false step might pre  cipitate me into the lake and when we reached the ruins what a pleasant surprise to find that a servant had preceded us with everything which  could make a picnic enjoyable you must have observed he always secures the best horses and  carriage and our guides always seem more intelli gent and obliging if they are selected by mr hil liard and the charm of his management is that he appears unconscious of doing  anything remark  mr hilliard speaks both german and french  fluently and that may be one reason why he se cures so quietly whatever he needs and perhaps the people who serve him recognize a  masterful intelligent and withal generous strength in him  which makes obedience natural and service pleas ant grace replied still toying with her woodland  treasures while the wavering color in her fair face  betrayed an interest which her averted eyes and indifferent tones attempted to conceal and mrs larrabee with womans quick perception read the irst syllables of the old story in her nieces fitful lushes and as if willing to give it emphasis tuoted from one of her favorite poems   yes i  have often noticed he has          a spray from lucerne       a mouth for mastery and manful work a certain brooding sweetness in the eves a brow the harbor of grave thought  and she might have added a voice revealing manly integrity culture and innate refinement aunt linda how much longer shall we be de tained here dr steiger says i may safely leave on mon day next  only three days more  and i have learned to love lucerne so tenderly that i shall say goodby with a great sigh of regret grace mr hilliard has asked me if he may accompany us to greneva what answer shall i make miss malthy raised her eyes for a moment to her aunts face but her glance of surprised inquiry was changed to blushing consciousness and she an swered stammeringly it is your right to select our travelling com panions aunt linda imr hilliard is always agreeable andthere the subjectwas dropped mrs larrabee did not choose to tell her niece what she knew of the clergymans reasons for lin gering a month in lucerne and not until that day had grace acknowledged to herself that alpine flowers gathered without mr htilliards aid would lack half their sweetness that the scenery had      a spray from lucerne worn new grace and grandeur since his coming and that her own life had been enriched and stim ulated to nobler uses by his words but that the clergyman had found in her more than a pleasant companion for holiday rambles she did not suspect until the expression of her aunts face coupled with mr hilliards request roused her unques tioning heart and then she remembered his careful shielding of her from fatigue and exposure during their long walks and muleback excursions his evident pleasure in securing for her some coveted trifle his delicate attempts to draw out her thoughts on whatever was the theme of conversation and his deferential listening to her lightest word and it must be confessed these memories gave birth to a timid hope which lent her eyes a soft gladsome light and her manner a sweet humility very be coming and other eyes than mrs larrabees dis covered the added charm when she reappeared in her aunts parlor we are trying to decide on an excursion for tomorrow said mrs sage  and i want to spend it on the lake what is your wish miss malthy to join the party in any excursion that will   a spray from lucerne       leave pleasant memories you know it will be our farewell of lucerne then let us give the honor of our farewell to the lake  and we will not spoil the sentiment and grace of the excursion by making it on a steamer well have a small sailboat if that will be as agreeable to mrs larrabee added mr hilliard but he looked in miss malthys eyes for his answer if aunt linda can overcome her prejudice against boating i think it will be delightful to drift close up to the feet of the mountains and halt wherever we fancy i if we could be sure of a calm day iwould not object to the small boat but theres so much danger of sudden squalls and capsizing and my sprained ankle has made me such a coward  youll bury your fears fathoms deep in the lak e before youve sailed half an hour with the two oarsmen whom   i will secure they know every rock inlet and cape of the coast and can scent the coming squall as far as a warhorse the  battle          you shall have the seat of honor and mr hilliard shall read us schillers descriptions of the scellery and i will take along some book that shall serve as ballast when poetry carries too    r            a spray from lucerne imuch sail caln i find anything readable on your table and mrs sage turned to examin e the few books while the others made plans for the morrows pleasure v     vra  whlat an odd title for a book ex claimed the lady i is it worth reading and then before an answer could be made she read aloud the sentence penciled on its flyleafleft by somebody for anybody    how  strange where was it left and who was the finder i found it at grindelwald and claimed it for my own answered grace with an appealing look toward mr hilliard who seemed not only some what startled but conscious and amused that presumption the book shall belong  henceforth to me or at least i will read it and then leave it for  anybody whose conscience per mits him to appropriate it but you havent told me if tis worth reading we found it very entertaining and liked both its style and  spirit mrs larrabee answered and more than once ivewanted to thank the author for its charming lessons of patience and courage and if i could meet the somebody who left it i should tell him what his generosity has done for us         a spray from lucerne      perhaps generous emotion had nothing to do with somebodys motives in leaving the book suggested mr hilliard and mrs sage added most likely his valise and shawlstraps were full and overflowing and the book no longer of use to hill   that sentence bequeathing  vera to any body might have been idly and thoughtlessly written while waiting for his dinner said grace  no whoever wrote those words does noth ing without a purpose mrs larrabee affirmed witlh more than usual emphasis and more over im quite certain he is a somebody whose friendship is worth having you must know aunt linda has almost a clair voyant gift in discerning a persons character in his handwriting and i have great faith in her skill i hope your faith will not be less when you know him better who left that book mr hilliaxd said and his eyes bent upon miss malthys face conveyed a deeper meaning than his words do vou mean to affirm eugene hilliard that you are the mysterious somebody weve been dis cussing exclaimed mrs sage  i believe the waif  vera was once mine and      a spray from lucerne left by me at grindelwald and iml delighted to know it has met such appreciative readers i wrote that sentence with a prayer that the book might serve as a steppingstone for some one mrs larrabee quietly held out her hand and while she uttered not a word the smile that accomi panied the act assured mr hilliard that he had gained a friend but when he raised his eyes to read in miss malthys face an approval of the com  pact she had turned from them and was studying the landscape as intently as if she sought that light which never yet was seen on land or sea if ever the lake of the four cantons  looked proudly conscious of its own loreliness it was when our little party trusted their frail bark to her mercy   never did the mountains seem so near akin to heaven as when with softened grandeur they were reflected from the lake while flocks of fleecy clouds seemed indigenous to its clear depths never did the pink foxglove bend more coquet tishy from her rugged home  in the gray rocks than when she saw her face in this mirror of nature the purple heather and  blue gentian smiled and nodded in thte sunshine and the moun  tain ash flung out its clusters of scarlet berries in such prodigal profusion that you could almost   a spray from lucerne  fancy some niggardly fitreewhose head was bald and whose branches were bent beneath the snows of many winters was hoarsely calling to what purpose is this waste  now as this workingday world is full of briars and events rarely do sail smoothly on without meeting breakers sandbars and contrary forces too numerous for mention these sumnmer friends of ours really ought to have encountered one of those spasms of wrath which gather around the head of mount pilatus and bursting suddenly upon the lake whip its waves into white passion their little shallop ought to have been capsizedthe ladies saved by billiard from drowning only by reason of his superhuman strength but no the elements were in holiday temper and threw no hindrances in the way of our tourists who enjoyed without stint or measure the gracious beauty spread out around them they went ashore for their lunch just where the jutting rocks formed natural terraces and a firtree more generous than its neighbors threw a canopy of green boughs over a carpet of soft mosses and while they partook gratefully of those viands which refresh the body heavenly manna scattered by invisible hands stole silently into their        a spray from   luogrne hearts   books were discussed poetry quoted and mrs larrabee after much gentle persuasion from her niece and many earnest entreaties from      her friends recited some lines which had fallen from her pen in rhythmic numbers one summer day when the lake of lucerne sat for its picture    in a low tuneful voice quite  in harmony with    the gently breaking waves and the music of the forest she repeated  o fair lucerne thy waters make a mirror for proud rhigils face and clouds their purple glory take from heavenly heights to lend thee grace then on thy softly blushing breast in golden silence calriily rest as infant to its mother pressed  upon thy waves the lilv white  in summer sunshine idly dreams the harebell bends to catch the light that on thy crystal bosom gleams the browneyed pansy lifts her head from off the tendermosses bed on thee her incense sweet to shed l fringes of modest graceful ferns creep closely to thy silver brim the columbine her coy face turns from sheltering rocks so gray and grim and looks with fondly wistful eyes into thy depths where mirrored lies the sunset amber of the skies   a spray from lucerne r           the tasseled larch and tuneful pine their shade and music freely give  and flowering shrub and trailing vine beside thee are content to live  from heights where snows eternal sleep with joyous shout the glad streams leap a carnival with thee to keep  around thee hoary mountains stand guarding thine everlasting dower of beauty from profaning hand and telling always of gods power g      his majesty and holiness and while thy waves their feet caress thy gentler mission is to bless   amen responded hilliard with deepest rev erence of tone and look   and blessings on her who has stolen some threads from natures loom to weave for us a holiday ribbon    and then a thoughtful silence fell upon the group who sat watching the lake and the boats that glided phan tomlike upon its surface   mrs sage broke the silence with an abrupt question eugene hilliard wlhat made you a minister such sights and sounds as meet us at every turning in this world answered the young man but i want a sensible reason for your lack of ambition your father was an eminent lawyer anid politician your uncles have held high offices and your brother stanley is adding honor to your old        a spray from lucebne family name what is the secret of your content in a small country parish and with a salary that will barely afford the decencies of life inasmuch as ye did it unto the least of these my disciples ye did it unto me quoted eugene hilliard the secret of my content is that christ accepts mny poor service and blesses it that he called me when i first reached out my hand for the honors and riches of this world and said  go publish the glad tidings  but you might be a rector innew york where thousands would listen to you instead of hundreds where your talents would be appreciated and would open the doors of cultivated and refined circles for you    c to the poor the gospel was especially sent and some one must minister to those who live in the byplaces my parish is not so far from the great cities that we cannot hear the whirr and buzz of civilization i have the satisfaction of knowing  that the hearts of the people are turned toward me that the children love me in fine my labor brings its own exceeding rich reward and while mrs larrabee ventured to express in words her ap  proval of his mission mr hilliard gathered from  grace malthys face such commendation as would i         a spray from lucerne      sweeten labor the long level shafts of golden light which shot under the hanging branches bade our friends make preparation for their evening sail and gathering up books baskets and shawls the two matrons were soon seated in the boat miss malthy standing upon the lakes brim wait ing to be helped to her seat in the boat missed the ribbon and locket which she had worn and with an exclamation of regret sprang lightly back over the rocks to search for it after a minutes hesi tation hilliard followed i found your locket when we were gathering up the fragments of our picnic and kept it as a hostage until what i have given you is returned  i have nothing of yours but  vra and you did not give me that  and grace held out her hand t for the locket you have made me a beggar he said taking the hand instead of restoring the locklet and grace looking timidly up forgot to ask what mr hil liard wanted in return for his gift she remem bhered only that her hand was firmly held and that her aunt and the boat were waiting  for loves sake will you share with me whlat ever work the master bids me do the words fell solemnly and tenderly as from a       a spray from lucerne great heart that knows the need and sacredness of love the work and the love will make life such a different thing was the honest but tremulous answer and then her hand received such conse cration from his lips her brow such honor and only the firtree and the silent rocks for witnesses then hilliardl led her to the boat and seated by his side the purple haze on the mountains and the soft sunset blush on the lake seemed but re flections of that love which had transfigured their lives  in a pretty thriving village where the berkshire hills and rivers make a landscape fair and delight ful to the eye grace malthy has found how to redeem the time and while s deeds of weekday holiness fall from her noiseless as the snow she fills the parsonage with gladness and content roger deanes work roger deanes work roger deanes work by

aprili pause to count the seasons   that have  slid  away since the first sounds of war roused the echoes of our newengland hills with a crash almost as deafening and surprising as if old ocean had forgotten the mandate  thus far shalt thou come and his waves had swept inland over meadow and forest country and town carrying desolation and      roger deanes work  ruin in their pathi pause to count the seasons for we have lived so much more in deeds than in years since the first gun was  fired at sumter that one can hardly be  lieve only two winters have sifted their snows upon the earth since that wellre membered day  only three sutnmers have vainly sought to cover with bloom  and beauty the hideous stains of blood and devastation which war has left upon our fair land two years ago last april when the first swallows were twittering under the eaves of a thriftylooking newengland farmhouse  and the old willows that skirted the lane were just putting on their softest tint of green and the red buds of the maples hung out a promise of cooling shade for   a the coming summer  the quiet inmates of the brown farmhouse forgot to look for the footsteps of spring roger was at   roger deane s work     home but ihis presence did not bring as in former years joy and gladness to the homestead hearth he had not come now for a few days of vacation but for his mothers farewell blessing she was a widow so he choked back the impulse that bade him fly to rescue our flag from dishonor when the news from sumter startled our land and bowed his head over books which had suddenly lost their charm but when newengland men had been shot in baltimore he could no longer check the hot blood that leaped in his veins blood inherited from revolutionary he roesand thrusting  from  his thoughts ambitious hopes and the memory of his mothers widowhood he had enlisted oh roger how could you do such a thing asked the mildeyed sadvoiced mother and though there was reproof in her tones there was loving admiration in      roger deanes work hero eye and a gentle caress in the way she lifted the short brown curls from his broad forehead well mother for more than a week i resisted the strong tide of impulse that bade me go because you were a widow and i your only son but i could not study and could not think of anything but the insult to our flag and the call for men and when i read about the shooting of our men in baltimore i think the news half crazed and maddened me for i rushed out and enlisted without waiting for your con sent you will not make it too hard for me to go mother nor withhold your bless ing now t  i will try to make the sacrifice cheer fully but you must not talk or think of sac rifices mother why im sure to come back you know the boys all say ive a   roger deanes work    g charmed life but youve never known of half the hairbreadth escapes ive had only last fall i was out gunning and slipped upon a decayed log in such a way that i fell and my loaded gun discharged its contents all going through my sleeve and just grazing my arm  i dont be lieve such stanch old republican blood as i ve inherited from the deanes and preb bles is to be spilled by rebels i trust that our god will save and return you roger but when i think of the hardships you must endure and the dangers you   must encounter my  heart sinks within me you must think only of the glory and honor of helping protect and preserve our free institutions and as for the hard ships what are they mother  why camping out for a few vveeks in the open air with a hard couch and plain fare     roger deanes work but there s many a young man who d gladly go through it all for the pleasure of trouting and shooting for a few weeks and i reckon what others can endure for sportji can for our countrys sake and three months is such a short time too youll hardly miss me then you know there are plenty of people who believe therell be no fighting at all weve only got to show the south that we are in earnest and theyll quickly be on their knees it may be so roger i know there are people wiser and older than i am who think we have only to raise an army and threaten an invasion to bring them to terms but when i remember the harsh and bitter war of words which has been waged so long i fear the contest will be long and bloody i think it would have been much better for you to have waited until your   roger de anes work    h medical studies were completed and then go as surgeon  but this is no time for the expression of fears or regrets we must act when does your regiment leave for washington       we hope to be off tomorrow the next day surely  does alice know that you have en listed  i ve had no time to tell her yet she had gone to school before i reached home this morning mrs deanes last question brought a cloud upon the open handsome face of her son and for some minutes both sat in si lence mother and sisters were dear to roger and could not be left without many severe struggles but he had found during the last year a love more holy and sacred than that of kin it had crept stealthily into his heart but once there had taken     roger deanes work root its buds and blossoms were making fragrant his whole life what would alice say   she was a tender delicate flower in calm sunshiny weather now that the storm had burst would it crush her or would she be t a reed in calm in storm a staff unbent she will say go mother theres the right kind of stuff in alice to make a woman of more strength of character be hind her girlish lighthearted ways than people give her credit for roger spoke in a lower more quiet tone than he had used before there was veneration and ten derness in his love and he could not speak of it in the same gay careless way that he had spoken of the war mrs deane did not reply she had not given alice much credit for strength of mind or will but had yielded to the charm of her bright face and winning manners   roger de anes work     glad that roger had chosen from a good old fallily and never fearing but alices love would in time develop sufficient wom anly strength i may as well go over to squire har lowes and call on alice she must be out of school by this time and i will bring her back to drink tea with us and spend a quiet evening here shall i mother if you please roger perhaps the young man detected in the sad tones of his mothers reply a shadow of jealous feeling for stooping he kissed with tender reverence her forehead and left the room it was hard for mrs deane to share even with alice the very few   precious hours that roger could be at home but her heart was familiar with sacrifices and summoning her womans strength and pa tience she busied her hands and thoughts     roger deanes work with making little loving preparations for rogers journey and campaign and tried to comfort herself with thinking that many a mother had laid upon the altar her only son and perhaps at this very hour thou sands were bending with tearfuil eyes and clasped handsasking god to bless the sac rifice but ah there were not many sons like roger true tender manly and hon est and if the thought caused a pang it likewise brought a balm for if roger must  go what pleasant memories would be left of his love and if he should fall no the master who had called back to life the widows son at nain would watch over roger she would not for a moment allow j such a fear to throw its black pall over her heart and while she was still bending over the knapsack alice came with her hand in rogers and though there were traces of                        rogoer deanes work     tears on her fair face there was hope faith and courage in her brown eyes mother alice says i ve done right and alice not daring to trust her voice knelt by rogers mother taking the work from her hands while she kissed her lips but i have no need to paint the scene in that widows cottage nor the parting in the gray light of that spring morning for alas there have been many such since then till now there are few families but have a hero in this war and few firesides but have a vacant chair roger goneand yet the violets and pansies bloom and live the old appletrees throw out a fragrant prophecy of autum al harvests while the sadfaced widow deane moves about her house and garden as in former years only in her heart there is no answering echo to the glad sound of spring s footsteps and alice harlowe is     roger deane s work always finding an excuse for visiting the cottage last year she was so shy and coy never coming unless roger or his little sis ters came to bring her now there is a book or bouquet or better still a letter from roger which must be shared with his mother ay what pleasant amusing letters they were what charming descriptions of country and town what a jolly thing camp life was while may and june were scatter ing their blossoms on the earth certainly it began to look more serious when the july heats grew stronger and fiercer and the smell of powder poisoned the breath of sum mer but these rebels were pampered slips of aristocracy when the contending hosts grappled they would surely shrink away abashed before the stronglimbed ironwilled farmers and mechanics of the federal army they were not buoyed up with the stern justice of their cause as were the stanch   roger deanes work      defenders of the stars and stripes this doctrine of states rights was a flimsy bul wark a mere pretence for the protection of slaveryit would not give them nerve and muscle on the battlefield so we tried to i think so alice believed but mrs deane had lived longer had pondered many things in her heart she thought there was much more strength and unity of purpose in the south than we gave them credit for  she was only a woman timid shrinking cow ardly afraid to think of what might hap pen to roger she had not the spirit of the old roman and spartan mothers nor yet of the newengland woman who wept because she had no son to defend her coun trys honor well the july days grew sul try and brought with them rumors of skir mishes which seemed to verify our belief in southern cowardicethe rebels were re treating we  could afford to lose a few      roger deanes work such men as ellsworth and winthrop when we had a fair prospect of crushing the re  bellion so easily how many hearts remember that quiet   i midsummer sabbath when mothers wives and sisters gathered prayerfully in new england in blissful ignorance of thefearful x carnage onvirginias soil who canever forget the solemn hush of the week that fol lowed when the great wheels of business were paralyzed and the very lifecurrent in human veins seemed frozen with fear while listening to the horrible details of that sun days battle  what a week of suspense to the anxious waiting hearts whose husbands sons broth ers and lovers were in that contest mrs deane and alice sat with clasped hands in the summer twilight  it was saturday evening and if no word came from roger that night they thought hope would   roger deanes work         die but one whose ear is ever open to the prayer of faith had heard that lonely mothers earnest pleading and had saved her only son and while they sat making sick ly efforts to cheer each other rogers little sister came flying in bearing aloft a letter t is rogers handwriting mother she exclaimed che must be safe yes thank god i ve been weak and full of fears or i should have known he was safe read it alice and alice brushing away tears that anx iety and suspense had failed to wring from her heart read  dear mother i m all right safe thank god for me for i dont know how to thank him as i ought i learned a lesson last sabbath which all the sermons that were preached in new england could never have taught me i learned how vain is mans strength unless     roger deanes work directed by infinite wisdom oh the hor rors of that battleday i grow sick and faint now when i think of the pools of human blood the ghastly wounds the panicstricken men and the flying horses  but you must have seen in the papers all these disgusting details and i will not write them i cannot tell you how i was saved i hardly know for my clothes were pierced with balls and i received only a little fleshwound in my arm which i bandaged with my hand kerchief but i suppose the loss of blood the heat and exhaustion all combined caused me to faint and t is a wonder i was not left upon the field but peter riley god bless his generous irish heart you remember peter mother he made our garden last year well peter saw me fall and he with another brave fellow car ried me off the field to an ambulance but in the fear and panic of the flight the am   roger deane s work      bulance was leftthe cowardly brutes in charge of it cut the traces and escaped on the horses still i recovered from my faint in season to fly with the restgod onily knows how when we reached washing ton i was only fit for a hospital but never fear now mother im doing well and have been up assisting the surgeon all day he says ive shown remarkable skill in dress ing wounds for one who had no experience he is quite an elderly man and has been so kind and attentive to me giving me so much good advice that i feel as if i had known him   for years he says i was impetuous and foolhardy to rush off as a private as soon as the first warnote sounded when i might do my country so much better service in the capacity of surgeon and he says too that setting aside the happiness and honor of serving these brave fellows who have spilled their blood for the cause of roger deases work truth and liberty the experience i shall get as a surgeon will be invaluable to me he thinksand i am afraid he is more than half right that we have got to wade through rivers of blood before our glorious old flag shall again be honored in the dis loyal states dr chandler is a massachusetts man and he says he can secure for me the post of assistantsurgeon and keep me with him now i want you to think this over dear mother and make up your mind to send me off again with your blessing after i have made you a short visit you know i shall be saving lives and serving god and my country and shall have better fare without as much exposure as the rank and file but i need not press my suit for i know my mothers heart is loyal and every american woman must make sacrifices in this hour of peril and if i should die in the service   roger deane s work       no the brave die never being deathless they but change their countrys arms for nzore their countrys heart but as i was going to say if anything should befall me i should be supported   by the glorious hope of a blessed immortality in that kingdom  where disloyalty war and strife are unknown alicei m   proud of alice mother   she has written me such beautiful letters filled with hope and cheer ful courage what a shield of strength and purity her love will be to me ove s a virtue for heroes as white as the snow on high hills and immortal as every great soul is that struggles endures and fulfils nwhat a boy i am to be quoting poetry with a bandaged arm   and the groans of so many poor suffering  fellows ringing in my ears  by the way mnother i think i ve asked a hundred of these wounded shattered men today if they regretted having enlisted in this cause you should see the light that      roger deanes work flashes in their eyes and hear the hearty emphasis of their tones as they reply never for a moment such patience as they exhibit no murmurs nor complaints my heart is wholly drawn out to them and my life is at their service what a long letter i have written you may expect me home in less than two weeks tell my little sisters to prepare for some rare fun in hay making and berrying and dear mother pray without ceasing for your country and your son most lovingly yours roger s deane they were women mrs deane and alice so we will not blame them for shedding a few tears partly for joy that roger was safe and partly because they saw the sacri fices that must be made in the future if his god and his country need him we must help him buckle on his armor alice q   roger deanes work       mrs deanes tones were tremulous but there was submission and holy trust in her face it will be much easier to bid him go as a surgeon than in ainy other way alice replied but when roger returned he in sisted that it had cost him the sacrifice of many ambitious hopes to act as a surgeon because you see mother there is no prospect now of my ever being anything but a surgeon and one never asks the names of the surgeons that do their work after the battles but rather what officers commanded in   the engagement i can never be a gallant colonel nor a brave general now but i can be a faithful patriot and surgeon and an honest man and earnest chris tian roger live so that your religion may be honored god helping me i will mother     roger deanes work august and september came bringing their deephued flowers and mellow fiuits but not to the widows cottage its wonted cheer and pleasures true roger was at home and each hour of his stay was pre cious but life had suddenly grown a serious thing with him his laugh was less loud and frequent and his face seemed to have caught a shadow from the black cloud which hung over our nation  deeper thought and more serious purpose lighted it and prep arations for his great work had taken the place of those pleasures which had formerly occupied him at this season and alice had laid aside her embroidery and crochetneedle and coarse ogray cloth and red flannel might be seen for a part of each day in her fair hands and surely ladies hands have never looked more fair than when plying the needle upon soldiers gar ments even rogers little sisters found   roger deanes work     the hemming of kerchiefs stitching of seams and scraping of lint more interest ing than dolls the terrible reality of war awoke many a heart from a selfish pleas ureseeking existence to find that there were things of more importance than  crinkling silks that swept about the fine dust of most subtle courtesies many a hand found some real work to do which before had only cared to show off its jewels oh if our american women had thought less of dress fashion and parade would not their sons have been wiser and nobler men would not the selfish intrigu ing politicians who have helped to bring on this cruel war have been purer honester statesmen if they had been cradled and taught by pureminded homeloving moth ers  if they had   been  counselled by wives whose adorning was not the out ward adorning of plaiting the hair and of     roger deanes work wearing of gold or of putting on of ap parel i wish i might say one word which would arrest the eye and claim the serious attention ofgiddy young girls something which would help to make them worthy of gearing the sacred titles of wife and mother but i know their thoughtless habits so well that i am sure every par agraph which looks serious in this little story will be  skipped the husks were pale and rustling on the golden ears of corn when roger again left home not for a jolly freeandeasy cam paign in summer weather but for work  such work as shows the stuff that men are made of and mrs deane took up the simple homely duties of her quiet life finding time for many more acts of kind ness and charity than in former years  for rogers sake she would have told you and alice for the same reason bent her pretty   roger deane  s work     face over  seam gussets and band prick ing the blue tints of soldiers shirts into her white forefingerand writing brave courageous letters to the young surgeon while she grew pale as the faded forest leaves over the newspaper reports of skir mishes and battles in the west oh the ominous hush of that quiet winter on the potomac and the sickening sound of revelry in  our  capital when silly women rivalled each other in the giv ing of parties and wearing of jewels and flirted with shoulderstraps and giltbuttons and  the waves of life were crested with such muddy foam before the melting of our newengland winters snows we had  grown familiar with the sounds of war had accepted it as inevitable and many true hearts were pray ng that god would bring us from  behind ts pillar of cloud and fire a nation puri     roger deanes work fied and honored the pulse of business had again quickened in its great arteries and life moved on much the same as before our nation paused to pay toll in human blood over the smooth turnpike of our sins spring put forth her buds and earth smiled up as if she held most honeyed thoughts at heart and had quite forgotten the warstains of the departed winter  mrs deane and alice planted their seeds thinking of rogers love of flowers and waited in patient hope the sweet fulfilment of their blossoming the army of the potomac as if awak ened to new life by the breath of spring was again in motion on to richmond was the battlecry and with what eager in tentness we watcheji each step of progress our hearts alternately buoyed with hope or depressed with fearuntil hope seemed al most triumphant for our great army threat   roger deane work     ened the very gates of the rebel stronghold and then no we will not live over again that seven days battle we will not roll the stone from the grave of those buried hopes we will only read an extract from one of rogers letters hospital malvern hll  my dear mother i must write you a few lines because i know how anxiously you will wait we have been again defeated but our men fought noblybetter soldiers never gave their lives away nor sold them at so dear a rate if we have failed to take richmond our attempt to do it has cost the south a fearful price you can hardly imagine how heartily i thank god for the privilege of helping to alleviate the suffer ings of our brave wounded men i was upon the field a portion of each day during the long struggle and several times narrow ly escaped being shot     roger deanes work        i i wish i could give you an idea of the desolation which war leaves in its path do you remember how that fine old willow that ised to stand by the pasturebars looked after it was rent by lightning well many of the grand old oaks and elms are shivered by shells till they look like that willow ences are laid prostrate houses are pierced mnd shattered the road is strewn with tat tered blue coats knapsacks and muskets on every hand there are blighted crops of clover corn and wheat with here and there i few tender blades looking up piteously to ward the summer sky the house which we are using for a hospital on malvern hill is a quaint old mansion built of red brick and owned by a wealthy slaveholder i am told there are still many evidences of wealth as well as highly cultivated taste clinging to it it must have been one of virginias most beau tiful homes before the devastating breath of   roger deanes work      war blasted it from its windows you can  see the windings of the james river for several miles we have here nearly  of our federal soldiers and only three sur geons beside myself the patience of the poor wounded men is wonderfultheir sufferings are greatly aggravated by the intense heat ranging from  to  in the shade and the poisonous effluvia rising from the carcasses of dead horses which taints the air for miles around but dear mother do not worry about me i am doing a great work and god will take care of me i shall try and write alice a few  lines tomorrow but every minute snatched from the bedsides of these poor fellows even for necessary rest and writing seems like stealing from them their chances of life with tenderest love to all i     am  always your roger     roger deane s work oh alice exclaimed the widow after they had read and reread that precious let ter if roger should escape being shot only to die of fever and exhaustion something tells me that god will pro tect him and then he always seems to have such an exhaustless store of health and cheerful spirits that i cannot believe hell get sick but if anything should hap pen to him mrs deane i shall fly to him at once my dear do you not know that t is almost impossible for women to gain ad mission to the hospitals and then if it were an easy matter to obtain passes i am sure your father would never allow you to go you are much too young and goodlooking to be so exposed i know roger would not wish it dont let us anticipate trouble but if roger should need me i m sure my father   roger deanes work     willv not throw any obstacles in the way of my going to him alice harlowe was something of a queen in her fathers house she had never known her mother and being an only child and a very pretty winning one it had been her fathers pleasure to gratify all her wishes  even when roger sued for her love and squire harlowe would gladly have dismissed him because of his poverty alices tears conquered the stern lawyer and forced him to sanction the en gagement and ever since roger had been in the army he had allowed his pet ted child to spend a part of each day with the widow and her little girls but roger worked bravely through the peninsula campaign fought off the fevers which carried so many brave men to their last restingplace and dr chandler as sured mrs deane in a letter written to allay    roger deane s work her fearsroger has the nerve strength and endurance of three common men he works like a tiger and the bright cheer ful look which he always wears is better than medicine for his patients i wish you could see his stern decision when using the knife and his womanly tender ness when the operation is over tis my firm belief that more than half the poor fellows who must die  go proudly on their way with death upon the errand of almighty god if they can draw their last breath with a hand in his or resting upon his breast it was natural for mrs deane being a mother to shed a few happy tears over such an encomium on her son   and very becoming in alice to raise her brown eyes and thank god that she had the warmest place in that mans heart and ask him   roger deanes w ork    to make her worthy to walk side by side with his strength and tender purity roger would take no furlough during the july and august heats though mrs deane and alice wrote eloquent letters of entreaty he had but one answer to their appeals the memory of the sufferings that i should leave here which possibly my care might alleviate would destroy the pleasures of home  wait until the au tumn frosts have broken up the fevers and cooled the air but september brought more to mrs deane and alice than its bright tints and spicy odors another great battle had left its red stains upon the soil of antietam and roger in his brave daring efforts to assist the wounded from the field of con test had been hit by a fragment of shell t is not a dangerous wound wrote dr chandler though i think he   will     roger deanes work never have a sound anklejoint again and he has suffered so rmuch from loss of blood and inflammation that he is a mere shadow it will be so long before he is able to work and he is so much in need of a womans care that h have made arrangements to send him home he cannot sit up but i think the fatigue and exposure of travelling upon a litter will be no permanent injury to  him   a great deal in his case depends upon nursing and freedom from excitement you may expect him the day after receiving this i shall send a strong faithful man in charge of him each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows which show like grief itself but are not so mrs deane and alice had now  the sub stance of a grief and knew that only the shadows had visited them before   but faith  the golden side of heavens great d shield came between their hearts and utter   roger deanes work     despair and while they sat exhausted and almost benumbed with sorrow they remem bered that god had tempered their great affliction with mercy for he had given them the privilege of ministering to rogers necessities and the hope of his restoration while to thousands of homes the last week had brought only the message shot dead roger came but how unlike his com ing in former years  brought upon a couch over that threshold which his foot had so often pressed in proud consciousness of manly vigor the bright hue of health gone and only the flush of fever upon his cheek and in his eye there were tearful embraces and whispered exclamations of dear mother and s my alice  answered with  my precious son and oh rog er hearts have not very abundant lan guage for such meetings the rest and     roger deanes work quiet of home were so delicious after the bustle of travelling and the horrid din that had preceded it that soon roger slept at first heavily the sleep of exhaustion and then his slumbers were fitful broken and feverish when the morning broke he was delirious and no longer knew the features of his mother and his alice but continually called upon them to come and remaove him from some impending danger then he would imagine himself still at work upon the field of antietam and would call fran tically for help to assist a stricken soldier for lint and bandages to stop the gushing wounds of another and then in tender soothing tones that brought tears to the eyes of his attendants he would say ehere my good man rest your head upon my shoulder for a minute a message for your mother god bless her ill take it with a lock of your hair and tell her you   roger delanes work     died as a soldier should the rebels are fly ing did you say three cheers for the old flag  even squire harlowe and the old physician wept when the young mans delirious and incoherent sentences showed that he thought himself still at work for his country i would not dare paint in words the days and nights of anxiety and agonized suspense that followed rogers return  when for weeks iis feet seemed already in the dark river and mrs deane and alice were always lifting up their hearts in prayer for his young life neither would i attempt to picture the deep joy and thankfulness of those two women when a conscious light once more returned to rogers eyes and the physician gave them leave to hope that with careful nursing he might recover this war has brought to almost every american family a familiar knowledge of     roger deanes work     i grief but very few have known such hap piness as came to mrs deane and alice with the hope of rogers restoration novembers clouds which had seemed so dark and heavy with their freight of sorrow were now tinged with a soft and mellow lightand the pale withered leaves whose rustlings had seemed likemysterious whis perings of some great coming sorrow brought now a soothing balm  but there were still days and weeks of painful waiting for roger as well asi for his friends days when the contest between the angels of life and death seemed scarcely decided but life was victorious though roger was barely able to limp about with the help of a crutch when the first spring flowers lifted up their heads in greeting and the fragrant winds kissed his pale cheeks it was one of those warm bright days in may when the robins pour forth such   roger deanes work     joyous strains of welcome to the buds and flowers and the very air seems laden with new life and vigor for languid limbs that roger sat in a gardenchair under a blos soming appletree and alice by his side he had never regained his old bright cheer fulness and of late had appeared more than usually depressed the widow and alice had often attempted to reach the cause of his unnatural sadness but he had always cautiously baffled their efforts alice timidly longing to administer balm thought the fragrant sunny day and cheer ful harmony of the outdoor world would assist her in persuading him to share his troubles with her you are not happy roger she spoke in that low soft voice which is still as excellent and becoming in woman as it was when shakspeare wrote nonot as happy as i should be when roger deanes work i remember how much better my condition is than that of thousands what would you have more alice youtorture me do you sup pose t is an easy thing for a young man to limp about all his days  an easy thing to sit here crippled when my country needs me  but oh harder than all  and here his face was hid by two pale hands to feel that ive no longer the right to ask for your love why roger     the snowy blossoms that fell from the old tree were scarcely softer than her voice or sweeter than the perfume of love which clung to it why  because i was unworthy of such a treasure when i had health and strength to protect it and now i m sure your father would never consent to your walking beside a crutch all your life alice was too timid to offer the balm she   i   roger deanes work         would gladly have given she longed to tell him that his lameness was an honorable badge which she gloried in that she was prouder of his crutch than she would be of general mcclennans sword but she was afraid to trust her voice and then per haps roger had grown weary of her love  that thought would freeze her to silence if nothing else would but roger spoke again to think you have been growing dearer and dearer to me all these months and the conviction slowly fastening itself upon me that it was only a sisters kind patient care you were giving me that you only pitied me because you could never love a poor lame sick man and if that is true alice you are unworthy of any mans love both started at the words for they had not heard the approach of squire harlowes       roger dean es work feet upon the soft turf and alice forget ful in her grief of rogers presence and her timid reserve threw herself in her fa thers armns exclaiming oh father it is not true i never loved him half as well as i do now and i should be so miserable without him and he needs me so much and hush child you ve given us reasons enough i trust roger is satisfied i am be kind and gentle to her young man and god bless you both  and here he tried to put alice back upon her seat but she clung to him and hid her wet face upon his shoulder and roger seiz ing one of his hands poured forth a volley of incoherent thanks and the robins set up a jubilant chorus of congratulation the whole scene was very embarrassing to the stern lawyer the muscles of whose face had been trained to such rigid composure and   roger deanes work     when he did speak it was in a voice so husky that his brotherlawyers would never have recognized it take good care of her roger and never mind your lameness i have only a few suggestions to makefirst that you should begin housekeeping without any un necessary delay that you should take me as a boarder and that you should think no more of your countrys need at present open an office in our thriving village and you will find enough to do for suffering humanity here i must let fall the curtain although i would like to tell you how quickly love and hope chased the shadows from rogers hearthow many channels he found for his patriotism and charity to flow through even though his ankle prevented him from serv ing in the armyhow   poor stricken sol diers still reverently whisper his name in prayer     roger deanes work i would like to tell you how calmly con tented and happy is the widow deane how pretty alice looked in white silk with orange blossomshow sweet the sound of rogers cane upon the floor is to her wifely earswhat quantities of blue and red flan nel assume shape and comeliness in her fair handsand how while she works a song of glory hovers round the work like rainbow round a fountain  the man without a country boston ticknor and fields  entered according to act of congress in the year  by ticknor and fields in the clerks office of the district court for the district of massachusetts university press welch bigelow and company cambridge the man without a country the man without a country i suppose that very few casual readers of the new york herald of august th observed in an obscure corner among the deaths the announcement nolan died on board u s corvette levant lat   s long  w on the th of may philip nolan i happened to observe it because i was stranded at the old missionhouse in mackinaw waiting for a lakesuperior steamer which did not choose to come and i was devouring to the very stubble all the current literature i could get hold of even down to the deaths and marriages in the herald my memory for names and people is good and the reader will see as he goes on that i had reason enough to remember philip nolan there are hundreds of readers who would have paused at that announcement if the officer of the levant who reported it had chosen to make it thusdied may th the man without a country for it was as the man without a country that poor philip nolan had generally been known by the officers who had him in charge during some fifty years as indeed by all the men who sailed under them i dare say there is many a man who has taken wine with him once a fortnight in a three years cruise who never knew that his name was nolan or whether the poor wretch had any name at all there can now be no possible harm in telling this poor creatures story reason enough there has been till now ever since madisons administration went out in  for very strict secrecy the secrecy of honor itself among the gentlemen of the navy who have had nolan in successive charge and certainly it speaks well for the esprit de corps of the profession and the personal honor of its members that to the press this mans story has been wholly unknownand i think to the country at large also i have reason to think from some investigations i made in the naval archives when i was attached to the bureau of construction that every official report relating to him was burned when ross burned the public buildings at washington one of the tuckers or possibly one of the watsons had nolan in charge at the end of the war and when on returning from his cruise he reported at washington to one of the crowninshieldswho was in the navy department when he came homehe found that the department ignored the whole business whether they really knew nothing about it or whether it was a non mi ricordo determined on as a piece of policy i do not know but this i do know that since  and possibly before no naval officer has mentioned nolan in his report of a cruise but as i say there is no need for secrecy any longer and now the poor creature is dead it seems to me worth while to tell a little of his story by way of showing young americans of today what it is to be a man without a country philip nolan was as fine a young officer as there was in the legion of the west as the western division of our army was then called when aaron burr made his first dashing expedition down to new orleans in  at fort massac or somewhere above on the river he met as the devil would have it this gay dashing bright young fellow at some dinnerparty i think burr marked him talked to him walked with him took him a day or twos voyage in his flatboat and in short fascinated him for the next year barracklife was very tame to poor nolan he occasionally availed of the permission the great man had given him to write to him long highworded stilted letters the poor boy wrote and rewrote and copied but never a line did he have in reply from the gay deceiver the other boys in the garrison sneered at him because he sacrificed in this unrequited affection for a politician the time which they devoted to monongahela sledge and highlowjack bourbon euchre and poker were still unknown but one day nolan had his revenge this time burr came down the river not as an attorney seeking a place for his office but as a disguised conqueror he had defeated i know not how many districtattorneys he had dined at i know not how many public dinners he had been heralded in i know not how many weekly arguses and it was rumored that he had an army behind him and an empire before him it was a great dayhis arrivalto poor nolan burr had not been at the fort an hour before he sent for him that evening he asked nolan to take him out in his skiff to show him a canebrake or a cottonwood tree as he saidreally to seduce him and by the time the sail was over nolan was enlisted body and soul from that time though he did not yet know it he lived as a man without a country what burr meant to do i know no more than you dear reader it is none of our business just now only when the grand catastrophe came and jefferson and the house of virginia of that day undertook to break on the wheel all the possible clarences of the then house of york by the great treasontrial at richmond some of the lesser fry in that distant mississippi valley which was farther from us than pugets sound is today introduced the like novelty on their provincial stage and to while away the monotony of the summer at fort adams got up for spectacles a string of courtmartials on the officers there one and another of the colonels and majors were tried and to fill out the list little nolan against whom heaven knows there was evidence enoughthat he was sick of the service had been willing to be false to it and would have obeyed any order to march anywhither with any one who would follow him had the order only been signed by command of his exc a burr the courts dragged on the big flies escapedrightly for all i know nolan was proved guilty enough as i say yet you and i would never have heard of him reader but that when the president of the court asked him at the close whether he wished to say anything to show that he had always been faithful to the united states he cried out in a fit of frenzy dn the united states i wish i may never hear of the united states again i suppose he did not know how the words shocked old colonel morgan who was holding the court half the officers who sat in it had served through the revolution and their lives not to say their necks had been risked for the very idea which he so cavalierly cursed in his madness he on his part had grown up in the west of those days in the midst of spanish plot orleans plot and all the rest he had been educated on a plantation where the finest company was a spanish officer or a french merchant from orleans his education such as it was had been perfected in commercial expeditions to vera cruz and i think he told me his father once hired an englishman to be a private tutor for a winter on the plantation he had spent half his youth with an older brother hunting horses in texas and in a word to him united states was scarcely a reality yet he had been fed by united states for all the years since he had been in the army he had sworn on his faith as a christian to be true to united states it was united states which gave him the uniform he wore and the sword by his side nay my poor nolan it was only because united states had picked you out first as one of her own confidential men of honor that a burr cared for you a straw more than for the flatboat men who sailed his ark for him i do not excuse nolan i only explain to the reader why he damned his country and wished he might never hear her name again he never did hear her name but once again from that moment september   till the day he died may   he never heard her name again for that half century and more he was a man without a country old morgan as i said was terribly shocked if nolan had compared george washington to benedict arnold or had cried god save king george morgan would not have felt worse he called the court into his private room and returned in fifteen minutes with a face like a sheet to say prisoner hear the sentence of the court the court decides subject to the approval of the president that you never hear the name of the united states again nolan laughed but nobody else laughed old morgan was too solemn and the whole room was hushed dead as night for a minute even nolan lost his swagger in a moment then morgan added mr marshal take the prisoner to orleans in an armed boat and deliver him to the naval commander there the marshal gave his orders and the prisoner was taken out of court mr marshal continued old morgan see that no one mentions the united states to the prisoner mr marshal make my respects to lieutenant mitchell at orleans and request him to order that no one shall mention the united states to the prisoner while he is on board ship you will receive your written orders from the officer on duty here this evening the court is adjourned without day i have always supposed that colonel morgan himself took the proceedings of the court to washington city and explained them to mr jefferson certain it is that the president approved themcertain that is if i may believe the men who say they have seen his signature before the nautilus got round from new orleans to the northern atlantic coast with the prisoner on board the sentence had been approved and he was a man without a country the plan then adopted was substantially the same which was necessarily followed ever after perhaps it was suggested by the necessity of sending him by water from fort adams and orleans the secretary of the navyit must have been the first crowninshield though he is a man i do not rememberwas requested to put nolan on board a government vessel bound on a long cruise and to direct that he should be only so far confined there as to make it certain that he never saw or heard of the country we had few long cruises then and the navy was very much out of favor and as almost all of this story is traditional as i have explained i do not know certainly what his first cruise was but the commander to whom he was intrustedperhaps it was tingey or shaw though i think it was one of the younger menwe are all old enough nowregulated the etiquette and the precautions of the affair and according to his scheme they were carried out i suppose till nolan died when i was second officer of the intrepid some thirty years after i saw the original paper of instructions i have been sorry ever since that i did not copy the whole of it it ran however much in this way washington with the date which must have been late in  siryou will receive from lieutenant neale the person of philip nolan late a lieutenant in the united states army this person on his trial by courtmartial expressed with an oath the wish that he might never hear of the united states again the court sentenced him to have his wish fulfilled for the present the execution of the order is intrusted by the president to this department you will take the prisoner on board your ship and keep him there with such precautions as shall prevent his escape you will provide him with such quarters rations and clothing as would be proper for an officer of his late rank if he were a passenger on your vessel on the business of his government the gentlemen on board will make any arrangements agreeable to themselves regarding his society he is to be exposed to no indignity of any kind nor is he ever unnecessarily to be reminded that he is a prisoner but under no circumstances is he ever to hear of his country or to see any information regarding it and you will specially caution all the officers under your command to take care that in the various indulgences which may be granted this rule in which his punishment is involved shall not be broken it is the intention of the government that he shall never again see the country which he has disowned before the end of your cruise you will receive orders which will give effect to this intention respectfully yours w southard for the secretary of the navy if i had only preserved the whole of this paper there would be no break in the beginning of my sketch of this story for captain shaw if it was he handed it to his successor in the charge and he to his and i suppose the commander of the levant has it today as his authority for keeping this man in this mild custody the rule adopted on board the ships on which i have met the man without a country was i think transmitted from the beginning no mess liked to have him permanently because his presence cut off all talk of home or of the prospect of return of politics or letters of peace or of warcut off more than half the talk men like to have at sea but it was always thought too hard that he should never meet the rest of us except to touch hats and we finally sank into one system he was not permitted to talk with the men unless an officer was by with officers he had unrestrained intercourse as far as they and he chose but he grew shy though he had favorites i was one then the captain always asked him to dinner on monday every mess in succession took up the invitation in its turn according to the size of the ship you had him at your mess more or less often at dinner his breakfast he ate in his own stateroomhe always had a stateroomwhich was where a sentinel or somebody on the watch could see the door and whatever else he ate or drank he ate or drank alone sometimes when the marines or sailors had any special jollification they were permitted to invite plainbuttons as they called him then nolan was sent with some officer and the men were forbidden to speak of home while he was there i believe the theory was that the sight of his punishment did them good they called him plainbuttons because while he always chose to wear a regulation armyuniform he was not permitted to wear the armybutton for the reason that it bore either the initials or the insignia of the country he had disowned i remember soon after i joined the navy i was on shore with some of the older officers from our ship and from the brandywine which we had met at alexandria we had leave to make a party and go up to cairo and the pyramids as we jogged along you went on donkeys then some of the gentleman we boys called them dons but the phrase was long since changed fell to talking about nolan and some one told the system which was adopted from the first about his books and other reading as he was almost never permitted to go on shore even though the vessel lay in port for months his time at the best hung heavy and everybody was permitted to lend him books if they were not published in america and made no allusion to it these were common enough in the old days when people in the other hemisphere talked of the united states as little as we do of paraguay he had almost all the foreign papers that came into the ship sooner or later only somebody must go over them first and cut out any advertisement or stray paragraph that alluded to america this was a little cruel sometimes when the back of what was cut out might be as innocent as hesiod right in the midst of one of napoleons battles or one of cannings speeches poor nolan would find a great hole because on the back of the page of that paper there had been an advertisement of a packet for new york or a scrap from the presidents message i say this was the first time i ever heard of this plan which afterwards i had enough and more than enough to do with i remember it because poor phillips who was of the party as soon as the allusion to reading was made told a story of something which happened at the cape of good hope on nolans first voyage and it is the only thing i ever knew of that voyage they had touched at the cape and had done the civil thing with the english admiral and the fleet and then leaving for a long cruise up the indian ocean phillips had borrowed a lot of english books from an officer which in those days as indeed in these was quite a windfall among them as the devil would order was the lay of the last minstrel which they had all of them heard of but which most of them had never seen i think it could not have been published long well nobody thought there could be any risk of anything national in that though phillips swore old shaw had cut out the tempest from shakespeare before he let nolan have it because he said the bermudas ought to be ours and by jove should be one day so nolan was permitted to join the circle one afternoon when a lot of them sat on deck smoking and reading aloud people do not do such things so often now but when i was young we got rid of a great deal of time so well so it happened that in his turn nolan took the book and read to the others and he read very well as i know nobody in the circle knew a line of the poem only it was all magic and border chivalry and was ten thousand years ago poor nolan read steadily through the fifth canto stopped a minute and drank something and then began without a thought of what was coming breathes there the man with soul so dead who never to himself hath said it seems impossible to us that anybody ever heard this for the first time but all these fellows did then and poor nolan himself went on still unconsciously or mechanically this is my own my native land then they all saw something was to pay but he expected to get through i suppose turned a little pale but plunged on whose heart hath neer within him burned as home his footsteps he hath turned from wandering on a foreign strand if such there breathe go mark him well by this time the men were all beside themselves wishing there was any way to make him turn over two pages but he had not quite presence of mind for that he gagged a little colored crimson and staggered on for him no minstrel raptures swell high though his titles proud his name boundless his wealth as wish can claim despite these titles power and pelf the wretch concentred all in self and here the poor fellow choked could not go on but started up swung the book into the sea vanished into his stateroom and by jove said phillips we did not see him for two months again and i had to make up some beggarly story to that english surgeon why i did not return his walter scott to him that story shows about the time when nolans braggadocio must have broken down at first they said he took a very high tone considered his imprisonment a mere farce affected to enjoy the voyage and all that but phillips said that after he came out of his stateroom he never was the same man again he never read aloud again unless it was the bible or shakespeare or something else he was sure of but it was not that merely he never entered in with the other young men exactly as a companion again he was always shy afterwards when i knew himvery seldom spoke unless he was spoken to except to a very few friends he lighted up occasionallyi remember late in his life hearing him fairly eloquent on something which had been suggested to him by one of flchiers sermonsbut generally he had the nervous tired look of a heartwounded man when captain shaw was coming homeif as i say it was shawrather to the surprise of everybody they made one of the windward islands and lay off and on for nearly a week the boys said the officers were sick of saltjunk and meant to have turtlesoup before they came home but after several days the warren came to the same rendezvous they exchanged signals she sent to phillips and these homewardbound men letters and papers and told them she was outwardbound perhaps to the mediterranean and took poor nolan and his traps on the boat back to try his second cruise he looked very blank when he was told to get ready to join her he had known enough of the signs of the sky to know that till that moment he was going home but this was a distinct evidence of something he had not thought of perhapsthat there was no going home for him even to a prison and this was the first of some twenty such transfers which brought him sooner or later into half our best vessels but which kept him all his life at least some hundred miles from the country he had hoped he might never hear of again it may have been on that second cruiseit was once when he was up the mediterraneanthat mrs graff the celebrated southern beauty of those days danced with him they had been lying a long time in the bay of naples and the officers were very intimate in the english fleet and there had been great festivities and our men thought they must give a great ball on board the ship how they ever did it on board the warren i am sure i do not know perhaps it was not the warren or perhaps ladies did not take up so much room as they do now they wanted to use nolans stateroom for something and they hated to do it without asking him to the ball so the captain said they might ask him if they would be responsible that he did not talk with the wrong people who would give him intelligence so the dance went on the finest party that had ever been known i dare say for i never heard of a manofwar ball that was not for ladies they had the family of the american consul one or two travellers who had adventured so far and a nice bevy of english girls and matrons perhaps lady hamilton herself well different officers relieved each other in standing and talking with nolan in a friendly way so as to be sure that nobody else spoke to him the dancing went on with spirit and after a while even the fellows who took this honorary guard of nolan ceased to fear any contretemps only when some english ladylady hamilton as i said perhapscalled for a set of american dances an odd thing happened everybody then danced contradances the black band nothing loath conferred as to what american dances were and started off with virginia reel which they followed with moneymusk which in its turn in those days should have been followed by the old thirteen but just as dick the leader tapped for his fiddles to begin and bent forward about to say in true negro state the old thirteen gentlemen and ladies as he had said virginny reel if you please and moneymusk if you please the captains boy tapped him on the shoulder whispered to him and he did not announce the name of the dance he merely bowed began on the air and they all fell tothe officers teaching the english girls the figure but not telling them why it had no name but that is not the story i started to tellas the dancing went on nolan and our fellows all got at ease as i saidso much so that it seemed quite natural for him to bow to that splendid mrs graff and say i hope you have not forgotten me miss rutledge shall i have the honor of dancing he did it so quickly that fellows who was by him could not hinder him she laughed and said i am not miss rutledge any longer mr nolan but i will dance all the same just nodded to fellows as if to say he must leave mr nolan to her and led him off to the place where the dance was forming nolan thought he had got his chance he had known her at philadelphia and at other places had met her and this was a godsend you could not talk in contradances as you do in cotillons or even in the pauses of waltzing but there were chances for tongues and sounds as well as for eyes and blushes he began with her travels and europe and vesuvius and the french and then when they had worked down and had that long talkingtime at the bottom of the set he said boldlya little pale she said as she told me the story years after and what do you hear from home mrs graff and that splendid creature looked through him jove how she must have looked through him home mr nolan i thought you were the man who never wanted to hear of home againand she walked directly up the deck to her husband and left poor nolan alone as he always washe did not dance again i cannot give any history of him in order nobody can now and indeed i am not trying to these are the traditions which i sort out as i believe them from the myths which have been told about this man for forty years the lies that have been told about him are legion the fellows used to say he was the iron mask and poor george pons went to his grave in the belief that this was the author of junius who was being punished for his celebrated libel on thomas jefferson pons was not very strong in the historical line a happier story than either of these i have told is of the war that came along soon after i have heard this affair told in three or four waysand indeed it may have happened more than once but which ship it was on i cannot tell however in one at least of the great frigateduels with the english in which the navy was really baptized it happened that a roundshot from the enemy entered one of our ports square and took right down the officer of the gun himself and almost every man of the guns crew now you may say what you choose about courage but that is not a nice thing to see but as the men who were not killed picked themselves up and as they and the surgeons people were carrying off the bodies there appeared nolan in his shirtsleeves with the rammer in his hand and just as if he had been the officer told them off with authoritywho should go to the cockpit with the wounded men who should stay with himperfectly cheery and with that way which makes men feel sure all is right and is going to be right and he finished loading the gun with his own hands aimed it and bade the men fire and there he stayed captain of that gun keeping those fellows in spirits till the enemy strucksitting on the carriage while the gun was cooling though he was exposed all the timeshowing them easier ways to handle heavy shotmaking the raw hands laugh at their own blundersand when the gun cooled again getting it loaded and fired twice as often as any other gun on the ship the captain walked forward by way of encouraging the men and nolan touched his hat and said i am showing them how we do this in the artillery sir and this is the part of the story where all the legends agree that the commodore said i see you do and i thank you sir and i shall never forget this day sir and you never shall sir and after the whole thing was over and he had the englishmans sword in the midst of the state and ceremony of the quarterdeck he said where is mr nolan ask mr nolan to come here and when nolan came the captain said mr nolan we are all very grateful to you today you are one of us today you will be named in the despatches and then the old man took off his own sword of ceremony and gave it to nolan and made him put it on the man told me this who saw it nolan cried like a baby and well he might he had not worn a sword since that infernal day at fort adams but always afterwards on occasions of ceremony he wore that quaint old french sword of the commodores the captain did mention him in the despatches it was always said he asked that he might be pardoned he wrote a special letter to the secretary of war but nothing ever came of it as i said that was about the time when they began to ignore the whole transaction at washington and when nolans imprisonment began to carry itself on because there was nobody to stop it without any new orders from home i have heard it said that he was with porter when he took possession of the nukahiwa islands not this porter you know but old porter his father essex porterthat is the old essex porter not this essex as an artillery officer who had seen service in the west nolan knew more about fortifications embrasures ravelins stockades and all that than any of them did and he worked with a right goodwill in fixing that battery all right i have always thought it was a pity porter did not leave him in command there with gamble that would have settled all the question about his punishment we should have kept the islands and at this moment we should have one station in the pacific ocean our french friends too when they wanted this little wateringplace would have found it was preoccupied but madison and the virginians of course flung all that away all that was near fifty years ago if nolan was thirty then he must have been near eighty when he died he looked sixty when he was forty but he never seemed to me to change a hair afterwards as i imagine his life from what i have seen and heard of it he must have been in every sea and yet almost never on land he must have known in a formal way more officers in our service than any man living knows he told me once with a grave smile that no man in the world lived so methodical a life as he you know the boys say i am the iron mask and you know how busy he was he said it did not do for any one to try to read all the time more than to do anything else all the time but that he read just five hours a day then he said i keep up my notebooks writing in them at such and such hours from what i have been reading and i include in these my scrapbooks these were very curious indeed he had six or eight of different subjects there was one of history one of natural science one which he called odds and ends but they were not merely books of extracts from newspapers they had bits of plants and ribbons shells tied on and carved scraps of bone and wood which he had taught the men to cut for him and they were beautifully illustrated he drew admirably he had some of the funniest drawings there and some of the most pathetic that i have ever seen in my life i wonder who will have nolans scrapbooks well he said his reading and his notes were his profession and that they took five hours and two hours respectively of each day then said he every man should have a diversion as well as a profession my natural history is my diversion that took two hours a day more the men used to bring him birds and fish but on a long cruise he had to satisfy himself with centipedes and cockroaches and such small game he was the only naturalist i ever met who knew anything about the habits of the housefly and the mosquito all those people can tell you whether they are lepidoptera or steptopotera but as for telling how you can get rid of them or how they get away from you when you strike themwhy linnus knew as little of that as john foy the idiot did these nine hours made nolans regular daily occupation the rest of the time he talked or walked till he grew very old he went aloft a great deal he always kept up his exercise and i never heard that he was ill if any other man was ill he was the kindest nurse in the world and he knew more than half the surgeons do then if anybody was sick or died or if the captain wanted him to on any other occasion he was always ready to read prayers i have said that he read beautifully my own acquaintance with philip nolan began six or eight years after the war on my first voyage after i was appointed a midshipman it was in the first days after our slavetrade treaty while the reigning house which was still the house of virginia had still a sort of sentimentalism about the suppression of the horrors of the middle passage and something was sometimes done that way we were in the south atlantic on that business from the time i joined i believe i thought nolan was a sort of lay chaplaina chaplain with a blue coat i never asked about him everything in the ship was strange to me i knew it was green to ask questions and i suppose i thought there was a plainbuttons on every ship we had him to dine in our mess once a week and the caution was given that on that day nothing was to be said about home but if they had told us not to say anything about the planet mars or the book of deuteronomy i should not have asked why there were a great many things which seemed to me to have as little reason i first came to understand anything about the man without a country one day when we overhauled a dirty little schooner which had slaves on board an officer was sent to take charge of her and after a few minutes he sent back his boat to ask that some one might be sent him who could speak portuguese we were all looking over the rail when the message came and we all wished we could interpret when the captain asked who spoke portuguese but none of the officers did and just as the captain was sending forward to ask if any of the people could nolan stepped out and said he should be glad to interpret if the captain wished as he understood the language the captain thanked him fitted out another boat with him and in this boat it was my luck to go when we got there it was such a scene as you seldom see and never want to nastiness beyond account and chaos run loose in the midst of the nastiness there were not a great many of the negroes but by way of making what there were understand that they were free vaughan had had their handcuffs and anklecuffs knocked off and for convenience sake was putting them upon the rascals of the schooners crew the negroes were most of them out of the hold and swarming all round the dirty deck with a central throng surrounding vaughan and addressing him in every dialect and patois of a dialect from the zulu click up to the parisian of beledeljereed as we came on deck vaughan looked down from a hogshead on which he had mounted in desperation and said for gods love is there anybody who can make these wretches understand something the men gave them rum and that did not quiet them i knocked that big fellow down twice and that did not soothe him and then i talked choctaw to all of them together and ill be hanged if they understood that as well as they understood the english nolan said he could speak portuguese and one or two finelooking kroomen were dragged out who as it had been found already had worked for the portuguese on the coast at fernando po tell them they are free said vaughan and tell them that these rascals are to be hanged as soon as we can get rope enough nolan put that into spanishthat is he explained it in such portuguese as the kroomen could understand and they in turn to such of the negroes as could understand them then there was such a yell of delight clinching of fists leaping and dancing kissing of nolans feet and a general rush made to the hogshead by way of spontaneous worship of vaughan as the deus ex machina of the occasion tell them said vaughan well pleased that i will take them all to cape palmas this did not answer so well cape palmas was practically as far from the homes of most of them as new orleans or rio janeiro was that is they would be eternally separated from home there and their interpreters as we could understand instantly said ah non palmas and began to propose infinite other expedients in most voluble language vaughan was rather disappointed at this result of his liberality and asked nolan eagerly what they said the drops stood on poor nolans white forehead as he hushed the men down and said he says not palmas he says take us home take us to our own country take us to our own house take us to our own pickaninnies and our own women he says he has an old father and mother who will die if they do not see him and this one says he left his people all sick and paddled down to fernando to beg the white doctor to come and help them and that these devils caught him in the bay just in sight of home and that he has never seen anybody from home since then and this one says choked out nolan that he has not heard a word from his home in six months while he hats been locked up in an infernal barracoon vaughan always said he grew gray himself while nolan struggled through this interpretation i who did not understand anything of the passion involved in it saw that the very elements were melting with fervent heat and that something was to pay somewhere even the negroes themselves stopped howling as they saw nolans agony and vaughans almost equal agony of sympathy as quick as he could get words he said tell them yes yes yes tell them they shall go to the mountains of the moon if they will if i sail the schooner through the great white desert they shall go home and after some fashion nolan said so and then they all fell to kissing him again and wanted to rub his nose with theirs but he could not stand it long and getting vaughan to say he might go back he beckoned me down into our boat as we lay back in the sternsheets and the men gave way he said to meyoungster let that show you what it is to be without a family without a home and without a country and if you are ever tempted to say a word or to do a thing that shall put a bar between you and your family your home and your country pray god in his mercy to take you that instant home to his own heaven stick by your family boy forget you have a self while you do everything for them think of your home boy write and send and talk about it let it be nearer and nearer to your thought the farther you have to travel from it and rush back to it when you are free as that poor black slave is doing now and for your country boy and the words rattled in his throat and for that flag and he pointed to the ship never dream a dream but of serving her as she bids you though the service carry you through a thousand hells no matter what happens to you no matter who flatters you or who abuses you never look at another flag never let a night pass but you pray god to bless that flag remember boy that behind all these men you have to do with behind officers and government and people even there is the country herself your country and that you belong to her as you belong to your own mother stand by her boy as you would stand by your mother if those devils there had got hold of her today i was frightened to death by his calm hard passion but i blundered out that i would by all that was holy and that i had never thought of doing anything else he hardly seemed to hear me but he did almost in a whisper sayoh if anybody had said so to me when i was of your age i think it was this halfconfidence of his which i never abused for i never told this story till now which afterward made us great friends he was very kind to me often he sat up or even got up at night to walk the deck with me when it was my watch he explained to me a great deal of my mathematics and i owe to him my taste for mathematics he lent me books and helped me about my reading he never alluded so directly to his story again but from one and another officer i have learned in thirty years what i am telling when we parted from him in st thomas harbor at the end of our cruise i was more sorry than i can tell i was very glad to meet him again in  and later in life when i thought i had some influence in washington i moved heaven and earth to have him discharged but it was like getting a ghost out of prison they pretended there was no such man and never was such a man they will say so at the department ment now perhaps they do not know it will not be the first thing in the service of which the department appears to know nothing there is a story that nolan met burr once on one of our vessels when a party of americans came on board in the mediterranean but this i believe to be a lie or rather it is a myth ben trovato involving a tremendous blowingup with which he sunk burrasking him how he liked to be without a country but it is clear from burrs life that nothing of the sort could have happened and i mention this only as an illustration of the stories which get agoing where there is the least mystery at bottom so poor philip nolan had his wish fulfilled i know but one fate more dreadful it is the fate reserved for those men who shall have one day to exile themselves from their country because they have attempted her ruin and shall have at the same time to see the prosperity and honor to which she rises when she has rid herself of them and their iniquities the wish of poor nolan as we all learned to call him not because his punishment was too great but because his repentance was so clear was precisely the wish of every bragg and beauregard who broke a soldiers oath two years ago and of every maury and barron who broke a sailors i do not know how often they have repented i do know that they have done all that in them lay that they might have no countrythat all the honors associations memories and hopes which belong to country might be broken up into little shreds and distributed to the winds i know too that their punishment as they vegetate through what is left of life to them in wretched boulognes and leicester squares where they are destined to upbraid each other till they die will have all the agony of nolans with the added pang that every one who sees them will see them to despise and to execrate them they will have their wish like him for him poor fellow he repented of his folly and then like a man submitted to the fate he had asked for he never intentionally added to the difficulty or delicacy of the charge of those who had him in hold accidents would happen but they never happened from his fault lieutenant truxton told me that when texas was annexed there was a careful discussion among the officers whether they should get hold of nolans handsome set of maps and cut texas out of itfrom the map of the world and the map of mexico the united states had been cut out when the atlas was bought for him but it was voted rightly enough that to do this would be virtually to reveal to him what had happened or as harry cole said to make him think old burr had succeeded so it was from no fault of nolans that a great botch happened at my own table when for a short time i was in command of the george washington corvette on the southamerican station we were lying in the la plata and some of the officers who had been on shore and had just joined again were entertaining us with accounts of their misadventures in riding the halfwild horses of buenos ayres nolan was at table and was in an unusually bright and talkative mood some story of a tumble reminded him of an adventure of his own when he was catching wild horses in texas with his brother stephen at a time when he must have been quite a boy he told the story with a good deal of spiritso much so that the silence which often follows a good story hung over the table for an instant to be broken by nolan himself for he asked perfectly unconsciously pray what has become of texas after the mexicans got their independence i thought that province of texas would come forward very fast it is really one of the finest regions on earth it is the italy of this continent but i have not seen or heard a word of texas for near twenty years there were two texan officers at the table the reason he had never heard of texas was that texas and her affairs had been painfully cut out of his newspapers since austin began his settlements so that while he read of honduras and tamaulipas and till quite lately of californiathis virgin province in which his brother had travelled so far and i believe had died had ceased to be to him waters and williams the two texas men looked grimly at each other and tried not to laugh edward morris had his attention attracted by the third link in the chain of the captains chandelier watrous was seized with a convulsion of sneezing nolan himself saw that something was to pay he did not know what and i as master of the feast had to say texas is out of the map mr nolan have you seen captain backs curious account of sir thomas roes welcome after that cruise i never saw nolan again i wrote to him at least twice a year for in that voyage we became even confidentially intimate but he never wrote to me the other men tell me that in those fifteen years he aged very fast as well he might indeed but that he was still the same gentle uncomplaining silent sufferer that he ever was bearing as best he could his selfappointed punishmentrather less social perhaps with new men whom he did not know but more anxious apparently than ever to serve and befriend and teach the boys some of whom fairly seemed to worship him and now it seems the dear old fellow is dead he has found a home at last and a country since writing this and while considering whether or no i would print it as a warning to the young nolans and vallandighams and tatnals of today of what it is to throw away a country i have received from danforth who is on board the levant a letter which gives an account of nolans last hours it removes all my doubts about telling this story to understand the first words of the letter the nonprofessional reader should remember that after  the position of every officer who had nolan in charge was one of the greatest delicacy the government had failed to renew the order of  regarding him what was a man to do should he let him go what then if he were called to account by the department for violating the order of  should he keep him what then if nolan should be liberated some day and should bring an action for false imprisonment or kidnapping against every man who had had him in charge i urged and pressed this upon southard and i have reason to think that other officers did the same thing but the secretary always said as they so often do at washington that there were no special orders to give and that we must act on our own judgment that means if you succeed you will be sustained if you fail you will be disavowed well as danforth says all that is over now though i do not know but i expose myself to a criminal prosecution on the evidence of the very revelation i am making here is the letter levant   s   w dear fredi try to find heart and life to tell you that it is all over with dear old nolan i have been with him on this voyage more than i ever was and i can understand wholly now the way in which you used to speak of the dear old fellow i could see that he was not strong but i had no idea the end was so near the doctor has been watching him very carefully and yesterday morning came to me and told me that nolan was not so well and had not left his staterooma thing i never remember before he had let the doctor come and see him as he lay therethe first time the doctor had been in the stateroomand he said he should like to see me o dear do you remember the mysteries we boys used to invent about his room in the old intrepid days well i went in and there to be sure the poor fellow lay in his berth smiling pleasantly as he gave me his hand but looking very frail i could not help a glance round which showed me what a little shrine he had made of the box he was lying in the stars and stripes were triced up above and around a picture of washington and he had painted a majestic eagle with lightnings blazing from his beak and his foot just clasping the whole globe which his wings overshadowed the dear old boy saw my glance and said with a sad smile here you see i have a country and then he pointed to the foot of his bed where i had not seen before a great map of the united states as he had drawn it from memory and which he had there to look upon as he lay quaint queer old names were on it in large letters indiana territory mississippi territory and louisiana territory as i suppose our fathers learned such things but the old fellow had patched in texas too he had carried his western boundary all the way to the pacific but on that shore he had defined nothing o danforth he said i know i am dying i cannot get home surely you will tell me something nowstop stop do not speak till i say what i am sure you know that there is not in this ship that there is not in americagod bless hera more loyal man than i there cannot be a man who loves the old flag as i do or prays for it as i do or hopes for it as i do there are thirtyfour stars in it now danforth i thank god for that though i do not know what their names are there has never been one taken away i thank god for that i know by that that there has never been any successful burr o danforth danforth he sighed out how like a wretched nights dream a boys idea of personal fame or of separate sovereignty seems when one looks back on it after such a life as mine but tell metell me somethingtell me everything danforth before i die ingham i swear to you that i felt like a monster that i had not told him everything before danger or no danger delicacy or no delicacy who was i that i should have been acting the tyrant all this time over this dear sainted old man who had years ago expiated in his whole manhoods life the madness of a boys treason mr nolan said i i will tell you everything you ask about only where shall i begin o the blessed smile that crept over his white face and he pressed my hand and said god bless you tell me their names he said and he pointed to the stars on the flag the last i know is ohio my father lived in kentucky but i have guessed michigan and indiana and mississippithat was where fort adams isthey make twenty but where are your other fourteen you have not cut up any of the old ones i hope well that was not a bad text and i told him the names in as good order as i could and he bade me take down his beautiful map and draw them in as i best could with my pencil he was wild with delight about texas told me how his brother died there he had marked a gold cross where he supposed his brothers grave was and he had guessed at texas then he was delighted as he saw california and oregonthat he said he had suspected partly because he had never been permitted to land on that shore though the ships were there so much and the men said he laughing brought off a good deal besides furs then he went backheavens how farto ask about the chesapeake and what was done to barron for surrendering her to the leopard and whether burr ever tried againand he ground his teeth with the only passion he showed but in a moment that was over and he said god forgive me for i am sure i forgive him then he asked about the old wartold me the true story of his serving the gun the day we took the javaasked about dear old david porter as he called him then he settled down more quietly and very happily to hear me tell in an hour the history of fifty years how i wished it had been somebody who knew something but i did as well as i could i told him of the english war i told him about fulton and the steamboat beginning i told him about old scott and jackson told him all i could think about the mississippi and new orleans and texas and his own old kentucky and do you think he asked who was in command of the legion of the west i told him it was a very gallant officer named grant and that by our last news he was about to establish his headquarters at vicksburg then where was vicksburg i worked that out on the map it was about a hundred miles more or less above his old fort adams and i thought fort adams must be a ruin now it must be at old vicks plantation said he well that is a change i tell you ingham it was a hard thing to condense the history of half a century into that talk with a sick man and i do not now know what i told himof emigration and the means of itof steamboats and railroads and telegraphsof inventions and books and literatureof the colleges and west point and the naval schoolbut with the queerest interruptions that ever you heard you see it was robinson crusoe asking all the accumulated questions of fiftysix years i remember he asked all of a sudden who was president now and when i told him he asked if old abe was general benjamin lincolns son he said he met old general lincoln when he was quite a boy himself at some indian treaty i said no that old abe was a kentuckian like himself but i could not tell him of what family he had worked up from the ranks good for him cried nolan i am glad of that as i have brooded and wondered i have thought our danger was in keeping up those regular successions in the first families then i got talking about my visit to washington i told him of meeting the oregon congressman harding i told him about the smithsonian and the exploring expedition i told him about the capitol and the statues for the pediment and crawfords liberty and greenoughs washington ingham i told him everything i could think of that would show the grandeur of his country and its prosperity but i could not make up my mouth to tell him a word about this infernal rebellion and he drank it in and enjoyed it as i cannot tell you he grew more and more silent yet i never thought he was tired or faint i gave him a glass of water but he just wet his lips and told me not to go away then he asked me to bring the presbyterian book of public prayer which lay there and said with a smile that it would open at the right placeand so it did there was his double red mark down the page and i knelt down and read and he repeated with me for ourselves and our country o gracious god we thank thee that notwithstanding our manifold transgressions of thy holy laws thou hast continued to us thy marvellous kindnessand so to the end of that thanksgiving then he turned to the end of the same book and i read the words more familiar to memost heartily we beseech thee with thy favor to behold and bless thy servant the president of the united states and all others in authorityand the rest of the episcopal collect danforth said he i have repeated those prayers night and morning it is now fiftyfive years and then he said he would go to sleep he bent me down over him and kissed me and he said look in my bible danforth when i am gone and i went away but i had no thought it was the end i thought he was tired and would sleep i knew he was happy and i wanted him to be alone but in an hour when the doctor went in gently he found nolan had breathed his life away with a smile he had something pressed close to his lips it was his fathers badge of the order of cincinnati we looked in his bible and there was a slip of paper at the place where he had marked the text they desire a country even a heavenly wherefore god is not ashamed to be called their god for he hath prepared for them a city on this slip of paper he had written bury me in the sea it has been my home and i love it but will not some one set up a stone for my memory at fort adams or at orleans that my disgrace may not be more than i ought to bear say on it in memory of philip nolan lieutenant in the army of the united states he loved his country as no other man has loved her but no man deserved less at her hands southern sketches cecil gray

from the sky the stars were shining bright and as the pale moon arose in queenly beauty it shone through the window of a noble mansion in a mantling with its silver lines the beautiful face of cecil

billetdoux lying open before her i am sure we will not be seen by her as her thoughts are too intent upon other things stop i have seen it tis the name of walter earnest cecil gray thinks she loves him yet the image of another dearer is ever rising before her mind as it grows more and more distinct yet she feels that to banish or strive to cease thinking of elbert grant will accom plish her purpose for will not an outward show of affection be sufficient for walter earnest and is he not rich and distingu ished as an eminent lawyer yes it is decided walter eernest and no other shall gain the hand of cecil gray so away with your wooing elbert grant for cecil gray is the affianced bride of walter earnest what a victory to achieve after having made many hearts ache beneath her bewitching glance such were the thoughts of the proud beauty as we found her so intent upon the futurethe glory of the eclat that would follow her debut as ars lawyer earnest her train of thought however did not remain so triumphant very long for an approaching footstep and a ring at the hall door warned her to prepare with her many fascinating gracest for a visitor walter e i know said cecil as she approached to open the door herself and with a smile but not for elbert grant for it was no other than he she bade him enter and be seated the sudden pallor that oer spread her features betrayed an uneasy feeling but to elbert grant cecil was lovelier than ever twas some moments before either spoke a word and when elbert grant did speak he broached upon a subject too painful to cecil for her to hide her real feelings what cecil gray said elbert grant after giving me every encouragement necessary to confirm it in my mind that i was a favored suitor and to one beloved after having to un      derstand that you have trifled with my feelings i am now to be spurned and too after having poured out my all of love upon the shrine i thought so willing to return my adoration what is my return the dissembling smiles of an accomplished coquette is all i have for requital for my almost sacred worship speak not so elbert grant said the pale and agitated cecil but not deigning a reply and murmuring a hasty fare well elbert grant departed and with a heavy heart did he pace the floor of his apartment a small office in a plainly but neatly furnished containing a few of the luxuries of a student of medicine unlike the sump tuous apartments of walter earnest walter e and elbert grant had been friends and associates from childhood but now that they both strove to gain the same prizerivals in love there was a growing enmity existing between them that it seemed nought could eradicate chapter   ii after elbert grant departed cecil burst into a flood of tears and with the most agonizing feelings prepared to dress herself thr an evening party to which w earnest had promised to ac company her after having gone through with all the graces of her toilet and her maid having pronounced her dress complete she quietly surveyed herself in an opposite mirror and with a haughty air she asked of her maid do you not think me a prize worthy to be gained by any suitorof course her maid answered the question satisfactorily and after having flattered her with all the honeyed words she knew was requisite to satisfy her mis tresss pride she descended the stairs with her mistress and going before her to open the parlor door they were suddenly confionted by w earnest who after passing the usual compli ments upon the costume of his fair one he proffered his arm for her acceptance bowing a triumphant assent she took it and its being the hour to repair to the soiree at mrs wilsons and as it was but a short distance from cecils fathers they were soon mingling in the gay and mirthful crowd cecil gray was pronounced the belle of that bright assembly and as murmurs of admiration ran through the gay crowd all were willing to declare cecil gray the brightest star among them there was one who watched her with an untiring eye and whose thoughts were upon her alone little dreaming that the haughty cecil gray was struggling between the duty of love for him and the smiles of a golden fortune cecil grays parents were not rich but were styled well off and through many worldly trials and hard struggles had suc ceeded in laying up a small store for cecil after giving her a sound education and as they said after making a lady of her  they trusted her beauty for the rest thus far she had succeed  ed in playing her cards well as to the marrying of fortune for she was soon to be the bride of walter e     chapter iii cecil after having mingled for some the in the gay dance until she was beginning to feel fatigued she sought the quiet of an adjoining gallery where in its solitude she strove to lull the wild throbbings of her breast but it was not there to be found for elbert grant noticed her departure and as he had went there alone to get an opportunity to speak to her it was all he wished and as he followed her he was soon by her side cecil seemed very much surprised but recovering her self possession she bowed a cold good evening to elbert grant who scarcely noting the condescension sprang to her side and with hurried and passionate vehemence exclaimed oh cecil precious cecil can i not hope yet will you not give me one hope to cling to tis hard to part from my hearts idol give it up forever cecil gray would have given the world to soothe his sorrow but she could not give up the thought of a glittering fortune  and striving to speak with more determination she replied to his passionate appeal elbert grant there is many a fairer form than mine many a brighter eye a sweeter smile that can live for you go and seek so said elbert you bid me go quit the land of my nati vity forever yes i will go but not to seels at your command but go retaining the undying love within my breast for you farewelloh cecil gray remember he departed and it was well for cecil as walter e was not long waiting for her but was soon by her side and with a look of some surprise asked why this seclusion fair cecil when so many are waiting your coming and pointing at the same time to the dancers said there is no life without you cecil could scarcely suppress a tear as she took his arm to re sume her place among the dancers the music soon was hushed the sound of rushing feet was still and quiet reigned once more at mrs wilsons two clock found cecil and walter earnest on their way home walter e  was silent for some moments when he suddenly turned to cecil and asked her if she had seen elbert grant at he party or whether she had spoken to him or not cecil would fain have denied speaking to him but she feared she had been discovered and as she answered and told him where she iad seen him w earnest felt a pang of jealousy and with a slight tremor in his voice that betrayed the workings of his passion he remarked that e grant did not remain long at the party and inquired were you the cause of his sudden departure i say cecil e candid with me perhaps i was replied cecil perhaps you are not certain then i am certain said walter earnest  for after looking in for a brighter eye and a     l   sweeter smile he departed beware cecil gray resumed walter earnest if there is any attachment existing between you and elbert grant i am nt the man to be deceived why do you speak thus said cecil  have i ever given you any reason to think that after giving you my heart and hand that another is preferred  god forbid said walter earnest and after exchanging re peated vows of constancy they separated at the door of cecils house cecil gray to the slumberless rest of an uneasy mind and walter earnest to bask in dreams of love and happiness chapter iv time wore on marked with a fleeting breath to walter ear nest how he longed to clasp cecil gray to his heart and call her wife and with a growing impatience he again sought her fathers residence when finding cecil in all the charms of lan guid loveliness he beseeched her with all the eloquence of love to set the day that would complete his happiness she finally blessed him with the promise of an appointed day which was the th of july  great preparations were being made at graylount for the approaching event which was to launch cecil gray on the ocean of matrimony oh how happy was walter earnest and with all the pride of a chosen he invited his numerous friends to partake of the good cheer of his wedding morn after inviting all that he could well rememberhe did not forget to seek out elbert grant as one of the select invited ungenerous walter he only wished him to behold the consum lmation of his own misery but elbert grant was gone walter made several inquiries as to where elbert was gone but none led to his discovery walter earnest after finding his search fruitless returned to his office and then with the help of various superfluitiespomatum and broad clothhe soon came out a polished bridegroom and soon amiidst the numerous congratulations of his friends accompanied by them he repaired to gray mount where after greeting the vast assembly there and having been sufficiently  flattered by all he could wait no longer and with what a happy smile did walter earnest stand by his fair bride and with a clear deep voice vowed faith and constancy unto the end cecil grays voice trembled as she was bade by the aged pas tor to take walter earnest as her own forever her words were scarcely audible such were the deep emotions of her heart yet all thought cecil gray happy how she wished she had never seen walter earnest how she prayed that death might relieve her ah vain vain cecil gray too late came your sad regrets pledged you are won as the wife of walter earnest who thinks that he alone is beloved by you    l  chapter v elegantly and expensively furnished was the future house of cecil earnest with all the luxuries that southern wealth could afford and after remaining a few days longer at her fathers house cecil bade adieu to the scenes made dear by associations from cehildhood and sought with walter earnest the comforts of their own fireside in vain cecil strove to be happy all the endearing epithets that were all her own all the tender smiles that walter cast upon her failed to call forth one beam of happiness yet wal ter earnest believed cecil happy believed that all her smiles were reflected from a true heart that lived for him alone  how well did cecil deceive him making him content for a while with an outward show of affection but it was not long so walter earnest soon learned to feel wretched to know that his wife did not exhibit the right kind of feeling for him labor was irksome to him business lost the charm of steadi ness and after vainly trying something new he gave up all en terprising pursuits and finally lapsed into listless inactivity years rolled on and two lovely babes lived but not to bless their unhappy union  how walter earnest worshipped his children so did cecil yet despite their childish innocence they fiiled to unite those wretched hearts and at last when the tramp of war sounded throughout our beloved country calling for every brave heart to join in the struggle for liberty and independence gladly did walter ear nest respond to its calling and getting a commission as captain he bade adieu to his precious children cecil and home and with a noble band entered in active service in virginia no sad regrets no sigh of grief were breathed by cecil at parting but as an unfaithful feeling of relief came over her as she gazed at the receding form of w earnest she resolved to free herself from him forever she knew well she could not present any reasonable demand for a divorce and after reflecting long upon the subject she concluded to leave her home accompanied by her children and seek a home among some of her relatives in the north and knowing elbert grant was there she wished of course to meet him as she one evening was pondering over her future determina tions and quietly looking on the innocent play of her children for she loved ever thus to be occupiedfor cecil idolized them both  as she was thus musing she heard a low knock at the door and rising to open it she was accosted by a wayworn soldier wearing the garb of a confederate trooper bidding him welcome and after setting before him some delicate re freshments partly prepared by hei own hands cecil ventured to ask his name as there was something in his features that awakened tender memories of old in the bosom of cecil ear iest grant is my name said the soldier     s  grant great god almost screamed cecil are you elbert grants brother for oh you are his image i am quietly replied the soldier elbert grant is my brother but said he i must be going stay stay cried cecil  fear nothing and tell me oh tell me she passionately exclaimed where elbert grant is leon grant not seeming at all surprised at this demonstra tion of feeling in the fair cecil he answered elbert grant my brother is an officer in the federal army madam and being acquainted with the past history of his at tachment to a lady in this country miss cecil gray i believe perhaps i am not mistaken in the person before me are you cecil gray but looking around whose children are these two beautiful ones here are you married o unhappy me exclaimed cecil yes married and those angels are mine and i am so wretched for i never loved but one and that one is elbert grant whose precious image haunts me night and day calm yourself said leon perhaps it will be some com fort to you to know that my brother still lives for you and you alone and i have often heard him say although you treated him so unkindly yet it could never chill his undying affection for youbut stop madam i must be going and now that i can trust you i must confess that i am a federal soldier myself or will be one as soon as i reach my brothers command on the banks of the potomac then you will see him passionately exclaimed cecil  tell him o tell him how i still love him how i have suffered for him and that i would give the world to see him but said leon turning suddenly to cecil  where is your husband he was killed in the battle of manassas replied cecil so you are a widow is there any commands for my bro the i would be happy to be the bearer yes yes wait said cecil and seating herself she wrote a hasty note as follows elbert grant u s a dearest elberti know you will be surprised at the receipt of this and too from one you believe to have forgotten you and ceased to think of you your brother will tell you all o dear elbert how wretched i have been how oft have i wished myself dead for the cruel treatment you have received at my hands o dearest elbert can you forgive me one who has loved you so long comfort me i am so wretched your faithful cecil chapter vi leon grant after many hair breadth escapes finally reached    the northern canp on the banks of the potomac and after doff ing his disguise he made himself known to his surprised and happy brother is it indeed you leon said elbert grant how glad i am to see you any news of a rebel movement below said he with some anxiety all quiet replied leon passed right through the lines lee is calm as a summers morn i guess you are tired and would like some refreshments said elbert and retiring into the tent beckoned leon to follow him here is some good old madeira said he will you try it not until i have given you another slight surprise said leon and searching in his overcoat he withdrew from one of its ample pockets a small package after unfolding it he threw it to his brother exclaiming  there ell is something you are little looking for what a letter and from whom inquired elbert and glancing at the name of the writer he hurriedly exclaimed cecil earnest my god what does this mean be quiet said leon perhaps you can do something for the fair widow my cecil married and a widow she tdld me so said leon and after narrating his adven tures together with an account of cecil and family he added she would give the world to see you elbert did she say so my poor cecil yes see her i will though lee sweeps the hordes of the north to the red sea so brother come said elbert  advise me not another moments rest can i have until i have gained the port where hies my own cecil perhaps you had better wait the army would not like to lose such an able officer a few more months may put an end to this hated struggle then you can greet cecil neath the ban ier of peace chapter viil we will now follow walter earnest in his dreary wanderings through the proud old state of virginia after leaving home he reached virginia in safety and partici pated in several battles there not receiving a single wound he was finally sent with reinforcements to the valley of missis sippi walter earnest cared but little for life it had but little charms for him yet he still worshipped his children and but for them he was often heard to remark he would never dodge a cannon ball in the meantime cecils letters became less frequent as she had an object in not wishing to receive any letters from him as she found it necessary to remain at home we will explain her object she knew that if grant still lived that he would seek to find her and furthermore she knew that walter earnest had       no intention of returning home until the war was over so she knew if she circulated a report respecting the death of walter throughout the neighborhood that it would be readily believed and that if she ceased to write to him he would cease to write to her thus confirming her story of his death she acted accord ingly and soon she was known as the widow earnest she had heard from some source that elbert grant was on his way to see her she of course was overjoyed at the thoughts of marrying him we will now leave her to her inglorious reflections and return to walter earnest whose bravery and valor as a soldier and officer had won him many friends even his enemies were forced to confess their recognition of his brilliant achievements on the field of battle the rumor of an approaching battle was rife throughout the fair mississippi valley and every brave heart was ready to par ticipate in its bloody scenes and as they impatiently waited the signal for the strife they were not left in suspense for soon the cannons were booming loud and long shot and shell hailed rife oer the battle ground groans of the wounded and dying were heard above the crack of the unerring rifle and in the midst of the heartless strife was seen a steed and rider plunging thro the mass of struggling souls and high above the flashing artillery was heard the tones of command from a deep clear voice which none that knew could fail to recognise as the voice of walter earnest he met the deathly missiles with unwavering bravery and when the smoke died away leaving the ground victorious to our southern boys we see the same noble officer charging through the camps bearing from the ground a rifle saddle bags holsters c as trophies of the shiloh fight his face is un usually pale and as we scan his features more closely we can see the workings of deep emotions halting at his tent and throwing the bridle carelessly to his charger he left him to graze at will while he proceeded to dis play his won treasures to the gaze of his admiring friends on a carved silver plate the mounting of the holster was en graved the name of e grant col commanding th n y reg walter earnest refused to answer any inquiries concerning his trouble for all knew he was laboring under some new excite ment w earnest proceeded to empty the saddle bags of its contents and among the many things it contained was the letter from cecil to grant sent him by his brother leon on on rushed walter earnest with maddening fury to the head quarters of his commander demanding a furlough home giving as his excuse and wish for such a sudden determination urgent business determined to rescue his children that desire and the desire of revenge now alone filled his breast he determined to kill grant if he ever crossed his pathway how sweet to him was the thoughts of revenge earnest failed to get a furlough at that time but after repeated     applications finally succeeded in getting an unlimited one elbert grant was an honorable man o how cruelly he had been deceived by cecil earnest chapter viii the cool soft winds were wafting from the bowers the sweetest perfume of the lovely flowers and as the evening shades grew dim upon the wide prairies of f still the form of a weary horseman is plainly visible and as he urges his steed to a quicker pace we can see plainly that he is in a deep study sad is the expression of his noble brow as he seems to be laboring under some deep emotions he starts suddenly as an old familiar waysign greets his tear ful eye but it is not with a bounding home again does he quicken his pace no for he would fain enter his own neighbor hood secretly as a hunter wishing to deprive a tigress of her young taking a secluded path through the skirt of a deep woodland adjoining his own possessions wishing to avoid any encounter with familiar faces he slowly and cautiously rode along heed ing not the shades of night that was wrapping all nature in its sombre mantle his thoughts on his precious children and on bygone days he scarcely heeded a voice calling wa lter walter earnest great god is that you when the whole country has been rife with thenews of your death long ago and your widow earnest not deigning any ceremony replied yes sammy richards it is i richards was an old fiiend and had suddenly confronted walter in the forest on his way home from a hunt earnest inquired anxiously sam is all right over there pointing to his own house richards not waiting any further explanations replied earnest your widow is to be married to night to some grand fellow i believe his name is grant to be married great god thinks me dcad well stop sam richards not a word of me  walter earnest would fain behold her i would fain see if her voice trembles while giving the sacred vow let no one know i am about all right said richards you know you can trust me walter earnest after leaving his steed securely bound in an adjacent wood taking his gun with him crept softly towards his dwelling as he drew near he beheld his house in a blaze of splendor crowded with the lite of a he wanted only to see one form to recognise one face hour after hour went by he wavered not patiently waiting he at last beheld cecil magnificently attired in her wedding dress hanging lovingly upon the arm of elbert grant        all was commotion every eye wishedl to behold the consum mation of so much happiness as cecil was breathing her fervent vow the crack of a pistol was heard a scream and the manly noble form of elbert grant was laid low in death none knew there from whence he had received his death portion but all knew that cecil earnests heart was well nigh broke chapter ix moaning with pain lay cecil earnest heeding not the de parture of her children as they stole softly from her chamber and whispering  there let mama rest no she knew not that she had gotten the last glimpse of their angel faces on went the innocent ones until they were finally out of sight of the house and revelling in their innocent amusements they were suddenly alarmed by a noise behind them and rising to flee homeward they were each called by name recognizing their fathers voice they sprang to him and clasping him lovingly around the neck exclaimed o papa is this you have you come to see mama she is so sick hush hush said walter make no noise come with papa following him in mute surprise they quietly obeyed and taking a seat in the vehicle he had in waiting they were soon upon the road to st l   where they were to take a boat his mother residing in mi he intended having them reared under her charge chapter x cecil earnest awoke from her fitful slumbers and calling for her children she was frantic with despair when her maid in formed her of their absence no one made any effort to recover them for by that time sam t  knowing w earnest was gone had made it known throughout the neighborhood that he had seen him all knew it was just that she well deserved her wretchedness few at tended cecil earnest in her last hours but a faithful old servant and leon grant who was with her untiringly elbert grant lessie and maud the names of her children were incoherently uttered in her last moments oh what a sad ending to one but for vanity would have been so happy in the quiet grave yard of a is interred the unhappy cecil ear nest and above her written upon a marble slab is this inscrip tion by leon grant in memory of cecil earnest whose undying devotion to one caused her to forget her duty as a wife to anotherpeace to her ashes   rosa sherwiood or the avenger chapter i silence reigned throughout the rebel camp on the banks of the potomac the steady tramp of the sentinel was the only martial sound heard save the crack of a picket gun on guard more frequently shooting at some passing game than at an enemy the soldiers were lounging around the tents in all the luxury of a rest after a fatiguing march of five days there was a group of fine looking fellows standing aloof from the rest enjoying a quiet confab seeming to have no desire of disturbance from the rest of their fellow comrades what a dreary life we lead here said one without the smile of lovely woman earth is indeed a wretched wilderness made up with what is generally termed men but truthfully speaking a set of brutes for my part said another whose scowling face and wicked looking eyes proclaiming him one of the homo genus that cared but little for the fair sex for my part said he i think men would get along better without ever getting a glimpse of the deceitful creatures what you valery said his comrade a man who i thought could scarcely endure the service because it veiled him from the sight of some charming face not i nelson replied valery ive got enough of one girl in this world i believe i did love her but it is done and i cant help it done what said nelson valery lee looked up surprised and only replied tut tut i was only talking at random so said nelson you will tell us no more of the fairy i dare say she has you irrevocably charmed and the merry fellow broke forth into a loud laugh at the frowns on valerys brow called forth by his sentimental accusation not i replied valery there you are indeed mistaken well said another i do not wish to be kept in this cruel war long if i am to be kept from the sight of one bright eyed fairy whose image reflects sunshine to my now lonely heart oh if i was at home said another h would show you that susiq was beloved by me if i am one of the homeliest fel lows in the whole company      after this outhurst of sentiment from our homely hero the reply from one of his comrades was hush hush harold you are not the only ugly fellow in the crowd for look yonder pointing to a fellow comrade op posite him who was so intent on a piece of bacon and bread he did not seem to think there was no little sport going on at his expense hello there rufus said one of our chosen come over here rufus dropping the remainder of his grub walked slowly over to our mess inquired gruffly what do you want with me we want to see whether you can beat bob kendall looking ugly or not suppose you represent your feelings in the way of grimaces on an occasion of a clean up of our army by  our dearly be loved brudders just across the river pointing to the yankee forces well bob said rufus goodnaturedly  since we are the butt tonight suppose we make them all pay well for the ex hibition good said bob and good cried all i for one said a fun loving fellow will treat to some good old monongahela by the way which is only a little sweetened water aside well begin said bob many a hearty laugh rang out that night as rufuss and bobs exhibition was in process and finally as rufus gained the victory he was triumphantly carried on the shoulders of the mess and being crowned the victor of the occasion they set him down to a camp feast to enjoy the glory of his tri umph rufus was heard to remark iif the course of his enjoy ment egad there is something in being tarnal ugly after all such were the many instances of amusement that relieved the dreariness of camp life among our dear southern boys tonight it seems that every face is lighted up with a smile of utmost contentment as all are revelling in their various en joyments all save valery lee whose surly countenance speaks plainly for him that his thoughts are on other things he quietly takes a seat near a sentinel whose gloomy tread is more in accordance with his feelings and as it is somewhat of a secluded place he contents himself by brooding over somne past misfortune chapter ii an approaching footstep aroused the sentinel and as the call for the  watchword is given it is quickly responded to and   at the word pass a youth of apparently  or  years of age enters the rebel camps his faceis one of extremely delicate mould and as his voice is exceedingly musical it naturally arouses a peculiar interest in the mind of the sentinel the sentinel kindly inquired where bound my young fellow to which the youth replies i wish to see my brother who is captain of company c regiment  what is your name my good fellow mortimer sherwood sir and my brother is dwight sher wood perhaps you know him well i think i do but that is a real northern name true sir we are both natives of the north but as our father espoused the southern cause we of course joined with him in the struggle but my brother esumed the youth i would like to get some directions as to where his tent is well well replied the sentinel go along and as you pass no  just to your right is capt sherwoods tent thank you said the youth and moving on soon gained his brothers tent entering quietly and finding his brother alone soon makes himself known in the person of rosa sher wood in disguise ah my little sister ive been terribly uneasy about you and now that you are here i am still more at a loss to know how to shield you from  discovery her womans wit was ready as she quickly replied as for that dwight just give me a more complete disguise and allow me to serve you as a lackey capital replied dwight step behind that curtain rosa and don this suit at the same time displaying a ragged coat and pants and slouched hat   at ycur service made moiselle rosa quietly obeyed and as she again made her appearance dwight drew  his sword in real anger forgetting rosa a moment supposing her to be some thief and when rosa saw his mistake she cried oh brother dwight dont you know me he was still surprised but when she doffed her wig and displaying a wreath of golden curls he went to her and kissing her tenderly said it is indeed you my poor dear little sister rosa but your voice darling had changed she soon satisfied him by opening her mouth and displaying at the same time a small tube the means of changing her voice well rosa your disguise is complete but why wish to remain so long why not do your work and go back again o you know brother i wait to listen and see if my name is ever mentioned by him and if he intends to be faithful to me i will do nothing but just one hint to the contrary and valery lee is hush hush rosa his tent is but a few feet from here      j he may even now be listening to us step out rosa and let us look around so that you can get used to the change rosa stepped boldly out and as her brother whispered would you like to see him she gladly consented so they were soon mingling in a crowd of soldiers valery lee among the rest who failed to recognize her after valery lee had conversed with mr mortimer sherwood upon various subjects he finally ventured to ask the fair youth if he was a relative of miss rosa sherwood of lichfield i am said the youth his face assuming an ashen hue i know her well said valery lee and as you are a relative i suppose that you have a natural interest in her continued he certainly i have said the youth and pray sir resumed he  may i ask what you know of my fair cousin since you speak so confidingly to me i hope said valery lee confidingly that you will not consider my trust presumptuous not at all replied the youth on the contrary i con consider myself highly honored with the confidence of a stranger well resumed valery leei once loved rosa sherwood and but for the weakness of woman displayed in her i would still love her but again that can never be although my com rades think me unmovable upon the subject of matrimony yet there is onx dear creature that lives but a short distance from here visited by me when all think me taking my usual solitary walk yes she is soon to be mine my own miriam but sir remember my confidence although you are a stranger but few knowof my approaching union with the idol of my heart miriam ludlow good night said the youth suddenly turning from lee and resuming his walk he soon entered capt sherwoods tent chapter iii dwight sherwood entered his tent and beheld his beautiful sister in an agony of weeping as she recognized her brothers footstep she arose and with a voice tremulous with a deter mined passion she said dwight my own dear brother it must be done i have heard it all and she almost shrieked he is to be married soon to one miriam ludlow he uncon sciously gave me his confidence supposing me to be only rosa sherwoods cousin he told me all so dwight it must be done but when rosa inquired dwight oh said she the night that will consummate his fondest hopes and that will be a seal to my lasting misery i have promised to stand by you in this awful hour of revenge for wrongs that can never be revenged oh revenge is sweet said rosa and i will have it     j but how is it to be managed inquired dwight with anxiety well said rosa you must manage to get an invitation to the marriage then  then what my poor sister  then i tell you my brother all will be right how will you manage rosa tell me quick while you have a chance rosa drew from her pocket a small vial containing the most deadly poison and handing it to her brother said  that is for her and this said drawing from her bosom a gleaming stiletto  this too shall find its way to his heart  as you please rosa said dwight but would to god i could win you from such a terrible determination chapter iv day after day rolled on and mortimer sherwood was the regular attendant of captain sherwood frequently serving valery lees mess in the capacity of a lackey but was never discovered finally valery lees marriage eve arrived and as dwight and mortimer sherwood were privately invited they made every preparation for the event and repaired to ludlow manor where in all splendor of wealth and luxury they found the mansion crowded with the fairest of richmonds lovely daughters and in the midst of all was seen the beautiful bride clad in robes of splendor she was surpassingly beauti ful and as rosa glanced at her happy countenance a pang of regret entered her heart but stifling her better feeling she murmured never never this night shall seal my determi nation the ceremony was over and all were revelling in the joy of a wedding feast the lovely bride was seen to take a glass con taining wine from a small table and as she bowed gracefully she drank a toast to all well done my miriam said valery lee miriam strove to reply but the effort proved fruitless she staggered and fell to the floor a stiffened corpse valery lee was in an agony of grief as he bowed in bitter wretchedness over the lovely form of miriam cold in death a thousand inquiries were made concerning her sudden death not a suspicion crossed the mind of any one that she had been poisoned rosa sherwood knew the source well and as she chuckled in demoniac glee over her work she departed with her brother who by this time was terribly agitated fearing rosas discovery and as he again pleaded with her to return home her only answer was no he shall go next i and then what my poor wretched sister i will go in the first fight and hope i will receive my just        punishment by a ball that will put an end to my miserable existence  rosa my poor sister hush dwight your pleading is useless i am  deter mined they reached the camp and entering their tent they threw themselves upon their humble beds but there was no sleep for wretched rosa racked with the pain of bitter remorse orning dawned and finding her still awake and poignantly sensible of her crime the first thing she addressed to her brother was the inquiry where is valery lee has he arrived yetjust then valery lee accosted dwight with good morning capt sherwood i would like to get a little brandy his voice was low and husky and as he strove to converse with dwight he apologized for his stupor as he called it and without further ceremony he departed ah exclaimed rosa so sir deceiver you are going to drink away your sorrow perhaps in the dawn of tomorrow you will have more to brood over true enough for on that solemn night when all seemed wrapped in deepened sorrow a form was seen creeping softly in the direction of valery lees tent and as it stealthily entered all within was as still as death save the troubled breathing of valery lee who ever and anon uttered the name of miriam in his sleep rosa could scarcely suppress a scream as her feel ings went forth in bitter agony at the sound of miriam ludlows name uttered in such tender accents by the voice of one she once loved she waited soon valery lee turned restlessly over and inquired of his mate eh nelson was that you what replied nelson half awake i thought said valery i heard a heavy breathing near me but i guess it was you yes said nelson who was soon sound asleep rosa was again assured of valery iees deep slumber and musing low to herself my hour has come and his and plunging the dagger up to the hilt in his bosom it done the wished for work valery lee died without a groan as rosa withdrew the weapon she directed her steps towards the river avoiding the sentinels she soon reached it and after medita ting a few moments upon the conclusion of her vengeance she attached a stone to the fatal weapon and casting it in the bubbling stream it sank to rise no more well done brave heart exclaimed the wretched girl he will never deceive another oh my child my precious child for a few moments she gave up to her bitterness of grief in venting the burning tears that told of her undying agony it is done again exclaimed rosa and now said she my time comes next she retraced her steps cautiously and regaining her brothers tent she found him anxiously waiting for her as she entered    he arose and embraced her tenderly and in a voice of deep emotion he exclaimed o my sister would to god i could have spared you this misery dont be troubled dear brother on my account i will not be here long to give care to any one o speak not so my poor sister your brother can never be happy again o dear brother it is useless to repine at my sad fate for i have brought it all upon myself my own wretched impru dence life can never have any charms for me again i do not wish to live yet i am not fit to die and o i know he will not meet with a better fate in eternity i t is meet that i should share it with him o sister can i not persuade you to return to our poor father and mother and your child o sister your poor child hush hush brother say no more you will drive me mad you know my purpose is fixed leos and dwight retired early and rising early the following morning they sauntered leisurely along around the camps and were repeatedly asked if they had heard of valery lees death of course both feigned great surprise and finally the excitement died away and no suspicions were ever aroused by rosa sherwoods alias mortimer sherwoods appearance chapter v all around seemed calm and even still as daylight faded over plain and hill the sentinels were keeping their regular guard surrounded by the watchful pickets of johnsons army they had waited it seemed all day with patience for a battle as rumors had been afloat in camps for several days of an approaching struggle with the enemy who were then prying around to ascertain the strength of our brave band and at last when night came upon them and still no signal for the strife they all seemed satisfied that the enemy would not attack them in the night it was even so but just as the golden sun arose clear and resplendent from out of the eastern horizon making every object look cheerful covered with its bright beams the signal for the approaching battle was heard and forward march was responded to by our dear brave southern boys with a spirit that panted to meet the hated foe on on they moved their dazzling steel gleaming out in threatening vengeance at last the battle began the flashing artillery pealed forth in its deadly thunder and as the unerring rifles crack in the midst of the strife they too make many a brave heart bite the dust hour after hour passed and still the battle raged in unabated fury o many many sank to rise no more there was one brave form that fought unwaveringly until at last he fell mortally wounded and as he cried for help a sur       geon was quickly by the side of the fair form and as he bended  gently over the beautiful face its surpassing beauty spellbound the kind hearted physician and to use his own words a sweeter voice never fell upon the ear of mortal man a more beautiful face never met the admiring gaze of human at last he kindly enquired can you tell me where you are wounded yes yes here said the musical voice laying a small white hand on one side wlere the blood was gushing out profusely which in the intensity of his excitement the surgeon had failed to notice he proceeded to rip open the closefitting soldiers jacket when lo a new wonder was displayed to him and casting another glance at his patients face instead of the low soldier cap that almost screened a jetty black wigit had fallen off and a cloud of golden curls shrouded the snow white brow of this lovely creature corresponding so well with the soft blue eye now almost dim with the dew of approaching death all satisfied him that his patient was a lovely maiden in disguise call call she said faintly who would you see said the kind man call my brother dwight sherwood if you know him he was near me when i fell the surgeon obeyed and soon returned with capt dwight sherwood she made an effort to speak but failed at fiist her voice was so husky that even when she did speak her words were scarcely intelligible but to the practiced ear of her brother who had known and loved that voice from childhood he understood all dwight said she you have been faithful to me and o brother you know my sad story but too well you know that this is the reward of revenge which the lord saith is mine i was not willing to wait his vengeance i wreaked it myself and now i go to be punished accordingly come nearer brother tell my mother to raise my child in the fear of the lord tell her to forgive my rashness for o said she i refused to listen to her kind counsel she begged me to leave it all to god i would not bury me brother in some lone spot where there is no fear of intrusion where my body will rest o god have mercy on my soul tell not my child of my sad end let her be a stranger to the history of wretched mother farewell thus died the beautiful and once beloved rosa sherwood whose name may be recognized by many her brother buried her in a sweet secluded spot and planted a simple rose bush over her grave emblem of her that was once pure and lovely no marble slab is erected there to tell the passer by whose remains are interred in that beautiful spot but ah dwight sherwood will never forget it but kneeling in an agony of weeping over her lovely form he vowed to make that place a spot for sacred worship in memory of the sister of his childhood there he will go when no eye beholds his sorrow loving her memory dearer than the pilgrim who consecrates his worship to the temples of

to act of congress in the year  by w e hathaway in the office of the librarian of congress at washington   my grandfathrs old coat a political allegory my grandfather was a man of many virtues i am very proud of his memory he was somewhat peculiar but nevertheless so full of goodness and love that many people were very much attached to him he had his enemies however and very bitter ones too some of them were he was as it is sometimes said the soul of honor and humanitarianism was strong in him what wonder then that his nature was brought in conflict with nl ay who could stoop to any meanness and before whom another humanb beiing counts as notling if chancing to stand in their way  against such his anger was terrible but to the poor and needy he was always gentle as a dove i think i see him now as i first remember him in the prime of his life of full form and commanding stature eyes that gleamed like lightning when he was aroused or melted in tenderness when one appealed to him for protection i remember an occasion which called out a full display of both sides of his nature his farm joined to that of a very aristocratic gentleman between whom and my grandfather there existed for a long time very peaceable and even friendly relations they used frequently to meet at the linefence and discuss their crops cattle the markets and politics and sometimes met in each others houses and talked of religion law and social progress they were mem bers of the same chlurch but attended two diflfrent meetings as one drove south to knechtschaft and the other to the north to vorrecht the services in these two churches of the same de nomination especially the preaching was quite different so           my grandfathers old coat marked that neither my grandfather nor his neighbor iould have attended the other church on any account my grand ather was a working man and did not hesitate to gonto the fieldland assist his hired men in any of the operations which were carnied on on the farm his neighbor on the contrary whose name jas wuth erick considered it degrading for him to work and iad man aged to get a number of men and women into his pow r whomi he compelled to perform all his labor for him ovei these he sometimes condescended to watch while they were at their work and if they did not delve with sufficient vigor or if they displeased him in any waywhich often occurred as he was very exact inghe would go off in a great rage and abuse them very shame fully more often however he left them to the care of an over seer more disposed to be cruel than himself and this wretch would lead his workmen and womenfor he had women who worked in the field alsoa very sad life indeed many of these poor creatures would have been glad to get away fromthe service of such a man but he held them by virtue of some very out rageous laws and they were forced to stay and endure all his abuse and cruelty the best way they could if i was to write pages and pages i could not begin to tell about all the bad things that mr wutherich did and if i could you would scarcely believe me they were so very dreadful and yet he was a member in good standing in the church where he attended and had m anv friends in the neighborhood who because he was rich were glad to court his favor and shut their eyes to all his wicked ways he was particularly noted for his hospitality and gave excellent dinners and invited everybody to come to his house and help eat his good things and drink his wine which as lie never paid his workmen anything was not so very wonderful after all many a man could aflord to be generous if he could only employ other peoples property with which to entertain his friends my grandfather would never go to any of these entertainments however or at least he very soon refused to do so he may have gone once or twice before he knew or thought how bad a man mr wutherich was   my grandfathers old coat          but after he began to realize how matters went he said he had as soon turn cannibal at once as to eat at his table  for it amounted to nothing else than dining off the flesh and blood of his poor people still as a great many people were not so conscientious my grandfathers neighbor had no trouble in finding plenty who would partake of his fare and wonderfully jolly times they used to think they had of it sometimes my grandfather would expos tulate with them about the impropriety of keeping company with such a man but they generally laughed a little or replied well now mr freiheityou greatly misjudge our neighbor mr wuther ich really now he is not so bad a fellow as you think but my grandfather was not to be deceived by such language and rightly concluded that these people cared more for good dinners and the approbation of mr wutherichmean as he wasbecause he was rich than they cared for the truth or for the good of the poor creatures who were constantly defiauded in order to supply all the good things which they enjoyed sometimes my grandfather would stop in his work and look across the fields over into mr wtiteichs farm where the poor people were at work and sometimes when he saw the overseer knock a poor fellow down or strike a woman with a heavy stick as he often did he would drop his hoe or rake or whatever he had and clutch his fist and grit his teeth and vow he would go over and thrash the fellow on the spot but his prudence generally got the better of his passion by the time he reached the linefence and then he would walk sadly and slowly back and resume his work stopping occasionally to wipe something out of his eye in order to take another look across the fences at last he became so burdened with the course of mr wuth erich that he resolved to open his mind to him and accordingly he embraced the first opportunity when they were both near the linefence to expostulate with him on the iniquity of his conduct i expect my grandfather expressed himself in rather strong terms that was his way when he felt deeply but you should have seen the passion into which mr w flew at once if you really want to           my grandfathers old coat know how contemptible he was and heard the shlcking oaths he swore at my grandfather and the threats with which he souglht to intimidate him if he ever dared to say anything like that again but instead of fiightening my grandfather he only woke him up and he gave him back again as good as he sent with a pretty thick mixture of good strong moral swearing like by the eternal and such and let him know that he was his peer any day and always was and that he was not going to stand by any longer and see his abominable villainy and not publicly pro test against it and furthermore he would take measures im mediately to have his atrocious conduct investigated and stopped and the men and women whom he had so long cheated and abused should have their rights as sure as there was a god in heaven and much more of the same sort a few days after this one of mr wutherichs men named fluchtig came over to my grandfathers and besought him to take him in as mr w   had threatened to kill him and when he started to run had set the dogs after him and chased him with a gun and shot at him so that he was already halfscared to death my grand father never hesitated a moment but opened the door to him and then he took down an old gun that hung on the wall and says to fluchtig can you shoot the poor fellows teeth were chattering with fear but a moment before but my grandfathers manner braced him up a good deal and he answered yayes i can try well then said my grandfather  take this and ifi guess we had better skip what he called him dares to touch you blow his head off thats alland then he coolly planted him self in his doorway with another gun handy but kept out of sight and waited for mr wutherich to appear pretty soon he rode up on horseback and demanded to know if fluchtig had been seen about my grandfathers premises as he felt sure he had taken refuge there and if so he wanted him immediately my grandfather replied that he had been seen there and that   my grandfathers olt  coat       moreover he was at that moment inside the house and if mr nw  wanted him very badly he had better come in and take him but as he said this there was a look on his face that was very disagreeable to mr wutherich and he ran his eye over my grandfathers stout limbs as much as to say i wonder if i could thrash him if i should try if that is really whait he thought he seemed to decide in the negative for after swearing a good deal and threatening very much and reasoning very little he finally rode away in a great rage and vowing no lend of vengeance before he went however a large number of the neighbors had collected about the house some of whom sided evidently with my grandfather but rmore with mr wttherich  and tjese encouraged him to take the fellow t hilling him that they would stand by him tnd give old freihcit fits there was one man particularly by the name of rauber with a bald head a squint eye and a very brazen face who distinguished himself on that occasion by much loud talking but who was an arrant coward and took care not to say anything very definite as soon as mr wutherich rode away he came up to my grand father and protested admiration for his conduct because then our friends were hooting after the rascal and calling him names and the others were slinking away you think i am a long while in getting to the point of my story which is to be about nmy grandfathers coat but have a little patience and you shall hear it all before i am done and it has much to do with this same raubers subsequent conduct my grandfather had despised this man as he had been more willing than any one else to excuse mr wutherichs rascality and partake of his hospitality but now his words were so apparently sincere that he did not know but that the fellow had really seen a new light and so took him by thd hand in a fiank and manly way among the other threats in which mr wutherich indulged he vowed he would burn my grandfathers house and barn and de           my grandfather s old coat stroy his fences and kill his stock and generally transform his fertile farm into a howling wilderness and utterly clean him outbag and baggage and all that he hadwith an extraordi narily complete thrashing to finish off with if he had ever carried out all he said he would do i am afraid i should not have been left to tell this tale and that le did not do it is no fault of his for i must do him the credit to say that he tried very hard to accomplish it all and some people say that he very nearly succeeded however that may be we were awakened one fine morning by a great noise and jumped out of bed to see what was the matter only to find the devilish fel low really trying to carry out his threats we had not fully believed that he would be as bad as his word and were wholly unprepared to resist him but the way my grandfather went for that villain then was refreshing i can tell you mr wuther ich had evidently tampered with some of my grandfathers hired men and calculated very much on their assistance arid some of them did throw down the fences and go over to mr wutherichs side carrying with them whatever they could conveniently take along but the most of them to their lasting honor stood stoutly by him while a few evidently waited to see how the scrimmage was to terlminate before they declared an open allegiance to either side immediately almost the neighbors began to collect and many of them came fully prepared to give at least their moral support to mr wutherich as my grandfather was con sidered a peculiar fellow who could not somehow appreciate  a good thing and it would be just as well to have him trt of the way  but he displayed so much vigor in thevery beginning of the fight that these  policy fellows  began to shake their heads and one by one they caine and stood over on my grandfathers side not indeed doing much except a good deal of loud talking and when mr wutherich began to get the worst of it very much they thought it was almost too bad to whip the fellow so dreadfully   my grandfathers old coat         but among them all none were so contemptible as that man rauber who sat upon the linefence doing nothing and savingo nothing until it was perfectly clear to him that my grandfathter was sure to whip wutherich out of his boots and then he climbed down and came around near the combatants on my gramdfathers side and howled and tore arouiid so that if you hadjust come up you would have thought that that was his ex elusive affair it is hardly necessary to enter into full particulars of that gallant fight but of course my grandfatler won a signal  victory and it was a thing to be proud of too for wutherich  did fight like a hero and as i used to think only as men can who contend for a good cause so that he proved a very worthy antagonist and very nearly a matchfor my grandfaither but when he was compelled to surrender he did it like a man and acknowledged that my grandfather was the stronger and perhaps also wiser and better and promised to give up a great many of his evil practices and to quit abusing his poor people and to pay them their wages regularly on the whole he begian to behave himself with so much decency and show so much manliness that my grandfather quite forgot that he had just been giving him an awful drubbing an eached out his hand to him and said now let us be friends agin  and wutherich took t cordially and i really believe he respected my grandfather more that day than he had ever done before in his life well now i come to the point of my story my grandfather had for several years woin a very peculiar sort of coat made oc wool of the natural color just as it calne from the sheeps back for he saidtie knew where that came from and that no unpaid labor had helped to make it people often laughed at him for his peculiarity and pointed at him as he passed along the street and some bad boys had been set on by older people who would have been ashamed to do it themselves to throw mud on hilm but he wore that coat asi a c testimony he said  against the pride and cruelty of the world  and of course wherever he went that coat spoke as loud as any man could directly to the con           my grandfathers old coat sciences of many wicked people and that made them hate the very sight or nanme of it this was particularly the case with mr wutherich and all his fiiends but after my grandfathers victory over him and them that coat became wonderfully popu lar and very many who had scoffed at it before made haste to get one just as near like it as they could many of them cut a queer figure clad in such a new harness but they all pretended to like it very much and seemed to imagine that to put on a coat like my grandfathers would make people believe that they were in all respects just like him he was immensely popularnow and no mistake amnong all who did as i have described no one made more display of it than this man rauber and to have heard him talk you would have supposed that it was principally he who whipped wutherich and compelled him to be a more respectable gentle man he was alwa s talking about thefight as if it was a great and sufficient virtue to have been in it and whipped wutherich and that after having done that it did not matter much what sort of a life a man led in this world as he was sure of the respect of his fellowcitizens and eternal felicity hereafter for thatlone deed to be sure he did not have much part in the fight but ilid he not wear my grandfathers coat and had not my grandfather done the greatest and noblest things imaginable and was he not all things considered about the most wonderful man that had ever lived or could be born of course he was and eirgo he rauberfor he wore his coat was certainly entitled to honor and confidence the amount of honor that that man heaped upon himself in consequence of his part in that afftir and the selfcon ceit that he exhibited on account of wearing a bit of apparel similar to my grandfather would have been sufficient to supply a state it was perfectly ridiculous but the worst is yet to come by constantly prating about the matter raubcr did finally suc ceed in making a good many people believe that he was a man of some merit let any fool persistently tell the world that he is wise and he will be sure to find a multitude to accept his word   my grandfathers old coat        ii and let any rascal constantly assert that he is a pattern of mo rality and he shall not want ardent believers and so it came about that he was chosen to fill a very responsible position in the neighborhood and h nored and trusted for my grandfathers sake who was now bec ming an old man but who yet was full of love and truth and would have scorned to do a mean or dis graceful act others ami ng those who had likewise donned thb peculiar coat pressed forvard into public notice and my grand father began to feel verl uneasy with his honor as it were in the keeping of so many new and untried men these men he said who wear myicoat and profess my principles where were they during the yeails of my patient endurance of the worlds scoffs some of them it is true were always my fiiencds but many of them and the loudest mouthed among them too were either tacit or positive enemies to me and then my grand father freiheit would shake his head gloomily and heave a sigh that foreboded ill of these noisy professions subsequent and quickly developed circumstances proved that his uneasiness was only too well founded rauber and his con federates were soon discovered in many most contemptible and  utterly disgraceful acts they were thieves they were liars they were perjurers and they cared no more for the interests of all the good and honest people than wutherich had cared for the lives and souls of his poor people in the years that were past and we could easier recount all of that bad mans misconduct than tell of all the mischief which they did but when accused of it they pointed to the coat they wore well knowing that it was the symbol of purity and truth and tried to drown the voice of their accusers by shouting out the vir tues of freiheit and how lhe had once whipped wutherich and done so much good and made so many people happy this kind of talk deceived a great many people who could not and would not believe that these men who wore that coat and made so much of freiheits virtues were really as bad as others said they were  and so they were allowed for a long time to go           my grandfathers old coat on undisturbed and drew a great many good men into their bad ways and corrupted every department of the public service until it seemed as if truth and justice was nowhere to be found and still the people were blind to the truth and really thought that in keeping these men in their places they were honoring freiheit and maintaining his principles while the truth was freiheit was weeping at home for shame and rage at those who wore his coat and pretended to represent him at last when my grandfather could endure it no longer he called us all about him and said my children you see this coat which i have worn so long he could hardly speak fbr his emotions but went onl l i have loved that coat very much indeed it is more to me than just simply a coat it reminds me of my sorrow and joyof my struggles and triumphs i wore it when to wear it was consid ered a disgrace and i have lived to see it more honored than any other coat ever was before the old man fairly hugged it to his heart but then said  but i have come to feel that i must put it out of my sight yes more than that i will burn it up for after all it is only a coat and i can get another for men have dishonored it and today it hides more shame and wrong i fear than it has ever sheltered good i will no longer cherish or allow myself to love an object which has come to mean something so contral r to my name and nature  so hateful to all good men and so forgetful of god and then with trembling hand but sure purpose he castlit into the fire i involuntarily sprang to rescue it but he caught me and held me back saying nay my son it is better so i know you loved it too and i was glad once that you were not ashamed of it or of me when all men reviled it lit if you still love what once it stood for as i think you do you will let it burn  i could not if i would describe the heaviness of heart with which i saw its woolly fibers k k and consume in the flame but i   my grandfathers old coat         i comforted myself with my grandfathers words that it was l only a coat after all my grandfather got a new coat and this time he had it colored red  for said he tthere will come a very hot fire into the midst of these fellows before we have done withthem and god willing i will start such a blaze as will burn both them and all the coats on their backs to the blackest cinders well do you think that rauber and those fellows changed their coats at once if you do you are mistaken the time had not come yet they said to themselves the most of the people have entirely forgotten freiheit by this time  or if they have not entirely forgotten him they have forgotten if they ever knew whatkind of a man he really is and so they went blindly on in their own way and i must confess that what they said seexmed to be almost literally true othe red coat attracted some atten tion and the people laughed a good deal at it and the news papers made sport of it and called old freiheit a fool and only a few sympathized with hm and ho one came out in exactly the same color once a few men declared together that they would adopt freiheits color and called a great meetiing at which every man was to be dressed in red but instead of that they came in every shade of brown and black and even a few of the regular old wool which they drew over the peoples eyes until every body was either blind or mad and they all went homne again feeling that they had made fools of themselves then the wearers of the old coat were more jubilant than ever and felt sure that the wool could always be drawn over the peoples eyes and weiit on with their shameless conduct more bold than ever at which  my grandfather was so much distressed that he took to his bed and his life was felt to be in gree danger he lingered along however some months after that weak and doubtfil existeence only sometimes he would rally a little and then sink almost away and we would think he was really gone day and night we watched with him and never left his side for a moment and it seemeq as if nothing but our constant attentions         my grandfatiers old coat kept him alive at all we scarce dared to take our eyes off from him lest while we turned away he should breathe his last but one night there was a great illumination and fireworks and a great procession and cannons fired and men hurrahingthe lord only knows at whatand we all ran to the window to look out well there was rauber seated on a splendid horse gaily adorned with ribbons and bands of music and companies of sol diers and riding by his side and following in his train were usurpator and verrathes leaders of those who clung to the old coat and hid all manner of villainy beneath its righteous color and a host of their friends and followers who seemed content to follow like a pack of fools or dogs and walk in the mud through which their horses splashed and shout themselves hoarse or do any other absurd and servile thing for their pompous and shame less masters and standing at our gate was wutherich one among a few who looked upon this spectacle with shame written on his face and speaking angry words about it while freiheit lay dying in his own home and no one caring enough about him to stop this idle rush and still their noisy clamor that was speed ing his death but it was a great displaya long procession and a glittering pageant and when it was past it was near morning then we hurried back to my grandfathers bedside and were there stricken with unutterable remorse and sorrow for my grandfather my dear grandfather freiheit was dead hlow we mourned for him in secret and sorrow i need not tell but as soon as it was light and while the weary paraders were straggling home we went out and published the news which ran like wildfire and spread con sternation everywhere freiheit is dead freiheit is dead was uttered everywhere in subdued and fiightcned accents and all at once men knew that one who was great and good and precious beyond price had gone out from amlong them   my grandfathers old coat        i with broken hearts and tearful eyes they crowded about our house to look upon him and old men told how fair he once was how strong of limb and true of heart  women wept over his remains and men who had sat on his lap in their childhood rent the air with agonizing wails of sor row at his departure young men and children who scarce realized their loss looked on in dumb wonder and from afar ofl rauber and his associates conducted themselves for a little time with considerate prudence we must not press upon the people now they said  but in a few days we will drzzle them again with a glittering show and they will forget all about it but freiheit is dead and it is a jolly thing for us too that he is and then they drank some wine and smacked theiil lips with satisfaction ajid settled them  selves in comfortable luxuriance to smoke the choicest and most expensive cigars bought with the peoples money they soon drove out in elegant carriages drawn by noble horsesmore noble than those they drewand bowed benignly to the people whose money paid the icost they lived in stately mansions and had hundreds of men at work to build greater still while poor men toiled and children cried for food to furnish all their splendor freiheit is deadagain and again the few who realized it spoke the sad truth with brokelihearted wailing what shall we do without freiheit they said and we answered only what shall we do for our hearts were heavy and our spirits crushed with sorrow what indeed shall we do       christopher crooked a christmas story by w e hathaway a  owferful stort for both old and roung

the surround ing country in a few minutes a cavalryman rashed int camp his charger at his topmost speed the bugle sound  ed the alarm and after such hurried confusion captain horton formed his company

bridge where it will make arrangements to fight as long as our supply of ammunition lasts  these orders were given by captain horton to lieuten ant emitson and were immediately put in execution  this occurred a few days before the commencemeit of the memorable seven days battles around richmond al th e  troops except enough to watch the movements of the ene my at his several points of occupationl were removed from the department and conpentrated to tske part in that san guinary conflict to save the capitol of the country     captainhorton with his gallant little band of one hun dred well mounted partizans was left unaided to confront the enemy numbering five hundred nfantry a battery of lartillery and a company of cavalry occupying one of the towns in the department of north carolinia the enemy were however well acquainted with captain horton time and again had he pounced like an eagle upon their unsus pecting credulity and bore away their outposts their for aging and scouting partiesuntil his name alone had be come a terror to their imaginations notwithstanding this captain horton did not slumber with this featful odds against him he saw at a glance and appreciated the res ponsibility that had devolved upon him thousands of rich farmers straining every nerve to make sustenance for the army looked to him for protection against a thieving ene my every day defenceless women and children thronged his camp begging with tearbedimmed eyes to be saved from the hands of aruthless foe added to these he as weil i s mosf of his men were fighting for their very hearthstones the town occupied by the enemy was situated upon the northern bank of one of the principal rivers in the old north state the river ran in almost a direct line east and west and intermingled the crystal waters of the blue ridge mountains with those of the grept atlantic this added a  new arm oftrength to the enemyas the river was naviga ble several miles above the town up which with his boats he could lay waste to the surrounding country but as he ihad few boats that could operate on the river owing to its narrowness and its undulating banks behind which con cealed riflemen were more than an equdl in a contest even with these huge monsters captain horton had few fears from that direction miakingoalmost a right angle with one inclining somewhat to the west wound a large creek ard emptied its waters into the river a mile above the town on both sides of this creek were dense mirey swampl so that to cross it was impossible except at the several public ra    crossings at which were in former times built bridges by way of the direct road leading from thetownto wher cap tain horton had taken his position to the crossing of this stream was seven miles five miles farther on ran another stream parallelwith the first and emptied also its waters into the river across this latter stream was the mill bridge referred to in captain hortons order when he was left without the least hope of aid from any quarter his first pre caution was to destroy all the bridges crossing this first stream seeing of course the fruitlessness of endeavoring to keep the enemy within the town this offered the first impediment to an advance wherever a crossing might be effected it would be done at a fearful loss of life and when this was done a greater impediment yet had to be metat the mnll bridge where as captain horton said they could never pass so long as his supply of ammunition lasted this first creek though adopted by captain horton as a picket line yet the country beyond it was not entirelyabandoned the enemy did not dare to advance beyond the range of the guns mounting the brerstwork surrounding the town except with almost their entire commaind captain horton bad the one plan and its alternative ever before his eyes  if the enemyadvanced directly upon his po sition to give him battle as above described but if he chibse to pass him by unnoticed after cros ing thefirst stream and   advancing through the country in a different directionu h alternative was to transport his cemmand to the opposite side of the river marshal his available force cut the ene mys communication and harass his rear until a force could be concentrated in fr nt to stop his advance as he promised lieutenant emitson the necessary dispo sitions were made at the bridge to give the enemy a hand some reception he was patiently waiting the return of the  lieutenant and the adyance of the foe his monotony would now and then be broken by the repwt of the cannoni at the bridge but nothing more                         s  tsurely he said emitson has not allowed them to cross uadisturbed the lieutenant returned very soon the enemy have driven back our pickets from the creek and arethrowing up an entrenchment said he handing the captain a note backed with a pencil  they no doubt intend to rebuild the bridge said the captain opening the note what disposition have you made of the picket lieutenant i ordered them to fall back beyond the range of the en emys guns and to resume the watch i have a sqoutalso concealed at the creek to watch the enemys demonstrations the note read as follows captain hrton i have just time to write this note and convey it across to your pickets the yankees do not intend to advance farther than to drive off your picket and establish their own in their stead on this side of the creek give yourself no alarm but of course be vigilant toross the creek at the old landing and i will meet you at the little hillock on this side at four oclock

hour she will not come somcthing has happened he said as he rose and stretched his gaze in the direction from whence he had come and was now about to return  a low whisper greeted his ear he started and turned quickly on his heel his eyes met a human form it was estelle the beautiful fairy formed the terrestrial angel estelle the only object that bound his heart to earth that which animated and urged him on to deeds of valor in the hour of trial and peril estelle was a far off scion of the normon french and in her bright black eyes she showed still the spirit of her intrepid ancestry as their counten ances met sheforced a smile n         you have been waiting i reckon captain  yes estelle he answered grasping her extended hand i h ave been here one hour or more what has caused your delay my brotherwhom you know holds a commission in the federal army returned homethis morning to establish a force between my home and your command is the cause of their advance they will return when he has accomplished the object of his visit  pusillanimous policy but such selfish motives seem tb actuate even the head of their government i am hot surprised but estelle what is the object of your brothers  visit ie hehs come said she choking down a sigh i to force me into a marriage with ed alston whom from my childhood i have never looked upon oiierwise than as a friend he accompanies my brother dressed in yankee uni form i have treated him very c olly and as they know of our attachment they watch me eontinually this has been the cause of my delay   fiends incarnate said the captain seating himself upon the earth and drawing her down by his side they can never succeed while the blood ifi my veins runs warm but you had better go with me now and continue with my mother orsome of you friends until  no i will not be driven from my home i will stay to convince them of their folly hardly had these words es caped her lips when a hurried footstep behind them con vineed them of an intrusion captain horton caught his hand upon his pistol liolt and attempted to rise but too late two pistols were presented to his head and a stern voice shouted resist and you shall die estelle caught his arm and whispered  forbear estelle said her brother in a pedantic voice i ought toe iiscouetenance you hereafter as my sister you are at liberty to do so she answered in a firm voice   while i have been away striving to restore peace to the country my only sister has been carrying on a disgraceful alliance with  its false and the intimation is unworthy of a broth er she interrupted yes fou have brought disgrace upon me by this alli ance with an enemy to me and to all mankind and a traitor to his country  this insult almost caused the blood in captain hortonos veins to take fire but what could he do disgrace upon you a traitor to his country she an swered smilingly beautiful language for one who has brought disgrace upon his family by selling his honor and his birthright for the paultry sum of a commission in a van dal armyan army who wars upon dcfenseless wofiien and childrena band of disgraceful thieves and cutthroats does not the word traitor burn upon your lips i would take this abuse from no one else nor wold i take your intimations from any one else but your eloquence will not alter my determinatton  have come to see the consummation of a marriage between alston and yourself and it shall be it shall never be i do not love him and i will never marry one whom i do not love so desist brpther you can not force me i am ready to die but to yield never i am your senior and will be your advisor i know that you are betrothed to alstonnd the engagement shall be fulfilled  would you consigni me to a life of misery is this the brother who promised a dying mother to watch over my wellfare oh faithless humanity said she bursting into tears have i a brother and yet not one friend in this  wide world whose hands are ubnbpund to save me miss estelle said alston stepping forward  say that you havenever made the most solemn vows to me nad i will release you at once from the engagement            t        f      i may have done so mr alston in jest but heavep knows that i have never loved you and your unmanly con duct now makes me hate you is no estelle said the lieutenant her brother this traitor has poisoned your mind and his life shall pay the forfeit captain horton could no longer keep down the anger that these cowardly insults had aroused in his nature he sprang to his feet drew his repeater from its holster and s aid bir my life is not worth a farthing to me how and these cowardly insults shall be printed here upon the brow of this little hill in characters of blood estille rushed fearlessly between the two presented pis tols and caught captain hortons arm it is madness captain do not sacrifice your life but live for my sake i give estelle into your chargh accompany her home sat her brother addressing alston itcan go alone said estelle but alston took her arm and forted heer away deliver your pist  to me said the lieutenant to cap tain horton  just at this moment a noise on the opposite side of the hill attracted their attention and a detachment of captain hortons men rushed upon the hill the lieutenant see ing the peril of his position covered himself by captain hortonand made a precipitate retreat stand aside captain shouted lieutenant emitson hold emitson hold said he the enemy are only a few hundred yards from this place the enemy had already been attracted to the place and were then in view i anticipated this treachery captain said lieutenant emitson and have made all possible haste to your relief say not treachery lieutenant but misfortune oh                                  could your arrival have been hut one minute earlier poor  estelle said he rubbing his hands but i will release her or loose my life in the attempt we all owe them a debt of revenge answered the lieutenant as the enemy were now bearing dorn upon them they were compelled to retreat captain horton returne i to his camp with his plans for lthe release of estelle fully decided upon by taking his men twelve miles up the creek he could cross at a fdrd known only to himself andt in four hoirs he could come up exactly in rear of the enemys position this he resolved to do hoping notwithstanding the fearful odds that he would have to encounter with the advantage of a surprise in a night at tack to be able if nothing more to recover estelle and take her within his own lines the plan was put in execution and at the hour of eleven wlhen the enemy had retired to slumber in peaceful security  captain horton hurled his hundred furious horsemen like an avalanche into their camp which lay in an hundred yarcld of estelles home the enemy fled in every direction panic strickbn and dismayed but captain holton was so eager for the prize he rushed headloig in fiont of his command rand his horse stumbling precipitated him senseless upon the earth in the midst ot the enemy when of course he fell into their hands lieutenant emitson assumed com mand and still continued to urge his men upon the enemy dealing a perfect malestorm of death in their midst but he hurdled them in a mass finally upon the banks of the streamn where they either had to fight or surrender taking advan tage of the disorder into which the contest had thrown the horsemen they commenced a stubborn resistance and from advantage of numbers very soon so far ecovered as to be able to make an assault upon lieutenant emitsons confused column he resisted it with spirit but finally had to fall back thereby leaving captain horton a helpless prisoner in the handsof the enemy                 v      chapter ii estelle had heard the attack made on the yankee camp and hau divined its object she ever felt sure of the defeat of the expedition but she did not anticipate the trouble that awaited her  soon as the men were restored to quiet and there was no probability of the rebels returning her brother made haste to apprise her of his victory we have given those impertinent midnight assassins a decent thrashing and what is more cheering and glorious their chiefyour lover is a prisoner safe into our hands said he in a boasting and menacing manner for a minute she was speechless for what could she say the case if true and she could not doubt it was hopeless he is a prisoner of war isnt he brother she asked at last in a humiliated voice  no he has forfeited the respect due a prisoner of war and is held subject to my orders and disposal and estelle nnless you make amends for your impertinence this after noon you shall witness his torture  with this threat to subdue her indomitable will he left her to her own thoughts she past the night in indiscribable anguishbetween hope and dispair a thousand plans for his release passed through her mind but were all attended with some insurmountable obstacle  the nighta sleepless one past away at last her pillow was drenched with her tears i only one hope cheered her troubled bosom she reseo ed toi ti her powers of persua sion upon the heart of her brother ureiy he was her broth er the same blood coursed each others veins she heard   him promise  dying mnother to love and take care of ir it could ntot b that one years association  itli h arits companions even had made him a brute she expetedltfii sympathy she was not the same stubborn elstelle of ye terday her spirit was crushed and she must yieldi she arranged her toilet and hastened to the parlor where she extpcted to find her brother alone but not so shem found hih accompanied by alston who were making merry over that greatest curse to the human family the bacchana  lian board  the sightof alston and her brothers dissipation arouse d lher ire anew but she must suppress it now andg ripvg al ston one look that made his guilty cowardly soul crouch like a whipped cur she beckoned her brother to one side he rose and followed her into another apartment when he took a seat she knelt by his side the humiliation of that proud spirit and not penitence caused a tear to course its way over her flushed cheek  brother said she i have knelt here to ask the re lease of captain horton i am youl sister and as such i make this request you are my only relative that i know of on earthand therefore the only source from which i can  expect sympathy and protection your last words to our dying mother n this room was a  mostsolemnai roinise to look after my wellfare in lifeto guard my

to me to know that lie is unharmed  you are through i suppose and you are quite an laum ble little sister this morning he said in sneering ridicule but estelle my plans are fixedmy promise is given the blood of fifty of my comrades the work of his hands last night cries in tones of thunder against captain horton while the moans of an hundred wounded men call curses upon his head he shall never marry you but neverthe less lie can have the opportunity of taking the oath of alle giance to the united states and thereby save his lifeif youl will promise to marry alston immediately and go north the heartlessness of this proposition sent a pang of sor rew to her heart and crushced her soul beneath a load of dis pair she saw that her plan was not successful all seem ed lost she rose up seated hersclf upon a sofa and bury ing her face in her hands lursted into a violent fit of grief but necessity is indeed the mother of invention and when almost the last ray of hope had ifed something seemed to suggestanother plan to her mind it was based oi decep tion and as deception is a womans fort it gave her new hope i have thrown grass she thought and it avail ed nothing i am excusable now to try what virtue there is in a stone           brother i am willing to make any almnost any sacrifice to save captain hortons life but he will not take the oath if you will agree to release him unconditionally and i can love alston and i will try i will consent to your proposition and give you a positive answer this evenig i will also make up my mind by that time he answer ed                   she drdw her pencil from her pocket wrote a few words on a piece of paper folded it handed it to her brother and requested him to hand it to alston he received it with a smile of satisfaction and departed on the mission she wrote   t    it also a short note to lieutenant emitsonand by means of aa undergroundtelegraph in the coarse of an hour it was placed in his hands in a few mlnmutes alston made hib appearance for the note requested an interview he looked awkward and agitated but it was a part of her plan fo reassure him take a seat edward he said smiling this agitated him more i recko she resumed that you have thought my conduct very strange it is my disposition you know to make tny love matters romantic but i reckon now i have carried the matter fhr enough and i have concluded hereafter to make our meeting mnore agreeable you must pardon my little frivolties  certainly eatelle certainly he said with the greatest emotions of delight  i have been very silly not to have seen more clearly into the matter before but you girls are always capable of deception but she answered  dont let brother iknow it yet i want usto surprise him  all rilh t  come this evening at  oclock and we will take a walk to our old play ground and talk over the pleasurcs of by gone days i have wearied myself withl this excitement and you must excuse me until then and ising from her seat she presented him a bough of arbaitae springing to his feet he departed in a perfect ecstacy of surprise and delight estelle smiled at the successful execu tion ofthe groundwork of her scheme     chapter iv  all ws quiet in the yankee encampment the day wai spent in burying the dead that had fallen the previous night and preparing against another like surprise the hour of three arrived and faithful to promise came edward alston unspeakably elated with glowing anticipa tions of the future little did he think that the halter was prepared for his neck and that with his own hands he was to tie the fatal knot estelle miglit be censured by theworld but whatever others nwre disposed to say she oared not she was determined to exhaust all the means at her command to defeat her brothers plans and save un harmed the object of her affections at all cost l she met alston at the dobr with a smile and taking his arm they set off for the proptsed evenings walk the walkto the old play ground upon the banks of the creek was spent it merry conversation in making amends for past offences and explanations as they neared the edge of the stream four confederate soldiers stepped from be hind an excavation in the banks and in a decided voice told alston that he wam a prisoner he was dismayed and thunder struck there was to farther necessity for de ception on the part of e telle her plan was fuily devel  oped giving the guard some hurried instructions they bore their charge away estelle watched them until they were beyond all danger when she hastily retraced her foot steps back to the house now the dreadful ordeal had to be passed she must meet an unreasonable drother exas perated by defeat what night he not dub but in the    spirit of the true heroine she resigned herself tothe unal terable decrees of fate and bowed her spirit in humble submission at the shrine of fortune she halted at the door to nerve her courage for the emergenc and toplace a little dagger that she wore in her bosom in a convenient position she entered the parlor and found ier brother seated smoking a cigarin dreamy reverie her footstep aroused him why estelle he said drowsily ybu did not walk long where is edward  in the hands of lieutenant emitson she answered decidedly he sprang to his feet in amazement say that again eptelle in the hands of lieutenant emitsona hoetage for captain horton she repeated i ill be said he in the most violent fit of passion if i intend thus to be baffled and bullied from my purpose by mortal mankind womaisisterno bynotyeven by my mother  swear by eternal heaven if edward a ston a united states soldier is not returned tothis house by tomorrow noon thatiwiithurn before your eyes this out lawed villian horton do you remember that and then if one hair on alstans head is molested i will place you in the hands of the commander of this department to stand the consequenc s t tmeasurei the distance answered estelle coolly beftoe  began the journey but brother whatever measare you meet to cptain hortoi shall be measqurd to edward alston again your vain threats will not daunt my spirits cor ater my purpose the feal is get and stamped an eye for an e e a tooth for a tooth icare not what the consequences may be to myself  he strode like a frantic mauiac back and forth across the room lie saw the fruiufesuness of ende voring to iam v     a      timidate a spirit that feared not death b felt that he was defeatedhopelessly defeated he halted before ler and looked in her countenance he saw there depicted the in flexible determinationthe casehardened will what could he do his fiendish nature could have crushed her from existenre but he feared to attemrpt it heretofore he said i have ibeen lenient towards you estelle but hereafter i shall alter my purpose i will send over captain horton in exchange for alston but you shall be incarcerated in onel of the darkest dungeons in fort warren where you shall eke out your life in igno miny and shame where pity nor mercy can never reach you whes he you shall never see a human face except of him who will come o to tantalize you i am consoled said she smiling for the thought that captain horton wras to be set free hadc brightened her hopes  to know that none of your hellish prisons are so dark but that the sunbeanms of mercy from heaven can penetrate their gloom  and there even there i will laugh at your folly and held sweet converse with that god who causes it to rainupon the just and upon the unjust he leit the romi andlockiing the door took the key with him iis threat was a dreadful one she pondered its consequences alone but she felt consoled she had gained a victiory though it might be dearly bought then in her mind she saw captain ilorton free oncle more she hopedyes she hopedbut what did she hope froma window sile could see all that transpired in the camr she wept tor two hours over her fearful destiny i have no frienll save my god and he has forsaken me she sobbed she turned her eyes again towards the camp and saw her brother accompanied by alston walking hur riedly towards headquarters and engaged in eager conver sation she felt that captaii horton was free there was too some excitement she fell upon her knees and in an humble submissive prayer thanked god e                               i             that although she vas to suffer herself that she had been the means of saving all that she loved on earth from an ig nominious death the tears that accompaniedfthis prayer were analized in heaven  as ahe reseated herself a whizing sound attracted her attention and then a deafening crash a shell bursted in the midst of the yankee camp and enveloped it in a sul phurious smoke another and still another crash in quick succession until the houses trembled with the vibrations confusion and panic siezed upon the men and they ran in every direction while excited officers were swearing and endeavoring to restore order videttes from the tear came in at breakneck speed shouting  the rebels have crossed the creek above and are advancing to cut oft our retreat this made the consternation complete and a generalstam  pede leaving accoutrements and equipage ensued from a position taken for that purpose cadtain horton could witness the enemys movement his command had been strengthened by a regiment of infantry and four pieces of artillery the infantry had been sent to cut oft the enemys retreat while captain horton with his compa ny for a support had attracted the enemy at the creek with the artillery to drive him from his position but whel this was done captain horton could not effect a crossing  and when he sawjthat the enefiy made so hurried a retreat he ordered the firing to cease and accompanied by lieu tenant emitson he crossed the creek to see the spoils of his victory there were still some straggters loitering in the abandoned camp by making his way through the wcods be evaded their observation add gained the honse where he hoped to hear what had become of estelle be fort the gate stood an ambulance with two horses before it he at once divined its object and though he felt that he was incurring a fearful risk yet shmething had to be done and done quickly by chance he got within a few paces of the door and stopped to take an observation of                z   t the interior near the center of the room sat jteute ner hands bound and her head reeting upon a table weeping  heri brother and alston were making some hurried pre parations to leave    no matter what danger attends it i ill attempt to res cue her whispewd captain horton

cleared away captain horton found himself in a few paces ofal aton and estelles brother prostrated near him a corpse a single combat ensued alston fired his pitol struck  captain hortons right arm and so paralized it that his pitql dropped from his hand upon the flopr captain hor ton quickly perceived that this accident had placed hlrn in a fearful dilemma aeston was re cocking his pistol to dis patch him in that moment of idspair with his left hand he grasped alston by the t roat and the suddennessof the  assault bore him to the floor and knocked his pistol from his hand but the loss of the use of one of his hands gave alston the advantage and he nearly regained his pistol when etelle having extricated her hands from the thongs rushed to the two conmbaaants raised her dagger and thrast its sharp point into alstonis heart with a slight tremor of his frame and a horrid contortion of his countenance his unmall soitit pa t away at the hands of her whose earth ly happiness he had sought

front of his tent and addressing his firstlieutenant who in company with several of the men were seated around a camp fire passingoff the evening in jovial con versation  any thing new on the picket lines captain asked the lieutenant anxiously no excitement there i believe but why then will you remember today so especially  another adventure i guess  no not an adventure  but an escape from the widows bewitching eyes answered the r lieutenant jestingly  dont be jealous lieutenant said the captain fore ing a smile but the want of life evinced by capt forrester in thus turning what he knew to be a very important matter into a joke was instantly made quite evident to lieutenant hart have a noncommissioned officer and twelve men de tailed immediately lieutenant aid order them to am bush tkemselres at the secondmile post beyond the vidette at the fork of the road there they will find a blind foot path leading off to the right exactly at the wlepost that r   f     a t d f t   r  path i desire to have strictly watched instruct them to keep well concealed toarrest every one that endeavors to pass and bring them to me and to continue there until further orders finishing these instructiqns he turned away and ordered his cook  to  prepare dinner in five minutes the qaptains excited said one of the men at the fire   theres something wrong as sure as twice one make four answered charlie m this lapsus lingua or the wrong answer to the wrong  sum caused a general outburst of laughter and charlie in ridicule was orderedby all present to go imnniiediately and call on the widow that she might teach him mathe datics hury off the cletail lieutenant ordered the cap tain as he seated himself at his messchest to eat his has tily prepared meal saddle up  s outed the noncoinnissioned officer and in a few minutes the detail was making its way to the place designated it was now growing dark and the sombre clouds boiling up from the noitheast and spreading over the horizen gave ominous signs of a snow storm while a boisterous wind shrieked and howled amid the towering forest pine tops the campfires of captain forresters squadton blazing brightly and the men that were not immediately on duty were quietly seated around them waiting for their turns to go at headquarters things were exceedingly quiet alone capt forrester ind lieutenant hart might be seen by the light of their fires seated in dreamy silencethe lieu      tenant in wonder while the captain was evidently en gaged in deep thought  and from the oftei voluntary contracting of his dark brow the path of dutyover which these thoughts were then meandering were beset with many unpleasant obstacles but at last as though to break the suspense that he knew must be passing through the lieutenants mind he said today lieutenant i have ome in possession of positive information that there is in our midst a secret league composed of our own fel lowcitizens but i am glad to say that the league is small whose avowed intention it is to thwart our designs who have a regular means of communication that conveys information to the enemy with the greatest dispatch whio carry on a nefarious contraband traffic and who are en deavoring to induce our fellow soldiers to desert their countrys flag if this disaffection is not crushed in its infancy it bids fair to weaken if not destroy the cause in north carolina this is perfectly reliable information from a responsible source  but by the wxay came near costing me my life today  and opening the breast of his coat he displayed the trace ofa rifle bullet that just missed his body at the heigth of his heart this too was the work of what was once a lady but hesitating he buried his forehead in his hands is it possible  asked the lieutenant in surprise but before toinorrowss sun heaven may favor us with some cue to this dark plot and if so i shall go im mediately to work heart and hand to bring those black hearted villians to summary justice and rid our mother state of the stigma that their conduct is already bringing upon her fair name  you will need assistance captain in this matter and remember that i am anxious t be your abettor yes i am aware that it will be a hazardous under taking and to be successful will require nerve energy and perseverance i know of no one on whom i can more confidently rely than yourself in this matter and i shallr expect your assistance rising from his seat he extend ed his hand to the lieutenant who grasping it said w       i t r               s here i suppose captain forrester we mutualy resolve to succeed or perish thats the determination was the response hapter ii nothing has been heard from the detail i suppose lieutenant asked the captain early on the next morn ing                                           nothing except what has just been brought in by the relieved piclts they report that firing was heard be low about daybreak order a man to saddle his horse and report to me said the captain but hold i see a man riding in camp now its one of the detail answered the lieutenant and strange to say he has a little girl on the horse with him a little girl ha thus heaven has crowned this enter prise with success captain forrester followed by lieutenant hart walked in the tent as the horseman rode up in front captain said he lifting the little girl from his horse i have come to bring this little girl whom we caught this morning acompanied by some one endeav  oring to pass through our ambuscade her escort made his escape after we had fired on him several times she will give us no information come here tome said the captain putting on an austere frown and addressing the little miss who had as sumed a look of perfect resignation this abrupt order caused a little agitation however in her features but placing the nail of her left fore finger between her teeth she promptly obeyed the order as the captain turned away to complete his toilet which he had not quite fin ished take a seat on the bed here sissy aint you cold  asked the lieutenant no sir  answered a low voice the captain somewhat attracted by the soft musical voice turned his eyes upon the beautiful features of the blueeyed neat little maiden and asked whose little girl are you she hesitated in perplexity i am nobodys little girl what is your name lula lulawhat else  asked the captain nothing else  what is your fathers name  she refused to answer where is your home i havnt got any home where is your mother  i have no mother now she answered while the tears chased each other down her plump cheeks you are a singular little being said the captain you belong to nobody you have no home nor mother and named nothing but lula where is your father come you must answer rae ei dont know sir a kt s   thave you no brothers and sisters  yes sir i have two brothers and one sister  where are they  i dont jnow sir and whats your sisters name julia nothing but julia of course said the captain iron ically is she grown yes sir what is your age ten she answered ten said the captain you know a great deal more than you have told he made a feint as though to draw this sabre from its scabbard hoping thereby to intimidate her she caught the movemeint and throwing herself into lieutenant harts arms she shrieked oh lieutenant dont let him kill me   he will not hurt you if you will tell us why you were passing our men this morning and who was with you i was sent she said and couldnt help it oh  if you please dont makeine tell any more dont be rashwith her captain she must be sent to the general said the captain ill swear by eternoal heaven to wreak vengeance upon the heads of those villians yet  captain forrester was a young confederate officer of much promise   no one yaw him but to love him his manly form his frank open countenance his fierce black eyes his generous heart and inflexible determinatiou won the admiration even of his enemies  an enemy to him however was an enemy and he hated him with all the bitterness and venom that the depths of his soul could foster while he loved his friends with that interesting devotion that ever characterises the faithful  i heart the cause of his country was dearer to him thai even life itself and hae respected no one that did not cherish a like devotion                          when captain forrester was convinced thata plan was really set on foot in his native state to break down the eause in which he himself was struggling and in which he had seen so many of his comrades and even a cherish ed brother sacrificetheir lives it aroused every nerve in his form to energy then the rews through ris picket lines to the enemy awakened him to a vigilant seuse of his duty in lieutenant hart he founda genial companion one whose motto was ever to do or die one who loved ad  venture with a veteran hunters devotion one who never shrank from any duty except where his finer sentiments were compromised nevertherefore could the disaffect  ed mob of north carolinians havd had two more deter mined foemen watching them thanthese two who before a campfire mutually resolved to crush them or die lieutenant said he after musing for a few moments we are now fairly on the track of those traitorous rene gades whose headquarters if we may honor their den by this appellation i have every reason to believe isnot far distant from this place in the wilds of dover swamp to detect and defeat them now only requires a little cunning courage and energetic action what course ought we now to pursue or what are your plans  we must first find out their base of operations this movement must be definitely understood they must be betrayed by strategy and then we must crush them at orle blow of course we cannot commence au open cam paign against them in their dens in dover swamp so secrecy on our partwillbe the ground work of success i am well acquainted with all of this country cap tain and i offer you my services as a scout    i     tl a i  i suggest then that you take with you three days cooked rations and set out this evening i am sure that the foot path at which our gnen are now ambushed is a cominunication to their headquarters take that path and find to what mystical rendezvous or hover it leads and what dark deeds of treachery it witnesses cauion must be your watchword  and let me advise you to keep your eyes open and have no confidants order your de tail to camp this plan was adopted and lieutenant hart was dis patched as a seout and ijetective f    chapter iii  the widow gives us another ball tonight said charlie mas he walked hurriedly in camp and ad dressed a number of his comrades who had seated them selves upon the pine straw and were very diligently watch ing two of their number who were deeply interested in a contest at checks                     not to us answered one of the men charlie bit to you  he  the invitation is extended to as many of the squadron as are disposed to go you must go boys we shall have splendid mnsie furthermore there is to be some new ladies there the widow says they are beau tiful where are they to come from  was asked they are to run the blockade of our pickets tonight after dark accompanied by edgar and austin but this must not be made knbwn to captain forrester   it will be a hazardous undertaking and further more it is acting in bad faith to the service how are they to return  i reckon the captain will grant them a pass in the morning to return answered charlie you are mistaken charlie  orders have just been is sued that no one shall pass the lines without written per mission from the general never mind boys the matter is all fixed with the captain andwill all tirn out right and charlie turned away and walked to another portion of the encampment that boy deserves sympathy said one of his friends eyeing him closely as he left why   sked another because by subtility that woman has completely en trapped him and is fast leading him astray i for one have but little confidence in her i am sure that she has always treated us very kindly and for all i know she is a perfect lady very true buti do not like the cut of her eye fur thermore her husband died in the yankee service and some even doubt his being dead at allneverthelesssi suppose she is called widow she could not help what her husband did  probablp not three hours afterwards and the merriment at the wid ows ball was at its acme   t r i y                                            f  tlf r      f r    fi           j              ye t n      boi aae a

successful as you right suppose was the re ply    why they evaded the picket and patrol but were met by the relief who have reported itto the captain the captain says that he intends to arrest the ladies early in the morning aid he has doubled the picket lines to pre vent their escape the captain has offered a reward to know the boys that piloted them tlrough the relief could not recognize them in the dark edgar is strongly      suspected i know that none of the boys who are knowing to all the circumstances will betray edgar and austin end i will make all of these facts known to them immediatelyl saying this charlie called his two friends to one side and related the circumstances to them this is very strange conduct on the part of the cap rain or else  have been deceived in the matter said austin for  never mind boys interrupted charlie  it will all be right yes but if captain forrester made this threat he will carry it into execution unless the ladies are carried back through the lines before day and this must be done goedgar and tell them what hashappened tell them that we will take them back at four oclock and be ready then to start tell them also that it will be impossible totake them back on horseback and that they will have to walk                         edgar did as he was advised and soon returned with the report that the ladies were very much excited and ready to start immediately  no says austin at four oclock the fifth relief will take post we will pass the lines at patrol number one x s t  f   i p                   i  i   f m    t   ti i  at four the patrol will be expecting the relief and will be standing on post with the picket and under the cover of night we can cross his beat and then how  asked edgar we will get into the field at the gate from whence there is a smdll path leading into the main read beyond the last vidette post hownear the pickets do we have to pass  in rifle shot  but if we are cautious we shall pass un observed at the hour set apart this plan was put in execution as they passed out of the field at which place they were safely across the picket lines austinexclaimed  and now i feel relieved all danger is now over  wasnt that the tramp of horses hoofson the road  asked edgar  be still  the enemy  the enemy  whispered one of the young ladies you had better return to y our command we are not afraid now to return home by ourselves we are sorrythat we cannot see you safely home but  it is best for us to return and extending their hands to the young ladies they bid them in haste goodbye  tell captain forrester whispered oe of the young ladies but before she could complete the sentence she was abruptly interrupted by her companion  and the two young men hastened back in the direction of their camps when they were passing their picket post they were as they haddone before using great precaution for fear of being discovered edgar halted suddenly and laid his hand on the shoulder of his companion hark  he whispered  anadvancing footstep ahead lie down the form of a man passed them he is alone whis pered austin as prompted by one common impulse   k  a   they sprang to their feet and presented their pistols to the truders head the man scared out ef his wits fell upon his knees and stammering said   iin a aeteezn not a word from you sir                  amplet us search him said austin what are you doing here at this hour  demanded edgar of the affrighted stranger hunttting around our pickets i guess so are we what kind of a dispatch is this you have here  said austin extracting a neatly folded paper from the back lining of the prisoners coat which when it became light read as follows to        gliesmo tunwt the prisoner and his unintelligible sent to department headquarters d  di c  w dispatch were both  chapter iv if three days previous had made a lasting impression upon the mind of captain forrester indeed this was a day of memorable events to the entire command the most important information had been communicated to the general commandingby thisnerveusspy and his dis patch while the minor deeds of treachery that had been going on even within the bounds of captain forresters camps began to unfold themselves before his eyes the day commencedwith a demonstration by the enemy upon the picket lines the pickets were everywhere driven back upon the reserve when to maintain their position a most desperate skirmish took place which though it resulted in completely routing the insolent foe yet many of our bravest boys had fallen among those were edgarand austin who while feeling the trength i the enemysline of battle in the first part of the en gagernent were shot dead and at a point too where no nemy was suspected hardly had the enemydisappeared the line of battle been broken and the excitement  of the morning passed away when lieutenanthartireturned to camp from his epedition this was a new case of excitement for every one could see in his telltale countenance thathe had brought infor matiou of importance  whats the newsf whats the news i lieutenant  asked voice after voice i  i suppose you thrashed the yankees this morning would be his evasive answer he sought captain forrester in private interview the camp was in breathless suspense until broken byan order issued by the captain  for all of the men to be ready to march at four oclock on foot when the men were marched to the field of operation nut one knew where he was nor what he was to do they had marched through the wild woods for an hour and a half and were now halted in the thickest place they had    seen the captain andlieutenant who had lead their horses in therear a few moments before halting the men had fastened them to trees    the captain wants to hide us good said one of the  men in mimic ridicule ordering the squadron to count off the strength of the line in an under tone he divided it into two equal parts with the first he formed a parallel line of battle and placing it in charge of lieutenant hart he marched the second forty paces filed it to the right halted brought it to a front in a line corresponding witly the first now make ready with your pieces men lie down and await order  in the greatest suspense and anxiety they all prostrated themselves upon the earth with their pieces cocked and in a position to be discharged at the commandafire how indiscribable is that feeling of impatience that at tends the anticipation of a final issue every stroke of the heart seems to say wait while it apparently makes but four vibrations per hour what is to be done  would be asked by one of an other all the way down the line the suspense was one of novelty with the men  every thought would seem to ask its successor whats the is sue   with captain forrester it was different his sus pense was half doubt intermingled with hopeful antioi pation he and lieutenant hart alone in thetwo line thenconfronting each other knew that between themy a small iut well beaten footpath as the last lingering sun beam took its departure from the tallest forest pine topthe man on the left of the first line touched his nea est comrade with his elbow look he whispered and nodding his head to the left he drew his attention to a detachmentsay a hundredarmed men marching ii single file close order on they marched unsuspecting some wore the insignia of the soldier both blue and gray while by far the greeter portion were garbed in the habit ef the plebeian citizen as the head of the ntarehing column passed the riglt ef the ambuscade captain forrester rose coolly and or dered his men  upon their feet   the men sprang from their cover like mad lanther their guns sprung and levelled  surrender he demanded in a firm yet animates voice this fell upon their unsuspecting reverie like a thunder bolt some attempted to run some threw down their arms and shouted dont shoot shoot out the brains of the first scoundrel that ak temptsto escape ordered captain forrester well give up and other tokens of surrenderrang out all the way down the line arrangements were made for their safe escort to the anmp when the captain shouted to our horses lieu tenant to our horses and mounting their restless chargers they set off with almost lightning speed down the footpath through the dense gloomy forest   the path brought them suddenly to n opening at thi riouth of a lane the captain reined up that is it said the lieutenantpointing to a cottag built farmhouse two or three hundred yards in the d nze i    they drew their pistols from the holsters and pressing their rowels to their horses sides they made them redou ble their exertions as they neared the gate leading to the yard two armed men stepped from behind the gate posts and levelling their guns fired lieutentant hart reeledin his saddle and finally fell from his horse while captain forresters horse fell dead in a few paces of the gate he caught on his feet however and recovered from the shock of the fall only to find himself confronted by the two men who with fixed bayonets had thrown themselves in thegateway to dispute his farther advance raising his pistol he shot one of them dead in his tracks the other seeing the fate of his companion endeavored to save himself by flight  but ere he made but few steps he met a like fate the captainnow caught his pistol im his left and drawing  lissabre with his right hand rushed en still to the house as he placed his foot upon the door steps the smoke from a musket almost stifled him but the hall missed its mark raising his sabre at a teirce point he thrust it into the bosom of his antagonist and bore him struggling to the floor like a tiger roused from his lair with the scent of blood he leaped over the prostrated body of the eying man and into the passage of the house to the left he spied a shut door with an elastic bound he threw himself against it and hoisted it from its hinges as his ey es met its interior now shaded by the soft evening twilight a woman with hands ex tended towards heaven and speechless with fear met him and knelt at his feet are you he demanded    one of the fiends of this den to

spring when a placid smile hay be said to be dawn ing upon the lips of naturewhen each little songster dares to speak forth an anxious carol in unison with the notes of the gladdened insects that have been awakened by a stealing sunbeam a morning that brings gloom over dhe despondent and makes the grave lighthearted mirth fulwhen joy and despair seem to linge together upon ihe air as the sun lifted his sparkling face rbove the low wall of smoke that belted the surrounding horizon all the gloom in the neighboring atmosphere seemed to concen trate and hover over captain forresters camp it was indeed a picture of a calm after a storm to a shipwrecked crew who had been rescued from  immediate death but doorped to perish by degrees upon a barren and solitary sock in the immense bosom of the briny deep here and there might be seen one gloomy face seated undisturbed and alone his mind wandering apparently in the fathom less depths of despoudeney at sone other point groups were assembled as though to mingle and share each others ennui the death of a comrade a messmate or afriend dad tb be commemorated in mutual sympathy at headquarters things had been quite astir at an early hour during the night courieis had been dispatched t and returned from  the general commandiag with in structions at sunrise captain forrester was walking back and forth ip front of his tent his eyes fixed intently upn the earth and grasping tightly his right arma with v   t  i a    a s i i  his left bothofwhich were drawn tightly across hip bo som something haunted him  and what was it charlije entered the camp hurriedly and sought him  captain his voice faltered have youobeyed my orders charlie   we found it impossible captain impossible  retorted the captain we found her a corpse a crpse indeed she has coinntted suicide said charlie handing the caitain a note                                   she held this note in her han  which is addressed io you the captain read the note aloud as follows iknow captain i orrester before this yiu have been apprised of my wickedness i know that es cape is im possible and i have preferred death todisgrace so charlie this widow wih hw iom we have all as sociated and recognized as a friend has beei one of the chief accomplices in getting information to the enemy she has been a spy e en vhwithin the bounds of our camp  charlie icoked horrornstricken  for this widked woman by her cunning devices had exerted an influence over his youthful heart that was fast developing itself in a deepseated affection his ftr lhve was blighted at a blow in this note he saw her history at a glnce how he had been duped i for a moment lie was moved  but how easily can the heart forgive a fatl even in a worth less object of affection when captain eor ete had obstarined satisfactory e vi deuce of the guilt oh this woman he knew not of the inti  macy that existed between oharlie and herself and as charlie was one oi his favorites he was charged with the execution of the order for her arrest charlie could not would not shrink from the duty but resolved in his heart to rescue her frqm imprisonment but with her own hands she had snow shut herself within the walls of a prisonhouse from which the most desperate lover hae never attempted to extricate the ideal of his heart and now charlie retires from the further thread of this story if not a better at least a mueh wiserboy but this did not ease the heart and calm the troubled bosom of captain forrester he had been the hero in noble enterprise his whole actions must come before the eyes of the world for approval or disapproval but  let th e  itd  t tua  mer knew one tender iog te geruts nature tru  condemn him lieutenant tart whom we left fallen from his horse in the lane near the deserters house not killed but severely wounded in the head as soon as he recovered from the shock was placed upon his faithful steed that did pot do sert him by captain forrester and succeeded in return ing to camp from whence he was sent to the hospital at kinston little lula who had borne herself out nobly before the general by telling all she knew and probably a great deal morewhen she heard that lieutenant hart was at the hospital wounded volunteered her services to nurse him  and when a day or two afterwards he was granted  permission  to be sent home by his regnest she accompanied him     mrs hart the lieutenants mother is very much interested in her history as related by herself and will not consent for her to leave little lula is very happy now and says the lieutenant is her sweet healtt the citteezin with his vile abetters have met a very merited end that is the end of a rope now let uns return and follow captain forrester through the sequel of his noble project captain forrester of himself had undertaken a worthy  purpose that of bringing a treasonable league of his fel lowountrymen to the bar of justice how far he had   y f t  t i t  t f fj f i i a   g eneceeded let results tell yes he had traced it to its headquarters and had given it a deathblow but hadhe net conte shortof his duty t                   at that headquarters he found a woman a daughter of the ring leader he as a military chieftain was acting for the cause of his country regardless of selfish conside ration he ought to have arrested her but the sympathy de had elicited in her behalf had caused him to forego mat unpleasant ordeal she was a womanlike hit motherlike his sister she might be an enemyan ac eemplice in the hellborn band that be had crushed such a train of thoughts as these were wrangling in his bosom this morning but he saw her still in his mind as he had seen her in realitythe pure innocent blueeyed julia te angel in the den of ruffians a lily that had sprung up unfortunately among bramblesthe aromatic ettle flowerthat seemed destined                     to blush unseen and waste its swetuess on the desert air in these operations he had been general commander inchief as well as the war making power might he not be allowed to exercise his judgment in the entire plan regardless of what the world night say in detail and hope to be justified by the final results surely he thought there can be no treachery in a heart to which those eyes are the index         but the idea haunted him in the farther discharge of lis duty  at the very consummation of his plan he risk ed his judgment in an important matter and might it mot have beeii modified by tears in the eyes of a beautiful woman he stopped in his walk  some solid henclusion iad passed through his mind he said aloud  human nature is deceitful and woman is an unsolved mystery if she las deceived meif she is an accomplice of the enemy now she has neither home nor friends she xll seek his protection ya as sooi as a respite from duty wonid permit hirehe r safed to satisfy himself by seeing her again so iount lg his horse he rede to the house where he had left her he met him at the gate the same warmhearted julia  nevertheless wearing an expression of sadness in her sym pathyinspiring eyes but she did not meet him as one who had been the means of throwing her upon the old  world without a friend to sympathize ora home te shelter her head but as her deliverer when he grasped her ex tended hand its warm palm sent a pang of sorrow to his keait that nothing save restoration to her could ease and caused a tear to concentrate in his fierce eyes  julia said he  i came this  orning that yoi might tell me of and show me those pans of which you spoke yesterday come in captain thank you i would be glad to do so but i must soon return she flitted back into the house and soon returned ready to accompany him to the house where but the evenifig previous he had been the hero in so bloody a tragedy they walked on in silence  for what could he say she broke the suspense captain itold you last evening thati had been hell  as a prisoneri told you that i had one opportunity of communicating to you tl treason that was going on in he neighborhood of your commnd on the night of the widows ball my father consented for me accompanied by a wicked woman one of his accomplices to go with me in your lines she went with the purpose of obtaining infor mation  intended to go to you and expose the whole affair  but your threat to arrest us coupled with the knowledge that iwas in bad company and would be un able to exculpate myself intimidated me and my planu were all frustrated  where is that wonian now  asked the captain  a a      i f  r i i    t t y f  t s y she has escaped to the enemy and will go to new york where she has relatives  and she is therefore gone forever beyond your readh just atthis moment they emerged into a large neigh borhood road one end of which led to a confederate pick et stand and the other through dover swamp into the lower neuse road  julia stopped suddenly and burst ed into tears  captain said she  here a few days age my poor misguided mother sufferect herself

be was met by a number of soldiers who captured her and fired on him i have not heard from him since overcome by these thoughts she seated herself upon a fallen tree and burst into a most violent paroxysm of grief captain forrester watched her in wonder and agitation until his heart grew sick within his bosom he seated himself by her side and threw his arm gently around her shoulders and drew her to his bosom cjulia said he will you captain forrester sheexclaimed endeavoring to free herself from his grasp would y ou insult a poor girl whose heartis already borne to the earth with sorrow

to convince me that a pen which can be made so efficient in the cause of temperance should not remain inactive you make the legitimate articles from which intox icating drinks are made speak out in a language which cannot be mistaken may i hope you will turn your attention to the trees plants minerals and other sub stances which have been compelled to take so humili ating a part in producing so many counterfeit intoxi cating liquors liquors which are inflicting upon poor humanity much greater evils than the genuine to enable you to see the extent to which wines are manufactured without the grape and other liquors drugged and adulterated to make them seem what they are not i send you a little tract by mr delavan this will give you some idea of the gross frauds in the liquor trade the

stranger near to spoil our heartfelt joy if solid happiness we prize within our breast this jewel lies and they are fools who roam i will introduce my readers without preface or apology into the bright and pleasant breakfastroom of mrs goodwin the cheerful breakfast is over the morning duties performed and the younger children prepared for school mrs goodwin still retains her place at the deserted table giv ing the last polish to the silver coffee urn and placing in order due the cups and sau cers since we have introduced ourselves          the campiene lampe thus unceremoniously into mrs goodwins presence let us listen to her soliloquy how happy i am she said to herself as she deposited on the table with a look of satisfaction at its brightness the coffee urn i never expected to feel so well and in such good spirits again it seems as if a cloud llad been lifted from off my pros pects and the sunshine of the future gilds the shadows of the past oh what a change has one short year wrought i think i feel as lighthearted as i did the day i received this urn as a wedding gift from my dear dear aunt she mentally conti nued as she placed it on the broad shelf of her china closet along with other memen toes of that happy period the gifts of early friends as we have begun to take liberties we shall allow ourselves a peep into this well arranged and neatly kept closet the very atmosphere of which is alluring as the eye ranges over the neat display of   the camphene lamp     china and glass it reaches on the topmost shelf a row of cut glass lamps of a neat pattern and apparently in good order but evidently out of use as well as out of reach by their side and in equally good condition stand a row of decanters flanked by a goodly array of wine glasses of vari ous dimensions patterns and color there is a history attached to these lamps that i have half a mind to tell you good reader though it may be revealing family secrets but as mrs goodwin is too benevolent a woman to withhold any thing that may benefit her fellow beings i will imagine i have her permission to tell the whole story there was a period you swell recollect when a mania prevailed in the community for camphene spirit gas burning fluid patent oil and various other substitutes for good old fashioned sperm a few prudent personsescaped the contagion and others          the campiiene lamp were too timid to admit it into their houses mrs good wil who always had an eye to im provements in the domestic economy was one of the first to be caught by the flaming advertisements thrown in at the door set ting forth its various advantages the supe rior clearness and brilliancy of the light its neatness its cheapness and its safety if used with cauiton  and indeed some of the articles were even declared on good authority to be safe at any rate absolutely not explosive if a lighted match should he plunged into the can containing the fluid an experiment the vender declared he had tried himself mrs goodwin was entirely won over the great business now was to win over her husband this was not so easy a matter he knew the nature of these compositions and felt that they wouldnt aluays be safe though care fil people might use them their whole lives without an accident they argued the   the camphene lamp     matter for some time till her eloquence in setting forth its advantages overcame his better judgment and the point was carried it was pronounced by the whole family to be a great improvement and being adopted by so prudent a lady as mrs goodwin in creased its popularity so that oil was nearly banished froti the neighborhood they had used it safely for so long a time they began to think all the shocking accounts they had read of its dangerous qualities were only bughears to frighten the timid till one evening they were startled by a cry of fire attended by unusual demonstrations of alarm and on going to the door found the room of an opposite neighbor in flames and the family rushing from the house in great terror when the tumult had a little subsided it was found to be caused by the bursting of a camphene lamp the chil dren five in number from the age of two to twelve were sitting around a table look         the camphene lamp ing over their lessons for the next day the lamp burning dimly one of them took it up to see if it needed filling when it sud denly exploded with a noise like the dis charge of a pistol and enveloped them in a sheet of flame with rare presence of mind one of the boys ran and plunged himself into a snow drift by the door oth ers were seized by different members of the family and the flames extinguished but not before they were dreadfully burnt the youngestfatally mr goodwin who hap pened to be at home was the first to run to their relief he was very much excited by the scene he witnessed for he was a man of ardent feelings and what is called naturally good hearted keenly alive to any thing that threatened the lives of his children though not always mindful of their best interests hear me wife said he  not one drop of burning fluid of any kind shall ever enter this house mrs   the camkphene lamp     goodwin strove to calm his excited feel ings but didnt attempt any remonstrance seeing it was no time to do so but returned to the afflicted family and being a most sympathetic and efficient neighbor and friend made herself very useful as a nurse she devoted herself all the next day to the harriss and closed the eyes of the young est child in death before she left the house when she returned home her first business was to collect all the candlesticks the house afforded and remove the offensive lamps before mr goodwins return she didnt hesitate one moment to banish the cam phene much as she admired the light and though it involved the sacrifice of her new lamps and though she knew the ac cident was the result of a childs careless ness these considerations didnt weigh a straw against the risk of her family in re taiiinig it no allusion was made to the accident at tea nor was the subject of         the camphene lamp lamps discussed mr goodwin returned home earlier in the evening than he was wont to do for of late he had spent most of his evenings abroad he said when he entered and found his wife sitting alone with one candle we do miss the bril liant light of the camphene wife how have you worried through the evening with this dim candle i have been sitting where the room was lighted by gas and the con trast is very striking it seems like com ing into a tomb lighted by a taper which only serves to make darkness visible i can never endure this what a pity said his wife  when we are making a change that we cannot intro duce gas into the house when it is brought to our very door it is such a nice light so little trouble and so diffusive it would really take away half the trouble of hav ing company if our rooms were lighted by it yes yes wife i know all its advan   the camphene lamp     tages said he rather impatiently it is indeed a beautiful light and i wish from my heart we could have it but it is too expensive altogether positively i cant think of it at present i am a great economist too said mrs goodwin play fully  cant we retrench in some way that will enable us to meet the additional ex pense it is really so desirable no im possible he replied in the first place the gas itself is allowed to be more ex pensive than oil but think how easy it is to economize in it she interposed he went on not heeding her remark then there is the getting it into the house then the fixtures all this costjs a great deal of money mrs g  i grant all this she replied  the first cost is great but will you allow me to suggest a mode of retrenchment she said timidly that i think will enable us to meet this expense and many others besides i hate this         the camphene lamp talking continually about expense and re trenchment said he pettishly a man of business knows what he cal afford and these little savings you talk about dont amount to any thing a mere drop in the bucket a nians notes must be paid when they are due or he loses his credit as a merchant but what new suggestion have you to make now by way of economy let me hear she drew him gently to the closet do you see said she  where  have placed the camphene lamps because we thought they endangered the lives and welfare of our family will you for the same reason place the decanters by their side in short will you give up the use of wine and banish all intoxicating drinks from your house promise me this and i will pledge myself that at the end of one year your parlors shall be lighted with gas and you shall not complain of the expense what an idea said he in amazement   the camphene lamp     what has put this into your head it has been in my head and heart too she said many a long day and weary sleep less night and i should have spoken of it before but i lacked the courage to do it i have seen so much of late to shock and distress me in your altered looks in your impaired health in your perplexities about money matters that i can refrain no longer ihave practised economy and denied my children means of education they ought to enjoy because i wouldnt call on you for the money when i knew these expenses might all be met with the money needlessly expended upon articles of drink find ing he made no reply she was inspired to go on did you ever reckon the expense of wine at one of your dinner parties she said no he replied i wouldnt be guilty of such a mean contemptible thing when i entertain my friends i wish to do it in a handsome way without         the camphene lamp counting the cost it isnt my way either said mrs goodwi  to count the cost of entertaining my friends though i keep an exact account of my personal ex penses for your satisfaction  let the dol lars and cents go  that is a secondary mat ter i dont care a straw about the money it is the moral influence it will exert upon our children i look at i always thought it would be my pride and joy to point them to their father for an example of all that was noble and high minded now will you my dear george said she in supplicating accents cby one promise make me as happy as i was the day we pledged our troth at the altar remember the solemn promises we then made to each other which we called god to witness mr goodwin looked amazed  this is strange language julia and i am not prepared for such a step as you propose my dear husband said she  it is a step   the camphene lamp    once taken you will never wish to retrace you didnt hesitate a moment about the camphene when you saw the mischief it had done i could show you by living ex amples that you are retaining the most dangerous agent of the two camphene has caused the death of tens where ardent spirits has destroyed thousands both soul and body this i grant may be true said he somewhat softened  but wife you talk as if you hadnt been happy havent you had every thing you wanted have i denied you atly reasonable gratifi cation have i ever treated you with un kindness since our marriage no george i complain of no positive unkind ness but i have sadly missed of late those delicate attentions that tender sympathy which the heart of woman demands and has a right to expect from him to whom she has given her heart and in whose hands she has placed her happiness think          the camphene lamp you george it has been no trial to me to go into the company of my friends unat tended by you because youl preferred the society of convivials to theirs do you think i have sat up many many times till weary midnight to receive you on your re turn without many a sad and bitter feeling of regret that my society and the pleasures of home and the prattle of our sweet chil dren was not preferred to the company of the worldly and dissipated and when our lovely little julia dearer to me than life was breathing her last in my arms did it add nothing to my grief think you that her the word father was stifled by her emotions she would have added was not there to sympathize in my anguish  could you at such seasons said she re suming her composure  have looked into my heart and seen the struggle that was going on there you would have needed no   the camphene lamp     other expostulation and i should have been spared the pain of this appeal her husband was moved and his feelings touched after a pause in which he seemed to be summoning resolution for a ecisive step he turned to his wife and said with emotion you are right dearest julia i see the whole extent of the evil and the tendency of the course i have pursued i have seen it for a long time and knew that it was working my destruc tion but hadnt resolution to break loose from my associates and burst the thraldom of this dreadful habit i loathe it from my inmost soul and you cannot tell me any thing i do not know of its evils my resolution is taken you have helped me to make it and i trust that with the help of god i shall be enabled to keep it i will place the decanters with my own hands where you have placed the lamps who can describe the happiness of that         the camphene lamp moment  the anxious wife who had trembled for the result could find no ex pression for her feelings but in tears they flowed freely but they were tears of grati tude and joy before she laid her head on the pillow that night she implored her heavenly father to take the returning wanderer into his fold to set his feet in the right path and to establish his goings and give him strength to per severe in the right way  the next morning she awoke with a new feeling it was like the calm sunshine that succeeds a stormy day hushing the troubled elements to repose shedding a rainbow hue on every object and edging even the clouds with a silvery brightness she rose earlier than usual and had a bright fire burning in the breakfast room before mr goodwin made his appearance every thing wore a cheer ful aspect and mr goodwin was the first to resume the last evenings conversation   the camphene lamp     since my dear julia i have become a convert to your doctrine and pledged myself to touch not taste not handle not please instruct me how i shall dispose of the choice spirits i have imprisoned in my wine cellar shall i pour them out as a libation to mother earth i will tell you she quickly replied send it all to the apothecaries to be dealt out as medi cine to the sick and to minister to the declining years of the aged and infirm who may need it i suppose it is all of suitable quality for that purpose  not quite sure of that wife some of my wine cost enough to be the genuine article but of the rest i am doubtful you dont suppose i gave my common visitors the same quality as i set before gentlemen connoiseurs in these matters that would be casting pearls before swine i will let barney take some of my port to a chemist to ascertain its quality before i dispose of         the camphene lamp it for i have some suspicion of that and i mean to look into the matter it is a vile imposition that is being practised upon the public in the composition and adulteration of liquors and it is so skilfully done too that it cannot be detected by the most experienced you cannot tell said his wife  how much it has distressed me to see young men  lads i may say  stim ulating their appetites by the use of various substitutes for cold water manufactured no doubt from the vilest material slow poison which their healthful stomachs resist for a time but which must operate to their detriment sooner or later and not the less surely because slowly did i ever tell you of the brandy i once procured at a small shop in the neighborhood for the purpose of wetting papers to put over my jellies i turned it into a plate and not having occasion to use it all that day it stood in the closet till the next morning   the camphene lamp    when i went to it the spirit had departed and a dark sediment resembling logwood was all that remained here the conver sation was interrupted by the entrance of the children and wasnt resumed till mr goodwin had furnished himself with the information he sought with regard to the adulteration of liquors my investigation saidhe when he again introduced the subject has led wife to some of the most astounding rev elations which as they come from the most reliable sources we cannot for a moment doubt though they may tax the credulity of those who are iot disposed to believe them i will read you some ex tracts from a pamphlet put into my hands by a friend of temperance now though once a liquor dealer and who indorses all the statements frauds committed in the adulteration of wine and spirit in the city of new york alone amount it is sup          the cadiphene lamp posed to at least three millions of dollars annually professor c a lee of new york makes the following statement a cheap madeira is made by extracting the oils from common whiskey and by passing it through carbon there are immense establishments in this city where the whiskey is thus turned into wine  in some of those devoted to this branch of business the whiskey is rolled in in the evening but the wine goes out in the broad day light ready to defy the closest inspec tion prof lee further adds  the trade in empty wine casks in this city new york is immense the same casks being replenished again and again and always accompanied by that infallible test of genuineness the customhouse certifi cate a french chemist says wines are adul terated by various substances the object is to mask defects to give color or strength   the campiene lamp     wines adulterated by sugar of lead are the most dangerous accum on culinary poisons says i few commodities which are the object of com merce are adulterated to a greater extent than wine a mixture of spoiled foreign and homemade wines are frequently con verted into the wretched compound fre quently sold under the name of old port hear what dr warren of boston says every body will have confidence in his statements he relates an instance of  twenty persons having become severely ill in paris after drinking white wine that had been adulterated with lead one of them died and one became a paralytic it is now a well ascertained fact that no wine can cross the atlantic in its natural state without spoiling it must be enforced by drugs or ardent spirits a friend of mine he adds ordered some wine from madeira with the positive injunction that         the camphene lamp no ardent spirits should be put into the wine the wine came as strong as ever the question was asked the shipper did you comply with my order the answer came   we complied with the letter but not with the spirit of your order we put no ardent spirit into the wine but we put the wine into the ardent spirit had we not made the addition the wine would have spoiled before reaching you rev dr baird states that little or no wine is shipped in a pure state the dealers he says purchase it in a pure state at the vineyards but in their hands its character is entirely changed either by being infused by distilled liquors or drug ged horatio greenough our distinguished countryman and eminent sculptor wrote from florence italy though pure juice of the grape can be furnished for one cent a bottle you who have studied the matter   the campiiene lamp    know very well that the retailers choose to gain a fraction of profit by the admission of water or drugs and he remarks how far the destructive influence of wine as here used is to be ascribed to the grape and how far it is augmented and aggravated by poisonous adulterations it would be difficult to say to show the great strength of liquors sold as wine in this country over liquors sold as such on the continent of europe in a letter on the subject j fennimore cooper says five and twenty years since when i first visited europe i was astonished to see wine drank in tumblers i did not at first understand that the half of what i had been drinking was brandy under the name of wine says another dr lewis beck devoted inuch time to the examination of my stock of wine about the time i abandoned its use my port which was as imported         tthe caimphene lamp was found to contail fortytwo per cent of the strength of brandy and my madeira fortyeight per cent tlhe above tests were only made to ascertain the proportion of spirit not to detect drugs the port cost four dollars the gallon the madeira about the same  while travelling says mr delavan in a public conveyance in company with a gentleman whose aid i was anxious to secure for the temperance cause the adul teration of liquors was discussed i stated to him many facts i had gathered in my investigation into the subject and said to him that in order to be sure he was drink ing pure liquor and not a mixture of poison he would require a chemist with his labo ratory constantly in attendance after giving a variety of facts on the subject he replied i cannot credit what you say you have been deceived such things could not exist without exposure so long    the camphene lamp     if true or half true those liquor forgers deserve the state prison ten times more than he who writes another mans name without his knowledge on the back of a note for the purpose of raising money thereon here is mr  sitting beside us he is an extensive importer of wine let us appeal to him is what mr delavan relates true  yes replied our fellow passenger all that he says is true says president nott in his admirable lecture i had a friend who hl himself been a wine dealer and having read the startling statements some time since made public in relation to the brewing of wines and the adulteration of liquors generally i enquired of that friend as to the verity of those statements his reply was  god forgive what has passed in my own cellar but the statements made are true all true i assire you  that friend says dr nott has gone to his account as doubt          ttie cabiphene laip less have many of those whose days ol earth were shortened by poisons he dis pensed but i still remember and shall long remember the terms and tone of that laconic answer the statements made are true all true i assure you one sentence more and i must leave you to peruse the rest of mr delavans valuable little book at your leisure said mr goodwin medical men advanced in life he says have assured me that the effect of using intoxicating liquors now is rauch more fatal to health and life than thirty years since then the liquors were comparatively pure the alcohol in them was usually the only ingredient that the constitution had to contend with and then an habitual drunkard if he lived so long frequently didnt become a known drunk ard under twenty years but now it fre quently occurred that the same amount of habitual drinking roduced disease and   the camphene lamp     intemperance in three years this change these medical gentlemen attribute to the presence of other poisons than the poison of alcohol in the intoxicating liquors used by the people in vast quantities these statements said mrs goodwin are perfectly frightful and appalling why may not this be the prolific source of dyspepsia neuralgia and other distressing and lingering maladies that are thought to be peculiar to this period and which old people tell us were never known in their time and it accounts too for the lon gevity of some old drinkers that i knew in my childhood  miserable creatures to be sure but still crawling on the face of the earth mere wrecks of humanity they had only the alcohol to contend with not the modern poisons call any one be so dead to their own interests as to continue the use of these liquors after such disclo i  sures when they are known to contain          the camtphene lamp the elements of death that the use of them myust shorten hluman life and entail disease on generations yet to come which tend to destroy the dearest interests of man in this world and his eternal interests in the next being left to reflect on this subject still further mrs goodwin said to herself why is it that the principle of selfpres ervation implanted by the deity in every bosom and which operates so powerfully in all other cases why is it so inoperative in this instance why should it be ne cessary to plead with men to preserve their own lives   chapter ii our babes shall richest comforts bring if tutored right they ll prove a spring whence pleasures ever rise we  form their minds with studious care to all that s manly good and fair and train them for the skies w e will not trace the progress by which mr goodwin attained the position which he occupied when our story opened   it was not reached without many struggles and conflicts there are those who have left us pictures of their own mental suffer ing when brought to see the error of their ways which no effort of imagination can equal and no pencil paint unless dipped in  the fountain of bitter experience there were not wanting those who were ready to aid and sustain him in his new path and  to direct him to the true source of strength they were well aware that a resolution i         the camphene lamp founded on mere temporal considerations was not to be depended on it must have a deeper foundation and they anxiously waited for the right moment to lead his mind to religious considerations to one whose moral sensibilities are blunted by the habitual use of strong drink the truths and motives of the christian religion are as idle tales and fall powerless upon the ear but let the scales once fall from his eyes and the mists be dispelled from his mental vision then the rays of divine truth find admission and he becomes an altered man i do not say that all reformed ine briates become real christians but i do say they are more likely to become so than when arrayed in the panoply of resistance that this stupefying vice weaves about them there are different degrees and grada tions of intemperance as well as of every other vice and we wouldnt class them   the camphene lamp     altogether neither would we call any of its unfortunate victims bp hard names they ought to be met with pity and kindness rather than severity and contempt the grosser forms of intemperance we instinctively shrink from with a feeling of disgust and horror the brutalized vic tim who murders his wife and children must be met with the strong arm of the law and though intoxication may be pleaded as an extenuation of his guilt he is likely to expiate his crime on the gallows or in the prison the insidious foe that approaches unseen and makes his ravages in the do mestic circle seizing upon the young as his easiest victim and spreading desola tion in his path must be met with a differ ent weapon this is a case for which there is no provision in the penal code and which legislation hasnt yet reached how many bright eyes grow dim how many soft cheeks turn palehow many         the camphene lamp lovely forms fade away into the tomb and none can tell the cause that blighted their loveliness as the dove will clasp its wing to its side and cover and conceal the arrow that is preying upon its vitals so it is the nature of woman to hide from the world  the unworthiness and unkindness of a hus band she will be seen to be fading grad ually away and you will be told that she is suffering from some chronic nervous dif ficulty or is the victim of consumption that lays its withering touch upon the love ly and the loved but the true cause that is sapping her strength stealing away her bloom and making her  so easy a prey to the spoiler is never revealed people wonder that one so young so healthy so buoyant in spirit and married with such bright prospects should so soon have be come a prey to disease and be hurried to an early grave they are never told that it was the neglect of him she loved that   the camphene lamp     it was his desertion of her society for the haunts of intemperance and dissipation that stole from her cheek the glow and radiance of health and from her heart its gladness and brought her down to darkness and the worm oh that woman in whose hands is placed the moral training of her children would feel that she has a mission to per form in bringing about a change in the usages of society with regard to drinking her influence if rightly directed would be omnipotent let her teach her chil dren to shun the contaminating influence of this vice in every form in which it presents itself just as she would inculcate honesty truthfulness and the kindred virtues let her instruct her daughters when they go out into the world or make their debut into society to refuse those who ask their hand in the dance if they make the re quest with the odor of wine on their lips         the camphene lamp and to repulse the attentions of those who when they leave their company can be traced to the saloons of dissipation or the haunts of vice but alas how many in stead of being discountenanced are encour aged and even tempted to the practice of drinking by those who ought to frown it down many a lovely woman has herself been lured by slow degrees into the snares of a vice which she once looked upon with horror and disgust by partaking in scenes of festivity and mirth of articles in which the exciting poison was disguised or in openly pledging the winecup could such an one have been shown in the days of her innocence and hopefulness  when life seemed to her a fairyland and all was bright before her a picture of what she might be come by these indulgences she would have started back with horror and ex   the camphene lamp      claimed let me die rather than real ize this but to return to the goodwins the evening of the day on which our story opens was made joyous by the return of the eldest son robert on his first college vacation it was a great event to the chil dren and looked forward to with high anticipations every little scheme of pleas ure was put off till robert should come to enjoy it with them the day at last arrived though it seemed to the impa tient children a long time in coming he received a cordial greeting from every mem ber of the family who eyed him from head to foot expecting that a three months resi dence in college must have wrought some change in his personal appearance the children were emulous to please him and each had something curious to show or amusing to tell a happier group than this family presented could scarcely be         the camphene lamp found any where evening came and they had all assembled in the parlor to receive their father how bright you all look said robert  with your gas and your new carpet either it is a very becoming light or mother has grown handsome didnt you always think mother handsome said emma rather resentfully oh yes in deed emma she always looked handsome to me but i didnt like to see her so pale and thin as she used to be now she has the rose as well as the lily on her cheek and father too how well he is looking he isnt so fat as he used to be but his whis kers are quite becoming dont you think so yes said emma and every body says he looks ten years younger we shall have a nice time this evening said jennie father will be at home and we have such pleasant times with him he is at home every evening now except when hegoes to a lecture or concert with mother   the camphene lamp     he hears our lessons too after tea which you know he never used to do said em ma i believe he has taken private lessons in arithmetic for the purpose for he always used to say when i went to him with a difficult sum  dont trouble me child go to your mother she knows more than i do about it now he can go a great deal farther than mother and is as pleasant as can be then he used to be so cross after dinner  dont you tell him i said so now he takes us a drive into the coun try and says it really makes him young again to go out among the hills and we have such fine times this was a simple childs view of the subject unconscious of the real cause of the change the truth was mr g had discovered how interesting his children were and how much enjoyment he might find in their society and a wellspring of happiness was opened in his heart that had         tiie camphene lamp been sealed for years  come said emma after they had all arranged them selves for the evening  do tell us robert something about college life i admire to hear about the tricks they play there i hope robert didnt go to college to play tricks emma said her mother i should like to hear about his studies and other experience i am not far enough ad vanced emma to be entitled to play tricks i shall think myself fortunate if i am not made the subject of them thus far however i have escaped practical jokes as for my studies mother i get on with them as well as i could expect though i have to study pretty hard there are some firstrate fellows in my class and some rather wild c choose good associ ates my son that is allimportant said his father who heard this last remark and avoid expensive habits i want you there sometimes mother said robert   the camphene lamp    to preach temperance to some of the boys i lecture them occasionally but its of no use i only get laughed at and ridi culed you may as well preach to the storm and reason with despair as try to make any impression upon them  i hope my dear boy you have been faithful to your mothers motto  touch not taste not handle not there is no safety but in that course and perhaps your example may in time win them  over yes mother i stick to that and there are several in my class who never touch any thing intoxicating i would trust them any where but it is otherwise with some there is a young boy from the south a fine generous little fellow that i couldnt help speaking to bout it because he was so far from his friends and i thought they would feel so sadly if they knew how he was going on he said that his father thinks if boys are brought up to see wine         the caimiphene lamp every day and drink a little now and then they are more likely to grow up temperate than those who never see it on the table at all strange said his mother that a father should preach such a doctrine as this nothing could be more delusive and ruinous this i could easily exemplify by numerous cases that have come under my own observation i could give    this lad the history of at least a dozen fine promising young boys blest with all the advantages of fortune family connec tions and talents of the first order who were victims of intemperance and took their first glass at their own fathers table one of them dragged out a miserable existence in a half idiotic state another became a lunatic and died in the insane hospital another after passing through every grada tion of this debasing vice became a vaga bond wine was then an article of hospi tality and i trust these parents sinned   the camptene lamp     ignorantly though they reaped the bitter fruits i could swell my list still further and authenticate it with circumstances more heartrending than i like to detail to your inexperienced ears though i doubt not the friends of these poor unfortunates would be willing they should be held up as beacons if their examples could warn those who are just launching on the voyage of life to avoid the shoals and quicksands on which they were wrecked  i have always regarded college life she con tinued as an ordeal and i should tremble to trust a son there if i did not think he was fortified with strong temperance prin ciples and i really believe if the total abstinence law was enforced there we shouldnt hear of so many riots rebellions and acts of insubordination as we now do there might be a little mischief the effer vescence of youthful spirits but nothing         the camphene lamp serious nothing that would call for the interference of civil power in reminiscences of college life how often do we hear when an old classmate is inquired after this reply oh poor fellow havent you heard of his fate he started in life with the brightest pros pects good patronage brilliant talents every prospect of success in his profession but he got into gay society for which you know he always had a taste became intemperate and after a while incapable of transacting business and though sustain ed for a long time by friends gradually sunk into the deepest degradation and died miserably poor fellow he was no bodys enemy but his own for every one admired and loved him before he became so degraded his widow now supports herself and children by needlework with what assistance she gets from his old class   the camphene lamp    mates is there a class exempt from such instances  the conversation was here interrupted by the entrance of a servant to say that katy olaughn the gardeners wife would like to speak to mrs goodwin mrs goodwin was quick to obey the sum mons for she always had a ready ear and a word of counsel for her irish friends well katy how is it with you these days oh firstrate mrs goodwin first rate i have got into a new house and i may say a new world my leddy and what has brought about this great change in your circumstances katy oh its all owing to barneys taking the plidge which he did the very day my leddy that he helped mr goodwin clear out the cellar and took the bottles to the poteca ries mr goodwin said something to him while they were in the cellar together that had a great effect upon barney my leddy         the camphene lamp may be you never knew barneys infarmity and i would be the last to mintion it but for the great change that has come over him my leddy you do indeed sur prise me katy i knew youl were always behindhand though barney had good wages but i supposed he didnt have as good work in winter as summer i never had a suspicion that drinking was the cause i hope katy he never treated you ill or the children thats neither here nor there my leddy i never laid up any thing against him for i always said when he gave me any ill tratementit is nt barney but the liquor that s in him for when he was himself there niver was a kinder cratur than barney olaughn how long has he been in this way katy  a great while by spells as i may say i may as well tell you the whole story my leddy said she loweting her voice you know when gintlemen   the camphene lamp    in the neighborhood that didnt keep a man servant were going to have a card party or a supper or the like of that they would come to barney in a coaxing like way for they knew it wasnt his rigular business to wait and tendupon a table for barney was brought up to gardening bar ney says they you must put on your white apron and come to my house this evening says they and wait upon the company and be a butler like as they call them in the old country it was then he got a taste of the wine my leddy and he would come home quite merry like and that of course i didnt object to but the next day he would go loafing round with his pay in his pocket among them that were ready enough to get it away from him and at night he would drink the bad liquor and come home so wild and furious that i would be obliged to take my little children          the camphene lamp into the woodshed till the liquor was out of him for fear of our lives working in the garden the next day would bring him to himself again so he came home one day in such a good mood that i ventured to say to him  and i was all of a trimble while i said it  barney says i what becomes of all the money you earn where does it go to im ashamed of my life that i cannot pay the bakers bill what becomes of the money to be sure katy olaughn  says he why it goesao buy clothes and victuals and drink for you and the children it is few clothes you buy with your money barney says i or vic tuals either it is the liquor that takes the bread from our childrens mouths and why need we buy drink when we have a good well of water right at our door with that he turned upon me and said  shut up your head katy olaughn and dont be accusing me when the great gintlemen   the camphene lamp     up yonder leave off taking the good cratur barney olaughn will too and havnt the gintlemen a right to drink their delicate wines barney says i when they can afford to do it and it doesnt harm them either but it is the ruin of such as you body and soul to take the strong bad liquor that is no better than pisen says i and havnt i barney olaughn a right to drink too in a free country as well as they says he in a bold way like  ive seen how they manage says he  if they took any thing very strong to begin with they wouldnt be able to see the spots on the bit cards they hold in their hands first pop goes the corks from the bottles with the long necks against the ceiling like a bit musket this pale sparkling wine they call champaigne this makes them bright and merry likethen come the short necks  this wine is quiet in its way but it works in the brain i tell you katy         the camphene lamp says he them that drinks much of it wouldnt get home safe if it wasnt for the help they get from one another and from the like of me sometimes what do you say to that katy olaughn says he its no use talking about other people barney says i thats nothing to you but i tell you this if you go on so me and my children will come to the poor house says i or some worse place well go now says he if you like it better than living here in a dacent man ner and off he went it was that very blessed day my leddy that he had a talk with mr goodwin gods blessing be upon him and took the plidge and a drop of liquor has never passed his lips since mrs goodwins sympathy with katy was heartfelt for she could comprehend her feelings do you know katy said she that the wise men of the nation are try   the camphene lamp     ing to pass a law to prevent the sale of all intoxicating drinks that will be a good thing my leddy but i had rather barney would leave off because he wont drink than because he cant that certainly is best katy but there are some unfort te ones who can not resist when tey see the liquor to whom the law would be a great benefit oh indeed my leddy there are multi tudes of misfortunate craturs who would do well intirely and support their families if they couldnt get the bad liquor so easy if it wasnt for the little shops about where they can sit and drink and smoke and no one know any thing about it  oh i should like to see the keepers of those hor rid places put where they deserve to be or in some worse place some of them are kept by women miserable craturs that they are and manys the poor boy that goes into their dens that comes out worse         the camphene lamp than the beasts that perish and gets mur dered on his way home for the money he has in his pocket there was patrick min nigin my first cousin on my mothers side came out from ireland as nice a boy as you ever saw my leddy and a good cratur to work he came over with the temperance medal round his neck put on by father mathew himself  he was young and foolish like and he saw how little atten tion was paid to the plidge here so my leddy he did just like the rest and in a short time the bad liquor he took killed him the doctors said it was a stroke of the sun but i knew all the time it was another kind of stroke that was the death of the poor young cratur and here she wiped her eyes with the corner of her apron and look ing up at the clock and seeing that the evening was far advanced exclaimed i am crazy to be staying so laving my little children and the bit baby sick too what   the camphene lamp    is the matter with the baby asked mrs goodwin oh my leddy he has a great oppression about his heart stuffed like he could hardly breathe last night you must take home a dose of squills for him i have some is can give you thank you my leddy but i have wrapped him all up in goose grase and given him some onion tea and i think he will do well i forgot intirely the arand i came on i wanted to ask you my leddy if you would like to take my eggs i can let you have two dozen a week barney has bought me six shankhighs i think they call them and built a coop for them with his own hands fine birds are they and go step ping round so proud like as if they were peacocks mrs goodwin said she should like the eggs you shall have them fresh every morning for the masters breakfast i will send them over by little bridget  where do you live now katy asked         the camphene lamp mrs goodwin why forenent the big yankee meetinghouse with a big bell in the steeple thats on chestnut street you pass through the alley way then you cross over dover court and you will see a wee bit house with a green door and yard before it and the hencoop and thats my house katy now drew the head of her cloth cloak over her cap and saying as she left the room long life to you and your family and may you never want light in your dwelling took her departure leaving mrs goodwin to muse over her conversa tion her mind naturally reverted to the time when barney was exposed to tempta tion in her house and the question rose does any responsibility rest on those per sons who subject their servants and other transient tenders to such trials of their moral strength persons who conscien tiously banish camphene and other danger ous agents from their houses because fill   the campiiene lamp    ing the lamps may endanger the life of a careless servant allow him to fill the de canters with ten times the danger to his moral wellbeing the evil doesnt stop here your servants the company you keep and the practices you allow are edu cating your children insensibly perhaps but not the less certainly what higher sanction does a child need than  ly father does iti heard the other day of a young boy who when reproved by his teacher for profaneness justified himself by saying my father swears let fathers be persuaded as they value the true inter ests of their children not to speak lightly of temperance men or temperance measures in their presence ridicule is a powerful weapon and children who are accustomed to hear really good men called fools and fa natics and their measures denounced as unjustifiable and encroaching on private rights will grow up to be opposers of eve         the camphene lamp ry thing that is good and sacred every one admires temperance in the abstract why not make it practical and enjoy its benefits they are real substantial do you feel less respect for the merchant who instead of sitting over his wine inhaling the vapor of his cigar gives his wife and children a drive into the country to enjoy the fragrance of nature and the pure and exhilarating influences to be found there do you feel less confidence in your physician because he is a total abstinence man than you would if he came to your bedside with a breath made offensive by the fumes of wine would you trust a cause in which prop erty and perhaps life are involved to a lawyer who went from the bar of the hotel to the legal bar do you feel less reverence for your min ister because he frowns upon the winecup than if he should raise it to his lips praise its   the camphene lamp     flavor and drink it freely in the presence of your children would you elevate to a public office the man who countenances the traffic in ardent spirits rather than one who in putting down the haunts of vice stopping the sale of the article in drinking saloons places of re freshment and subterranean resorts lessens the amount of taxes and human misery by stopping the manufacture of paupers would you patronize a grocer who carries on the adulteration and sale of ardent spirits sooner than one who never admits one drop into his premises would you engage the services of a servant though ever so skillful in the culi nary department who takes as it is fami liarly termed a drop too much though only occasionally in preference to one who is habitually temperate and never suffers a drop of intoxicating drink to pass his lips in short is there a man in any profession         the camphene lamp or employment from the shoemaker to the statesman that isnt ennobled and made respectable and successful in life by the practice of temperance let your heart give an honest answer to these questions temperance is not a solitary virtue the moral virtues cluster around it and form a diadem hear the enumeration as found in the first chapter of st peter fifth verse add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godli ness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be found in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren nor un fruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things is blind the following lines by miss caroline briggs well describe the state of one who   the camphene lamp        has waked to a consciousness of his true being i have wakened to my duty  to a knowledge strong and deep that i recked not of aforetime in my long inglorious sleep for to live is something useful and i knew it not before and i dreamed not

glorious to be conscious of a growing power within stronger than the rallying forces of a charged and marshalled sin          the camphene lamp never in these old romances felt i half the sense of life that i feel within me stirring standing in this place of strife oh those olden days of dalliance when i wantoned with my fate when i trifled with a knowledge that had wellnigh come too late yet

by george laughlin author op the outlaw of mssissippi eto boston printied for mrs laugttttn ty john wilson and son  ashmore or the reclaimed husband part i  asnmore was about five and twenty his wife but eighteen years old they had been married some sixteen months and were blessed with one boy the darling of his father the idol of his mother the husband and wife lived happily together for their means were ample their tastes cultivated and their habits correct not an angry word had passed between them since the hour they were joined for life at the altar ashmore called his wife a model spouse and she rewarded him with an attachment that bordered on adoration she knew hisstep in the hall and always welcomed him with smiles ashmores friends would rally him occasionally  for his domestic habits his regular mode of life and  his strict temperance principles one of thq in particular named obre who was very fond afood oteod f  v                      ashmore living used to ridicule him without mercy at every opportunity lucy disliked this obre she dreaded the effect of his keen polished satire on the rather  sensitive mind of her husband and she feared he might some day be the means of goading ashmore into the vortex of that  gay world of fashion for which she felt an utter aversion the husband and wife were sitting together one winter night ashmore was reading aloud to lucy while she fondled her boy with all a mothers endear ments the doorbell rang and presently a tall graceful young man entered the room with the air  of an old friend missis ashmore i have the honor to salute you  said he bowing with easy elegance as he addressed the lady your husband should be the happiest of men and he smiled a winning smile d and so he is obre said horace in a tone of earnest animation i the very happiest of men my  delighted to hear it indeed was the quiet re joinder ut dye know ashmore i would not like to be such a very close housekeeper and he smiled again ashmore moved uneasily in his chair you know oir dispositions are very different s bd he without doubt retorted obre they are in deed i am fond of variety while you can only   exist in an atmosphere of perpetual bliss he glanced at lucy as these words escaped him but         i  t    or the reclaiamred husband     she looked grave and did not seem to notice the compliment conveyed in his last remark jny news asked horace anxious to change the subject yes stirring news ive just come for you to accompany me to the clubrooms and decide a heavy bet in my favor how can i decide it easily enough i staked a pretty decent little sum with wilson that you would drink a couple of glasses of champagne with us tonight at morri sons indeed said horace evidently mortified at the information o ciary dear fellow dont be alarmed why one would suppose i had pledged you to drink prussic acid instead of a glass of champagne you kpow my husbands aversion to wine and toall intoxicating drinks said lucy with studied politeness obres smile was fascination itself his manners were so easy and selfassured and his tone so light yet respectful that it was next to impossible to be angry with him and sit in his presence  intoxicating drinks exclaimed he with affected horror  why i loathe all such myself but cham pagne is merely an agreeable beverage twill not hurt a child any kind of wine is hurtful persisted mrs ashmore         x          ashmeore  doubtless it is but two glasses ca ot injure any one returned obre what is the amount o yur bet inquired ashmore only five thousand was the careless reply mrs ashmore became uneasy and her husband looked vexed how in the name of common sense could you be so thoughtless obre said ashmore thoughtless rejoined the incorrigible man of fashion  tis an easy way to win five thousand and the bland smile played more blandly round his mouth if your bet depends on my drinking that wine youll lose to a certainty said ashmore a sweet look from his wife assured horace how much she was gratified by his wrds but obre   heeded not this byplay  you wont win for me then said he   sorry you should lose your money but in this instance i cannot help it what and youll suffer me to lose this sum for the paltry matter of drinking two glasses of cham pagne nobodywill believe it then let e   erpody doubt it and they will have their doubts for their pains you are resolute then i am indeed said horace for the first time since he enteredthe room obre looked grave    or the reclatmtd husband      but ashmore said he i need this money very much to pay a certain amount i owe to young chesney  better let chesney wait but he threatens pains andpenalties let him threaten put to be frank with you i cannot pay this five thousand if i am to lose it ashmore looked irresolute his wife approached him and winding her arms round his waist said dear horace do not go but obre will be dishonored lucy think of that  oh pay the money horace pay the money and do not touch the wine the wife said this imploringly tis a debt of honor maam said obre in a tone of wounded pride  a debt of honor which i alone must pay and he rose to depart o mr obre withdraw your bet urged mrs alhmore impossible returned obre as he moved to wards the door ashmore paced the floor with rapid steps dont go for a moment obre said he stopping abruptly before him  you must suffer me to pay this mo ney for you at present not a stiver sir said obre haughtily no no if you will not drink two glasses of harmless wine to save a friend five thousand dollars then sir          ash more all i can say is that your friendship is not very sincere saying which he hastily withdrew the husband and wife regarded each other for a few minutes without speaking at length mrs ashmore ventured timidly to observe what do you mean to do husbatnd why to say the truth lucy i begin to think that obre is partly right in what h last said it does seem a little absurd that my friend should lose five thousand dollars for the matter of my drinking two glasses of wine true i would rather pay the money but qbre would shrink from me as he did but now at the mere attempt to do so besides dear five thousand dollars seem a considerable sum to throw away for nothing and we owe a duty to our child to be careful of our means ah horace the best way to fulfil such duty is for the father to preserve his virtue the husband started to his feet while a flush of indignation suffused his manly features i trust mrs ashmore said he somewhat bit terly  that my principles are not so very loose as to be uprooted by indulging in a glass of wine you should have known me better by this time but i now distinctly declare to you that i am resolved to see the issue of this affair for a twofold purpose first to save my friends money and next to regain your good opinion which it would seem i have somehow forfeited he spoke thus with irritation and impetuosity   or the reclaimed husband      and seizing his hat dashed out of the apartment leaving his wife bewildered for a time with surprise and grief part ii the sporting club  held its meetings in a mag nificent saloon furnished in splendid style and illuminated by myriads of lights that blazed from two large chandeliers newspapers sporting maga zines and periodicals of various kinds were strewed promiscuously on numerous tables the walls were decorated with paintings and engravings of dogs horses deer c while here and there at inter vals were placed trophies of the chase from different parts of the country obre was a favotite w all the members of the club for he was generous f his money fearless to bet and prompt to pay he could also tell a good story sing an excellent song and was a prime judge of horseflesh his powers of ridicule too were generally dreaded they were known to be great and men conciliated what they could not combat with any chance of success and so it happened that when obre entered the clubroom shortly after his inter view with ashmore on the night we speak of he was greeted with general cordiality it chanced to be a full meeting and the saloon was crowded with members some were talking some laughing some         ashmore smoking and all enjoying themselves with uncom mon relish they were mostly yqung men of leisure possessed of the means to make time pass merrily and fond of pleasure for the excitement it brought any bet out of the ordinary course was sure to excite general interest so when obre returned from ashmores hi was hailed with accla mation and they crowded round him to learn the success of his mission will he toe the mark demanded one ay will he come to the scratch said an other did you unkennel the animal asked a third whats the chance for my bet inquired a fourth have you sprung your game shouted a fifth and so they went on overwhelming him with questions of a like nature to all of which obre made no reply but coolly lighting a cigar seated himself without ceremony and smoked with apparent com posure the buzz of many voices still continued but shortly there was a general pause then an exclamation of surprise from some one then a hur ried whispering and the eyes of all the members were directed to the door obre sprang to his feet and looking in the same direction beheld to his great surprise no less a person than his friend horace ashmore slowly advancing to the centre of the saloon   or the recla tmedn husband     is it possible said obre to himself why this exceeds belief then aloud to horace this way ashmore this way my friend bravo hurrah i knew you wouldnt let me lose bravo echoed the crowd of members as the two friends shook hands and exchanged a few words in an undertone obre raised his hand to enjoin silence and when the noise ceased ashmore spoke ive come gentlemen said he to relieve my friend from an unpleasant position but not with any intention of joining your club as most of you would seem to imagine this announcement created some sensation and there were shouts of go it ashmore  be one of us join us old fellow no sneaking c c then one of the members said lets have no preaching then another member shouted sup pr waits and presently there was a general rush a long table laid out witha delicious supper wines c ashmore and ober were borne along by the rush till they found themselves at the table come take a seat horace said obre good humoredly  heres a rare supper my boy ashmore hesitated but at length felt ashamed of his scruples and seated himself at table with the rest then supper was discussed right cheerily the laugh and jest went round humorous anec dotes funny stories smart sayings ludicrous jests were the order of the night ao t   ashmore a glass of wine with you ashmore said the e president from the head of the table and instantly all eyes were bent on the guest he filled his glass with a fikm hand nodded to the president and drank it off at once the ice was fairly broken and although ashmore did not that night exceed the two glasses he was pledged to drink yet the ice was broken   t pthe secod  art irl the second anniversary of the night on which her jhusband decided that bet for obre closed upon lucy ashmore and found her wretched she held her boy convulsively to her breast and rocked him to and fro with a low sad song that came from a breast sur charged with bitter feelings two years of suffering had seamed her fair brow paled her cheek and dimmed the lustre of her large blue eye her whole appearance denoted suffering  patient voiceless suffering suffering calmly expected meekly endured piously braved the poverty that now surrounded her in her bleak abode was stern proof of the volume of suffering through which the once affluent wife must have waded to her present wretched state one by one each cherished article of furniture or of brna ment had been quietly surrendered to find fuel to feed the remorseless flame that consumed her infa   or the reclatmed husband      tuated husband the gnawing thirst for wine that possessed him like a demon lands houses fur niture ornaments dress  every thing in short that could be turned to money  had been sacrificed to this hideous demon of thirst and still it craved more wines property domestic comfort selfrespect health happiness had all been sacrificed at the altar of this accursed fiend and yet it was not satisfied more wine more wine more wine yes the man possessed by this demon must have more wine though wife and child should perish wife and child what were these to him compared with wine alas there was a time and that but twos brief years ago when they were much all every thing when they were his sum of life the world in which he lived moved breathed and had his being wife  she was the planet round which he had revolved continually child  it was the mag  net that had attracted him to the mother with love irresistible yet this planet this magnet were now obscured by a demon in purple commonly known by the name of wine oh how lucy execrated the fiend as she sang sad songs to her child and counted the weary hours of the bitter winter night awaiting her husbands return she thought of the hundreds and the thousands of widows and of orphans intemperance had made of the oceans of tears it had caused to flow of the millions of sighs it had wrung from many an aching breast of the murders it had prompted of the deadly quarrels it had e         ashmore engendered of the propertyit had destroyed of the hopes it had crushed of the joys it had blasted of the mountain of human hearts it must have broken in its mad career she thought of all this and shuddered when she reflected that her hus band was in the gripe of this demon twelve oclock hadestruck and ashmore was still absent one oclock came yet he came not her child slept soundly and as she drew her torn shawl more closely round it a scalding tear fell on the little face poor thing murmured the mother now nearly exhausted with hunger cold and want of rest she leaned her tead against the damp wall behind her chair and graually sleep overpowered her yes she slept and soon she smiled in her forlorn sleep ay the wretched mother smiled for he who tempers the wind to the shorn lamb beheld the suffering of his desolate child and delighted the lulled senses with an enchanting dream the mother wasiteaming of her youthful days when she gathered flowers with her playmates  all artless happy girls in the springtime of life then she thought she had grown to be a woman and was walking along a rough uneven thorny road where here were many quagmires and pitfalls then she thought a frightful monster sprang from one of these pitfalls and pursued her with great speed for some distance at length after toiling up a steep rocky thorny hill she turned and beheld the monster in the agonies of death inflicted by a   or the reclaimed husband      slender youth who held in his hand a bloody spear the youth soon stood by her side on the summit of the hill and pointing with his spear to the country before them said behold your route go on in safety and suddenly disappeared she sdwly pursued her way and the road she now travelled was beautiful exceedingly rare flowers of every hue adorned the edges of the path and filled the air with delicious odors plants shrubs and trees of exquisite foliage were grouped here and there through the glittering green fields and swarms of birds with golden plumage poured forth floods of melody such as her ears had never heard before she beheld people moving through those fields all happy and joyous and radiant with delight they looked at her as she passed and smiled sweet smiles of welcome but further than this they heeded her not she went on and on and on over ths path that led through these fields and as she advanced the country seemed to increase in beauty her steps seemed lighter and a sense of ineffable happiness seemed to possess her she beheld afar a gorgeous temple surrounded by a great multitude of people add to that temple she perceived the path led her approach to the temple was slow for it was still a great way off but at length she drew near enough to distinguish over the portals in enormous letters of gold the word truth she was getting yet nearer to the temple when her dream was rudely broken by a fierce noise at the door  ashmore of her humble abode startingvildly from her chair she gazed round her for a moment with the delight ful imagery of the dream still fresh on her mind and seizing a lamp from a rude chair she hastily opened the street door a bloated fieryeyed man with dishevelled hair rushed past her swearing a dreadful oath and ordered her to follow him quickly she did so and there in the chair from which she had taken the lamp was horace ashmore wine had made sad havoc with his fine manly form he was but the wreck of his former self and now as he sat before his wife staring wildly at her and heaping frightful curses on her head there seemed a glaring unnatural excitement in his look that foreshadowed madness and he was mad indeed wine  he hiccoughed i have not a drop said the meekewife  liar liar roared the drunkard striking fiercely at her he had sworn to protect to love and to cherish wine i say thundered the baffled toper aiming another blow at the helpless wife she avoided it and tried to soothe him but her efforts

avoided the missile and again approached her husband fofr the purpose of soothing him but was arrested by his looks he glared wildly at herfor a moment   like a tiger about to spring on its prey then throw ing up his arms wildly in the air he fell senseless at her feet part iv many weeks passed and ashmore lay on a sick bed he was slowly recovering from a dreadful fever that had nearly carried him off lucy murmured the invalid turning feebly on his pillow  come hither give me something to wet my lips the fond wife speedily administered some sooth ing liquid and the lick man regarded her with looks of powerful gratitude lucy said he if i am destined to rise in health from this fevered couch you will find me an altered man and you shall yet be the happiest of women the wifes eyes glittered

with some pain is fraught our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought in a splendid apartment of a splendid mansion the abode of a merchantprince three persons were seated one night in autumn they were mother son and daughter the mother an engaging ma tronly lady was occupied with some fancy needle work the daughter a rare flower of exquisite beauty was intently examining some choice engrav ings the son a fine manly intelligent young man was cutting the leaves of a magazine fresh from the hands of the publisher this is a touching group mamma said emily so faithfully grouped round the deathbed of wash ington i was only a girl then returned the mother  a very little girl but i can well remember the universal feeling of sadness that pervaded the entire    the students last ofyifering community  truly that was a deathbed the new world then lost the spirit of its great deliverer which soared upward to a better hero sage and statesman the great hand of time may trace many cycles oer the dial ere america shall behold another washington i dont wonder you revere his character so much mamma it was so good yes it was unselfishness itself his glorious maxim was all for my country nothing for my self                hisprinciples were godlike mamma rejoined emily turning over the engraving to examine an other lofty and noble they were  but here is such a cupid  such a dear bewitching little fel low  what a roguish pair of eyes what a mouth do mamma just look at this mischievous young imp and kte animated girl glided to the matrons side engraving in hand to share her delight with her fond parent ha ha ha laughed the son who had opened his magazine meanwhile and perused nearly a page of a humorous article that tickled his fancy im mensely  ha ha ha theres a witty fellow  a right merry fellow indeed ha ha ha the mother and daughter looked up while the son read a few more sentences and throwing him self back in his chair burst out afresh into irrepres sible laughter you must have found something very interest    the students last offering    ing charles said the mother regarding her son with a quiet smile im sure its very witty observed the young lady stealing softly to her brothers chair and glan cinfg over his shoulder let me see it charles and quickly scanning the first paragraph she also indulged in a merry laugh its excellent very excellent said emily taking up the magazine its the richest story ive read in an age added charles what a fund of wit that writer must have  a perfect fund of wit and he laughed again you seem in very good humor here said a stout gentleman of middle age quietly closing the door behind him and taking a seat near the table at which his son and daughter were occupied with the magazine o papa theres such a laughable story in this magazine exclaimed emily charles is so amused with it let me see the title said papa in whose fea tures benevolence and a profound knowledge of human nature were admirably blended he looked at the name of the article read a few sentences and the habitual smile that lighted up his agreeable fea tures gave place to an air of sober gravity the son and daughter were surprised at this for their papa could relish genuine wit with unalloyed plea sure papa read a few sentences more and his air became yet more grave he closed the magazine    the students last offeringo and handing it to his son earnestly remarked in the tone of a man familiar with every word the article contained read it to the end my son and when iyou get through i will relate to you its his tory for it has a history and that too at singular variance with its tone and spirit so mirthful and so spiritstirring as you think them it has a history papa eagerly inquired the young lady with all a young ladys pardonable curiosity in her speaking eyes  it has a history then chimed in charles who inherited enough of eves blood to develop in him an inquisitive propensity o it has a history affirmed papa taking from his pocket some letters and breaking the seals  a his tory that i will relate to you when you have read the article and not before and not before queried emily not before repeated papa unfolding his letters and beginning to peruse one the sister seated herself beside the brother and together they perused the article with deep atten tion pausing now and then to indulge in uncontrol lable mirth and a few brief comments on the spar kling wit of the author at length they reached the conclusion just as papa had concluded reading his last letter and turning to him they cheerfully reminded him of his promise what think you of the writer said papa ad  dressing both his children   the students last offering     inimitable rejoined emily a man of talent in whom the humorous evi dently predominates added charles you think so then listen and when you have heard me through let this simple history lead you to beware of judging from appearances for most assuredly all is not gold that glitters papa put away his letters and then related to his children the following short history of a story   edward staunton returned from college at the age of nineteen a delicate thoughtful youth grave for his years and highly educated he was the only son of his mother and she was a widow he had a sister  an only sister  a bright fairhaired creature of remarkable intelligence his father had been dead for many years and the slender income he had left was exhausted in educating ed ward for the mother doated on her boy and she would stint herself and her daughter of all but the barest necessaries of life to have him qualified for an honorable profession he was the apple of her eye the pride of her widowed heart she loved to falk of him to his sister when he was absent at college and to console herself with the reflection that his talents would yet procure honor and fame to himself and a comfortable home for them all she suffered and pinched and stinted herself beyond credibility to supply him with the means of com b pleting his studies how much she pinched and    the students last offering stinted herself i care not to tell and when he returned to his humble home in the suburbs of a great city he found that home cold and cheerless and bare of every thing that can make a home com fortableof nearly all but his mothers and his sisters affectionate embraces how he chewed the bitter cud of thought as his sharp eye scanned the attenuated forms and worn garments of his mother and his sister the damp unfinished walls of their two narrow rooms so scant of furniture and so chill for lack of fuel the struggle to preserve appearances and the war with the giant grasp of want so apparent in all that he beheld and want was there indeed there he was in that highsouled students home slowly in twining his hideous arms around those forms so dearly beloved for they had not a morsel of bread to offer the son and brother those meekeyed gentle sufferers needlework was their only means of support had been their sole means of support for weary days and weeks and months needlework so tedious to do and so poor to pay needlework that dims the sight chills the blood wastes the form pales the cheek seams the brow sears the brain hacks the chest needlework that makes flesh and blood so cheap they could barely gain bread by unremitting toil that consumed half the dreary hours of night but they bore up patiently and murmured not for their faith in providence yss firm as adamant and they looked forward with   the studentss last offering     trusting heart to the return of the absent one hoping wishing believing that he would soon find means to lift them from blighting penury hope the sustainer had buoyed them through many a weary night and day had nerved them to conceal the real state of affairs from edward had raised their drooping spirits and helped them to bear with calm resignation  the oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes thus far had hope buoyed nerved and helped them to endure till the absent ones return and now that he had returned the gaunt visage of want frowned on him from his mothers hearth stone twas a bleak prospect for one so young and gifted but it must be facedmanfully and daringly faced resisted attacked and overcome want is a fierce foe to grapple witha mighty terrible scathing foe whose breath is baneful whose touch is withering whose presence is allcorroding a mortal enemy to soul and body muttered ed ward glancing round the dreary walls that i must banish from this abode the youth had some loose change left of his scanty store and this served to supply them with bread for tilat night and a few more days meantime he took possession of the cold sleepingapartment that adjoined his mothers room of all work and there he sat hour by hour    th tudents last o oktlug and day by day forming plans for the future and studying how he should most effectively work to aid his mother and sister he little knew how that mother and sister had noted his worn cheek that flushed at intervals his sunken eye and wasted form and how painfully to their ears cam sound of the hollow ominous relentless couglhthat heralds consumption he thought not of himself he only thought of them and of any feasible means by which he could support them at length he thought of the press and accordingly he began an elaborate article for a magazine summoning to his aid all his scholastic attainments he spent three days and nights in polishing and perfecting for pub lication his production he worked eagerly ear nestly and hopefully he had a vague idea that the article must bring him a good price for he poured without stint the rich treasures of his cul tivated mind into its pages and in all the confi dence of unhackneyed youth he expected an ade quate return with a light ieart he crossed his mothers threshold to carry his first offering to the press with a heavy heart and drooping spirits he repassed that threshold an hour after his de parture and moodily flinging his hat on a table shut himself up in his room alone his sister en tered and sought to rouse him but the only answer she could get to her kind soothing questions was conveyed in the simple word rejected she left him and returned to condole with her mother   w   the students last offering     too learned for our columns and too long muttered the student in bitterness of spirit and sweeping the bare walls of his room with glaring eyes he recollected that those dependent on him for support had not another days sustenance nor the means wherewith to buy the visage of want scowled on him from the wall and urged him goaded him maddened him into action he seized a pen and fiercely ejaculating i will try again braced himself afresh for his task days and nights wore away six of them had vanished adown the dark vista of time and the second article was not yet finished i was in too much of a hurry with the first said edward to himself musingly perhaps that was the secret of its failure ill be more careful with this and he conned and weighed every word and every sen tence with the anxiety of a diplomatist but while he conned and weighed he did not notice what mother and sister did that his worn cheek grew more worn his sunken eye more sunken and his hollow cough more ominous they had noticed this with bitter sorrow and sought by entreaty to dissuade him from writing but he calmly heard their remonstrances and eating abstractedly of the slender fare they placed before him won by the weary needle he only answered mother we must emerge from the gripe of want we must indeed how rapidly he was gliding from the fangs of all want that is earthly he poor fellow never dreamed    the students last olfflring singular fatality of consumption that soothes its victims ever and always with hope and healthful years in the dim perspective at length the second offering is ready for the press he wends his weary way to the autocrat of types and submitting his production is desired to leave it and call in two days homeward he takes his weary way again and the two ensuing days are passed in a state of nervous irritation of alternate fear and hope doubt and delight hard to endure harder to portray the third morning dawns lightens deepens bright clear and blue how anxiously he marked it dawn lighten and deepen eight oclock struck but that was too soon for his purpose he would wait till nine the hour wore away nine chimed lively and loud from a neigh boring churchtower and taking his hat he bent his steps feebly enough to the printingoffice he entered the room of the owner and found him alone he was recognized his article drawn from a small pile of others and quietly returned to him the heart in his breast thumped against its bars for a few seconds as if it would burst and presently felt to him heavy as lead a cold dew broke out on his forehead and grasping a chair he would have fallen but for the ownera humane man deeply absorbed in his trade who supported him to a seat and begged him to rest for a few minutes  your production has merit sir said the owner soothingly undoubted merit but it lacks spirit i              the student s iast offering    tis hardly lively enough for our pages a little more vivacity a few dashes of humor and i would readily have purchased it be of good cheer try your hand again practice is indispensable to make a taking writer for the press that was it exclaimed edward eagerly start ing up you want a humorous article sir will you purchase such an article if i write one that will please you i most willingly and give you its utmost value said the humane publisher glancing at the worn garments and sharp features of the youthful candi date with an eye of deep interest  bring it soon and it shall appear in our next issue hgadded in a tone of touching kindness  blessed hope mysterious sustainer gift most infinite bravely didst thou bear up the mind of the feeble youth that night inhis cold lonely room and fill his brain with all manner of quaint fancies and mirthful conceits wondrous hope that canst heal the seared thoughts as by magic and in their stead fill the vexed mind with teeming oddities and laughtermoving spells drawing from sorrow from misery from suffering deep and unutterable their most potent antidotes  mirth and fantastic humor edward would think and write by turns patiently and in those intervals his eyes wandered round the bare walls of his chilly room from whence the gaunt visage of want had scowled at him before it did not scowl now it grinned and winked and mimicked    the studets last offering and flitted about he thought taking all manner of strange uncouth shapes and encouraging him by its grimaces to proceed with his work of wit he felt a strong desire to continue he was just in the mood for humorous writing he would turn the mood to account and if possible finish his article before morning what he bad already written was much to his mind twas he thought very laughable he would therefore continue and try to conclude before day the room was bitter cold but he cared not for that his light was dim but there was enough of it to last till day his cough troubled him but he only dreaded the noise troubling his mother and sister they fond creatures had retired to rest two hours before weary of entreating him to desist from a task that had tried his health so powerfully he felt an irresistible desire to proceed and pro ceed he did hour after hour glided by and sheet after sheet of his mirthmoving article passed per fect from his wasted hand twelve oclock struck and found him full of rare conceits which he traced on his paper with a rapidity or excelled by his thoughts one sounded solemnly heavily on the cold nightair he dropped his pen and surveyed with delighted eyes the fruits of his labor the room seemed colder than usual he shrugged his shoulders and thought twas fancy the cough hacked his feeble lungs with unpleasant severity but he thought not of the cough the visage on the wall grinned more merrily add urged him to finish   the students last offering    o his task conceits more quaint and strange than any he had yet known now rioted through his brain with preternatural intensity  inducing profound mirth and wreathing his wasted features in ghastly smiles two oclock clanged from the churchtower hard by and the energy of the writer seemed abat ing his hand moved more slowly over the paper his thoughts were less intense his fancies were fading and he sustained the spirit of his article only by great mental effort leaning back in his chair overcome with lassitude he surveyed the pile of sheets with a sigh and muttering only a little longer and tis done he shortly resumed his pen and his task three oclock boomed sullenly over the quiet city and the work of the worn youth was ended the feeble hand traced the last line laid down the pen and fell heavily by the side the eyes sunken and hollow wandered round the bare walls for a few minutes and then rested on the pile of manuscript the head sank back against the chair in an attitude of repose a sad smile played round the mouth and the brow was damp with per spiration and thus they found him a few hours later the mother and the sister when they entered with his scanty breakfast  stark rigid and lifeless staring at his last offering on earth in the body while the spirit having glided from the want that is earthly had soared up to heaven with the angels such my children added papa with deep feeling     the students last offering such is the history of the article that has amused you so keenly it abounds in strokes of irresistible humor but the writer is no longer of the living and how did you learn this history papa urged emily in a subdued voice  from the mother and the daughter was the answer the rooms they occupied were rented of my agent who was about to eject them for non payment of rent when i passing by accident inter fered and restored the widow and her child to their shelter god will bless you for that dear papa said emily rising up and kissing him fervently the proceeds of the article continued papa have provided them with a few comforts which i have increased and recollect emily added the benevolent gentleman laying his hand tenderly on rich tresses of his daughters head  recollect that they are henceforth under my care and yours and yours emily he repeated with gentle em phasis   be it so papa they shall be well cared for the forlorn ones ill visit them tomorrow without fail and she did and the benevolent daughter of that benevolent merchant has been and is a firm friend to the widow and the fatherless   t    writing for bread dimuise it as thou wilt still still poverty thou art a bitter draught sterbne dick sensitiveo sat weary and desponding in the rickety attic of a rickety house in a back street of london one dismal december day in the year  the air was very keen and so was dicks appetite he had not tasted food for fortyeight hours reader permit us to inquire in the most delicate manner imaginable if you have ever known the pangs of protracted hunger if you answer in the nega tive then we sincerely hope were your years to reach a thousand ydu may never feel yourself in a position to realize such unspeakable agony but if by rare accident you have been enabled to reply in the affirmative then we are satisfied that you can feel for dick sensitive his eyes were wolfish positively wolfish and an occasional sharp spasmodic twitch of his mouth denoted aneager desire to scrape immediate ac quaintance with a beefsteak there are worse things in the world for an empty stomach than a tender beefstea done to a turn and       writing for bread flanked by a creamy pot of porter in dicks opi nion there were very few better and he felt that if by any sudden freak of fortune he were to become master of such a treasure he would not exchange it for its weight in gold  he was wrong theli decidedly wrong as any man conversant with the rates of exchange could have informed him for although gold is slightly indigesti ble slightly unpalatable and moreover a trifle diffi cult to cook yet it is said to be  allpowerful and will buy a beefsteak one ay dozens tens hun dreds thousands millions of dozens if you only have it a theres the rub if you only have it but dick was poor his treacherous memory was un able to fix the precise date when his sole remaining sovereign was transformed into shillings and pence his pockets were ignorant of silver for a week past and two days had elapsed two weary tedious days since he parted with his last copper to a kitchenboy for a mouldy bone and now as he sat in his bare attic pinched with cold starving and scant of rai ment he prayed for the possession of a single shil ling that he might stifle the vulture in his entrails a paltry shilling but twelve pence sterling was the entire extent of his present ambitious desires it would give him ease animation life but how was he to get it the question has puzzled is still puzzling and to the end of time will continue to puzzle the brains of many men with ten times the intellect of dick sen   writing for bread       sitive he leaned back in hiskeleton of a chair to try and solve it a variety of vague and indefinite thoughts flitted through his mind for a time but the ignorant cun ning selfish image of his landlady would be upper most the insolent demeanor with which she had threatened but an hour ago to  show him the door was positively torturing to his constitutional suscep tibility what was he to do the gloomy sullen surge of old thames as it fell on his ear whispered a remedy  a final remedy speedy yet sure short yet wicked but dick was a christian and banished the temptation with a prayer he thought of work any kind of drudgery the meanest then he thought of the brutal liverystable owner who had thrust him forth that morning after an hour of arduous trial because his hands were so tender then he surveyed those soft slender wasted hands and sighed the spirit indeed was willing but the flesh was weak here a fierce sudden blustering whistling gust of wind rustled the old attic windows as if in mock ery of human misery and roused him once more he glanced at the wintry sky without and all at once recollected that christmas would be on the morrow he thought of the merry happy time he used to spend at christmas in the home of his boyhood long ago when his gallant father and tender mother s     writing for bread and dear sister were all the world to him he thought of that gallant father and tender mother now in the dust  of that dear sister lost to him for ever a choking sensation rose in his throat a single hot blistering tear fell on his cheek another and another followed then as a pent torrent the windows of his soul opened and he wept like a child powerful mental emotion is for the most part transient and well for us it is so  dicks grief was intense while it lasted and therefore soon at an end a sudden twinge of the stomach contributed to shor ten it the gastric juice is somewhat imperative and may not be neglected with impunity dick started to his feet and paced his narrow attic with one abrupt step while his tortured feelings found vent in bitter soliloquy were i only a drayman a hodman a dustman a coalheaver a sweep any thing in short but the povertystricken son of a gentleman it is hor rible surely there is something i might do to avoid actual starvation he paused and gazed thoughtfully for a moment on the floor then rubbing his forehead like one who has made a sudden discovery he elevateid his arm and exclaimed i have it at last yes let me try if i cannot write for my bread no one can say but this idea seemed both reasona ble and feasible but like many others it was more easily conceived than put into practice it was at   writing eor bread       least worthy of a trial and likely to prove a more agreeable experiment than a plunge into the thames dick was decidedly of this opinion so he set about the execution of his project with wonderful alacrity for a man indulging in the pleasant luxury of a forty eight hours fast from the skeleton of a consumptive trunk he produced a stumpy pen and a crumpled leaf of paper then seating himself once more on his frail chair he prepared for a plunge into prose ten fifteen twenty thirty minutes had elapsed and his paper was yet unstained by ink he was intently debating with himself as to the choice of a subject but his worried thoughts were not to be dragooned into a decision like owen glendowers spirit in the vasty deep they  would not come when he did call for them at length his wandering glance is arrested by a patient spider  spinning still and still for ever spin ning his tiny web he watches the unwearied insect for a moment and his memory reverts to the magic effect produced by a similar sight on the drooping spirits of an imprisoned scottish king properly handled that historical incident might afford material for a sheet of judicious reflections on the necessity of perseverance in adversity he has some thought of choosing that incident for his subject lhis pen is in the ink  when a boisterous jawbreaking earsplitting laugh is heard from an adjoining attic       writing for bread dick dropped his remnant of a gray goosequill and wondered who on earth could be the author of such uproarious merriment it was so reckless so jovial so very loud that he felt satisfied the happy mortal whoever he might be was not likely to die of consumption neither did it seem that he was much afflicted with the trouble of this wicked world care if any he had seemed to sit lightly on his heart and still more lightly on his lungs he must have dined too for no man in his senses would undertake such a laugh on an empty stomach this contrast between his own desponding mood and the hilarity of his unknown neighbor had the effect of changing the current of dicks thoughts entirely he concluded to permit the incident of bruce and the spider to remain quietly in the page ofthe scottish historian and instantly resolved to write a chapter on laughter he would anatomize and describe the various sorts of laughter in modern use with their different effects on different individuals anc after a few flourishes about the general benefit to be derived from this delightful amusement he would go on to treat of each particular kind of laugh known to hu manity  beginning with the chronic and ending with the laugh that apes humility the short dry sententious laugh of purseproud arrogance the inflated preposterous chuckle of self conceit the confident swaggering grin of commer cial hypocrisy and the smooth oily demure sneer   writing for bread       of religious fanaticism these he would dismiss with a brief sentence or two but the laugh which he would dwell upon in an especial manner and point out as the one most worthy of being practised is the pure righteous open holy smile that adorns the face of him whose heart is warmed by the springs of benevolence the result of this kind of laughter he thought if it were only to become fashionable might be a speedy improvement in the condition of the whole human race having thus arranged the plan of his subject in his mind he proceeded to commit the details to pa per and after an infinite number of blots scratches and interlinings he succeeded in producing an arti cle that would have been pronounced in these days fairish for an amateur when it was finished he nervously folded the manuscript and prepared to find a purchaser buttoning up his thin threadbare frockcoat he snatched from the floor what had once been a hat and with head erect and step elate hurriedly descended to the street as the door closed behind him his ear was saluted by the remainder of a blasphemous prayer from the lips of his virago of a landlady to the effect that she  might never set eyes on his miserable phiz again he heeded it not but quickly took his way through the dreary streaes night had fallen upon the huae city and wrapped it in a gloomy mantle the stars were obscured by piles of ugly black ominous clouds a cold sharp      writing for bread drizzling sleet was whirled in the teeth of the lick less wayfarer and cut against his face like a shower of needles dick felt it keenly as he threaded his way but his spirit was buoyed by hope after an arduous walk he reached the shop of an extensive publisher and with palpitating heart and tremulous hand drew forth his manuscript and ten dered it to a middleaged shrewdlooking spectacled individual who was busily employed in piling away a heap of magazines fresh from the press this person scrutinized dicks appearance for a moment then pointed to the manuscript ancsharply inquired  whats that an article sir that i wish to sell to some of the publishers was the meek reply take it elsewhere i have no time to read trash dick thrust it into his pocket with a sigh mut tered something about being needy and was about to leave the shop when a welldressed palefaced young man  who had been turning over the leaves of some periodicals and was an attentive witness to this brief interviewlaid a hand on dicks shoul der and in a voice of singular sweetness requested a sight of the manuscript in a second dicks face brightened in two more the stranger was attentively perusing his production a slight mixture of surprise and pleasure became visible in his countenance as lie proceeded and an o     writing for bread       occasional glance directed at dick showed that he was interested slowly folding the manuscript when he got to the end he thrust five sovereigns and his card into dicks hand telling him that he would be happy to see him again he bowed and passing to the door entered a cab and drove rapidly away while the wondering dick stood rooted to the spot amazed delighted stupefied and completely bewil dered by his good fortune s       f   c  the dreamer while

corners are jist the same ez all other impecoonius peoplethey want more money and the idee uv honest bill allen that to git it all yoo hed to do wuz to ishoo it filled our idees uv finanse eggsackly its simple and ezily understood i determined to put the idee into practice and to that end sejested to my friends the organizashen uv a bank uv ishoo under the name and title uv the onlimited trust and confidence company uv confedrit x roads i hed some trouble to git the citizens into it but i finelly succeeded i explained to the people that more money wood be an advantage to the debtor class wich ez ninetenths uv em is in debt to bascom the grosery keeper settled em they hailed with joy any movement that wood wipe out their scores and give em new credit at his bar to bascom and them ez i intended to hev in the management i showed that more money meant increased trade and ez the money woodent cost anything but the printin we coodent lose anything so the bank wuz started i wuz made president issaker gavitt cashier bascom vicepresident with a board uv directors consistin of ourselves with kernel mcpelter and the venerable deekin pogram we put the deekin on becoz he is baldheaded and therefore respectable his biznis is to sit in the front window reedin an inflashen paper it inspires confidence yoo have to watch him to keep him from hevin the paper upside down but in this community that dont matter ez very few know the difference more n he does our bankin room is lokatid immejitly under the printinoffis so we kin let the printed notes which we ishoo down to the presidents desk by a rope this saves labor wich is a great pint in a instooshen like ours the theory on wich our paper is ishood is very simple the company ishoo it and the people take it we hev no time fixed for redempshun for the beauty uv the biznis is that we dont never intend to redeem our notes reeds the onlimited trust and confidence company uv confedrit x roads wich is in the state uv kentucky promises to pay the bearer one dollar we dont say when where or how it is to be redeemed and therein is the strength uv the enterprise our first ishoo wuz reseeved with some hesitashen where is our secoority demanded one farmer to whom we offered it in payment for a load uv wheat faith in the company i ansered lookin at him pityinly gaze onto that face i resoomed pintin at deekin pogram who ruther spiled the effeck by brushin off a fly that hed lited on his nose look at that face and then ask for secoority when is it to be redeemed askt another it never wants to be redeemed wuz my anser we shel be libral and when a note wears out we will give yoo another wat do you want it redeemed fur money ishood on faith needs no redempshun we buy yoor prodoose with ityoo yoose it to buy yoor goods and so it goes round and round in a cirkle dispensin blessins wherever it lites ez long ez yoo take it wat do yoo want uv anything else another remarkt that it wuz his idee that paper money wuz all to be redeemed in gold gold i promptly replied is played out gold is merchandise our democratic brethren in ohio hev desided that money is simply promises to pay and that it dont matter on wat material that promise is stamptwhether gold silver iron shells or copper we shel put ourn on paper coz its the cheapest we shel hev no extravagance about this bank pollock the illinoy disturber in the most brootal manner refoozed to tech it and consekently his biznis suffered one shoemaker from ohio followed soot and undertook to argoo agin so much money he asserted the heresy that addin to the volum uv currency didnt add nothin to its power sed he i will illustrate so the corners will comprehend yoo take a gallon uv whiskey and add to it three gallons uv water well yoo hev four gallons in the barl but there aint but wun gallon uv square drunk in it after all i ansered him by readin copious extrax from carys speeches showin that troo prosperity goes hand in hand with plenty uv money they finelly wuz convinst and took our money for their grain tho we hed to pay them at the beginin twenty cents a bushel more for this wheat than other money wood hev got it for but we didnt care for we knew we cood make all uv it we wanted it wuz astonishin wat a era uv prosperity set in on the corners to wunst money became ez plenty ez blackberries and everybody hed their pockets full uv it land went up in valyoo two hundred per cent in a week and the price uv the nessaries uv life raised ekally bascom put up his new whiskey from  to  cents per drink and sich wuz the run uv trade he hed that his wife and his oldest son jefferson davis bascom both hed to stand in the bar to wait on customers the bank bought all the wheat and other produckshuns and paid for em in its own money and we paid sich prices ez happened for money wuz with us no objeck the high prices brot all the trade for twenty miles around to the corners and all the dealers who wood take the money stood up to their middles in it then my turn come pintin to the crowds uv people in bascoms i sed to the doubter wuz trade ez brisk ez that afore inflashun improvements are bein projected every day we hev organized a company to build a branch road from here to secessionville another over to bloody fork and still another to little andersonville five turnpike companies hev bin organized and three factries hev bin actooally commenced the water power on the run jist above the village is to be improved towunst and bascom is alreddy at work on a wing to the back part of the grocery town lots are doublin in valyoo every day and new addishuns are bein perpetyooally laid out everybody is spekelatin and everybody is gettin rich there is flush times here the people are all inflashionists i am president uv all these companies and i see no reason why i cant put em through it is troo the price of everything hez gone up the commonest nigger labor is now up to  a day and a pair uv pegged boots is wuth  but wat difference does that make so long ez simpkins the printer kin work his press we kin manufackter all the money we want and ez long ez we kin manufackter money there must be prosperity pollock and joe bigler we hed to git red uv for they wuz prejoodissen the people agin us pollocks stock uv goods and his store wuz wuth in the old times before the era uv inflashun about a thousand dollars and bascom and me and deekin pogram went to him and offered him that sum for his property things hez raised sed he and i wont sell for less than  we promptly accepted that price and i sent a boy back to the bank with a bushel basket to bring the money when it come pollock refoosed to take it return of the boy with currency i want greenbax sed he our money is jest ez good sez i i know it sez hebut i hev a prejoodis for other money there wuz a crowd about and it wood never do to acknowledge that any money wuz better n ours i took bascom one side g w sez i here is a golden opportunity to do two things first we git rid uv a disturber and second we give confidence in our ishoos rake up greenbax and pay him in em g w consented and it wuz done in the presence uv the people yoo see sed i my friends that wed jest as soon pay greenbax ez our own money the crowd wuz reashoored and took our bills ez readily ez ever pollock and bigler gave up the property but they didnt leave the village on the contrary they went to the tavern to board and jeered at us wuss than ever they sed they hed made more money by this transackshen than they hed ever made in the corners since they hed landed there deekin pogram capt mcpelter and issaker gavitt hev all paid off mortgages on their farms and i hev bot a farm and am gettin up plans for a manshun befittin my new position i am happy and contented i hev struck my gait

company p stheres a triflin but still embarrasin trouble okkurred the onprecedented run on bascom in consekence uv the plentifulness uv money exhausted his stock uv likkers yesterday and he sent to looisville for more the likker merchants uv that mersenary city ez a mere matter uv form generally require bascom to pay for goods afore they ship em to avoid mistakes he sent on a thousand dollars uv our money and they refoozed to take it ez he paid all the greenbax he hed to pollock he cant get supplies and the corners is parched wat to do we dont know we dont see why our money shoodent go in looisville it will take two weeks to ship enough grain to looisville to exchange for the likker and then comes another terrible quondary bascom demands the grain uv the bank and wants to pay for it in the banks ishoos and he insists on hevin it at wat its wuth in looisville in greenbax finanseerin aint the easiest biznis in the world our money startid well enuff on the cirkle but there seems to be a break in it ef we let bascom hev that grain and take our own money for it were is our profits ef we dont let him hev the grain the corners will die uv drouth and ef he gits it our money must be taken for it for its all hes got i cood cut the gorjen knot by failin but then the wheat wood be attached i shell hold on and see wat a week will bring forth providence never deserted me yit p v n the further progress of the unlimited trust and confidence companyits continued success confedrit x roads wich is in the state uv kentucky sept   ef life ever wuz a rose tinted dream to me at any time doorin my mortle pilgrimage this is the precise time i am thoroly happyso happy indeed that the privashens and troubles that i hev been thro are fadin out uv my memory entirely i hev paid bascoms account wich hez bin runnin for so many years and hev his receet in my safemy safe i say proudly i write them words my safe whothirty days ago wood hev supposed that i should ever say my safe then i hev two soots uv clozegood oneswich is one and a half more than i hev hed sence i was postmaster under johnsonheven rest his solei hev two shirts for the first time in my life and i am wearin stockins i hev but one pare ez yet but one cant rise to the summit uv hooman grandjer at wun bound i shel buy another pare in a week or two i think every bank president ought to either hev two pare uv stockins or return to the stern virchoos uv the republic in its better days and go barefoot goin barefoot or hevin a change is necessary to the keepin uv a bank presidents office in a sweet smellin condition but this is a digreshen suffice it to say i am clothed i pade three dollars and a half a pare for them stockinsthey is cottonwich is three dollars and a quarter more than they wuz worth in the old money but what difference does it make that three dollars and a half wuz made by four pulls on simpsons printin press and when money kin be made in that way wat difference does it make wat i pay for cotton sox at the beginnin we ishood    and  cent currency but we hev quit that prices hev gone up so under the general al prosperity that there aint anything in the corners that sells for less than a dollar and the frackshnel currency wuz desided to be yooselis besides it costs jest ez much to print a ten cent note ez it does a dollar and we bleeve in economizin simpson the printer is makin us a little trouble at the beginnin i yoosed to pay him for printin our bills by jest signin enuff uv em ez they come from the press to make his amount but lately he hez refoozed to take our money and insists on greenbax we tried to overawe him but when he threatened to publish the finanshel condishun uv the president and direktors it wuz considered advisable to humor him it is singler that sich men throw impediments in the way uv progress the obstacles in the way uv the bank that hev thus far developed themselves hev bin happily and easily removed bascom demanded wheat uv us to ship to looisville to git more whiskey and we hed to let him hev it and take pay in our own money and ez he demanded that we take our own money jest the same ez greenbax that bein the standard in looisville we met a heavy loss the account stands ez follows  bushels uv wheat cost us in our own money at   per bushel   sold it to bascom at looisville greenbax prices wich is  per bushel takin pay in the same money we hed paid for it   loss wich is easily figgered   we hed one more trouble wich we got on easier with pugsby the shoemaker who took our money run out uv leather and when he sent to looisville for more the merchants there ez in the case uv bascom refoozed to take our currency pugsby knowd uv bascoms experience and he came up smilin to hev us sell him wheat enuff at greenbax prices to renoo his stock wat kin we do i demanded in dire distress for really i didnt see why pugsby shoodent hev wheat to renoo his stock ez well ez bascom ceptin that whiskey is more necessary to the corners than leather do sed issaker gavitt with a expreshun uv skorn on his classick feechersdo and yoo claim to be finanseers hez pugsby a safe no well wher does he keep the  uv our money in his desk yes and that is wooden and his bildin is wood very good tell pugsby to come tomorrer and we will give him wheat at a dollar a bushel for all uv our money he hez got we hev twentyfour hours and banks ez well as nashens kin be saved in twentyfour hours and issaker put some matches in his vest pocketabout  worth matches hez gone up  a boxour money that nite pugsbys shop burnt up and the fire broke out jist under his desk the next mornin that unforchnit man came to us and insisted on hevin the wheat on the score uv the money he ned uv ours bring us the money said issaker beamin sweetly onto him and well give yoo all the wheat you want but yoo know that i hed yoor money and that it wuz burnt up last nite i persoom you hed some uv our money but i dont know it replied issaker no well regulated bank kin live if they shood take every mans word ez you want us to how kin i tell but wat yoo hev that money concealed and that the burnin of your shop was a skeem to defrod yoor creditors i am not shoor that it isnt my dooty to investigate the matter and issaker looked so stern that pugsby left the bank with a howl of terror issaker is developin so great a genius in financeerin that im reely jealus uv him he is the mastersperit of the institooshun at the board meetin last nite we discust wat we shood do in sich cases ez pugsbys hereafter but arrived at no definit conclooshun there is several uv em and they will hev to be met issaker bleeves in the style uv treatment he yoosed in pugsbys case but i cant consent to it its heroic i admit and good enuff for a temprary expedient but it wont do for a reglar system ef our money stimoolates a mans biznis to the pint of his bildin a new house we hev benefitted him and the commoonity ez well but ef to avoid the inconvenience uv redeemin that money we hev to burn the house wat good hev we accomplished none we hev got to find some other way i dont see any other way but no doubt it will sejest itself to me in time it is astonishin how the corners is boomin now that it hez money enuff five new ralerodes are bein built twenty new turnpikes one hundred and twentyeight cellers for new houses is bein dug and last week the cornerstuns for eight factrys wuz lade with approprit ceremonies the gradin is bein dun on the ralerodes and turnpikes and that part uv the work will be pushed to an early compleshun for the labrers furnish their own shovels and picks and take our money for wages the labrers buy their livin uv the farmers along the line with that money and then the farmers come to the corners with it and cheer their soles at bascoms so far all is serene and sweet so far the money sheds blessins ez a skunk does perfoom but at this pint comes worry wat is bascom to do with it the looisville merchants refooz to tech it for likker and we cant afford to give him wheat at looisville prices agin we wood bild a distillery but alas we cant pay for the nails the glass and the stillin apparatus in our money and we aint got any other but thanks to an overulin providence bascom hez enuff likker to last two weeks and suthin will turn up afore that is gone nasby persuaded to leave mcpelters watch prices hev gone up so that it takes a vast volume uv currency to transact the biznis uv the corners simpsons handpress wont anser the demands made onto it and he hez purchased a powerpress wich will print  sheets an hour and to facilitate biznis and to make it perfeckly shoor that we shell hev all the currency we want i hev hed my name and issakers engraved so that it kin be printed in thus saving us the trouble uv signin em with a pen prices uv things is still mountin up and general prosperity prevails pugsby gits  a pare now for pegged boots a great deal eazier that he yoost to git  and bascom hez put drinks up to  cents for new whiskey and  when you take sugar in it lots in the corporashun hez quadroopled in valyoo within the week and reel estate is changin hands lively i cood wish however that the ishoos uv the onlimited trust and confidence company cood hev a wider circulashen i took a brief vacashun this week wuz at the glauber salt springs and wuz beaten out uv  at cutthroat loo the gamblers refoozed to take my money and i was compelled to leave my watch with em that is captain mcpelters watch which i hed borrowed to make an imposin appearance but it wuz all the same to me ez i paid him for it in our own currency i wuz sorry to lose it for i had depended on that watch to help us out when we got into a very tite place petroleum v nasby president of the onlimited trust and confidence company p sanother trouble is loomin up on the horizon perkins the blacksmith is out uv iron and sampsell the carpenter hez to hev a jackplain and two augers all uv wich hez to be got in looisville and they demand uv us sich money ez looisville will take then another mortifyin circumstance happened yesterday the directers uv the bank hed determined to lay the corner stun uv our new bankin edifis wich we hev commenst but after announsin the ceremony we coodent lay it a bigger rope than any in the corners wuz nessary to lift the massive stun to its place we hed it massive ez an emblem uv our solidity but we coodent rake up enuff currency that theyd take in looisville to buy one so that corner stun aint laid and the work on the buildin i spose will hev to stop till we kin turn up suthin thers a crisis approachin p v n the progress of inflationthe trouble that perkins startedthe present status of the great idea confedrit x roads wich is in the state uv kentucky oct   i hev hed trouble enough with the unenlitened people uv these corners for the past week to nearly drive me mad indeed i shood hev bin in a loonatic asylum ere this hed i not bin sustained and soothed by an onlimited faith in the correctnis uv the doctrines uv the ohio dimocrisy ez regards money and feelin that i wuz assistin in my humble way in puttin them doctrines into practis i determined not to go mad but to persevere even unto the end but the perverse people are doin ther level best to drive me crazy and i am not shoor that they wont succeed i bought a pare uv horses uv one uv em for  and paid him in our own money he thot hed rather not tech it when will this be redeemed he askt innocently any time you want it i replied in wat he retorted in other notes onto the same bank sez i and how will yoo redeem them notes sez he in jist the same way sez i then all ther is uv it sez he yoo go on takin up one note by givin another and all uv em without interest nor nothin thats it eggsackly sed i yoo see cant yoo or are yoo an ijeot that money means faith now ef the proud finanshel instooshin in wich i am the hed ishoos its note yoo must hev faith that it will pay and so long ez yoo hev that faith and everybody else hez that faith so that they take it for money yoo never want the money on it so long ez money is taken yoo dont want it redeemed for it is good enuff yoo see our money is made good by faithand ez long ez it is sustaned by faith it will go when the notes yoo hev now wears out come to us and we will redeem em with new ones but evrybody must hev faith cant yoo see it evrybody must hev faith faith in the ishoos uv this bank uv ourn is nessary to its success and stability faith in our money is ez it is in religion the substance uv things hoped for and the evidence uv things not seen only more so wait till i git  from the printin offis and take em for yoor hosses and go yoor way hev faith perkins that wuz the farmers name took the money and went his way ponderin ez he went he walked down to bascoms with deep lines uv thot onto his face wich resolved itself into a expreshun uv stern determinashen ez he went in kin yoo sell me a barl uv whisky todaya entire barl certinly sed g w smilingly certinly mr perkins its only worth  a gallon or  per barl this mornin ill take a barl sed perkins all rite wuz g ws response id ez soon sell a barl towunst ez by the single drink so g w

in mine wen this note wears out come to me and i will write yoo a new one and dont keep it too longi shel take pleasure in writin yoo notes often so that they will alluz be new and pleasant to look at how pleasant it is bascom to pay ez yoo go how much better i feel to pay on the nale and how much better yoo must feel to hev yoor cash wen yoo deliver yoor goods and perkins drove off with the likker litehearted leavin bascom dumfounded in the door uv the grosery gaspin with astonishment and blind with rage perkins didnt stop with a barl uv likker he bot a pare uv pegged boots for  and pade for em in the same way and a kag uv nails and two soots uv cloze and calico dresses for his wife and dawters and a box uv paper collars and a necktie things he hed never dreemed uv hevin before and he got so eggscited at his success in finanseerin that he went home drunk ez a biled owl but the misery uv all this is every cuss within five miles seein perkinses success is doin the same thing and an immense volyoom uv wat i may call indivijjle currency is afloat and they is seriously thretnin to vote to hev the corprashen take the stuff for taxes the idee uv takin money for taxes that aint printed and that heznt got no president and casheer and board uv direkters there is sich a thing ez carryin this thing too fur but prosperity continoos her stimulatin rain we ishood thirty thousand dollars uv our money last week and the benefishle effeck is visible wheat is now  a bushel likker  a drink plain and  to them ez take sugar in theirn pegged boots is  cotton sox  and town lotswell any price that one chooses to ask for em the diggin uv cellars is goin on satisfactorily ez is evrything else that we kin pay for in our own money but i tremble with apprehensions wat will happen when they come to want the lumber and nales and glass and other things wich hev to come from looisville thats the gost that hants me petroleum v nasby president uv the onlimited trust and confidence company p sthe most wonderful effeck uv inflashen wuz showd this mornin on deekin pogram the old saint made his appearance at the bank in a noo soot uv cloze wich mirandy his dawter got for him the old man tried to keep up under it but finelly broke down he refoozed to stay in his seet unless wed take off the coat pull off his boots and them dd stockins deakin pogram reduced to his normal condition ez he expressed it and drip some tobacker joose over his buzm he swore that he ruther resine his posishen than to wear boots and stockins in the summer time and ez for paper collars hed wear none uv em he wood hev gone insane ef we hednt stript him and got him back to his normel style wat a difference there is in men now i took to stockins when i got to be president uv this bank ez naterally ez tho i hed alluz wore

uv kentucky october   the man wich undertakes to benefit his fellows loads up a very heavy contrack half the citizens ov the corners are agoin back in the most ongrateful manner onto the onlimited confidence and trust company they are a gettin  a bushel for wheat and about the same for oats and corn aad men now talk uv thousands wich never before knowd how to pronounce the word but yet they aint happy they hev a hankerin after redempshun uv some sortthey demand to know when this money uv ourn is again to be redeemed in suthin elsesome other kind uv moneyez tho our money backed by faith wuznt ez good ez any in the world ef these malcontents wood only take it and look pleasant there woodent be any trouble about it but these men are not the worst we hev to contend with the citizens wich are the stanchest supporters uv the new money hev determined that ef we hev the rite to ishoo money they hev the same rite and so four noo banks hev bin started this week mackey and burns started one with mackey ez president and burns ez cashier with them and a nigger carpenter ez the board of direkters they hev got the drop on us by requirin the officers to give bonds wich they accomplished by hevin mackey sign burns burns sign mackeys and both sign the nigger carpenters then they hev another advantage over us for they bought their own press and print their own notes wich ez we hev to pay simpson the printer a profit enables em to make money cheeper than we kin they call their institooshun the nashnel benefit assoshashen and hev their bankin offis in mackeys bedroom in the pogram house scarsely wuz this bank histin out money afore squire pettus and gedney the shoemaker started another wich they called the blessin diffusin bank uv north ameriky with the offis in gedneys shoe shop and they got ahead uv us by printin their notes in two colors which i must say gives em a solvent look by this time wheat went up to  a bushel and scase at that then parkins and barney the plasterers who hed made a great deal uv money since inflashen set in they hed to start a bank wich they called the ekitable and insashable bankin company uv the yoonited states and they ishood their bills by the bushel wheat went up immejitly to  per bushel and a noo era uv prosperity sot in before these finanseers hed got fairly under way butts and busterd conclooded theyd go into bankin and behold one mornin the bills uv the labor stimyoolatin companyi butts presidentmade their appearance they didnt hev any offis for buts sed he didnt see no yoose uv an offis he cood pay out money on the street all he wanted to ef the people wood take it and ez it never wuznt a goin to be redeemed wat did he want uv an offis he wuznt a goin to any sich expense for he bleeved in economizin to go to yooselis expenses wuz to show a culpable disregard uv the interests uv the people wheat went up to  per bushel and there wuz more prosperity then trouble set in in chunks the people who wuz not interested in bankin refoozed pint blank to take any uv their ishoos banks wuz a gettin rather too frekent a reackshen okkured agin our money wich we who wuz interested determined to crush towunst the offiishls uv the five banks in the town met and decided to hold a meetin uv the citizens at wich steps shood be taken to legalize our ishoos the meetin wuz held and uv course we kerried it without any trouble for seventenths uv em hed our money in their pockets and they wuz very favorable to any ackshen that wood keep it a bilin to that end we past the follerin resolooshens wareas the democrisy uv ohio and pennsylvany with a singerly just appreshiashen uv the wants uv the citizens uv the cross roads hev demanded more money and wareas five compinies hev kerried out the idee uv the democrisy uv

to take it decline to be benefited therefore be it resolved that this meetin uv citizens demand uv the town council that it towunst convene and pass an ordnance makin the ishoos uv the five banks legal tender for everything from drinks down to taxes and that any citizen who refoozes to take it or murmurs at it or in any way discredits it shel be held ez a public enemy and be immejitly hung the whereases and the resolooshen wuz passed towunst and i felt easier with the power to hang all wich refooze to take our money i rather think i kin make it current a rope over the limb uv a tree is a persuader of rare merit and it is the best endorsement uv our paper that we kin possibly hev so far so good but jist ez i wuz feelin good over my success cess that onmitigated cuss jehial perkins the man wat give his note to bascom for a barl uv whisky with sich distinguished success rose and sed he hed a series of whererases and a resolooshen to pass he went on to say that he hed given this question of finance a great deal uv study he endorsed fully the posishen uv the dimocrisy uv ohio and pennsylvany he bleeved in more moneymoney enuff for everybody he pinted with pride to the development uv the corners since the creashun uv more money and he bleeved that still more money would make still more prosperity the idee wuz correct the government shood ishoo promises to pay and faith shood make em good without any sich nonsense ez redeemin and if the government shood do it why shoodnt banks if banks why not indivijles thats what he wanted to know ef ther wuz any sich thing ez redeemin uv it in gold or anything else the people mite hev the rite to ask if them ez ishoo the money hed gold or anything else to redeem em with but ez ther aint no redeemin perposed why that question dont come in the people hev to hev faith and thats all the hevin ther is in the transackshen he wuz a bleever in more money and he perposed to hev more money and he bleeved that them ez hed the greatest need for money shood hev the privilege uv ishooin it and so long ez the people took it from each other it ansered all the perposes uv money therefore he perposed the yoonanimus adopshun uv the followin wherases and resolooshen wareas ef yoo hev a good thing yoo cant hev too much uv it and wareas the increese uv currency in the corners hez bin productive uv prosperity sich ez we never dreemed uv and wareas it is the dooty uv all earthly guvernments to diffoose its blessins ekally therby imitatin the doos of heaven wich falls alike on the just and onjust and wareas the manufakter uv money shood not be confined to the few but shood be the privilege uv the many and wareas we rekognize the justis and propriety uv compellin the people to take sich money ez may be ishood therefore be it resolved that every man may ishoo his notes uv hand in sich sums ez may soot his interest or convenience and that sich notes shel be legal tender fur everything the same ez the notes ishood by our five bankin institooshuns and the dd ideots abslootly passed the resolooshen without a minits delay and they demandid that the council meet that very nite and pass the ordinance wich it did ez every last man uv em commenst writin notes to wunst and buyin all sorts uv things with em were liable to hev enuff money at the corners immejitlyez much ez our brethren in ohio and pennsylvany wood desire even everything in the shape uv labor hez bin abandoned for everybody hez gone into the manufakter uv currency that is everybody who kin write thank heaven that they never favored skools herethe inability to shed ink is the only limit to our inflashen one singler result hez followed this ordinance viz nobody hez nothin to sell i went into a shoe store yesterday thinkin to treat myself to a

my hopes is blasted the onlimited trust and confidence company is not eggsackly no more but its near enuff dead to make it safe to bury it on a vencher its eyes is sot after a brilyant career uv five weeks coruscatin along the sky uv finance sheddin a perfect rain uv blessins at every jump its lite hez gone its brilyancy hez departed and it dont coruscate worth a cent we hevnt suspended nor failed nor closed our doors nor nothin for the simple reason that the bank wuz constructed on an ijee that made failin impossible and the closin uv doors onnecessary ez we dont hev to redeem wat shel we fail for ez we dont perpose to pay nothin wat shel we close our doors for ther aint nothin hidebound about this bank the people is welcome to come in and discuss finance and put ther feet up on the benches and spit terbacker jooce all over the floor jest as frendly as they choose and they may do it ez long ez they choose no the onlimited trust and confidence company aint failed but its kinder petered out ez it were it is expirin uv dry rot its notes wich is its blud aint hevin any cirkelashen the people dont take em with that cheerfulness nessary to a proper bankin bizness legislashen dont fetch em the ordinances wich made death the penalty for refoosin our ishoos only workt so far ez takin uv em for taxes the corporashen did take em for takes in pursooance uv their own legislashen and here wuz where the trouble begun the taxes wuz levied on a greenback basis and the entire levy amounted to  well the taxes for the first time in the histry uv the corners wuz all pade in full and with great promptness a more prompter set uv taxpayers i never seed the treasurer hed  uv our ishoos when it becum nessary to buy a plow and four spades to do some work on the roads in vane he tried to git em the dealers at home knowin wat currency he hed to pay in suddenly got out uv plows and spades and when he went to looisville it took  in our currency to pay his fare and he offered the hardware dealer the other  for the implements he wanted but it woodent go he hed to come back without em then he came and demanded some currency uv us wich he cood yoose wich uv course we hednt got none and he becum an opponent to our system two shoemakers each with  uv our money coodent buy a side uv sole leather to continyoo ther bizniss with and hed to stop our ralerodes and turnpikes hed to stop becoz hevin got to the pint wher we hed to hev iron and nales and sich things we coodent go on so all the labrers hed to be discharged which made a desprit populashen all howlin agin us but the wust wuz yet to come we cood hev wethered all this but alas bascom failed this wuz the finishin blowthe great staggerer wich the corners cood not possibly recover from bascom made a manly fite and i must say did all that he cood to stand up for us he raised the price uv drinks to  a drink and when he saw his barls rapidly failin he tried to keep the corners agoin by waterin his likker ez we hed watered the currency but theze expedient didnt work the higher the price he put on his likker the more the people seemed to want to drink uv it it seemed to be a delite to em to pay out our money ef they got anything watever for it but they woodent do wat bascom most desiredthat is to say they woodent stand his watered whiskey they sed to him ef  a drink aint high enuff charge  its all wun to us set em up agin and the barroom full wood step up and take suthin and the man who askt em wood throw down on the bar a peck of our currency and tell bascom to help himself bascom come to us and begged that we shood let him hev suthin that he cood yoose to restock his bar he sed the dealers in looisville laffed in his face when he offered em our money for likker and he had but two barls left and them two barls wuz vizably shrinkin every minit it seemed ez though the populis got insane for likker at the very time when we didnt want em to hev it for the first time in my life i wanted the corners to be temprit for every drop drunk from those barls brought our bank that much nearer its end i sot opposite bascoms and saw the crowd go in with a sinkin sensashen that wuz akin to death drink by drink it went and ez ef they coodent eggsaust it fast enough by the single drink they got to comin for it in tin dippers how does it hold out wuz the message i sent him at  a m the answer come prompt  a m wun barl untutched twenty gallons in the other and sinkin every minit b then i sent this  fill her up with water keep jeffson davis a pourin in hold the fort n and the answer come  jeffson davis is a histin in water ez fast ez he kin carry it mrs bascom is a rinsin out old barls to which she adds kyan pepper and camfene ef i hed some scotch snuff it wood help will hold out ez long ez its possible but its terrible a man jist come in and demandid a gallon b twenty minits thereafter bascom sent this hev jist put a spiggot in the last barl and the corners is a howlin it wont last an hour b then an expedient segested itself to me i sent this note time is everything bust the spiggot n wich he did thus keepin the wolves at bay for an hour while it wuz bein repaired but why harrow the public buzum with the detales uv this painful story the end wuz inevitable drop by drop drink by drink pint by pint that likker wuz ebbin away and each drop weakened the bank that likker wuz our lifeblud and ez it flowed we wilted waterin the barl wuz merely a palliative and it wuz with a feelin uv relief that i saw geo w throw up his hands and exclaim its all gone but a gallon wich i shel keep for my own yoose its all gone and i cant get another drop in looisville and he dropt his head despondinly on a pile uv about  uv our currency wich he hednt taken off the bar and wept despondinly why cant yoo get more demanded the excited populis becoz i aint got no money but this and yoo coodent get a barl uv whiskey in looisville for a car load uv it i attempted to reason with the people i told em that one reason uv our wealth wuz that we hed it in a currency that we coodent send away from home thus keepin our capitul within ourselves but they refoozed to listen to me they dd my bank they dd me and they went for the bank swearin that ef ther wuz anything there that cood be converted into likker bascom shood hev it it is onnessary to remark that they didnt find anything antissipatin an onpleasantnis we hed removed the valyooables to a place uv safety wich wuz the underside uv my bed at deekin pograms then they demanded that the money they held be redeemed into suthin they cood yoose but uv course we declined to discuss the matter referrin them to the terms uv the ishoo ez expressed on the notes ez well ez ther own endorsement uv the skeem but this didnt satisfy em they delibrately brought out  uv the ishoos uv the various banks and pilin uv it up on the street sot fire to it dancin a demoniac danc around it this amoozed me for uv course i hed no earthly objeckshen to ther redeemin uv it in that way but when i seed em riggin ropes to the trees in the visinity i remarkt to my fellowofficers gentlemen yoor president hez pressin biznis in yonder forest and i got out ez rapidly ez my poor wastid lims wood permit i flatter myself that i made tollable time for a man uv my age whose strength is mostly in his stumick indeed wen i turned and saw ten or a dozen uv the foremost men uv the corners clost behind me and all shoutin hang the dd thief no gentle gazelle that i ever heerd uv ever skimmed the plain ez i did i did not cease runnin till i got into the middle uv the big swamp the

public school in the city of rochester n y mr loguen made application and was cheerfully received as a pupil having been brought up in tennessee slavery which institution wherever it istfound never fails to bequeath to its victims the miserable inheritance of ignorance he was of course without education save the little which he had gleaned from time to time by his own per severing efforts but though the taskmaster had fettered his limbs and deprived him of learning yet it was evident that his soul was unshackled and his lofty spirit unsubdued i am not aware that mr loguen made any secret of the fact that he was a fugitive and then as now bid defiance to his claimant s j w ij           en  during the winter which mr loguen was under my tuition he improved rapidly in the primary branches of education and at the same time manifested a strong desire to be serviceable in some way to his downtrodden race   the writer being about the same age of mr loguen and both being in pursuit of knowledge with a view to future use fulness a close intimacy sprang up between us which time has not impaired observing that mr loguen was a man of uncommon energy of mind and of a truly benevolent spirit i soon became anx ious that he should enter pon a epose of study in some of the liberal institutions ofthe day in the following spring when about to return to the oneida institute in wxb iteoro

loguens progress at the institute that at the end of the first term he was able to teach an excellent school in utica and after spending some to seasons at the institution where by diligence and

man anrid as none can feel for the fugitive from slavery as he can who has been crushed by its power and whose heart has been made to bleed by it cruelties let us never fail to encourage those having thie requisite qualifications to aid others escaping  from the land of despotism to the land oy the free such conduct is not only according to the dictates of human ity but a plain and solemn duty which god requires man to perform if the words of the bible hide the outcasts and betray not him that wandereth mean anything at all they mean that it is the duty ot christians and philanthropists to do all that mr loguen and his patrons have  done for the last few years for those who were jiustly entitled to their sympathy and not only is the fugitive peculiarly fitted for the work of aiding those who have just come from the house of bondage because of his experience in suffering but none can describe so gifaphically the workings of slavery and present so clearly its different phases and make so stirring and pathetic appeals as he undoubtedly douglas bibb brown clark and others would have been distinguished men had they been raised on the soil of freedom but neither ot them would have been able to portray the wickedness and cruelty of slavery with such amazing power had they not been within its grasp and felt heavy scourge multitudeshave listened to mr loguen on the subject of

favorably received by all classes in community whose hearts are not be numbed by the influence of slavery may heaven smile upon this new effort of mr logue is to aid the sacred cause of liberty and

february th   to jarm i now take my pen to write you a few lines to let you know how wo all are i am a cripple but i am still able to get about the rest of the family are all well cherry is as well as common i write you these lines to let you know the situation that we are inpartly in consequence of your running away and stealing old rock olq fine mare though we got theknare back she was never worth much after you took her and as i now stand in need of some funds i have determined to sell you and i have had an offer for you but did not see fit to take it if you will send me one thousand dollars and pay for the old mare i will give up all claim i have to you write to me as soon as you get these lines and let me know if you will accept my proposition in consequence of your running away we had to sell abe and ann and twelve acres of land and i want you to send me the money that i may be able to redeem the land that you was the cause of our selling and on receipt of the above named sum of money i will send you your bill of sale if you do not comply with my request i will sell you to          j w loguen some one else and you may rest assured that the time is not far distant when things will be changed with you write to me as soon as you get these lines direct your letter to bighyville maury county tennessee you had better comply with my request i understand that you are a preacher as the southern peo ple are so bad you had better come and preach to your old ac quaintances i would like to known if you read your bible if so can you tell what will become of the thief if he does not repent and if the blind lead the blind what will the conse quence be i deem it unnecessary to say much more at pres ent a word to the wise is sufficient you know where the liar has his part you know that we reared you as we reared our own children  that you was never abused and that shortly before you ran away when your master asked you if you would like to be sold you said you would not leave him to go with any body               sarah logue mr loguens reply syracuse n y march   mrs sarah logue yours of the th of february is duly received and i thank you for it it is a long time since i heard from my poor old mother andt i am glad to know she is yet alive and as you say as well as common what that means i dont know i wish you had said more about her you are a woman but had you a womans heart you could never have insulted a brother by telling him you sold his only remaining brother and sister because he put himself beyond your power to convert him into money you sold my brother and sister abe and ann and  acres of land you say because i run away now you have the un utterable meanness to ask me to return and be your miserable chattel or in lieu thereof send you  to enable you to re deem the lnd but not to redeem my poor brother and sister   appendix           if i were to send you money it would be to get my brother and sister and not that you should get land you say you are a cripple and doubtless you say it to stir my pity for you knew i was susceptible in that direction i do pity you from the bot tom of my heart nevertheless i am indignant beyond the pow er of words to express that you should be so sunken and cruel as to tear the hearts i love so much all in pieces that you should be willing to impale and crucify us out of all compassion for your poorfoot or leg wretched woman be it known to you that i value my freedom to say nothing of my mother brothers and sisters more than your whole body more indeed than my own life more than all the lives of all the slavehold ers and tyrants under heaven you say you have offers to buy me and that you shall sell me if i do not send you  and in the same breath and almost  in the same sentence you say  you know we raised you as we did our own children woman did you raise your own chil dren for the market did you raise them for the whippingpost did you raise them to be drove off in a coffie in chains where are my poor bleeding brothers and sisters can you tell who was it that sent them off into sugar and cotton fields to be kick ed and cuffed and whipped and to groan and die and where no kin can hear their groans or attend and sympathize at their dying bed or follow in their funeral wretched woman do you say you did not do it then i reply your husband did and you approved the deedand the very letter you sentme shows that your heart approves it all shame on you  but by the way where is your husband you dont speak of him i infer therefore that he is dead that he has gone to his great account with all his sins against my poor family upon his head poor man gone to meet the spirits of my poor out raged and murdered people in a world whert liberty and jus tice are masters but you say i am a thief because i took the old mare along with me have you got to learn that i had a better right to the         jw loguen old mare as you call her than manasseth logue had to me is it a greater sin for me to steal his horse than it was for him to rob my mothers cradle and steal me if he and you infer that i forfeit all my rights to you shall not i infer that you for feit all your rights to me have you got to learn that human rights are mutual and reciprocal and if you take my liberty and life you forfeit me your own liberty and life before god and high heaven is there a law for one man which is not law for every other man if you or any other speculator on my body and rights wish to know how i regard my rights they need but come here and lay their hands on me to enslave me did you think to terrify me by presenting the alternative to give my money to you or give my body to slavery then let me say to you that i meet the proposition with unutterable scorn and contempt the proposition is an outrage and an insult i will not budge one hairs breadth i will not breathe a shorter breath even to save me from your persecutions i stand among a free people who i thank god sympathize with my rights and the rights of man kind and if your emissaries and venders come here to re enslave me and escape the unshrinking vigor of my own right arm i trust my strong and brave

of b thurston and co portland a great fire is like a great battle in that each man knows only what he sees close about himselfand so in aftertimes a thousand different tales are told one episode in the history of the fatal night of the fourth of july  is recorded in these pages which i dedicate to the memory of the old homes of portland the story of muff muff is a cata great gray cat with broad white bosom and such dainty white gloves and slippers i saw him sitting this afternoon on the window seat beside his mistresss workbasket and i could scarcely believe the story they told me of his rescue after the great fire all smirched and scorched with smoke and cinders i need not tell you where he livedfor the terrible disaster which swept over the beautiful city of portland last fourth of july is only too well known his home was a large oldfashioned house on a quiet street shaded by noble elms the green yard in front had a broad walk that led up to the great steps where muff and the children had many a merry play alas that neither pets nor children shall cross that threshold more along the path the tall white summerlilies were in full budthe crimson clusterroses were just in their prime and the broad bed of fringed pinks was fresh and fragrant that illfated day indoors were large cool rooms lowceiled but deepwindowed hung round with old portraits and set about with spiderlegged tables and chairs the china closet was full of rare old treasures for captain vaughan sailed his own ship out of portland harbor for over thirty years and he never came home without remembering his wifes pride in her china the wide front entry led through the house to the garden door that opened on a long brick walk and a woodbine trellis there had once been a gay garden there but now the grass had grown round the rows of box only a standard pear one white rose tree and a bed of mignonette were left up stairs were tall presses with generous store of blankets and linen still left after the wellanswered calls of the sanitary commission the best chamber with cushioned chairs and curtained bed of spotless dimity stood ever ready for the welcome guest mothers roomthe sunniest of all bright with its gay chintz and its open fire on chill evenings had been to many sons and daughters a refuge and a delight beyond was the nursery the wellworn carpet showed the tread of little feet and the tall fender still barred the grate the old clock on the stairs ticked nigh upon its hundredth year and childrens children pattered up and down hither the captain had brought his bride half a century ago and thence his children had gone out one after another to new homes and thence latest of all the old captain himself full of years and honors was carried to his long home only grandmamma vaughan was left now with mary the youngest of the flock to wait year after year as the absent ones came back for the beauty and freshness of the summers in the dear old town this year the old house renewed its youth for rob and alice aged seven and five children of a son who like his father followed the sea were left in aunt marys charge while their mother accompanied her husband it was a quiet house but the children were always happy there kind old friends of grandmamma were often there and in many a summer twilight the fair faces of aunt marys young companions brightened the old parlor there were merry cousins at uncle jamess far up town who came on holiday afternoons to listen to grandmammas stories and race about the garden with muff it was a home and a household in no way remarkable but i have described it because it was like many and many another out of which on that awful night went women and children by the hundreds together leaving their all to the flames it had been a peaceful sort of day not much going on in the streets rob and alice had fired crackers and torpedoes on the brick walk all the morning too proud of muffs glossy coat to risk singeing it with the crackers they had peppered him with torpedoes till his nerves and his back could stand it no longer and he had retreated in utter discomfiture when the bells rang at noon uncle james came in and helped them fire their last bunch in a barrel with which grand fusillade they finished their celebration bration uncle james promised to return to take them to see the fireworksbut he added there is a strong south wind rising perhaps they will put off the show you do not feel it here in the shelter of the house but it blows hard and the clouds look as if more was coming so each went his wayaunt mary and alice to put on white dresses in honor of the day and rob to wash off the powderstains to be ready for the salmon and strawberries of the holiday dinner they had scarcely risen from table before aunt mary had to shut the front door and the parlor windows for the air was full of dust all the people who passed by were holding on to their hats or bonnets and looked as if they had almost lost their last breath in the wind but it was very pleasant in the old parlor all the vases were full of flowers and grandmamma sat in the great straightbacked chair and told them stories of fourth of july when she was a little girl meanwhile muff had betaken himself to his own abode in a little room over the summer kitchen muff was grandmammas special pet he had lived with her more than a dozen yearshad attended five of the family weddings and when the old captain died he refused to be comforted but sat all day at the door of the dead mans room waiting for the morning greeting to which he had been accustomed he had seen many generations of cats and dogs come and go among the neighbors and had come to be regarded as a sort of patriarcha guardian of the public peace waiting up stairs till the silence of the childrens voices told him the coast was clear he made his way down and set forth upon his daily rounds from which his curiosity as to what rob and alice were about had detained him muff was a favorite with his friends so that he was welcomed in the neighboring kitchens and sheds by both cook and cat it was only a step down the garden fence and round a post and then over the woodpile to a little window where he could peep in upon madame finette a pretty little blackandtan terrier i doubt if she was glad to see him that day for how could a mother with nine sons and daughters to take care of stop to entertain company so she showed her white teeth and growled a little at him and then curled down again beside her ratlike babies as much as to say not at home so muff went on through the clothesyard and down the garden up the back of the summerhouse to the top of the fence where he could look over to the back piazza of a little brown house where lived as alice reported after her first visit two such dear old ladies and such darling cats the darling cats three together were keeping fourth of july on the piazza round a saucer of custard which miss gratia wrenn had set out as their share of the holiday feast muff was welcome for did not he and old puss the grandmother of the group come in the same basket kittens together from newburyport years ago mistress conny short for contraband for she was black as black could be made room for him on the side where he could best see the gay cockade she wore in honor of the day the kittena little black slug rob called itit curled itself so round and flat on the floorslept quietly while the friends gossipped over their daintyheard muffs terrors of the morning and how miss horatia and miss gratia had slept never a wink all night for fear of being burnt up in their beds by those wicked firecrackers indoors dressed in their sunday best sat the two sisters aged and wrinkledfor had not miss horatia been carried from her cradle when the british burned falmouth but the wrinkles were the traces of smiles for theirs was a happy old age under the roof which had sheltered them for eighty years and odd miss horatia read the christian mirrror of the week while miss gratia took her afternoon nap in the rockingchair all the while the wind was rushing through the great horsechestnut that darkened the sittingroom till a wilder gust tore off a long branch of the grape vine and blew it with a crash across the windows waking miss gratia with a start and sending the frightened cats away off behind the currant bushes it must be past four thought muff so he trotted round to his own front yard not without stopping more than once for the blinding dust and flying leaves and reached the broad stonestep all strown with crimson and white petals from the cluster rose and the syringas just as the third parish bell rang out quick and sharp an alarm of fire aunt mary opened the front door to look out but the whirl of the wind left her no chance to see and she retreated only giving muff time to slip in when he was seized by rob and carried off to the nursery to enact with alice the part of audience for his fourth of july oration the bell soon stopped and the alarm seemed over only from the upper window they could see above the elms a column of smoke but so far off to the south that even grandma paid little heed presently norah obrien the cook came hurrying home mindful of the belated supper but oh miss mary sure and it was the big firethe big mill on the wharf and them old sheds and the foundryand it all began in that little boatshop this side bridget conovers my cousinand isnt it the good luck for bridget and the childer that their house is over beyont it else never a roof would they have to their heads this blessed night and sure and they say its the grate sugar house thatl burn yit and me and the women stood laughing at the old boathouse to see it smoke and niver thought to say fire the column of smoke grew broader and blacker the southerly gale swept it along in great masses almost over their heads people went hurrying by the neighbors were opening their scuttles to look out and pretty soon the black soot and cinders began to fall in the front yard but they had come so far the fire was out there could be no danger from a fire a mile away rob begged to go out and after much entreaty aunt mary consented and he set forth under norahs charge the passersby reported the sugar house burningthen it was up in york street then a neighbor returning home stopped to say the fire was breaking through into cross street it was very dreadful but they must be thankful they were safe no doubt it must cross the city but it could not come below the first parish church at farthest then grandma and aunt mary waited and watched while the gray light of the cloudy day changed not to twilight or darkness but to a lurid glare the great elm branches tossed to and fro against the crimson sky and threw ghastly shadows across the street and garden rob and norah came home half frightened half wild with the strange excitement middle street rob said was all full of chairs and kitchen things and a piano on the sidewalk and carpets in the dirt and they saw an irishman carrying his pig and a woman carrying a barrel of flourand oh aunt mary one poor little boy was fast asleep right on the hard bricks in middle street at this alice burst out crying so pitifully that for a few minutes all were busy in consoling her with assurances that she was safe and should go to sleep in her own little bed whither she accordingly went with muff in her arms for a comforter muff himself had by this time discovered something amiss and was willing enough to get out of sight on the dark side of the house if aught could be dark under that fiery sky the old clock on the stairs struck nine aunt mary listened from force of habit for the nine oclock bell and then was for the first time conscious that the distant roar had come nearer some sounds were separating themselves and assuming distinctness could that be the crash of falling walls or that explosion like a cannon the blowing up of houses was that awful flame coming nearer would it sweep over themand with a sudden throb of terror her heart stood still as she thought of herself alone with her aged mother the sleeping child the helpless boy where oh where was her brother but almost with the thought she heard his step in the lower entry and sprang to meet him oh whatwherewas all she could say still under the spell of the first conception of the possibility of danger not here yet were his reassuring words it must take the heart of the city now for it is almost upon middle street when i left my office it was coming up union street as fast as a man could walkbut the customhouse must stop itit cant pass there it was like a charge of cavalry on the street we have saved almost everything but many a man has lost his all thank god this dear old home is still safeas mary recovered her presence of mind and could smile again dont let mother be frightened i must not stop now for every man is needed and worn and tired as he looked he turned to go but pausing on the step an instant he came back sayingbut at any rate i will take no it is foolish the fire certainly will stop yet perhaps it may be best i will take fathers portrait but dont let mother know it and mary do you remember the old canvass firebags that were grandfathers up in the north attic should you be afraid to look for themif and the mans voice quivered one instant for that was the home of all their lifethey might be useful you know but at any rate be sure i will come back no thought of fear for her now the something to do gave her as it did many another weak woman in that scene of dismay the strength and courage of heroes sure that her mother who sat watching the sleeping alice was still secure from alarm she called rob to hold her lamp in another moment she was pulling the old bags out of the corner where she had often wondered at them when a child as the remains of some dark age when fireengines were not and neighbors had far to come to drag them down the narrow stairs to her own room was an easy taskbut how to tell her mother of the need upon them robs quick impulse had been before her grandma grandma come help us pack the big bags and cant we put muff in so he will be safe mary my child in her own soft voice was all the old lady said as she met her daughter but on her placid face there came a smilethough mary thought not of it then nor remembered it till long after and then with sorrowful weepingas if with the summons thus to give up the home of her youth the shelter of her age there was sent a vision of the house not made with hands to which she stood so near mary drew up the curtain to look again at the sky it was no longer smoke and light but the shooting flashing flames rose over the elms in purple and crimson carts and wagons loaded with household stuff were hurrying by lights were flitting about the upper rooms of the neighboring houses the alarm was spreading it could no longer be concealedthe fire had passed the utmost bound of their foreboding still that pitiless wind rattled the windowpane scant time had they to choose what of the household gods to carry with them out of the burning city it might be minutes onlyto decide among the relics of a lifetime where every shelf had its recollection and every drawer its memory miniatures the family bible and silver the quaint old heirlooms of more than a century with what clothing would fill the bags was all they could hope to saveand again the sense of loneliness almost overpowered mary as she sought for warm shawls to protect her mother and alice on their midnight walk if go they must rob watched by alice his little heart swelling within himwould nobody come to help themwhen patricks house was burned up on the hill there were hundreds there and they pulled everything out wont anybody come to save papas books and grandpas secretary alas alas long ere this some of the strongest had lain down in utter exhaustion thousands of hands and feet could not have done the work that was needed that night on came the awful blast merciless remorseless overleaping overlapping sweeping through busy street and quiet lane rolling over roof and spire sparing neither the delights of home nor the sanctities of the church the relics of the dead nor the treasures of the living the memories of age nor the hopes of youth the venerable blind the helpless invalid who could not so much as venture her foot to the ground for delicateness the dead child from its coffin the newborn babe from its cradle must all alike forth into the night at a command more terrible than deaths mr vaughan on leaving the old house had lost no time in searching for some sort of carriage to remove his mother as every moment made the completeness of the impending disaster more apparent but everything of the sort had long since been seized upon for the earlier removals his own horse had been lent before night and was nowhere to be found the hours seemed days in his search and flakes of fire were falling in the garden as he drove up to the back gate with a little light wagon a countryman had just come to town in it would take his mother at least great was his relief to find standing in the kitchen a broadshouldered irishman whom norah presented as a cousin of mine sir coming in to look for his friend he had rendered vital service in putting out the fire which had caught on the top of the shed and now waited to aid in the departure norah who had been alternately lamenting the weeks wash all lying so swate and clean in the baskets up stairs and the iligant dishes the old captain had brought from over the say was wrapping ping up a loaf of bread for sorry a bit of bread therell be in the town the morn with all of us burnt up alive and wasnt it meself that saw the big flour mill all tumbling down with the fire mrs vaughan and her daughter stood ready if that could be readiness which had no preparation in the diningroom where the light was least vivid that alice might not be frightened for the moment their chief care was poor muff he had crept away from grandmamma and alice at the first alarm had startled aunt mary and rob in their search for the bags by his glowing eyes behind the chimneyhad trotted in and out in a curious sort of disturbance as the packing went on occasionally stopping to rub his head against his mistress but when as they closed the last bag rob returning to his first thought said but you havent put in muff the cat was missing to desert him was cruel hastily calling him through all the rooms they were abont to give up the search as hopeless when rob discovered him his ears crested and his eyes shining in the firelight behind the curtain on the window sill in the upper front entry where he had often hidden when tired of the childrens play rob captured him and he was now securely shut up in the china closet their council was hurried mr vaughan hoped to have time to return after taking his mother and alice to his own house if not at the worst aunt mary and rob could walk safely with norah and dennis crogan or stay if alice could walk he could save willys picturewee willy his mothers firstborn gone safe to heaven five and forty years before norah was ready to carry miss alice to the worlds end and at any rate he should meet them before they had gone far if it seemed unsafe to wait the little wagon patched and frail at the best could only take himself and his mother with the most precious of the bagsand by leaving alice the portrait crogan would drag another bag with norah to help the other two must be left but muff knotting his handkerchief firmly over the cats head and front paws mr vaughan found he was so far helpless as to make it possible perhaps for rob a strong boy of his age to carry him at least out of the range of the fire mary had reserved her writing desk for her own hands thus ordered they opened the front door to set forth but shrank back in terror at the sight before them all the air was filled with sparks of fire like a whirlwind of fastfalling snow above them the street was all aglow escape that way was impossible they must go far round as it was by the lower street through which mr vaughan had come to the garden gate still that relentless wind fanned the hot fury of the devouring flame the brazen knocker clanged as mr vaughan forced to the door with all his strength and the rusty key grated in the huge lock as mary turned it with a thought it may not burn yet i will at least lock out robbers the others hurried on but she lingered for a moment at the parlor door except the two portraits nothing had been moved not a book or flower since the happy morning the music lay on the piano her work on the table felix holt and our young folks on the sofa she thought of the white spare chamber all ready for the expected summer guestsher mothers room the sanctuary of the housethe dear old nurserythe rooms of her brothers and sistersher own shady windows far up among the elmbranches and her heart grew faint in the agony of longing to see them once more the old clock on the stairs struck twelve forevernever neverforever mary mary called her brother are you wild the church is all on fire you are lost if you stay taking alices hand she went out and the garden door locked itself behind her and she stoodhomeless yet with that keenness of sense by which the brain in moments of terror and peril notes even trifles she caught the scent of the mignonette as they crossed the old garden and knew that on the white rosebush the first bud which she and alice had watched since sunday had opened since noon oh flowers that never will in other climates grow was even eden dearer than the home she was leaving with the flaming sword descending upon it the gate opened upon a lane through which the way was easy though the breath of the swiftcoming destroyer was hot upon their cheeks at the little brown house the sittingroom shutters were flung wide the lamp burned alone on the table but the front door was openthe sisters were gone once upon the street their progress was more difficult here there was still hope an engine was at work on the corner men were on the roofs and even a woman lashed by a rope to a chimney stood throwing water the sidewalk was covered with motley pilessome twice thrice nay seven times removed to be burned at last anxious faces looked out of the doorways pleading voices asked in vain for help over all was the deep hoarse roar of the fire like the distant rush and roll of angry surf bending their heads before the blinding light they made their way past two or three squares till rob could no longer hold muff in the pitiful ignorance which prevents dumb animals from knowing their best friends the poor cat was struggling to escape from his courageous little deliverer aunt mary offered to take him though that involved the sacrifice of her precious desk for crogan and norah were already overburdened no no said rob put the desk on my head and ill carry it as the little negroes in cousin georges camp carried the water pails so the exchange was made though not without frantic efforts to escape on muffs part and a sad scratching of aunt marys arms for she still wore the thin white muslin of the summer noon hardly had they resumed their walk when they were startled by a scream of terror behind them two little girls had been following them carrying some light clothing in their arms one of them was protected by a waterproof cloak but the bundle of the younger had taken fire from the thickfalling sparks she had dropped it upon the sidewalk and the two were trying to stifle the flame which had spread to the childs own dress crogan sprang to her and grasping her in his arms extinguished the fire before the child was really hurt miss vaughan asked their names and whither they were going they scarcely knew father was gone to sea mother was sick they thought she would be burnt in her bedbut some men came and took her in a blanket they laid her on the sidewalk first they did not know where she was now a cousin lived down on the dump they wanted to go there come with us now said miss vaughan and then mr crogan shall take you to your friend the little dresses all the child had left in the world were by this time almost burned up and the fragments were blowing off across the street right over them towards the path of the fire bounded a little dark figureand aunt mary bethought herself that in her start of horror at the childs instant danger she had forgotten the strong clasp necessary to hold muff and he had sprang from her arms a stinging pain in her right hand and the fasttrickling blood showed how resolute had been the struggle by which the poor pet had freed himself from the handkerchief that bound him rob and alice began to cry but there was no help for itmuff was gone right back towards his homegone to certain death no words can tell how weary was the way along that noble shaded street through which the children had laughed and played on many a summer morning at last they were beyond the range of the flames and sat down to rest on a low stone wall here crogan proposed to leave the bag behind the wall and to carry rob the rest of the way why dont uncle james come had been the boys sorrowful question again and again it was more than a long hour since they started he should have met them long since a gentleman passed them looking anxiously right and left uncle james screamed aliceand as much to his own as to his sisters relief he stood beside them he had taken his mother safely home but returning a loaded dray furiously driven against the little wagon had totally wrecked it he had escaped himself strange to say unhurt though almost stunned by the collision and had been seeking them along the streets the addition of the little girls to the group had prevented his recognizing them in the strange firelight rob took heart again on his uncles reappearance and insisted upon walking the rest of the way so crogan departed with the little girls promising to return and see the bag safe in xstreet before morning sadly they went on their way distance gave some relief to their dazzled eyes and aunt mary and rob could give some heed to uncle jamess hurried account it was a clean sweep from the sugar house to munjoynothing left would this horrible night never end but ohthe morning what sorrow it would see and ohthe trees the trees said aunt mary as they turned down state street the dear old elmsand a shiver of loneliness and desolation passed over her as she looked up to the familiar windows of happy homesalas herselfhomeless no more the household fire the evening lamp for her the church clock hard by struck two as they reached her brothers doorbut long ere that the old home the elms the roses were wrapped in a sheet of flame all night long the wrathful tempest never stopped nor stayed up in the graveyard beside the dead all night sat frightened women and children with dim strained eyes fighting the fire in the dry grass while close upon them among the outer rows of graves it scorched and scathed and smouldered till the very gravemounds charred and crumbled to dust the old slatestones cracked and shivered to splinters and the thick marble bent in the glowing heat the broad july sun came up upon smoking ruins and thousands of homeless the young children ask bread and no man breaketh it to them they that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets how is the city of praise not left the city of my joy o vine of sibmah i will weep for thee the spoiler hath fallen upon thy summer fruits and thy vintage yet in all those crowds they say it who saw it was not a murmur or complaint patient courage and resolute hope braced every soul nor was help far off wherever fire was still the useful domestic sprite not the terrible destroying demon of the night kind hands were busy all over the land generous hearts were stirred at the tale of sorrow by noon loaded trains were speeding from east and from west god bless the hearts and hands that sprang so instantly to our relief in that hour of bitter need the next day grandmamma and aunt mary were too exhausted to think much or remember one and another came and went with sorrowful sympathy rob and alice talked of lost balls and hoops but most of all mourned for poor muff cousin charles went out to carry soup and came with stories to make ones heart ache the great schoolyard was full of hungry tired women and children men were asleep on the sidewalks and doorsteps down town was all heat and smoke and burning cellars the car rails were like twisted serpents along the streets his shoes were crisped with walking over the hot sidewalks with evening came uncle john from boston it seemed a little gleam of light in the gloom that was gathering round them for a deep darkness was falling on all the city the street lamps could not be lighted and the smouldering fires among the ruins only made the shadows more gloomy within doors were only dim candles or old lamps hunted out from odd corners there were rumors of wild rough men about the streets waiting for midnight to do their deeds of violence each man must guard his own that night will any one ever forget how thankful was that once peaceful city for the protection of the soldiers late the next afternoon the two brothers sought the old home silently with full hearts they walked down the desolate streets where no sign nor trace of human life was left in one brief night the storms of centuries had swept by white and hoar the ruins lay like the dead cities of long ago above them rose the treesgaunt stark skeletonsthe branches that waved in the light and greenness and beauty of summer now stretched stiff and straight northward in piteous appeal from their doomdumb witnesses of death against the blast that overwhelmed them who can speak the thoughts of the brothers as they stopped in the wellknown street something more than half the front wall of the old house was left so that the afternoon sky stared blankly upon them through the windows of mothers room out of which they had looked their first on life oppressed by the dreariness and hopelessness of the scene they turned to cross the yard to pick up a few fragments as mementoes when something crept round the corner of the house the brothers almost held their breath as it came very slowly very softly over the heaps of broken brick to the broad doorstep it was muff himself yet how changed his look ow altered his mienhis glossy coat all rent and torn his white gloves and slippers all black and scorched and one forefoot he scarcely touched to the ground as he walked through what terrors untold had not the poor fellow cometerrors of blinding light and drifting smokeof burning heat and of deep darknessof hurrying crowdsand of lonesome streetsled by the strange instinct that bound him to his homecome to find at last that home a ruin he paused on the broad stone as if he knew his playgroundthen resting his forepaw on the sill stretched his neck to look through he drew back then looked again then up over his head at the familiar doorwaythen smelt of the stone then gave another long look over the sill to the right and to the left then slowly turned perplexed and baffled by the strange sight before him mr james vaughan caught him in his arms before he left the step in great thankfulness to save the household pet alive for they had seen that on their way through the garden of the little brown house of which i should not like to tell you only no one ever saw old puss nor her daughter nor the little black slug any more poor madame finette was carried away by her master with her nine sons and daughters but she escaped and ran back to her bed and though twice rescued again perished at last very tenderly they carried the dear old cat to x street to be nursed by aunt mary and the children and the first tears that grandmamma shed after the fire were when uncle james laid muff all smutty and dusty as he was in her arms in the end of the summer the childrens father and mother came for them when octobers leaves were brightest aunt mary took muff to a new home which the tenderest love had been preparing for her the hopes of youth may bloom again

ill the month of july in the year  president lincoln had issued an order to have miore men drafted for the union army in a certain town in connecticut the inhabitants were in great excitement the order had been received that on a specified day the drafting must commence thougji a small place it had already con tributed largely considering the number of inhabitnts for the war widows had bid farewell to only sons their chief support  wives had partecd with cheerful and patriotic spirits from tell endeared husband and father brothers had left their sisters to go out tand face the dangers of the battlefield and to be exposed to the trials and temptations of a life in the army lovers hadll parted with their aftianced not knowing whether they should eveer meet again to fulfil their mutual vows all this had transpired in the small but prosperous village of a     within the space of two years and that many had fallen upon the battlefield and died from disease the sad countenances and mourning dress of many as they assembled inside of the churchl every sabbath told the sad tale but the end had not yet come and now the decree from the seat of government had gone forth again demanding more men if there were not enough to volun teer then they must be compelled to fight by being drafted as might be expected everybody in the village was in the great est excitement and ainong the most anxious were three families each of which had contributed a member to the war one was mrs mann a widow she had been left in early life withi two sons and a daughter to educate mr mann who was much older than his wife htd accumulated a large fortune and had retired from business and purchased a charming residence in this beautiful town in the valley of the connecticut hoping to pass the remainder of his life in the quiet enjoyment of his beloved young wifo and three           the armless sleeve interesting children but a few years previous to the war adversity had fallen upon the happy family mr mann had trusted one whom he supposed to be a friend to a very large amount had endorsed notes for him and in return mr cushing hald forged mr manns name to such a great extent that when the liabilities were all paid up he found h h had but ta very small income left but the chlmtin ing home having previously been deeded overt to mrs mann was saved from the generral ruin the disappointment and loss were greater than mr mann could bear  he died soon after from illness of only a few days after his death mrs mann leasted the manasion and retired with her limited income to a small cottage and devoted hler time to the education of her children george the eldest had for soime time been employed iu a stotre in new haven and came homle every night william alt eighteen had reslpolnded to the call of his country this hadc been ta gereat trial to his mother and had caused her malny anxiouls hours but she felt it to be her duty to give him up to the cause of liberty the was now just cwing into womanhooda beautiful high spirited creature full of patriotism who often wished she belonged to the sterner sex that she might go forth and if need be shed her blood in her countrys behalf mr wilson once an intimate friend of mr manns had always taken a deep interest in the children of his lamented associate they had grown up together like brothers and sisters tillie and maggie were almost inseparable harry wilson was one year older than william mann and had also joined the first regiment that went from the town of a  albert the eldest son of mr wilson was studying law in the city of new york and charles was still at home he being olly fif teen but would talk constantly of going into the army if under no other capacity he would go as a drummer boy but this did not trouble mr wilson much the other family mentioned was the ministers mr carter james clarence and bertha were respectively about the same ages as mrs manns children james carter had joined the regiment at the same time with harry wilson and william mann they had been in the army nearly two years and thus far their parents had no cause to regret having consented to their volunteering their services   the armless sleeve           chapter  the day for drafting in the village arrived and none but thoso who had members of their family old enough to go into the army knew the anxiety of that memorable day it can never be forgotten george mann that night on his way from the depot to his house was told he was one of the numlll r drafted his heart sank within him as he approached his homle he had that day been promoted in the store where he had been employed since he was sixteen years of age and during his journey home he had been picturing to him self how much he would do for his mother and sister inld evecn cau t himself dreaming of the day when lhe should be able to live once more in the old mansion when george reached his home he tried to appear cheery but his watchful mother saw the cloud upon his usually placid counte ance and exclaimed as he entered what is the matter george are you drafted tell me quick i am mother  i just heard of it oh my god must i give ztlother on for this cruel war i cannot oh i cannot god save me from this great trial george and tillie tried to console her but like rachel of holy record she refused to be comforted prayer was her only re fuge it was a sad household that night even maggie with all her putriotism could not feel as if she was called upon to part with her only protector she argued william has gone  why is not that enough george returned to the store the next day and when his employers heard that he was drafted they said he should never go  they could not part with such an efficient clerk and he must get asubstitute that night while the little family circle were talking over the matter george said to his mother  my darling mother dont feel so troubled  it makes the trial harder for me to bear when i see you take it so much to heart i see no alternative but i must go i am not able to provide a substitute i am sorry to leave mr harwood just as i  am promoted too i had expected to do so           the armless sleeve much for your comfort but never mind  tiliie wili take care of you perhaps the war wont last much longer and then we will all settle down again just at this moment thoro was a knock at the door and albert wilson and maggie entered where is george exclaimed albert hurrah for the army suzy my good fellow so you are drafted i hear i have just come from new york anmd as i stepped out of the cars the first thing i heard was that george mann and clarence carter were drafted and the very fellow that wanted to leave his old musty books for a while and have a little dig at the rebs must be left out now george my boy i want to take your place and father has given his consent oh no albert i will never hear of such a thing said george but you must listen father has charlie left and your mother has no son if you go i have a father too to leave with mother and there is malaggie i know she would rather i would go wouldnt you puss i shant say said lmaggie for i think it is too bad to draft any way let the people volunteer now george said albert laying all joking aside i am going whether or no i had made up my mind to volunteer and came home to talk to father about it and when i heard you was drafted that settled me i determined instead of going as a volun teer i would be your substitute what does your mother say about it said mrs mann she does not like it much but i tell her she has knit grey stockings and prepared lint enough for the soldiers to insure my success and safe return for she has done nothing else since the war broke out i cannot be so selfish albert as to have you sacrifice your life for my son said mrs mann now mrs mann you neednt say one word raore i go in georges place so that is settled tillie sat by with a tearful eye and beating heart of the two she did not know which would be the most severe trial to part with for her mothers sake she knew georges going would be the great est trial she had been engaged to albert for only a few months   the armless sleeve and now it seemed as if her cup of happiness had been taken from her forever after albert and maggie had gone tillie hasstened to her room and gave vent to her feelings in the following manner why oh why am i doomed to choose between two evils i must either part with my dear dear brother george or bid farewellperhaps foreverto my own cherished albert how can i oh how can i part with you my darling loved one god in mercy help me to bear this terrible trial just as the sunlight of prosperity is datwn ing upon us we must be separated now that albert has completed his studies and is soon to be admitted at the bart with such flatter ing prospects he must leave his brilliant anticipations and offer himself a sacrifice upon the altar of his country oh albert dear albert you are too good too noble to be thus sacrificed you are truly one of natures noblemen must i give you up i thought i loved my country and i do but not enough to cast all my hopes of future happiness at her feet i must not let mother or george see what i suffer i will try to gain strength from the true source of comfort she knelt down and offered up a fervent petition for sub mission and sustaining power to bear this her first great trial when she arose from prayer she felt comforted and mide prepartations for retiring but it was not until the dawning of day that her troubled mind found repose in the oblivion of that great irestorer sleep she awoke unusually late and did not reach the breakfast rooml until after george had gone to his place of business so he fortunately did not see the traces of unusual suffering upon his sisteis counte nance and before he returned at night tillie had her feelings under such control that she seemed like her own cheerful self again in the course of the day albert called to see tillie he was so full of genuine patriotism and appeared so happy at the prospect of fight ing in his countrys behalf that tillie was almost ashamed to let him know what she suffered at the thought of parting with him and although he saw with what fortitude she endeavored to be cheerful and conceal her true feelings from him he manfully controled his struggle within his own breast and talked hopefully of the future           the armless sleeve chapter iii wtrhe mr iarwood heard of the good fortune of george in ob taining a substitute so easily he wrote a congratulatory letterto mrs mann and itcreaed georges salary but the happy mothloler did not know how to receive the congratulation on one lhand sloe had her son fstill with her  and  fle o te ter

sachusetts and connecticut regiments then stationed at a harry wwilson had fa few weeks previous been proimoted to first lieu tenant and james carter to second lieutenant of their company they had heard nothing of their brothers having been drafted and their surprise can better be imagined than described when the intelligence came that a company from their native village would join them soon their number had been sadly diminished by dis ease and skirmishes but little did our heroes think they were so soon to see their own brothers fresh from their beloved homes harry my boy how are you said albert as he came unper ceived towards harry who was giving some orders to his men  how came you by thiat stripe upon your rhqliler harry started at the familiar voice why alley where did you come from home to be sure i thought i would take a run down here and help you fight the rebs how are you getting along oh firstrate we have had some pletty hot times since i left home   the armless sleeve            but they had not much time to speak about home for the order came to be on the march clarence carter saw his brother for a few moments and had only time to give the precious mementoes sent to william and james from the beloved ones at hiome when they were separated some of them to pass through untold suffering before they met again with cheerful alacrity the regiments moved on hoping soon to hear the notes of victory reverberate through the coutry  but they were doomed to many disappointmcents before therea t rebel lion wats quelled albert and clarence were obliged

clashing of arms are over and nothing is heard but the sighs and groans of the wounded and dying the clear cold moon looked down upon the field of carnage on the night after the terrible battle of c  there lay the dead and dying promiscuously thrown together two young officers were seen going carefully through the field of carnage said one i am sure i saw albert fall i was off at a distance when his regiment marched up to recruit and i saw alberts tall form rising above all the rest just as that deadly charge was made upon our troops bus when the smoke cleared away i saw nothing more of him oh harry i hope you are deceived i hope he has not fallen he is too noble to perish in this manner let us search thoroughly before we leave so these two young officers went on their sad way seeking their lost brother and friend james little thinking his brother too was one of the number just then they heard a groan they followed the sound and found a wounded man so situated in the midst of the helpless dead that he could not move water water he faintly said and as with some difficulty james carter succeeded in lifting him from underneath the inanimate mass of human bodies the man fainted harry harry come quick i fear we are too late i fear he is dead he called for water harry hastened to the spot  and as they took him out and car ried him to a clear space in the field james took his head upon his knee while harry taking some water from his canteen wet his handkerchief to bathe the disfigured face and as they removed the blood and dirt from his face james exclaimed  my gracious harry its clarence and sure enough it was his brother who had fallen in his first battle   the armless sleeve           i after a long time and much exertion they succeeded in restoring anilmation and although clarence was suffering great agony he told them to leave him and go find albert for they were side by side when he fell so james took off his overcoat and folding it up placed it under clarences head and went to look for albert and after searching for a long time found hilm apparently lifeless they brought him to the place where clarence lay and james stayed by then while harry went to obtain assistance and as day was dawning he returned in an ambulance albert in the meantime having shown symptoms of life they were gently placed by their affectionate brothers into the ambulance and taken to an hospital but james and harry were permlitted to remain only long enough to see that there was a surgeon to attend to their wounds it was with sad hearts that harry and james were obliged to move with their regimuents but as soon as practicable their wounded brothers were talken to the hospital at washington           the armless sleeve chapter v as soon as the news reached the homes of our heroes mr wil son and mr carter declared their intention of going immediately to washington bertha carter begged her father to let her ac company him he reluctantly consented and after she secured his consent she ran to tell tillie she was going and she would take any thing she wished to send albert and her brother william i will go too said tillie your brother and mother wont let you go i fear oh yes they will did not albert go in georges place it is my duty and i will go and stay with albert until he cmln be brought home i will run and ask mother now she must and will let me go mrs iua told tillie to wait until george came home that night and if p was willing she would not object when gaeorge came home tillie was at the depot to meet him and using all of her persuavsive powers she igailned his consent before they reached home h isy plep iatio s v w se clnseinently mde for their journey and on the s ond day afterl tihe news was received the party were on their wayv to wtsiaell  lgton ladn with wines jellies lint and every thing repint to alleviate the saturilogs of theo sick and wounded nothing of iltorocst occurred during the journey the cars did not move half fast enough and they stopped too long at the various stations or impatietnt travelers thought they arrived at washington two days after albert had gone through the operation of having his left arm amputated and clar ence his right arm  they were too low to see their parents or to have any conversation but when they were asleep tillie and bertha were allowed to sit by them and watch them it was a trying time for our heroines but they weare sustained by the hope that by good nursing the wounded sufferers would recover and   so they did in a few days they were able to converse and as soon as it was thought prudent they were carefully removed to their respective homes   the armless sleeve           while albert and clarence were suffering in the lospital wil liam james and harry were limoving from place to place engaged in skirmishes and battles at length william mann was reported killed and when the news reacheld mrs mann she was very much overcome but did not murmur for she felt how gently god had dealt with her it made her love albert more than ever to think that through his selfsacrifice she had been spared the affliction of perhaps losing two sons finally peace was deilared the few that were left returned to their respective homes harry and james  hald been through many battles but had escaped unharmed it was a imd day to mrs mann when they returned to klnow that her william was the only one lost out of her circle of friends albert had odlred to release tillie from her engagement on account as he said of his bein a onearmed fellow but she would not listen to it  ihe loved him and his arnmless sleeve as she called it with all the devotion her ardent nature possessed because le h had lost his arm by his own sacrifice clarence was to marry maggie and george bertha they had decided to be married in church and mr carter was to perform the ceremony there was to be a triple wedldingr and of course in a country village it caused great excitement after the ceremony the whole party were to go to mrs manns mansion for george had becolue a partner in mr harwoods firm and ho had prepared the mansion unknown to mrs mann for her reception on his wedding day where a collation was to be prepared it was to be a quiet affair  no dancing on account of mrs manns loss and affliction the day at length arrived the happy party had entered the church the spectators had also crowded into the aisles to witness the novel ceremony of marrying three couples at one time when a carriage drove up to the door and an emaciated soldier so weak that he could not walk without the assistance of a gentleman who was with him entered the church and sank almost fainting into a seat near the door and there he remained until the ceremony was over and the party had left the church then he returned to the carriage and followed the bridal party to mrs manns it was with great difficulty that the soldier could command strength enough to enter the house but when he did he advanced          the armless sleeve with faltering steps towards mrs mann and fainted at her feet it did not take mrs mann long to recognize the emaciated sol dier for it wits her son william who had been almost starved in the libby prison and when he was liberated he was so reduced both in mind and body that he had been laying in an hospital ever since the war his life part of the time hanging by a thread he preferred to take his friends by surprise and as he left the cars he heard the people talking about the triple wedding so he ordered the carriage to go right to the church he did not realize how weak he was until he saw the hippy group and recognized his mother when william recovered from his faint they all gathered around him to hear his story but as he was too welak to talk much his friend mr campbell told the story of suffering which william had passed through it seemed too incredible but the wan emaci ated form told the tale after some time as william was reclining upon the sofa albert came up to him with tillie leaning upon his arm looking as bright and beautiful as a june rose and said  well william after all you are s thin one thing you have which clarence and i have not and that is two arms what do you think of maggie and tillie being willing to marry two armless sleeves i think said william if they had gone through what you have they woaul be glad to have some one to take care of them william said tillie  did you know that albert went to the war as georges substitute indeed i did not albert you are doubly dear to me only think of your suffering so much from your sacrificing yourself for another and that my brother how can we ever repty yol i think i am more than repaid when i can call this dear one mine said albert as he pressed tillie to his heart what do i care if this sleeve is empty so long as the heart is so noble said tillie now stop tillie no flattery on our wedding day come said william who was just recovering his animation we have had a triple wedding let us have a triple dance to cele brate this joyful event   the armless sleeve           can you bear the noise and confusion of a dance william dear replied mrs mann yes mother the sight of you all has made me feel almost well my friend mr carmpbell will play i think we ought to have a merrly time come take your partners mr wilson took mrs mann  the three joyful grooms took their brides and they had a merry dance the hours quickly passed and then the merry party bade their friends adicu and left home for a wedding tour while william re mained at home to be nursed by his happy mother  and she was re wardedl for by kind care and gentle nursing he soon recovered his strength and after a few months was able to attend to business mr harwood in time retired from the filmn and gcorge and william carried on the concern the residents of a    will long remember the excitement that the triple wedding created together with the unexpected return of one

carrie lee she had been three years an orphan and during that time by her own exertions had supported her little brother and sister and although she boasted no higher birthplace than one of the cottage homes of america far would it have been from the nicest exquisite to couple with her the awkward manners and rustic complexion of the country lass nor did the graces of her person excel those of her mind or so the fates willed it that an uncle of her mother wealthy and a bachelor wanting sadly something to love and cherish had resolved to make her his pet and insisted on placing her at one of the best educational institutions in the land here she passed the brightest days of her life improving her advantages to the full until her seventeenth birthday passed then she first realized that her rations of sorrow had heretofore been withheld from her the sudden death of her mother followed lowed almost immediately by that of her father recalled her from a life of pleasure to one of exertion it was a sad blow for poor carrie but she became a woman under it and acted so heroically as to win golden opinions from uncle jacob and proved to him that he had not chosen his favorite unwisely but she had not heard all on the settlement of her fathers affairs she found herself almost penniless only one thing remained to her and her heart clung to this for the sake of its former owner it was a piece of ground the prettiest site in the village and had been her mothers and which was known by the name of wild cherry place what had given it its name no one could tell certainly it was not the old elm trees that were scattered so unsparingly over it as carrie glanced over the beautiful place and felt that every tree and nook and rock was linked with memories of the dead she resolved that nothing but the greatest necessity should tempt her to relinquish it and at the same time she likewise determined to refuse those kind offers of aunts and uncles to take charge of the younger children and nobly to depend on her own exertions  carrie had a secret talisman that she was thinking of all this while and relying upon its aid to carry out her determination what was it fair reader you shall see but to relate things as they happened go back to a pleasant afternoon in carries pleasant parlor it was circle afternoon and carrie was always sure of a large number for she was the fosterchild of the village and there was not a good lady there who did not secretly think that all her carries success was owing to her private counsel and aid why hadnt mrs seamer shown her her own favorite way of darning and mrs tuft given her herbs from her own choice collection hadnt mrs skimpton advised the arrangement of the kitchen and mrs whitten that of her parlor while miss tracy had daily advertised to her all the gossiping afloat and carrie dear creature with that admirable tact that belongs only to woman had managed to obey in everything and in nothing to suit everybody and please herself but we are wandering a goodly number had assembled at the sewing circle and after the confusion of finding and fitting work sorting thread and selecting needles the conversation flowed in the usual current that is those present talking of those who are not at length in a pause favorable to her purpose katy remington who never went to circle except when it met at carries springing up and gaining possession of a vacant seat near carrie exclaimed now carrie dear if you have a single spark of mercy in your nature i beg you to give me your secret do tell me in what way you have contrived to become such a perfect pattern to all young people who have the misfortune to belong to the same generation  come tell me before i die of envy carrie laughed heartily although kates rattlebrained entreaties were not new to her and declared there was neither any secret nor anything wonderful about it must i give up said kate in a tone of mock despair why i must tell you she added addressing her young companions i thought i would just bear in mind the number of times in a week that carrie lee was set forth to me as a model and what do you think why only on the third day my poor brain got so bewildered with their multiplicity that i was forced to give it up to avoid monomania or some other dreadful thing and now i have been listening to such an enumeration of virtues every word of which although it only counts one when added to carries praises detracts tenfold from ours and i appeal to you all is it fair that she should keep this wonderful witchery all to herself hereupon carrie was assailed by numerous voices all clamorous for her secret until suddenly one exclaimed to uncle jacob who was on a visit from the city oh mr harris do you just tell us how carrie manages so nicely indeed i think it is her duty to let at least fanny into the secret she added glancing archly at a friend near a bride of two weeks well really said old uncle jacob laughing its just what ive been often puzzled about myself carrie tells me she has a powerful talisman that aids her but what that is is more than i can find out a talisman a talisman echoed several voices come come carrie if you have got any egerias hid down in that delightful wild cherry place let us all have the benefit of it oh uncle jacob began carrie not knowing what to say but she was relieved from her embarrassment by the sudden and flurried entrance of miss tracy every one knew when she arrived they might expect to hear the latest bit of news out but to the numerous inquiries why she was so late she maintained a steady reserve until divested of her numerous wrappers and overshoes then seating herself in a very consequential way she began well where do you think ive been and being answered only by a profound silence she continued well youve all heard whats been said about the churchills them folks thats just moved from the city into the house across the road from ours they say twas on account of his wifes health but deara me if she thinks shes goin to get strong doin as shes doin shes mistaken thats all ive got to say why only yesterday janet told me she believed mrs churchill didnt go into the kitchen from one week to another and the waste there miss tracy was nearly overcome have you been in inquired several voices well said miss tracy reviving ive seen their hired man go to the postoffice almost every day and fetch back lots of letters and papers and what looked to me like magazines so to day when i saw him bring home a bigger bundle than usual i thought id jest run in an satisfy myself once for all so i went in and the man at the door took me right into the room where they were setting and what do you think i saw why all three of them mother and girls were reading them magazines and more n all they didnt seem one mite ashamed to be caught so and the girls didnt even lay down their hooks but kept twirling the leaves in their fingers all the time my eye caught the name of one of them and that was enough for me i come away what was it inquired several in breathless attention what do you think godeys ladys book and miss tracy having thus triumphantly delivered herself settled down in her chair and seemed much relieved godeys ladys book the very best part of the day spent in reading and such reading were exclamations heard on all sides from the good dames and which were followed by a general denunciation of all magazine publications in which the book having the largest circulation came in for the largest share then came a long list of accidents and disasters occasioned by their reading and a grave homily on the corruption of the present age which would support such concerns no doubt all this was intended indirectly to inspire all the young people with gratitude that they were under a supervision wise enough to protect them from such calamities suddenly uncle jacob exclaimed by the way carrie what did you want of godeys ladys book which you told me you would rather i would give you than anything else now you must know that during all this discussion carrie had not said a word but had sat quite still only now and then a quiet cunning smile playing round the corners of her mouth thus suddenly appealed to she started and looked confused what a stir among the good people carrie lee have godeys ladys book impossible they had not heard aright was it godeys ladys book uncle jacob yes godeys ladys book could it be had the pet of the whole village worn a mask all this while which was now so unwittingly torn aside there were looks of consternation and alarm sly glances and winkings from those who were jealous of carries favor while the faces of the younger portion looked as plain as words could say it what harm is done we would read it ourselves if we could carrie blushed what wonder although to confess the truth she could have laughed heartily to see the doleful faces round her but uncle jacobs question must be answered so she began well uncle i will tell you what i wanted with it and perhaps my answer may also set kate at rest godey is my talisman which you have been so naughty as to tell of nothing but intent looks of expectation so she went on when i was at boardingschool i learned the value of the ladys book there it was the only source that never failed did we want something perfectly unique and beautiful for the coming season godeys fashion plates are elegant and reliable did we want to get up a little tableau on a holiday godeys mezzotint and line engravings furnish beautiful groups did we want to get up a little fancy ball godeys costumes were straightway appealed to or did we want to send home little nicknacks for christmas presents godeys worktable is inexhaustible and you will not wonder uncle that i value the book when i tell you that from that i first got the idea of maintaining us myself and by that aid alone i have been able to carry it out no wonder you are surprised uncle for i dare say you never looked into a number in your whole life and there is such a spirit of condemnation among certain classes with regard to all such publications somebody in the first place condemns a magazine others catch the infection until the whole system is denounced and mostly by those who instead of seeing have only heard but to tell you what it has done for me when i was revolving in my mind how i should live godeys worktable suddenly occurred to me so knitting netting crocheting c filled my head and time for the next three months my articles sold readily and well for it was something quite new here and this encouraged me to open a little school for teaching others the same thing you all know how well i succeeded in that for i could still continue my own work during the intervals of teaching when the market here failed a friend in the city offered to dispose of my articles there that beautiful sofa pillow mrs whitten which you admired enough to buy i got from the september number of godey my little bouquets of worsted flowers which adorn many of your shelves came also from godey and that superb silk embroidery cried kate and those beautiful corners for handkerchiefs said another and all your elegant lamp mats exclaimed a third all all from godey said carrie with the gladdest smile imaginable every number devotes three or four pages to this subject so i am continually able to offer something new to my pupils who seem never tired of learning my income has been far greater than i dared to hope and now comes the crowning point of my happiness you all remember that beautiful wild cherry place which was mothers and where father always wanted so much to build a house just in that large open spot between those two largest elmtrees well i determined long ago if ever i had money enough to carry out his plan and about a month ago i found i had money enough provided i could dispense with the labors of an architect  this at first seemed impossible but here as in everything else my talisman did not fail me godeys model cottages were just what i wanted so added carrie taking a beautiful little portable desk from the table and showing several papers by taking one of his plans and altering it slightly in several points i have been able to get something which just suits me and which an architect could not improve and now with a little assistance from uncle jacob which i know i can depend upon before many months are gone i shall see one of the prettiest of cottages on wild cherry place i will not attempt to describe the revulsion of feeling that took place there or tell you how many declared they never would condemn a thing again without examining it themselves  some could not make themselves believe they were really awake others thought it exceeded all the stories they ever heard their grandmothers tell in the chimneycorner all were determined to subscribe and many wanted to write that very afternoon but carrie read to them the liberal terms which godey offers to clubs this they determined was the best way to do the thing and the extra copies should be given one to the ministers wife and the rest to those who could not afford to join but carries story was not over do tell me said kate who was in the midst of a knot of young people do tell us about this pretty desk of yours at a distance we thought it the japanese work but on a closer inspection we find it is not this said carrie smiling was an old pine thing and godeys good hint on anglojapanese work came just in time to save it from the fire what was it let us see it they all cried at once whereupon carrie produced the july number which was taken by her companions with a kind of awe being the first number of the kind they had ever seen oh what beautiful pictures cried one and fashion plates said another here is one of the cottages cried a third oh here is music exclaimed another oh yes said carrie i had forgotten to tell you that here is where i get all my new music that you have wondered so much about but now supper was announced and the conversation was suspended until after that was over then uncle jacob who had not spoken since carrie began but had been obliged several times to wipe away the tears that would come remarked that he would just walk to the postoffice or so for a little exercise what cook book do you use carrie said mrs skimpton carries hand was laid on her unfailing godey dont you think she said smiling its well worth the subscription well i declare said old mrs wilson between laughing and crying while she wiped her spectacles i never by this time the men had come who were each in turn obliged to listen to a recapitulation of carries wonderful story and nothing would suffice but carrie must finish the evening by reading something from the book and letting each see for himself carrie produced the numbers and regaled them for the rest of the evening with some of the richest things a magazine ever offered to the public the circle was held to a late hour and all departed resolved to subscribe and only regretting they had not done so years ago carrie said uncle jacob when all had gone did you ever hear your mother speak of miss zilphia harris a distant relative of hers carrie thought she had well continued uncle jacob i have just received a letter stating that she has died leaving to your mother the fortune which she has amassed this of course becomes yours what more could carrie desire her income though not very large was sufficient to support her in ease and comfort the cottage was built and never does the circle meet at carries without calling up that ever memorable afternoon when she first disclosed her talisman  subscribers godeys ladys book the book of beauty and of the

clerks office of the district court of the united states for the southern district of new york   caliban a sequel to ariel the bible is an inspired book and every word of it is true this proposition would never have been disputed if the bible had been properly understood but theologians have put into scrip ture what was not to be found there and brought revelation into conflict with history and science thus when divines asserted that according to genesis the earth was created some six or seven thousand years ago that it is the centre of the universe and the heavens revolve around it geology and astronomy contradicted the assertion and seemed to set science at war with revelation until a more correct interpretation of scripture brought them into harmony it has been supposed that the different races of mankind sprang from the same stock where as history and science prove the existence of races which could not have had a common origin if therefore the bible taught the unity of the race it would contradict an established fact but does the bible teach this so far from         caliban doing so it records at least two distillnct crea tions of human beings here were men upon the earth before adam for proof of this prop osition consult the book of genesis the only historical authority in  isaac la peyrere a learned and pious divine published a work entitled praeadamitae in which he sought to prove that adam was not the first humanbeing the writer of this disser tation has tried but without success to obtain a copy of it and is therefore ignorant of its con tents the inspired historian records two creations both by the stame divine creator the one in his eharacter of elohm or god and the other inl his character of jehovah or lord the transla tors of king james have wisely distinguished the hebrew words by rendering one of them god and the other lord i shall use the original elohm and jehovah any one who will look into a hebrew lexi con will find that elohm expresses thedivinity as allpowerful whilst jehovah designates him as intelligent and holy the first creation sprang from the omnipotence of deity the second was the product of his intelligence and holiness genesis chap  and  down to verse  con tains elohms creation there is also a brief resume of his work in chap   the crea tion by jehovah is recorded in gen   ariel says a good deal about the use of the arti cle in these passages but nothing to the purpose it certainly gives no countenance to his singular hypothesis that the negro is a beast an hypothesis   caliban              i at variance with natural history and psychology the hebrew article is essentially a demonstrative pronoun and is used like the same part of speech in greek and german viz when a definite object one previously mentioned or already lnown or the only one of its kind is the object of discourse gesenius heb gram s  nordheimers heb gram  p  winers idioms of the n t p  this rule proves two distinct creations   elohm said let us make man  so elohm created thie man i e the man he re solved to make the preadamite gen    there was not a man to till the ground and jehovah elohm formed the man i e the man for that purpose to till the ground the race of adam gen   the creation of the first races is recorded in gen   from this account it is evident that the material elements brought forth spon taneously everything including man the words are let the earth bring forth grass etc at the bidding of the omnipotent forests sprang fromll the soil fish and fowl from the waters and cattle from the earth in the sameway he made man that is human nature at its first appearance on the globe the ancients were right in their opinion that the aborigines of each country were earthborn terrce filitz they erred only in applying it to the race of adam from this account it is clear  elorim created the man in his own image i e endowed him with power a feeble image of g     caliban htis own omnipotence and gave him dominiol over all other animals  he appointed the race their work to sub due the earth to clear it of wild beasts  he gave them for their subsistence the spontaneous fruits of the earth  he created them male and female both sexes sprang out of the earth at once and were independent in their origin the woman was not as in the second creation taken out of the body of man hence she is not his consort but his slave now thisis precisely the condition of savage life the preadamites were wild men fed by the bounty of nature and waging perpetual war with wild beasts they had no agriculture no art no science the ties of domestic life were un known they were only one step removed from the simiadee the orangoutang and the chim panzee  this is precisely what the analogy of nature would suggest cre ztion rises by regular gra dation from inanimate matter through vegeta ble life sentient life the dynasty of the reptile of the fish of the bird and of the mammal up to the dynasty of man and this is the order re lated in genesis as is proved by hugh miller in his testimony of the rocks it is at once scientific and biblical within the limits of each class however there is a progressive advance from the lowest to the highest type the human class begins with the preadamite the lowest type  the creation of adan in immediate suc cession to the ape or the gorilla would have in   caliban  volved a saltus a leap unknown to nature a departure fromnt the order of the created universe for as is said by rev dr sumner archbishop of canterbury  there is less difference between the highest brute animal and the lowest savage than between the savage and the most improved man records of creation  chap  the negro is more like the chimpanzee than like the englishman it is remarked by hallam if man was made in the image of god he was also made in the image of an ape hist litera ture  p  this is true only of the pre adamites the affinity of cerebral structure of the negro and of the anthropomorphous ape is acknowledged by all great naturalists such as tiedemann cuvier serres vrolik gratiolet agassiz owen huxley the bible in its recognition of a race of human beings prior to adam accords with the discoveries of paleontological science geolo gists have discovered the bones of men mingled with the remains of animnals now extinct which lived upon the earth long before the creation of adam the facts have been collected by sir charles lyell in his geological evidences of the antiquity of man london  no in telligent and candid man can examine the evi dence without admitting the conclusion human beings races of men inhabited our globe long anterior to adam their skeletons are found in europe asia africa and even america in the delta of the mississippi and on the banks of the ohio the cemeteries of these preadamites have been thrown open to the view of the pre f calib an sent generation and given evidence of their successive steps towards civilization geologists distinguish these by the name of the stone the bronze and the iron age these primi tive dwellers upon earth manufactured their spearheads and domestic utensils first from stone then from bronze and finally from iron their relics show that they were originally sava ges and struggled through slow degrees after a civilization which they could never reach however they did the work assigned them by elohma to subdue the earth and have do minion over the fish of the sea etc who were these preadamites with the light of modern science the question is easily and satisfactorily answered naturalists are not agreed as to the races of mankind blumen  bach makes  five lawrences lectures p  dr prichard gives seven researchel   p   cuvier and others distinguish only the preadamites were mongols and negroes together with their mixed progey  created male and female and in many pairs they multi  plied rapidly exterminated the wild beasts and replenished the earth with beings of their ownt tpec  aes p enetrating int o every land the earth was not then divided as subsequently at the time of peleg gen   but formed one con tinent and therefore presented no obstruction their dispersion these roving freebooters   caliban          blended their blood in mongrel tribes spread over europe asia and africa and even pene trated into america passing down to its south ern extremity where they survive in their de scendants the brutal patagonians  the cat eyed chinaman the african hottentot the ma lay the laplander and the esquimaux all sprang from the primitive races of mankind in accord ance with the will of their creator they subsist ed at first upon the spontaneous productions of nature but in the course of time as is shown by their recently recovered remains they began to feed upon the animals they hunted whilst some of them acquired a relish for human flesh and became cannibals they make meals of the missionaries who go to them to convert them to christianity these savage tribes embroiled in perpetual war destroyed one another and the stronger subjugated and exterminated the weaker the ancients seem to have attained in solme way perhaps by tradition a knowledge of the origin and progress of these races which long rejected as fabulous is now confirmed by the  disinterment of their remains lucretius no tiees the three ages stone bronze ana iron de rerum natura v   the scholar will recall the passages in cicero de inven tione tusc quaest   in juvenal sat vi  xii  xv  and especially the fami liar lines of horace sat i   cum prorepserunt primis animalia terris mutum et turpe pecus glandem etc i         caliban the error of the ancients consisted in con founding the race of adam with thepreadam ites aristotle deriving his observation from the race with which he was familiar remarks with more truth and justice that civilization is the normal state of man that he is by nature a political animal had our modern philosophers inquired for facts instead of fabricating theories they would never have raised the question as to whether humanity commenced its career in civil ization or barbarism the caucasian never was a savage the other races began in barbarism and have never completely thrown it off tribes of them occupied this continent from the era of peleg down to the time of its discovery by co lumbus without becoming more than improved savages even the partial civilization of the aztecs and peruvians perished under the inva sion of their kinsmen the indians the mon golian chinese pent up within narrow limits and compelled by the necessities of an overcrowded population to resort to agriculture and handi craft and with a history that goes back far be yond the flood are at this day only semicivil ized the negro in his native haunts is always a savage and if reclaimed will without the con trol of a superior race speedily relapse into his primitive condition the negroes in the south have  already made rapid strides in that direc tion fetish worship has been revived among them the creation of the caucasian or white race is recorded in gen   up to this period the earth moistened by   caliban          mists yielded its spontaneous fruits for the sup port of the nomadic hunters but no rain had fallen upon the soil and  there was not a man to till the ground deity resolved to create a new race a race of tillers of the ground and settle them in a definite locality furnished with all the natural facilities for successful agriculture the adamic race began its career with agricul ture domestic life and social organization the goal of the preadamite is the startingpoint of the caucasian there are certain marked peculiarities in the origin and destination of the superior race  jehovah iformed the man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life he did not spring out of the earth but was fashioned by the plastic hands of the creator shaping the material into human form and then the breath of deity the divine afflatus was infused into him in this way not by the mere fiat of his maker he became a living soul the creator intended the cau casian to be a workman a builder an artist and hence he performed the part of a divine artist in creating him  the caucasian was to be engaged in agri culture and to be blessed with the elevating in fluences of that noblest of occupations hence hip maker did not command the earth to bring forth grass etc as at the first creation but planted a garden eastwardon the east of the preadamitesin eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the         caliban ground thus planted made jeaovah to grow every tree etc  the caucasian was endowed with a high aesthetic faculty the love of the beautiful he was to create and foster the fine arts hence his primitive abode contained trees  pleasant to the sight as well as  good for food the sav age is insensible to the charms of nature and art the loveliness of eden would have been wasted on the preadamites the negro in his native wilds never constructs a house nor plants a rose the chinaman knows nothing of perspective or the effect of light and shadow in painting  the caucasian as a tiller of the ground was provided with the means of artificial irriga tion in showers of rain which collecting into lakes or flowing in streams could be diverted to his fields  the ornaments of civilization were placed within his reach eden contained gold and precious stones both of them to decorate his fair daughters whilst gold would serve as a standard of value and a medium of exchange in the commerce which flows from agriculture sav ages only barter the civilized man is a mer chant  he was to advance the sciences hence the great teacher gave him the first lesson by bringing to him the inferior animalsthe fauna of eden to see what he would call them this was the first classification and nomencla ture in natural history from that day to this science has been the exclusive possession of his descendants   caliban           but the loftiest distinction of the caucasian consisted in his being made the headl and repre sentative of universal humanity he was placed on trial for all mankind it may be objected that adam could not have represented the pre adamites who lived before him and knw noth ing of him but it may be objected with equal propriety that hle could not have represented their descendants now living whilst al orthodox divines hold that he did represent them the fall was retrospective as well as prospective this doctrine however is the gordian knot of  theology which human wisdom is incompetent to untie this much may be said in vindication of divine providence that if the caucasian has no right to complain much less have the mongol and the negro for they were represented by one much better qualified to stand the test than any of their progenitors besides christianity the remedy of the fall is designed for all races this is affirmed by the apostle of the gentiles in a part of his writings which has greatly puz zled his interpreters col   his words are greek jew barbarian scythian accord ing to his interpreters the last term is super fluous for were not these scythians barbarians they certainly were the wildest of the caucasian race and this circumstance ought to have opened their eyes to st pauls meaning which undoubt edly is that the gospel is to be preached not only to jew greek and scythianthe most untutored of the children of adambut also to the pro geny of the preadamite barbarians  the caucasian is in form color and mental         caliban and moral qualities unlike the mongolian and the very antithesis of the negro who is as disproportioned in his manners as in his shape and no more resembles the white man than cal iban resembled ferdinand or the old hag syco rax the beautiful miranda he is a being on whose nature nurture can never stick and as with age his body uglier grows so his mind cankers adam in the garden needed only one thing to complete his happiness a wife  but among the races already in existence there was not found a helpmeet for him the hebrew is che negdo according to his front presence i e re sembling him as one of the same race as jr hovah had   shaped adam  from  the dust he formed a suitable help for him by building a rib taken from  his side into a woman she did not spring out of the earth but was part of him self transformed and sublimated the precious porcelain of human clay our first father en raptured at the spectacle of feminine loveliness exclaimed the very thing capital bone out of my bones and flesh out of my flesh this shall be called ishah woman for she was taken  out of ish man thus the planter became a hus band and the family organization took the place of the capricious concubinage of the other races happy had it been for him and our fair sweet   caliban          mother had they retained their innocence and bliss the narrative of the fall is given in the third chapter of genesis the tempter was the ser pent who is said to have been  more subtle than any beast of the field which jehovah elo hm had made here the comparative degree is used as is also the case in the targum of onkelos the earliest and best chaldee transla tion of the passage riggs chaldee manual p  the tempter was more cunning than any beast of the second creation that by jeho vah these being superior in organization to those of the first creation he surpassed all brutes in intelligence and therefore was not himself a brute what was he unquestion ably one of the preadamites the only human beings prior to adam true he is called a ser pent and this has puzzled the commentators dr adam clarke pressed by the difficulties of the case is driven to the supposition that he was an ape or ourang outang in which he came very near the truth the tempter was a preadamite perhaps a negro and he is denominated a ser pent by a common figure of speech just as a vile man is called a reptile brute a dog etc the hebrew verb from which the appellation is derived signifies according to gesenius to utter a low hissing sound to whisper especially of the whispering or muttering of sorcerers it presents a vivid picture of an african medicine man or conjurer with his grey dissimulation whispering his diabolical temptation into the ear of unsuspecting eve that the tempterwas a         caliban preadamite is evident from his name for deity yea hath elohm said he knew nothing of jehovah the first false step takenby eve was her recognition and repetition of his title of deity elohm hath said in this she virtu ally renounced jehovah and forfeited his pro tection she fell and became the occasion of her husbands fall but although fallen they were not utterly degraded they knew   that they were naked and with the modesty of their race  they sewed figleaves together and made themselves aprons   whilst the preadamn ites have always been shameless in their nudity the caucasian covers his person it is the unan imous testimony of travelers that the negro even the female appears perfectly naked without any sense of indecorum the existence of so absurd a form of supersti tion as ophiolatry or serpentworship has ex cited special wonder it assumes two   forms and is traceable to two different sources the savage adores the serpent in honor of his illuas trious progenitor and his exploits in the garden of eden the caucasian blending mythology with history has received his system firom the tradition of the brazen serpent which amoses erected as a type of our saviour the antag onism between the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent originated in eden and is irreconcilable the experience of centuries has only exasperated it the negroes of the south in their ingratitude and insolent demeanor leagued with the vilest white trinculos who batten on the miseries of the people and  steal   caliban            by line and level are ready at their behest to brain their former kind master or with a log batter his skull or paunch him with a stake or cut his weazand with the knife in view of all this well may the southerner exclaim abhorred slave which any print of goodness will not take being capable of all ill i pitied thee took pains to make thee speak taught thee each hour one thing or other when thou didst not savaged know thine own meaning but wouldst gabble like a thing most brutish i endowed their purposes with words that made them known but thy vile race thlough thou didst learn had that in t which good natures could not abide to be with the firstborn of adam   and eve was cain his pious mother recognized in him a man from jehovah   her fatal experience was well suited to impress her with a horror of  a man from elohm  as she caressed her infant boy her heart warmed to him as the image of his father and the image of jehovah next abel was born the sons adhered to the civilized vocation of the father but with a division of labor abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground gen      the cultivation of the soil and the breeding of cattle are the chief care of the intelligent farmer and in process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the firuit of the ground an offer ing unto jehovah   and abel brought of the firstlings of his flock  abels offering  was accepted whilst cains was rejected why was        caliban this each of the brothers brought the avails of his own occupation but cainlls offering of fruit was the oblation of a preadamnite recog nizing only elohm the omnipotent whilst abels acknowledged jehovah the holy one whom fallen man could not approach except through the medium of sacrifice he thus con fessed himself a sinner and by faith in the atonement  offered a more excellent sacrifice than cain  the sequel of the narrative would seem to warrant the inference that cain was contami nated by intercourse with the barbarians around him for he evinced the possession of their mur derous spirit by slaying his brother the pen alty inflicted upon the fratricide is worthy of notice  having indulged the temper of a sav age he was doomed   to dwell among them when   thou tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength a fugi tive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth the import of this malediction evidently is that he should no longer be an agriculturist but must become a savage eking out his subsistence from  the precarious bounty of nature and cain went out from  the presence of jehovah and dwelt in the land of nod as it is impos sible to escape the presence of the omnipresent the expression must mean that he was exiled from the race created by jehovah and enjoying his special protection this narrative proves beyond question the existence of humuan beings prior to adan for the murderer exclaimed  everyoe that find t he murderer exclaimed  everyon that find   cali ban          eth me shall kill me whom had he to fear abel was dead and his parents would not harm him it may be supposed that his apprehen sions were only the creation of an excited imagi nation conjuring up the spectres which always haunt the guilty but it is added jehovah set a mark upon cain lest any finding him should kill him which proves that there were men who might slay him cains fears were groundless the preadamites flattered by the visit of a white man welcomed the felon and gave him a wife just as the negroes of the south caress the recreant whites who because repudiated by their own race as contemptible villains have gone among the fireedmen for the purpose of ac quilring wealth or political importance the history of which the above is an epitome illustrates a fundamental principle of the divine governmentthe purity of race   the lord would not permit adam to marry a mongol or negro he cursed the first murderer by impos ing such a wife upon him miscegenation is a crime against nature an unlawful attempt to set aside the ordinance of heaven and reverse the wise and beneficent order of creation it is sin and the penalty of sin the mongrel posterity of cain blended the occupations of civilization with the pursuits of savage life he himself  builded a city with the hope of habituating his family to domestic social and civic manners but it could have been nothing more than a rude collection of wig wams jabal devoted himself to a sort of pas toral life jubel cultivated music and amused         caliban his leisure with the composition of war songs and corndances whilst tubalcain set up a forge for the manufacture of weapons of bronze and iron this dutiful son presented to his father lamnech the first polygamist a sword and the first use he made of the weapon was to try its tempelr upon a young preadamite in his exul tation over his exploit he boasted that the ven geance threatened against the slayer of cain was a trifle compared to that which he would inflict upon his assailants the very temper of the insolent savage breathes in his defiant appeal to his squaws  herder calls it the lay of the sword   it sounds very much like an indian war song a man have i slain for his woulnd to me even a young man for hurting me  if cain was to be avenged sevenfold truly lamnech seventy and sevenfold the reputation of these hybrid races became  infamous that as early as the time of enos he grandson of adam the caucasians assumed distinctive appellation gert  then began men to call upon the name of the lord the literal rendering of the hebrew is a be ginning was made for calling by the name  of jehovah  this is sanctioned by piscator dio at le clerc bishop patrick and other learned men and is adopted by ikitto biblical cyclo pedia ii p  its meaning is this the post erity of adam in consequence of the awful in ease of wickedness assumed the appellation of jehovahites or sons of eloimnot his slaves   the preadamites had proven themselves to be    caliban          ariel is correct in viewing the deluge as je hovahs declaration ngainst miscegenation  but mistakes the natulle of the offence the crime which occasioned that catastrophe was not the copulation of men with beasts but the internmix ture of the races of men the sons of god cau casians saw the daughters of mnen preadamites or more probably the hybrid cainites that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose   the adamites were en snared by these lascivious women mulattoes and quadroons  the offspring of these alliances were prodigies of wickedness the perpetrators of gigantic crimes and filled the earth with vio lence to preserve the purity of caucasian blood jeovaii swept these mongels fiom the earth and saved noah and his family the only unadulterated caucasians then living ariel sup poses that the negro went into the ark along with the other beasts but the negroes were never in the ark nor did they perish in the flood  the only persons destroyed were the mulattoes the mongrel progeny sprung from the amalgamation of the caucasian and the cainite the mongolians and nigitians together with the hybrid races caused by their intermixture had not committed the crime of which the deluge was the divinely appointed avengerthe crime of blending the blood of adam with that of the preadamite the flood was only partial limited to the portion of the earths surface inhabited by the culprits the notion of a universal flood has been abandoned by all intelligent theolo i caliban gians the bible does not teach it and science utterly ignores it the race thus rescued by jeova     was ele vated to higher privileges and blessings  i will not again curse the ground any more for mans sake  the primitive malediction resting on the soil was removed   that old curse says bishop sherlock     on prophecy p  was fully executed in the flood in consequence of which discharge from the curse a new bless ing is immediately pronounced upon the earth to cain the earth saturated with his brothers blood was cursed with barrenness to adam it yielded reluctantly and scantily but noah and his sons inherited a new world and ever since agriculture has been the most pleasant healthy and remunerative of all vocations it is tlle favorite pursuit of the caucasian race and the main sp ing of their opulence and p   osper it lhe first producetion of thle nriew earth was the wineproducing glape the noblest of fiuits which    cheereth god and man jidges   the farer now had         corn and  wine the scripture epitome of all temporal blessings noah planted a     vineyard and   drank of the wine and was drunken    fanatics are shocked at the conduct of the patriarch but the bible does not censure him  on  the contrary upon awaking fiomn the torpori of vinous inebriation he was filled with the spirit of prophecy and predicted the fortunes of his sons in which   he signified his reproval of hams unfilial demeanor by disclosing to him the degradation awaitin his son canaan  the common explanation oj    calibax          this affair is preposterous it is said that noah cullsed canaan because of the conduct of ham strange justice this to punish one man for the sin of anotherthe child for the crime of the parent but noah did not curse canaan he merely predicted the curse which was to fall upon hima curse which has been repeatedly fulfilled in the subjugation of his descendants by the posterity of shem and japhet remark that this was the subjection of the white to the white it was reserved for the radicals of this country in their fiendish malignity to subject the white man to the negro after the flood the discrimination between jehovah and elohm as also between the sons of god and men became less important and hence these termts are not used with the preci sion which is observed in the earlier chapters of genesis the race of noah went forth to their mission under the protection of jehovaelo imiii and as the only men worthy of the name the subsequent accounts are restrieted chiefly to them inspired history is the history of the caucasian it contains a genealogical table of noahs descendants with the countries to which they migrated there is not the slightest evi dence that any of them were colored people they are and always have been white the ethiopians or cushites as the bible terms them were not blacks as to canaan the effort to identify his posterity with the negro is utterly absurd dr hickok justly remarks it is not probable that distinctions of race at all took their rise in the three sons of noah empiri          caliban cal psychology p  history and science demonstrate the contrary these disfinetions existed long before the flood the caucasians scattered over the earth driv ing the inferior races before them and gradually took possession of its fairest portions at the era of peleg the fourth in descent firom shen the earth was divided gen    this was  an occurrence ill physical geography an earthquake which produced a vast chasm sepa lating two considerable parts of the earth in or near the district inhabited by man kitto bibl cyclop  p   the event recorded was doubtless the disruption of the globe into two continents by which the preadanites who had wandered to america were cut off from the caucasians and  intercourse between the two suspended until the discovrery of this continent where europeans found the descendants of the original emigrants and began to press upon and exterminate them at a  very early pe iod an terior to the dawn  of profane history the can casians drove the negro into africa and pursued him to the edge of the great desert which he crossed and concealed himself in southern afr ica where he

it for it is a very recent discovery which could be made only by the microscope prof lehrmann says the blood globules are distinguished by peculiarities of form and size in every animal genues the corpuscules of the blood of many of the rmam malia can be individually detected and distin guished from that of man physiological chenm istry  p  kolliker histologie htumaine paris  sameness of blood does not prove identity of species but only of genus the di ferent races or species of mankind are all made of one blood just as the lion the tiger and the cat are made of one blood and as the dog and the wolf are of one blood but the blood of one genus differs firom that of others men are of one blood but of different species let the skeptic inform us if he can where st paul got this knowledge of a fact unknown to aristotle and pliny  naturalists have been greatly perplexed with the doctrine of species and some of themn in their attemnpts to define it have fallen into the fallacy of the argumentim in circulo making fecundity the test of species and species the measure of fecundity the argument which they derive from the analogy of other animals fails in an essential particularthe absence of reason in virtue of this special endowment man possesses more vital force and is therefore capable of wider and more varied propagation the wolf and the dog produce a hybrid off spring but the offspring is not prolific now a sound logic arguing fromn analogy would con         ca liban elude that as man is superior to the brute he must possess a superior power of propagation and the species may intermix beyond any assign able limits hence mongrelism which is limited in the different speciesof brutes as the wolf and the dog the horse and the ass extends in man throughout all generations there are only three original types or species but several hun dred varieties the pure caucasian stands alone in his character and his achievements within a short period after the flood he had already founded vast empires built magnificent cities and erected the pyramids of egypt tihe temples of india and the gorgeous palaces which layard and rawlinson have exhumed from the mounds of assyria all history chronology art science and all literature worthy of the aame are his ariels hypothesis that the canaanites were a mongrel people is highly probable if not abso lutely certain although his reasons for it are destitute of force ihe mistakes a mere gentili tial or patronymic termination ite for the de signation of a cross between a man and a beast but the hypothesis is amply supported by the facts of the case the patriarchs were averse to all matrimonial connection with the canaanites and no reason can be given for it but the impu rity of their blood abraham charged his sei vantf thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the canaanites but thou shalt go unto my country and unto my kindred in what respect were the canaanites not the kindred of abraham since they had come from   caliban          t a common ancestor except that they had be come debased by amalgamation and were mon grels for the same reason esaus connection with a woman of that race was  a grief of mind to isaac and rebekah gen   and isaac charged his son jacob thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan but the clear est evidence of the fact is found in a very sin gular circumstance related in gen  sche chem a young canaanite prince had cohabited with dinah a daughter of jacob he was really  devoted to her and asked her in marriage prof fering her father and brethren any amount of dowry and gift this was certainly a fair and even generous offer but the brothers of the girl so far firom accepting it devised a scheme of terrible vengeance which resulted in the ex termination of the whole tribe the affair looks like the vengeance of white men exasperated beyond control by their sisters pollution by a mulatto and this is its most natural explana tion jacob might well have addressed to schechem the language with which prospero rebuked the monster caliban thou most lying knave whom stripes may move not kindness i have used thee filth as thou art with human care and lodged thee in mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate the honor of my child the stephanos of the age inebriated by fa naticism have emancipated the negroes and the liberated brutes wild with joy are dancing and crying out          caliban ban ban cacaliban has a new masterget a new man freedom heyday heyday freedom freedom but when the deluded victim     of drunken philanthropy regains his senses he will ex  claim what a thricedouble ass  was i to take this drunkard for a god and worship the dull fool there is another point in which ariel has approached and yet perverted the truth he affirms that the law in levit   which ex eludes from the priesthood one  that hath a flat nose was intended to exclude the negro from divine worship the regulation refers exclu sively to the priesthood into which no negro could enter because it was limited to the pos terity of aaron nevertheless the exception is very significant for it proves that if an aaron ite was so unfortunate as to have the blemish of flat nose that point of resemblance to the negro would interdict his approach to offer the bread of his god it is an indirect but power ful testimony against the negro whose very similitude the god of israel abhorred it is unnecessary to pursue the biblical argu ment further  in it heavens protest against admixture of race the contamination of cau casian by inferiorblood is as plain as if traced in letters of fire like the handwriting on the wall  our own country affords the most recent illustration of the primitive and unrepealed law it has been said that the institution of slavery was wrong and god punished the people of the   caliban          south for sustaining it this is rank fanaticism and falsehood nothing can be clearer than that slavery was not only tolerated but sanctioned by abraham moses our saviour and his apos tles and by the whole christian church down to a very recent period this was proved some years ago by that learned prelate dr england roman catholic bishop of charleston s c in his letters to the hon john forsyth   and more recently by the late revered bishop hop kins of vermont southern slavery involved no violation of any law human or divine and it was the best condition for the negro he can live with the white man only as his slave the south sinned and the south has suffered in consequence but her crime was not slavery but amalgamation boston new york and philadelphia were and are yet more licentious than charleston mobile and new orleans but in the former cities illicit intercourse was con fined to the same race whilst the sexual cornm merce of the latter was debased by miscegena tion the men of the south are in many re spects a noble race but they tolerated among them a crime which divine justice never passes by they contaminated their blood by admix ture with the lowest type of humanity for this they have been punishedmost signifi cantlyby subjection to the accomplices of their crime god has permitted unprincipled politicians vile and wicked men the basest that the wold has ever seen to inflict this penalty upon them so he permitted the pharisees to murder our saviour but took vengeance on        caliban them for the crime  thie radicals are the flail of deity they offered themselves for the service and have been accepted ruled by selfinterest and goaded by rancorous hate they have perpetrated a crime of colossal magnitude  and in subjecting the caucasian to the negro the highest type of humanity to the lowest  they have turned traitors to their race their religion and their god never before has the world beheld such criminals never such a retri bution as awaits them lingering perdition worse than any death can be at once shall step by step attend them and their ways they have exalted the ignorant and brutal negro to be the civil and political master of the south the legislator and the ruler of white men their wives and daughters they have thrust him into the jurybox the magistracy the com mon council forced the white into disgusting contact with him in all public conveyances and filled all places with the noisomeness of his filthy odor the  ancient and fishlike smell of the monster this and more than this with cool and calculating ferocity have they done these cruelties heaped upon the countrymen and kinsmen of washington jefferson  and jack son  history will be searched in vain for a parallel to the deep inexpiable wrong iln flicted by the radicals upon our brethren of the south  it were a torment to lay upon the dawned   caliban          the vengeance of jehovah the guardian of our race will pursue those miscreants and will vouchsafe neither peace nor union to our un happy country until they are hurled firom office stript of the power they have abused and tram pled in the dust by the people whose confidence they have betrayed whose honor they have stained this fair land of ours is the heritage of the caucasian the western home of the ger man the briton the irishman in short of all in whose veins beat the proud pulsations of earths best blood it is a white mans country the caucasian after occupying and embellishing the fairest seats of the old world has reared a mighty republic on this continent firom whose western shore he looks over the pacific to the primitive cradle of his race this is his possession the negro is an intruder here an alien and a foreigner a vagabond as all his fathers wereand this great common wealth will never achieve its destiny so long as the negro is allowed to vote or to exercise any political right or privilege whatever to subject the caucasian to the negro is a higher crime against nature than to place the negro under the ape or the baboon and noth ing can equal its atrocity it is the sum of all villanies a league with death and a covenant with hell the doom of the felons who have perpetrated this foul iniquity this crtmen lese majestatis against the noblest type of human

accumulate do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazed for nothing canst thou to damnation add greater than that one of the family one of the family by tertium quid portland published by bailey  noyes  one of the family my wife and i are married so much for a beginning to my story which some folks say is the hardest part to write when how or where we were married or how long after i asked will you and she willed is not the question for that has nothing to do with my story which is not about either of us but another member of our family i always had a fondness for pets and an especial one for dogs and horses so as soon as we had a home of our own  a search was begun for a member of the canine race i had read rab and his friends and immediately as a result became rabid for just such another but all my inquiries for a mastiff proved in vain notwithstanding the assertions of every body who had a dog for sale from a king charles to a st bernard that their particular dog was full blood mas tiff and nothing else finally i had to accept the fact that such a dog was not to be found and i must fain content myself with a new foundland at this point one of my friends in formed me that he had a pup as was a pup brought directly from newfound land whose progenitors were a noble pair weighing a hundred weight apiece    or more and that as he had no time to devote to his education would give him to me of course i accepted him unsight unseen but when that same evening there was deposited in my yard an an imated doorrug broad as it was long high as it was broad a lumpy dumpy dough ball of a dog with a mysterious gait as though his hind legs were de termined to do all the walking impart ing thereby a sort of sideway shambly motion not easily described with hair unkempt uncombed but when i say such a dog was deposited in my yard could it be expected that i should at once take him into my affections if it could all that i can say is you didnt see the dog however there he was his former  owner thanked and gone leaving me to speculate upon what accidental death he should die and querying as to how much strychnine it would take to cure him of looking so disagreeable next i wondered if there was any one else who would like a present of a fine pup thinking that if they did i knew an individual whose name it was quid that had one to give away dog cheap he spent that night in the cellar and demonstrated very conclusively his entire unfitness for any better abode and his dissatisfaction with it keeping us awake at least a month that blessed night here let me sug gest to any one seeking among herbs and barks for a soporific that whatever virtue in that direction they may find    if they wish to lie down to sleep in peace my advice would not be to try dog bark for in my experience it ag gravates the disease ditto the patient double ditto the impatient day dawned at last as likewise did our dog who wabbled against my legs exhibiting such a fund of affection that it flopped all over and one would have had a heart of stone yea two hearts of stone to have been able to repulse his demonstrations or resist the appeal made for just one spark of love well he continued to grow fat and into our affections and came to be con sidered one of the family exhibiting such a degree of affection and frolic that it was impossible not to love him in return one day when i reached home an  nie thats the wife i married called me to the window and pointing to some thing dangling from the clothesline asked me to see what bruce had been doing and if you will believe it gentle reader that promising pup had so ef fectually done up one of my new shirts that nothing remained but the collar bosom and half of one sleeve carefully pinned to the line whether he did it thinking it would save miss case who then presided over our kitchen as queen of flapjacks the trouble of starching and ironing or that he did not approve of the style of the gar ment i cannot say but feeling that it was a matter of great importance that i should not be left shirtless and that he should be taught to let our linen se verely alone he was dragged ignomin                   iously to the spot and solomons seal impressed upon his tender frame with such happy results that never since that eventful day has he intentionally done a pennys worth of mischief charlie our eldest boy was about four months old and bruce although they are not supposed to be twins was of the same immature age but old enough to receive a portion of the lib eral education which i decided to be stow upon him he was soon broken to harness and for many months drew his baby master in his little carriage with a care and gentleness never equalled and seldom excelled without reins or guiding string he would thread his way through crowded streets carefully avoiding con tact with boxes posts and boot legs  looking out keenly for passing teams bestowing small notice on other dogs passing along the even tenor of his way without ever meeting during two or three years of active service any disaster save once when in defending himself from the assaults of a quarrel some cur he tipped the boy out more to his indignation than his hurt he acquired skill in opening and shutting doors and even succeeded many times in turning glass or porce lain knobs and manifested such a de gree of docility and intelligence that he soon became widely known and ad mired his next lesson was to fetch and carry and he shortly learned to carry parcels umbrellas canes vials pails of milk baskets of eggs and sich with a faithfulness and tenderness won    derful to behold moreover he was taught in one short hour to bring the fire wood from the shed which he did stick by stick until bidden to stop he showed his sagacity in looking out for any purchases which i happened to make at once seizing them lest he should be sent back after them which people were very apt to request that he should do that they might see the performance and finally it became al most impossible for me to leave or lose anything so watchful was he to se cure my purchases i remember that on one occasion i allowed him to carry some window shades which i was returning to our friend marretts and laying them on the counter i paid for some other arti cles whistled for him and left for my place of business but when i had passed the corner of exchange street he was not to be seen surmising where he might be found i retraced my steps and as i opened the door down the stairs he came with full five hundred dollars worth of clerks after him to recover a roll of pa per which he had in his mouth it appeared that a moment after we left the store master bruce fearing no doubt that he was to be sent back rushed up the stairs sprung upon the counter seized the shades and was making off with them but was inter cepted and obliged to release his hold whereupon determined not to leave without an equivalent he took the roll of paper aforesaid in lieu at another time i returned a shawl   which my wife had taken home for my inspection laying it on the counter but bruce sat with eager eyes watching the bundle and upon my whistling to him leaped up and secured the shawl several times when caught in the rain i have secured a place of shelter and sent him for an umbrella which he always brought one time fairly taking it away from one of the children in front of the house in the meantime we moved to another house which stood next a provision store or the store stood next the house any one curious about the matter may deter mine which of these statements is cor rect by viewing the premises  and  gray street and it became often very convenient to send bruce with a pail or basket after any article wanted and  by and by he was given cents with which to make purchases on his own account one day he went into the shop with out a cent and the wife of the propri etor bestowed one upon him which he immediately took behind the counter to her husband signifying by exhibit ing his cent wagging his tail and other demonstrations that he was ready for a trade mr g thinking that as he really furnished the cent bruce should be satisfied with one cake he had al ways received two threw it down and ordered him to drop his cent but bruce had not studied arithmetic in vain and even when spoken sternly to refused to make the dicker but stood wagging his tail until it occurred to mr g that possibly the dog knew that he was en    titled to two cakes and upon throwing another to him presto down came the cent and away went bruce perfectly satisfied after this it often occurred that one young man living in the neighborhood and who had the honor of his acquaintance got bets out of other young men not so fortunate that if a cent was given him he would go to the store for round cakes nor leave without two on one occasion two were placed on the floor and as he dropped his cent one was taken up but bruce knew a thing or two as well as white folks for he succeeded in securing both cent and cake and after eating the latter re turned with the cent ready for another trade at one time he was guilty of a piece of meanness such as fagin   v recommended to noah claypole and which he denominated the kinchin lay see oliver twist and which i mention not to open afresh the wounds inflicted on his selfrespect but with the earnest hope that other puppies who read may be deterred from in dulging in so reprehensible an action eddie one of our boys who was at that time i think about three years of age had a cent given him which he was rolling on the sidewalk when bruce came along and regardless of the voice of conscience confiscated or appropri ated it to invest in cakes but the depths of meanness remains to be told and as eddie expressed it with tears in his eyes bwuce tole my cent and bwoght two wound cakes and wouldnt give me one he never repeated the    offence partly owing to the fact that the children had too much sense to expose their cents to his cupidity again and partly let us hope because upon calm reflection he learned to realize that it was an act worthy only of a vile cur and unworthy of any one bearing the noble name of bruce a brother of the writer lived in the neighborhood with whom it was cus tomary to exchange newspapers and bruce became the carrier he also learned the names of many different articles so that it was possible to send him up stairs down stairs in my la dys chamber for boots hats hammer basket etc etc and he rarely failed to bring the right article although sometimes in his haste to return and receive the praise and caresses usually  bestowed upon him he would take the wrong one proud enough he was to be of service and with tail curled tightly up he marched along pleased to make himself useful and i have often wished that i could see the boy or girl half as willing to do little acts of kindness as was bruce but then you cant expect every child to be such a puppy as he was i have spoken of him as one of the family nor is it to be wondered at since the children when wee little things used to address him thuswho you looking for bruce for father well hes down cellar or in the yard as the case may beand so he is one of the family for fifteen years he has been one of us but alas old age has overtaken him   j     likewise fleas likewise rheumatism and now blindness his old enemies the rats run over and around his venerable nose with im punity the midnight thief can enter the yard without a remonstrance from the voice which once would have sounded the alarm and swill boys plunder and peculate regardless of him who once was the terror of their class the eye once full of intelligence is dimmed the limbs so supple and so strong are stiff his race is almost finished under everybodys feet between ev erybodys legs is poor old bruce and hither and thither he goes punching his head against chairs and table legs or whatever is in his pathhe strays away from his home and has to be  sought after and led back and even his oldest and best friends find it im possible when in his presence to imag ine that it is patchouly they inhale the edict has gone forth that he must die and it has been going forth for many a day but still he lives for though chloroform may let him gently down to death his master cannot find it in his heart to slay him one more anecdote and then fare well for the first time after the great fire he dragged himself one sunday down town in blissful ignorance of the changes which had taken place and passing down exchange street missed his master the familiar bank where he had so often gone in former days was destroyed and naught remained but melancholy piles of broken bricks no    familiar spot was there accordingly he wended his way down the street to where a brother of the writer had his temporary place of business and had hung out his sign quid broker quietly he laid him down at the door watching until his master doth appear yah now mister quid do you spose that dog read that ere sign asked jim the hostler when i told him the story certain it is that he never was there before or sincebut yah do you spose that dog read that ere signquien sabe     addenda as many persons have never had the pleasure of an acquaintance with one of the family a brief description of his personal appearance c may be of interest to them his parental ancestor was a dog and his mother was a doggess both of them residents of the island of newfound land and bruce was their son in a di rect line of ancestry his color was brindle and white hair straight tail beautifully curled and he was pro    nounced by good judges to be as finely formed a dog as ever barked his weight was about seventyfive pounds as a watch dog he was verytfaithful and readily detected a strange footstep in the yard or about the premises in manners he was a gentleman never chasing cows or other animals and so seldom lifting up his voice that one of my opposite neighbors inquired one day if he could bark as he had lived in the neighborhood a half dozen years without ever hearing himi deed there was some reason to believe that when on his way from newfound land that his bark was on the sea and neglected to arrive when he did however he could bark loudly enough and was the first to give the alarm when burglars attempted to  break into the store next adjoining to  which allusion has been made he has always been a well behaved dog and had no enemies and even in passing by gorhams corner where for merly several men kept fighting dogs their masters took especial pains to prevent their attacking him for a dog of his weight he was very heavy but possessed an activity rarely seen in so large a dog and was very successful in killing rats against whom he waged a relentless warfare his appetite was good but never led him into appropriating what did not belong to him save in one instance previously mentioned he rarely staid out late o nights and was never known to be intoxicated as many puppies with only half the number of legs were    known to be and was a moral worthy member of society he was a splendid water dog swimming faster than any dog i ever saw and would undoubtedly have saved ever so many lives had he had an opportunity i omitted to mention that boys would sometimes give him their school books to carry for them but if they did were compelled to come to me in order to recover their property as he knew how to hold on strong two accomplishments he could not acquire although i took some pains to teach him one was to drive a horse and the other to wipe his feet on the door mat when they were muddy al though for several years he would wait patiently at the door when wet or  dirty not venturing to enter unless in vited in conclusion i would only add that everything narrated of him is strictly true and that it is far more probable that i have omitted some of his acts rather than overstated them t q gentle woman roused gentle woman roused a story of the temperance movemfent in the west reprinted from the hearth and home by rev e p roe author ofwhat can she do barriers burned away etc i thnk such action is unladylike unwoman ly and altogethei wrong said mrs elliot warmly  the idea of women marching in bands through the streets followed by a rab ble of rude men and boys the idea of refined ladies forcing their way into some filthy barroom full of obscene guz zling illomened looking loafers and kneeling on the to baccostained floor in audible prayer these temperanc movements always tend to fanaticism but this is a little worse than anything i have heard of yet must woman unsex herself and brave the most disgusting phase of pub licity mutst the pearls of religious feeling even in the most sacred form of prayer be cast before the swine that infest these low dens  the speaker was a young and very pretty lady who had lived in our town about a year indeed she had not been        gentle woman rottoed married much longer than that having come to us as a bride she was a fine type of the new england girl quite brilliant and ready in conversation very refined and high cultured a little opinionated but intense in her disgust at the pronounced phase of womans rights home is womans highest sphere she was wont to say  and there she can be the power behind and above the throne as we came to know her well we found that she possessed a warm heart and christian principle though not very obtru sive in manifesting either something of the coldness and repression of new england society tinctured her manner and made her seem a little formal at first in contrast with our free hearty western style  like too many of her sis ters instead of gaining hardiness from the bleak hills and chill winds of her early home she appeared a frail blossom that would ever need the shelter of the tenderest love and care her husband was a western man one who had grown up in our young city he was well connected of recognized ability as a lawyer and with a future before him of the fairest promise it had occasionally been whispered that he drank rather freely but no one had ever seen him the worse for it his lovely young wife seemed to possess boundless influence over aim and for the greater part of his first year of married life he had been very domestic but of late he spent his evenings out more frequently ex cusing his absence by saying that there were parties that c ould be seen in the way of business better at night than dring thecd y    gintle woman rousep          i had my fears but the wife suspected nothing  two or three of us were sitting socially with our work in her pretty parlor one afternoon when some remark on the strange temperance movement that had lately been developed led to mrs elliotts decided expression of opin ion with which i have commenced this brief record of an experience so different from my usual quiet life i will merely say to the reader that i am a middleaged widow lady quite alone in the world my home is next door to that of mrs elliott and from some secret affinity we had become very intimate years before my natural heart treasures had slipped from me and i in my loneliness found it very easy to love my young neighbor as a daugh ter through a side entrance we ran in and out of each others homes with perfect fireedom and often sat with our work together  this afternoon mrs judge ashman another intimate friend was also with us her only immediate response to mrs elliotts words was a deep sigh at last she said the evil grows so desperate i can scarcely wonder at any effort to counteract it though i must say with you that i can scarcely understand this one i do not see how a lady can go to such places as you describe i suppose only too truly but the trouble is the worst mischief isjnot done at these dens  many of our drinkingsaloons are elegant in all their appointments and are frequented by gentlemen  no matter answered mrs elliott almost hotly om aaly delicacy forbids tliatsh shouldl gotzue a        ggentle woman roused place they are frequented by roues and gamblers also whlo differ from the ragged loafers only in being better dressed in each case she is liable to insult and to see and hear things which to a pure refined woman are worse than blows id rather meet the coarse brutality of the dens than the contemptuous leers and mocking smiles of the gilded saloons what you say my dear seems perfectly true and i have always felt so myself but oh what can we do what can we do its dreadful to sit still with folded hands and see the havoc these places are making the pathos and distress in mrs ashmans voice were too deep to be caused by merely general appreciation of the evils of intemperance i had read the secret of the mothers trouble in the flushed and bloated face of one of her sons mrs elliott looked at her with a little surprise and said more quietly i agree with you it is a very great evil perhaps the greatest in our age but it is mans work to cope with it publicly women can help by making home so attractive that husbands fathers and brothers will find nothing that can tempt them abroad thank god i have never had much personal experience in ahis matter my husband takes a glass of wine when he feels like it and so did my father theres no more harm in that than in the use of tea and colffee no said mrs ashman with another deep sigh i suppose not if it would only end there again mrs elliott looked at her a little curiously and   gentle woman roused          changed the subject the early shadows of the coming winter evening soon after warned mrs ashman thlt she must be on her way homeward at mrs elliotts request i rentaied to tea her husband came in at the usual hour i do not wonder she half idolized the handsome darkeyed man with hs free andeasy western bearing refined by eastern culture for he had completed his studies at the east he certainly petted her to her hearts content but tonight he seemed a little preoccupied and excited after the meal was over he im mediately excused himself must you go out again this evening vinton asked his wife pleadingly indeed i must nellie its court week you know there are many lawyers in town and i have much on hand i heard her kiss him affectionately at the door as he de parted and thouglit it must be a stress of business indeed that would take a man from such a wife  but surely tlat kiss would be protection against every evil spell i sat with her till ten oclock we only spoke at inter vals for we had attained that true companionship that does not require constant talking i saw a dreamy far away look come into the young wifes eyes she was build icg bright castles in the future when her prospects of ma ternity would be realized in the supreme joy of mother love and her home be complete i did not offer to stay later than teaf for by so doing i might betray somewhat of the anxiety and boding of ill gentle woman roused that oppressed me i do not often have such feelings but am always in terror when i do for trouble has soon fol lowed my sittingroom was opposite her parlor where i knew she would watch and wait after lighting the gas i did not draw the curtains but sat down with my knitting where she could see me and so practically watched and waited with her when from a city steeple eleven was tolled out my neighbor grew restless when with solemn measured stroke midnight was announced i heard her side door open and her quick steps on the gravel i met her at the door dear mrs m   she exclaimed breathlessly how good of you to be up i half believe you have been watching with me vifnton has not come home yet what does it mean he never stayed out so late before she was shivering as with cold but it was the chill of fear i put my armns arouind her and said let us hope for the best my dear if you wish i will come and stay with you cplease do she half sobbed and then hastened back as if unwilling to be absent from her post a moment i was soon at her side and with her hand which trembled and fluttered like a frightened bird in mine we sat silently through another long hour like a knell one sounded from the steeple her hand closed convulsively upon mine and with an ashen face she turned and gasped oh if anything should happenif i shouldnt see him again   gentle woman roused        dont fear that i said hastily im sure you need not if he had been injured or sick you would have been sent for long before this what then can keep him she asked with a wild questioning look well i answered evasively looking away from her when lawyers get together they have a good deal to say and time passes more quickly than they think they may have had a little supper or something of the kind she shook her head decisively nothing of that kind would keep vinton from me espe cially now she said with emphasis another hour passed and she sprang up with such a frightened hunted look as i hope never to see in her sweet blue eyes again  come she said hoarsely  we must find him i shall go mad if i wait here in uncertainty but where shall we goi asked in dismay anywhere she cried desperately action nust take the place of this awful suspense i saw that she would go and prepared to follows but before we could assume some hasty wraps the doorbell rang she flew to open it her husband stumbled in and would have fallen had she not caught him it was a pitiable sight to see him leaning upon and clinging to her frail and trembling form as if she were a lamppost as the light streamed through the door i caught a glimpse of the glitter of a policemans star and then heard his gruff voice obgentle woman roused glad youre up magdam he needs looking after sure enough if it hadnt been for me he might liave met a foul death for i found him in the gutter this raw light true enough he was reeking with the filth of the street and besmearing the delicate fabric of his wiies dress as he clung to her but that wife would soon be in agony over deeper more loathsome stains its a lie hiccoughed her  husband in tones so differ ent from his usual clear manly voic e i was in a feather bed o god whats the matter with him gasped the wife well maam you are innocent  said the policeman in a not unkindly tone im sorry for you but do you really mean to say that you dont know hes drunk ill stay a bit and help you with him if you wish at the word  drunk she tottered a moment as if she would fall then by a great effort recovering herself said hoarsely no no go away i will take care of him stay let me thank you for bringing him home but in the name of mercy dont tell any one what you have seen the man made no promise as he departed and i shut the door srls m i am even sorry you are here i would iidle this from all the world would tlat i coullld litle it from heaven but i know i canll trust you what sliall l do with him this horrid unexpected scene at the door had found ue f          gentle woman rousen          both too bewildered to act and for a moment longer we looked helplessly at each other then her husband muttered whats the use standing here and he staggered into the parlor near the door stood a dainty little table with mrs elliotts bridal wreath and bouquet upon it encased in a glass coner he stumbled against this and fell with it crashing to the floor the warmth of the room with the excess of liquor that he had drunk now produced nausea and sickeninng to behold the flowers that had crowned his brides brow were now fouled literally even as his action had stained her fair pure name it was awfill it was horrible even to me beyond the power of words to express to see that proud refined gen tleman grovelling helplessly like a vile beast in his own filth in that sweet little parlor that dainty casket of hiss priceless jewel but what must it have been to his wife she did not faint as i feared or become hystericalbut the anguish of her look would melt a flinty heart with clasped hands she stood above her husband till he became somewlhat quiet as a pitying angel might oh the con trast she made to him oh the mighty triumph of love that she did not turn away in disgust as soon as she could she took his head in her lap and said in a low firm voice vinton how did it happen tell me all nothing  muchs happened he hiccoughed met some friends at harry hillstook little too muchthats all to      entle woman roused harry fills harry hills she muttered as if some lew lighct was dawning upon her i havie dwelt too long upon these painful scenes but they seem burnt in upon my memory and my mind will revert to thrum even though to think of them is torture he was not violent though somewhat obstinate and profane at last she got him to bed and he fell into heavy stupor as she returned to me in the diningroom where there was a fire i said i will not leave you tonight she thanked me by a silent pressure of my hand and we sat down to watch together as before but with the awful certainty of evil instead of its expectation in the depths of my soul i trembled for her she might stand one or two such shocks but the moment she lost faith in her hus bands will or power to refrain from the cause of his pre sent condition she would die her hold upon life was too fragile as it was she stepped to her husbands side from tirde to time and then came and sat down her brows were contracted as if in deep thought or the formation ofa purpose her eyes had a fixed solemn look that contrasted strangely with her fair young face at last she asked suddenly  where is this harry hills i told her morning came after a seeming age we had cleansed and righted the parlor as well as we could the cook got breakfast as usual and was told that her master was sick i tried to anticipate mrs elliott in obtaining the moining   gentle woman nuoitsed        paper from the newsboy but she was too quick for me with dilating eyes she scanned ihe eolumns then with a cry of anguish dropped the paper its all here she groaned and she writhed and wrung her hands as if in intense bodily anguish it was true enough and with an editorial paragraph of comment upon it a reporter of the paper was in the habit of feeing some of the nightguardians of the city forl any item of interest that came to their knowledge the policeman knew that this scandal of vinton elliott would be well paid for and he was not the man to lose several dollars on any sentimental grounds  even the night editors sensibilities seemed shocked over the affair for he had written  things have come to a sad pass when such men as elliott get down in the streets if the praying and sinig ing women can do us any good they had better come at once harry hills establishment with all its style is one of the most mischievous places in town etc after a few moments she again seized the paper coh leave it alone i cried youve had more thavf you can endure now i am not a child she answered almost fiercely i intend to know and face the worst of this matter and with a white stern face she read every word arid then sat for a few moments with the old thoughtful onitractioin of brow suddenly she started up with a look of fixedi pur pose and asked         how long do you think he will sleep       gentle woman roused several hours then come with me where to mrs judge ashmans the judges family was sitting down to breakfast when we arrived why mrs elliott and mrs m  too exclaimed that good lady in unfeigned surprise what is the mat ter surely this is not a social call no said mrs elliott impetuously it is not mrs ashman i take back all i said about ladies going to liquor saloons in order to break them up if they can i am going to harry hills today if i go alone he about the same as murdered my husband last night and she briefly told her story i am going there this very morning she continued he must resist a wifes prayers and a wifes curses if he sells my husband one drop more will you go with me mrs ashmans features were working with deep emo tion but the stately judge now joined us from the dining room and remonstrated really mrs elliott i greatly sympathize with you for i have read the painful account in the morning paper but i hope you will do nothing rash you will only expose yourself to insult and accomplish nothing perhaps you may obtain some legal redress with a dignity and impressiveness which even he had never possessed upon the bench the aroused wife silenced him with a gesture   gentle woman roused          you are not equal to this matter judge ashman she said nor are your legal forms during the past night i have seen my own grave open and in it buried life youth happiness what is far worse i have seen the yawling grave of my husband and i know it to be the mouth of hell and do you ask me to go to law about such matters harry hill and his kind are digging these graves i never realized it before surely he does not unless he is a fiend he will cease his vile traffic when i tell him the truth i tell you i will go if i go alone you may as well ask the lightning not to strike when the storm is at its height george cried mrs ashman in a voice of anguish how often has your own son been drunk at that same harry hills the judge turned pale and abruptly left the room you shall not go alone continued mrs asi man sobbing on mrs elliotts shoulder  a score of women that i know of smitten by this terrible curse will go with you if you will lead the way some are rich and some are poor but we all have common ground in this matter i will send them word after a little consultation it was arranged that we should start from mrs judge ashmans at eleven much as i shrank from the undertaking i determined to remain at the side of my beloved mrs elliott we called on a few per sonal friends and stated our purpose but so far from join ing us they seemed dismayed at the very idea mrs elliott then returned to her unconscious husband one look at him seemed to turn her delicate frame iito gentle woman roused steel and at a little before eleven she walked to mrs ash nans with as firm a tread asever a soldier marched into battle i shall never forget the group we found assembled in the judges parlor there were young faces present besides that of mrs elliott but all were pale and lined with care all were solemn with an earnest purpose and touched with the pathos of suffering ladies this is mrs elliott said mrs ashman simply all rose to receive their leader and she assumed control with the simplicity and dignity which only noble natures can attain in the main you are strangers to me she said  but our common danger and our common wrong knit oursouls together as one the evil which threatens our lives and homes has grown so desperate that it seems to require a desperate remedy it is a terrible cross for us weak timid women to go on this mission it brings back to us the days of martyrdom yesterday i thought i would die rather than do this now i feel that i would die if i did not go for a dearer life than mine is in peril i believe that i but imperfectly express the feelings of each one here god seems to be enabling our sisters in other places to save their dear ones in his name let us go forth to like rescue and before we go let us kneel to him in silent prayer for help and guidance we kneltbut the prayer was not silent there were sobs and groans and involuntary cries at last we sallied forth pale but as determined a little                        gentle woman roused hlz phalanx as ever assaulted a deathswept breach it was sleeting but we carried no umbrellas this was not a pleasure excursion we marched as soldiers do our appearance upon the street soon attracted attention people spoke hurriedly and excitedly together by thunder its broke out here i heard one man exclaim where will they strike first harry hills as you live was answered for thats vint elliotts wife aleadin the news spread fast and soon we had an ample but non descript following still the crowd was respectful the worst man who had caught a glimpse of mrs elliotts face could not have been otherwise by turning a corner we came suddenly upon the entrance of hills saloon there was a bustle within as if they would lock the door against us but we were too prompt for them and entered the crowd thronged in after us and with those already there filled the place completely mrs elliott advanced at once to the bar and we grouped ourselves around herand such a group as had never been seen in our city before where is mr hill asked our leader il a firm voice the bartender stared at her a moment in blank dismay and then called mr hill here quick yes tell him to come said mrs elliott c what does this mean asked mr hill appearing from an inner room with a face on which surprise and anger con tended for the mastery he was a florid lowbrowed  gentle woman roused thickset man showily dressed and with a hard sinister eye after one glance at him i hoped little from mrs elliotts appeal i turned to look at the crowd for a moment in order to see on whose side their sympathy would assert itself but the expression at this time was nainly one of eager curiosity and excitement but imagine my unmea sured surprise when i saw a side door open and viiiton elliott appear overlooking the scene with a white appalled face but all were too intent on the scene before them to note his entrance for with a voice that trembled and yet with dignity mrs elliott had commenced speaking mr hill you have the form and semblance of a man and we give you the credit of possessing the heart of one you cannot realize the results of your traffic as we poor women can whose homes you are destroying whose hearts you are breaking what is life to us if our fathers our brothers our sons our husbaczds oh how her voice thrilled at that word go down into the darkness and infamy of a drunkards grave can you not see that such life would be to us but living death and prolonged agony and yet not for ourselves are e pleading but for those whom you are destroying perhaps we may find a heaven hereafter but they cannot you poison body and soul at once we are desperate in view of the peril of those we love yesterday there was not in all the city a more proud and happy woman than hhappy in my home happy in my husband happy in my hopes for the future proud of his rich pro mise and good name but now my heart is breaking oh how it has ached since you sent him staggering to me   gentle woman roused         long past midnight what but hellbroth could have so clanged my noble manly husband yesterday all honored htim today the finger of the town will be pointed at him oh believe me sir a few dollars cannot pay you for in flictin all this shame and misery i beseech you sir pro mise me that you will never sell another drop of the ac cursed poison there was a momentary and a deathlike silence and then hill with difficulty found his brazen voice now look here madam he began ive got my rights as well as you and other people this is my business youve no right here interfering with it these are my premises youve no right here without my consent you all make yourselves liable to indictment for trespass be sides it ant the right thing for ladies to go tramping through the streets followed by a rabble and meddling with things that dont concern them it isnt ladylike its fanat iush in a word answer me cried mrs elliott in a voice that went to every heart like an arrow will you not promise me never to sell my husband another glass of liquor no shouted hill nor any other womans husband i will promise to sell to all wholl pay there was a sudden hoarse murmuring on the part of the rowd  hut in a moment it was hushed for the insulted wife hadi knelt on the floor before the bar we all dropped on our knees around her  god she pleaded in a tone that must have thrilled       entlb woman roused the very goul of the most hardened present  shall human love and human anguish plead before thee in vain art thou not a god of mercy and yet cruelty is crushing us art thou not a god of justice and yet we are being robbed of all that makes life endurable thou didst stop the mouth of lions here in our christian land are human hearts more savage thou didst preserve in the furnace seven times heated beneath our church spires burns the more remorseless and destructive passion of avarice wilt thou not break the stony heart before us and bend his stubborn will to thine thou knowest that because of our love we could die for our dear ones but we believe that thou dost love them even more wilt thou not in mercy change their destroyers into men wilt thou not take this awful soul killing temptation out of their path we plead in the name of thy dear son who gave his life for us all amen strange to say there was a responsive  amen  from the rough crowd that would have done honor to a metho dist classmeeting and as i looked around on rising i saw many eyes wet with tears where i had expected only looks of scorn i did not dare meet mr elliotts eye though he remained standing spellbound in the doorway still but the tragedy went forward without a moments pause mrs elliott took a step neater the rumseller pointed up with an impressive gesture and bent upon him a look such as i never saw on a womans face before for a mirror in the bar opposite revealed her form and features perfectly and gave her back to the audience as a startling   gesntle woman roused        picture hill tried to meet her eye but could not for his sank guiltily and confusedly to the floor mr hill she said in a low gentle voice it was so pene trating and aweinspiring conce more i ask you i beseech you answer me as you will wish you had answered when we stand before his judgmentseat will you not cease this dreadful business a deathlike hush followed hill was evidently cowed and overcome and after a moment mumbled out its not in man to resist you madam i promise i will not sell any more to your husband though he will get it elsewhere if he wants it i think its a pity he cant stand up for himself without sending his wife around apraying and beseeching for him give way there cried vinton elliotts voice and he sprang down from the raised doorstep and struggled to ward siswfet  there were murmurs and ejaculations of intense excitement on the part of the crowd as this new element entered into the drama and all gave way before him mrs elliott started and trambled violently at his voice and the moment he reached her clung to his alrm and hid her face sobbingly on his shoulder all her won derful nerve and selfcontrol seemed gone in a clear ringing tone elliott said mr hill you have spoken some true words this morn ing this is no place this is no adtionfor ladies like my wife and other honored women that i see here and be lieve me they would not be here if you and i and our like had not driven them todesperation god knows you have       gentle woman roused enough to answer for but you only are not to blame you cant force us to throw away our money and manliood here if half is true of what i have read concerning myself in the morning paper i wonder that my wife did not leave me for ever in utter disgust instead of that with womans faithfulness she comes here to plead for my safety but she will never be called to pass through such an ordeal again i thought i could drink in moderation at your bar as i had for years but you have taught me better sir vinton elliott can stand alone but he will stand aloof from you and your kind god and you fellowcitizens be my witnesses that i will drink no more and may he palsy my hand if it ever raises another glass of liquor to my lips mrs elliott gave a low glad cry i make no apology for what occurred last night he continued the case admits of none i deserve your contempt but it can not exceed that which i have for my self were it not for my wife and the hope of retrieving my character i would gladly die hurrah three cheers for elliott who faces the matter like a man cried a voice from the crowd and they were given with good will mrs judge ashman now came forward and said mr hill this wont answer my son is as dear to me as mrs elliotts husband to her we all represent some imperilled member of our households you must promise to quit the business altogether in our city do you see that asked a pale thin woman a me chanics wife and she lifted her hair and showed an ugly   gentile woman roused         scar across her temple my own husband once so kind and good gave me that blow it went in deep it nearly cost me my life but it made a deeper scar on my heart people must stop selling rum to my husband or i canlt live i feel that i will do something desperate ol please do promise mr hill pleaded a meeklook ing little woman with streaming eyes my only son has come home drunk twice of late and he says he got the liquor here now look here ladies said mr hill trying to work himself into a passion  business is business a man must live ive stood this longer now than he was interrupted by a tall gaunt woman who strangely reminded me of the stern old prophets withouta word ofprelude she stepped forward and commenced singing in a weird minor key thou who for humanity wept blood at every pore we come in kindred agony thy mercy to implore l must we for aye sigh hopelessly in worse than egypts bonds must we despairing helplessly endure destroying wounds most fearful is our enemy fc when he strikes a blow two hearts are pierced and perishing a household stricken low        rentld woman rovuso oh i give to us thy sympathy awake thine arm of power shake off the nations apathy proclaim the battlehour mr hill said mrs judge ashman  we propose to stay here till you make us this promise unless you thrust us forth with violence let him try that if he dares cried a dozen voices from the crowd hill considered a few moments and then said well madam ive thought it overindeed i thought it over before you came for i expected this infernal move ment would break out here i have an establishment in new york state and theyll stand good liquor such as i sell there to the end of the chapter ill go there for the present and stop selling here till this thundergust blows over this is the best promise ill make if you stay here a month so please vacate and ill put up my shutters after a brief consultation the ladies concluded it was the best they could do and there were those of their number who wished to visit other saloons by this time the strain upon mrs elliotts delicate frame had been too long and severe and she grew very white and faint her husband had urged her to go home with him at once but she had refused to leave her companions after having gained her own point but now she sank helplessly in his arms and he carried her to an adjacent drugstore sent for a carriage and we were soon in the blessed refuge of her home        gentle woman roused        but before an hour passed her pulse grew quick and her cheeks feverish the husband hung about her in an agony of solicitude after doing what i could i left them thinking they were better alone when the evening shadows gathered as i was sitting in my room by the light of the fire mr elliott entered unan nounced and said o mrs m i fear nellie is going to be sick and he gave way to such an agoony of grief as i never saw convulse a mans frame before i came and put my hand on his shoulder but only said god help you both at last he said now im better please stay with her while i go for the doctor for a week vinton and i have watched at nellies bed side her mind has wandered all the time and night and day she is pleading for and with her husband he has scarcely slept or ate his raven hair is becoming streaked with gray his ruddy cheeks are growing pale and wan and his every

sleepless anxiety and was careworn jand thoughtful on that morning my father always had a thought ful look i never saw him smile and i wondered at it for i  i             some passages in the life of

innocent occasion of her death she had gone a birth and a death at the same hour the house of joy con verted into the house of mourning chapter ii my school experience and what i learned there the schoolhouse was oated just outside of the corporatee lim its of the city i wa then proud to caw my birthplace it was a neat log building scarce fifteen feet by twenty consisting of a single room there was a green plot in front of the door and what was known as the lawn stretched out in the rear enter aeoffrey junker esq               ing the house early in the morning before the pedagogue had mounted his chair of state you might have discovered a state of affairs somewhat resembling the condition of bedlam and babel combined here mounted on a stool just three feet high stood a promising young lad of the same height bawling out a command at the top of his voice to another to keep quiet while in an opposite direction two qrthree little urchins were exercising their milseles at the expanse of each others bones these were occasionally relieved by outcries resemthing cat calls and the like emanating from different quarters of the spacious building suddenly as in a flash you would discover the tumilt cease and die away into a singsong tone as each little urchin took his place to hum over the morning recitation mr thomson the teacher was a jovial old man scarce turned of fty who had preserved his good spirits and gee d temper amazingly well in view of the trials they had severally ampncoun tered lie had no taste for extra exertion and this was one of the reasons assigned by the boys for his entire absence of an ger save on the most provoking occasions i do not remember ever to have seen him maci lut once and then strange to say it was a pure mistake the boys had a habit of ducking each other at certain seasons of the year unfortunately the ped agogue was mistaken for one of these mischievous urchins and as he entered his schoolroom he was saluted with a bucket full of water which ran down his savory person leaving his phiz and his person a b spectacle for gods and men  the poor little boy whose mischief it was trembled like an aspen leaf on the occasion and barely escaped the rod and his coumpan ionsone and allwere soundly berated upon the practice and strictly enjoined to abandon it from that day forward and              some passages in the life of

had  passed beyond the limited period of long clothes and spie the en my aunt who had had me under her pupilage these ten years i was sent to school on the fearful morning in which i as ushered into the pr  sence of the pedagogue my knees smote each other with terr r and i could with difficulty utter a word but the ordeal passed the day wore quickly away and i felt there was nothing so horrible in going to school after all at school it wasat this little village schoolthat j coin meuced the first serious business pursuit of my life and the exact character of ii pursuit may be guessed at when i in form you my son that the old village schools were the resort of both sexes where boys and girls were allowed to mingle in the fray together already had the girls been parcelled off to their respective admirers and there was not one of the fair sex who had not her especial protector among the other there was little polly dawson scarce entered upon her fifth tear with as much of the shrewdness and quickness in discern ing the times and seasons as her elder sister at home who had been caressed and courted by the entire town and polly had her admirer tooa boy not half my age little jack dowdyfor that was his name and a name he was never ashamed og was the son of the parson who has been already introduced little jack loved polly and polly loved jack and it was every where agreed that polly and jack were suited to each other at the time i entered it fortunately happened that a little fairy had just been transported to the city from a gcoffcy clinker esq  neighboring county and was to be entered this was my sole chance for every other of the girls had been claimed and won betsy was the name of the fair one to attempt a description of this child at this distant period with the feeble pen and fee bler intellects of an old man might seem like childs play but her image on the day on which she entered the schoolroom is as distinctly painted in my mind as if i had her now before me betty wore a pink calico dress neatly tucked with a white apron just ieaching the hem of her frock her hair was parted in the middle and fell in auburn ringlets about her shoulders cr manner was brisk half hesitating half ad vancing she would speak in a uick but quiet manner and every thing she said or did was with rapidity and ease she had the merriest laugh i have ever heardand it was this which first woke within me so much admiration i may say love for the little fairy betty carried to school a little bag in which she put her books and refreshments and i usually did myself the honor tc carry them home for her i was in love chapter iii childhood its love it is a foolish thingthis childish love it scarcely deserves the name but why is childish love a folly if it be then love itself is a folly altogether if in the first gushing out of exis tence while the heart is yet in its virgin youth and the rank weeds have not overgrown it it may not lovewhen shall it first begin to experience the emotion of affection does the ivy wait until the chills of winter have blasted its vigor or the summers sun has burnt and destroyed its vitality before it k          ome pasages in the

tered the rude blasts of the wintry storm before it clasps at least in memory and in thought the object of its early adora tion grant that the object is not always a proper one can the affection of the mature claim that it never errs we love we know not why and the instinct of the chibji which teaches it to love may claim a direeter guidance as emanating more immediately from the source and fountain of all true love i do not believe that childish love is an improper passion when but a child with the face of betty brown daguerreotype on my thoughts this truth was an axiom and needed no rea soning to support it and though many many years have rolled by between these youthful experiences and the time at which i write and many many sad clouds have passed over my spirit and the world

the tenderness and soli citude of a sister i verily believe that to her kind attentions and assiduous care i owed my life this from a comparative stranger was too much for one constituted as i was

who should pop in just while i wa setting there but the gentleman himself in a decent sort of way ii ot up and offered him a seat when he flew in a passion and asked who the deuce i was and what i was

was never treated so before and i have been to white folks houses ever seuce i knowed myself poor miss betsy  she was mighty mortified when she heard me tell on it but the man was in liquor and i suppose he was somewhat excusable on that account and if he had stopped there after driving me out i should have been better satisfied but he actually ordered me to be whipped and those rude niggers  caught hold of inc and stripped me tearing the white sleeve of my coat and whipped inc like a rogue and now while i  think on it mr old coat is getting much th worse for wear mass clinker and if you

absolutely necessary to the current of my history it was not long after the hero of the grey coat had narrated to me the unfortunate accident which befel him when the same coat played a distinguished part on another and more satisfac tory occasion to its owner parson dowy as his manner was was about to give his annual feast of good things to his parish ioners in the shape of a superb dining party it wouldibe no discredit to a better preacher than himself to say that these an nual festivals were much more highly prized than he weekly feasts which hamp was in the habit of dispensing from the village church we are apt to value a thing in proportion to its rarity and when the parson invited the parish to come t his annual feast for the body they all caineas to his weeklies they were rather slimly atteded for fear that some one might accuse the people of that period of great lack of piety on this account i may just add that in this regard they all strictly followed th  aeoffrey clinker esq example of their preacherit being a xell understood fact that parson dowdy himself as partial as he was to his wn nd his double and the village church was a little more partial to a good dinner or a glass of claret but away with discussions of the sort the parsons party was to come off shortly and as a matter of course jim bowers was in demand jim did him selfjustice on the occasion it was beyond all question the best dinner ever gotten up in that locality and the praises of our guest and the hero of the great coat were sounded on all hands the feast was a feast of fat things and the entire parish i e its inhabitants young and old flocked to the parsnage to partake of its hospitable cheer could i daguerreotype the scene for you  in y son you would have a full length portrait of my native  village in the year  done up in its handsomest colors of k course every body wore his smiles that day my little friends jack and polly were in the merriest mood jack was always  something of a wag but his peculiar excellences in that line never shone more brightly than on that occasion here was a couple deeply immersed in the mysteries of small talk and k over there a plain honest old planter was holding forth on the k virtues of his tobacco crop evidently elated by the news of the last       which had just reached him  he had a copy of k the gazette in his pocket here a gentleman with a red face wasdiscussing the relations of the colonies to the crown and just opposite a bevy of girls were amusing themselves and their ieghbors by charades and conundrums occasionally interrup

top ped for an instant to admire robert himself was clad in his usually simple attire and seemed to be in a more cheerful mood than usual in a few moments i found myself engaged in earnest

desperately taken with jim on his first visit in this region of country all day long they would snap at each other without the slightest conceivable cause and as judy was our washer woman and dinah the cook they were each mutually gratified with frequent opportunities to annoy the other dinah was the better looking but judy so jun had heard was possessed of the more ample fortune i e the latter could boat a new teas ter and bureau and the former had neither of these very useful articles jim was therefore at a standstill between the rival candidates for his person and honors one visit he would be stow more favors on dinah and the next he would flatter judy and in this manner lie succeeded for a series of months in keeping those charmers in the delightful state of anxiety and humor incident to such occasions thus far jim had been  is ii sjth a iv ill some passages in the life of              without a contestant for the honors of either hayl but sud denly as if by magic a host

furnished with a poor miser able pallet a rickety old chair an which the man was sittinga common deal table and an old battered and worn out trunk on which sat a mug of beer the bloated countenance and the haggard look with the deep seams and wrinkles on his brow showed plainliy the effects ofintempertnce and dlssipation while the wild eye and the indescribable desolationalmost despairof his

on but the flowing nightdress and as the lurid flames circled higher and higher nearer and close to her person enveloping in its scorching cloud her slight and beauteous form she looked like a being

months and his years had flown from him though his ravuygs cursings and mournful cries were terrible to hear yet still that lovely watcher sat by his bedside ever ready to soothe and to bless after a

dischver ed strange it is that love is such a t   telltale thlat it can never keep its own i  secrets hardly for a daybu it must by some deep mantngr blush or rosy tinted shame disclose oft to its very    object thc lbeavenborn passion which   has just begun to be part of the exist ence hubert and ella rode along over hill and dale but neither felt like breaking the silence till ella spoke they rpust return they were k riding too farthen a silence and hub ert said eela p what was the onlv answer then another long pause ella i love you hubert whispered and bu ried his ace in his handsbut it was her turn now to tremble and when he gathering courage as he proceec ed lifted his head and told her of the many times he had longed and prayed for some one to love and that in find ingher his lifelove had rested and how amidl his sickness it had sustained and comnforted him and without she could return his love his life was the same desert blank it ever had been his heart was hlers would she re ect it and then ella all weeping in her innocence could not but own she loved him too howlovingly she told him how she had watched his fevered face and brushed back hisdark loclksq u fromn his hot brow but she had dons it  willingly for she could never forget   cv  that he periled his life to save hers and that then she loved him aye and had ever since and should ever though the world stands between and then he told her of his dream of the angel that beckoned him on ever in his sleeping hours who was no longer ideal but a real angel beside    him then a dark cloud came across her countenance and she spoke of his past life and sobbed as t ough her heart would break as shed touched on the gloomy days hle must lave gone through and the dismal life he had led away from home with no mother or sister or loved ones around him and he wept too the scalding tears would come and then he called on    high heaven to witness that he was    and would beevermore a better wis er and purer man and tfien they both plighted hands and hearts aganand so they were betrothed the pony had slackened his pace but as slow as he went they were at home long before they wished to be with beaming eyes ella hastened to x communicate the intelligence to her father and mother they both ap   peared startled and surprised and not altogether pleased and ella was dis mayed that her father spoke so scorn fully ella why did you not ask our ad vice ere you gave yourself away why were you so rash ip hubert must never marry you why dear father i love him is it wrongno my dear ella and a look of sadness covered his counte nancebut our ella must not be a drunkards wife  from that moment ella commenc ed living a new life a life of earnest hopeful work all the love and ener gy of her being was

money would produce swiftness on the part of his carriers as he walked up tile long path from the gate of the park to the house he was struck with the des olate appearance of the house and its adjuncts everything proclaimed in silent but moving language that the master was sick hubert gently op ened the front door put the quick ear of love lad heard his step on the walk and he was met at

in the office of the librarian of congress at washington salutation shall home missions be encouraged the following memoirs were written with a view of touching the hearts of my fellow creatures at the reasonable price of ten cents a creature my ultimate object is to raise wind enough for mrs skinner to sail to church in a new spring bonnet my suggestion that she might buy a stylish secondhand article on salem street was met with scorn and contumely in which the mophandle joined mrs skinner is a sensitive plant and it is hard for her to be obliged to stay in the house sundays because she has nt got any spring bonnet and see the baxters and the mudgetts and the bensons appear out in their new things in buying this little book you also help lift a load of sorrow from the heart of a man who is utterly crushed by the dangerous illness of a motherinlaw and the probable departure of a tableboarder bless you bless you m s mose skinners bridal tour and other sketches mose skinners bridal tour they say a man can love but once but i dont believe it i have loved twice already and i am just as fresh and just as artless as i ever was in case my second wife the present mrs skinner should confer upon me the full title of widower by dropping off or make me a brevet widower by running away with another man i know i could love a third wife just as dearly as i did my first love when i found shed got money in the bank love is a pretty nice thing provided you can court thats the slickest part of it by a good deal like all good things though it is fearfully overdone when i went courting for instance i never thought of staying till after ten oclock and only went twice a week now they go seven nights in a week and cry because there aint eight then they write touching notes to each other during the day dear george do you love me as much now as you did at quarter past twelve last night say you do dearest and it will give me courage to go down to dinner and tackle them cold beans left over from yesterday well well let em court its their best hold and the longer they keep it up the more happiness they can look back to for after theyve stood up before the minister things begin to change mrs skinner has altered sadly since we got married if you could see her polishing me off with the mophandle or sending me to bed without my supper you would nt think there was a time when she sat on my knee very bashful and smoothed my hair and called me her tootsy pootsy no you would nt but she used to do that very nice and i felt like a two year old colt behind a band of music now i feel like an army mule drawing a load of pig iron up a steep hill im baldheaded and have to do chamber work im obliged to go to bed early cold winter evenings to get the bed warm and get up any time in the night to warm milk for the twins and lots of other things that i cant bear to think of my only consolation is that i may outlive her but when i see her walloping the children with a heavy hand or abusing the neighbors from the back doorstep in select language i dont know about it im afraid shes got too much robustness to pass away at present we had nt been married a week before my nose was on the grindstone and mrs skinner was turning the crank in a lively style she commenced operations by saying we must go on a bridal tour right straight off i told her with dignity that i preferred not to she laughed sort of hysteriky and said she did nt care what i preferred she was going and i was going too usually when she was traveling she said she wouldnt have a man round but she wanted me under training and so shed concluded to take me along she finished by ordering me to march up stairs and get ready i saw immediately that she was inclined to put on airs and i resolved to take her down at once i did nt want to be hard on her but i considered it a duty matilda said i sternly you dont know your place you seem to forget that i am now your lord and master not if i know myself you aint said she mrs skinner i replied you are fearfully demoralized you need reorganizing at once you are cranky and i brandished my new sixtytwo cent umbrella wildly around her head she looked at me for a minute with a sort of pitying smile i pity you said she because you dont know enough to see that youd better give in at once you cant make any points with me the man whos going to boss matilda baxter aint cut his eyeteeth yet then she took the umbrella away from me and locked me up in the clothes press when mrs skinner means business she dont dillydally about it she is a very smart woman the baxters are all a dreadful smart family her grandmother lived to be over ninety and done the work for fortythree boarders up to the last day and died in the act of frying flapjacks for the whole lot and when her grandfather was eightyseven he could walk forty miles without spectacles and read the finest print without a cane there aint any such folks nowadays our gals think its beneath em to iron a shirt or make a loaf of bread so they rattle the piano or walk the streets with their furbelows and feathers pretending to get mad if a young chap looks at em pretty hard but getting mad in earnest if he dont and as for the young men they aint worth bringing up instead of settling down to some honest manly business like their fathers before them they rush off to the city in pursuit of some genteel business where they can wear pretty clothes and not tumble their hair but to return to that clothespress mrs skinner kept me there about two hours and then asked me through the keyhole if i had come to my senses if i had i could go up stairs and change my clothes my wife is a woman of few words except when she gets to talking and so i went with may wife on that bridal tour see engraving in fact i wanted to go all the time for i was always noted for going on scrapes i dont pretend to say how many times i took my first wife out to see the engine squirt and there was no end to the free lectures we used to attend and the sewing circles too the neighbors used to say well it does beat all how them skinners do go and when signor blitz gave her a complimentary ticket to see his wonderful canaries i not only sold that ticket for my wife but i gave her half i the money but i wont brag of it for i dont think any man ought to get married till he can consider his wifes happiness only second to his own i intended to tell all about that bridal tour but i cant bring myself to dwell on it and so i keep wandering we were gone about too weeks i believe and i guess we had a very good time the fact is i was out of my head part of the time and dont remember much about it i know i lost twenty pounds and i am quite sure mrs skinner gained at least forty she came back improved in health and i found out before shed been in the house twentyfour hours that shed gained in strength also i dont say how i found it out i simply say i found it out it might be inferred from the above that mrs skinner is a hardhearted virago but she is not on the contrary she is full of charity and kindness of heart she gave my boys permission to go barefooted up to the first of december and insisted on it so much in her kind way that they could nt refuse she fairly dotes on my children and ive seen her many a time go to their trowsers packet and take out their pennies after theyd got to sleep and put them in her bureau drawer for fear they might lose them there aint any discount on mrs skinner after all a popular summer resort about the middle of may last i received a letter from my old friend bill j of vermont requesting to see me on particular business i thought id go for i longed to look upon his dear old face again and he offered to pay my expenses besides i found bill waiting for me at the depot and glad to see me the old chap still looks intellectual and can get away with his three square meals a day in a style that defies competition well my boy what business do you want me on said i as i stretched myself luxuriantly on the doormat in bills elegantly furnished cellarkitchen and watched the smoke as it curled lazily upward from my fragrant shortsix which was imported by bill directly from havana at a dollar and a quarter a hundred its this he replied you remember the old tarbox house over to c dont you i told him i did well he went on it was sold at auction last week and i bought it for a mere song but i dont know what to do with it now ive got it its a rickety old coop and leaks like a sieve nobody would live there anyhow for its close by cat swamp the last family died off in about a year and a half sposen i fix it up a little and advertise it as a popular summer resort setting forth its superior advantages in very large type pure water invigorating climate and all that sort of thing do you think twould pay it would i replied if you only charge big prices enough i can put on a cheap piazza continued bill raise it a story and double the number of rooms by running a partition through each one the old millpond close by will do for the elegant lake with unrivalled scenery and a couple of old pungboats will furnish the numerous facilities or enjoying the rare fishing which abounds in this locality but there aint a fish within twenty miles said i of course there aintbut this is only the advertisement and now i want you to help me get it up so we went to work and in a short time produced the following country boardthe famous resort known as tarbox villa is now open to the public for the summer season it has been noted for years for its wonderfully pure air exquisite landscapes and general healthfulness the hotel is supplied with two marbletopped washstands in every room together with twentyfive pianos for the use of guests every room is carpeted two inches thick with carpeting manufactured by mr brussels himself troupes of french and english servants glide noiselessly about anticipating the guests slightest wish the view from the piazza is exquisitely beautiful rivalling in gorgeous splendor the farfamed fairy lands of the east the eye takes in thousands of verdureclad hills from whose summits can be seen hundreds of prosperous farms and thriving villages with their church spires glistening in the sun the fishing is immense at crystal lake within ten minutes walk of the hotel thousands of trout gambol slyly about and by their fascinating wiles tempt the angler from his elegant easychair in the gentlemens sittingroom there are also plenty of other beautiful lakes close by in whose transparent depths the finny tribe largely congregate the boating is unrivalled in addition to numerous small craft the proprietors have lately purchased two superb yachts which speed the waters like a thing of life filled with laughing groups of beautiful and accomplished ladies other amusements are abundant including horseback riding the honest farmers in this locality lend their horses and refuse to take any pecuniary consideration now about the healthful climate said bill dont we want to make that rather strong a good many people are down on east winds you know some like em said i i know it he replied and so i dont know what to say sposen i say east winds never blow in this climate except by special request of the guests but we finally concluded to have it this way the climate here is unusually healthy the only funeral for the past ten years is the case of a man who fell from a meetinghouse steeple and was instantly killed there are no east winds here and the oldest inhabitant cannot remember a northeast storm is that all inquired bill no said i you must have in something about its being a resort for invalids a mineral spring or patent bath or something of that sort would do the business well said he hows this there is one of the finest mineral springs in the united states close by the house it has already cured thousands of sufferers afflicted with every known disease and some who never drank water at all now hanker for this large numbers of invalids come here every summer and go away rejoicing in health restored some come fearfully emaciated and hobbling on crutches who in a weeks time throw away their crutches and play leapfrog to take down their fat that will do i replied and now lets wind up by how to get to tarbox villa all the respectable railroads in the country run without change of cars direct to tarbox villa through one of the most imposing landscapes on this continent the last time i heard from bill his house was full and he was making money hand over fist people with elegant airy mansions in the best portion of our great city were flocking down to this den of his because they were humbugged by this newspaper advertisement they dont expose it as theyd ought to for when a person gets humbugged he generally keeps still about it in hopes others will get humbugged too its too bad and im sorry i helped bill on mose skinner as a drummer about a year ago i made a great discovery nothing more nor less than that wonderful root from which is made skinners chain lightning tonic that providential remedy which has already cured every disease known to the civilized world and stands ready to do it again its a beautiful tonic and it ought to be for it is ninety per cent whiskey what the public want nowadays is something tonicky without going into a barroom after it theres lots of very respectable men who wouldnt be seen drinking a glass of whiskey for the world but theyll swill down medicine by the gallon because it is called on the label a root and herb tonic for family use sons of temperance can drink all they want to of it for it will not only build their constitutions right straight up but itll make em feel nice and boozy without breaking any pledge for a spell it sold firstrate but some other patent medicine men got hold of my secret and soon the market was flooded with tonic at a dollar a bottle and called by all sorts of names so in order to make anything i had to use poorer whiskey and the result was my business sort of run down i tried every trick and dodge that i could think of and even went so far as to have my picture taken and stuck in the windows of all the cigar shops and apothecary stores with my name underneath dr moses skinner the good samaritan but it didnt work and so i was reduced to the last extremitythat of drumming i hated to be a drummer for our family was always considered respectable but i had a great deal of tonic on hand and i did nt want to see it wasted so i joined that noble body of men the drummers of boston who go broadcast over the land like a ravenous swarm of locusts devouring every green thing and waylaying innocent storekeepers with samples and impudence the first place i struck was portland portland is a very pretty city and is mostly occupied by drummers from boston occasionally a few of these rioters are arrested but the next train brings a reinforcement who leave their samples at a hotel and go round seeking whom they may devour after which they drink each other blind and write home how dull business is it would take volumes to describe a genuine drummer none of your wishywashy kind but a regular howler who knows a thing or two and is up to snuff at the hotel where i stopped there were fifty guests fortynine of whom were drummers the other one informed me privately that he used to be but seeing that it was slowly bringing his mothers grey hairs in sorrow to the grave he altered his dissolute course and he is now an honored shoemaker in lynn i went into the hotel that night with the intention of retiring early but i paused as my eye took in the scene around the stove were seated seventeen as beautiful drummers as you could wish to feast your eye on they represented ever thing from a patent washing machine to a rubber doll that would squeak they were all smoking pipes varying in size from a waterpail to a butterfirkin and each was trying with a christian fortitude that was simply heroic to come as near the spittoon as possible without going indistance seven feet they were beguiling the time in pleasant anecdotes of the days experience i sold old wapsle a bill today said one but i had to draw my revolver on him before i could do it what do you mean said i do you carry a revolver o lord aint he green he replied turning to the others of course we do said he all drummers carry em we couldnt sell any goods if we didnt we call em persuaders and when i get mine loaded shes good for six customers thats what we call commanding trade the last time i was down to lewiston said another i asked slammer to come up to the hotel and look at my samples and he said he would but he tried to sneak by without my seeing him of course i wasnt going to stand no such nonsense as that you know so i goes out and collars him he swore he didnt want any goods but i knew better so i got another fellow to help me and we just gagged him and carried him up the back way i locked him in and kept him there two days before he came to his oats but i fetched him finally he may think im a flat but i wasnt born yesterday o the storekeepers are getting meaner than dirt said another the last time i sold old borax down to bangor there were twentythree of us waiting for him to come back from dinner he saw us and tried to hide in the basement we put after him and opened our samples he gave a yell and rushed up stairs just as he was going through the scuttle a fellow bawled out that he was selling half cost twenty per cent off but borax stopped up his ears and got on the roof but your humble servant was enough for him he continued i went up the lightningrod with my samples strapped on my back and if i didnt sell him up there on the roof said he turning to me you can eat my liver i thank you sir said i but my physician warns me against late suppers then name your poison said he hauling me up to the bar i saw at once that i couldnt stand any chance with such a lot of fillibusters as there so i left next day for the west on my way i stopped at washington on my arrival i started immediately for the white house to see grant for i consider him the greatest statesman this country has produced besides being a good judge of horseflesh which all statesmen cant brag of besides im related to grant i dont know exactly what the relation is but i spose youd call it a sort of a cousin the way of it is you see my uncle joshua used to take all his grandmothers skimmilk just as regular as could he and so weve always been interested to see the grants get along and then theres john skinner my brother was a corporal in grants employ and grant liked him tip top you cant tell me anything about the grant family the skinners and grants are regular chums but unfortunately ulysees wasnt at home so i went down to the senate chamber a few minutes they were having a very stormy discussion there about passing a bill but i couldnt make head nor tail of it pretty soon though a senator who was a very old man got up and called another senator a natural born scoundrel and vagabond and twitted him about his squinteyed sister sal who had red hair and used to throw spitballs to the writing master the other senator responded in a very gentlemanly manner by calling his antagonist a hoary headed old reprobate and a palsied liar and inquired with much sarcasm if he would nt please inform the house how it was about that poor widow he cheated out of a months board in  at this the other senators laid back in their chairs put their feet on their desks and whispered to each other that it bid fair to become a spicy debate while the reporters sharpened their pencils eagerly and prepared to write extended accounts of a little setto between two senators with particulars as to the number of oaths uttered by each one and the number of times they shook their fists in each others face it was really exhilarating and i could hardly tear myself away in time to take the train i didnt go farther west after all than chicago and i didnt stop there as long as i intended for one morning i saw in the paper the following notice dastardly outragefor the past week a miserable scalawag calling himself dr skinner of boston has been infesting this locality outraging the community with a nauseous compound called chain lightning tonic which he claims will cure every thing several of our citizens are at deaths door by using it but the most diabolical outrage perpetrated by his hideous ruffian is the case of mrs timothy yawler who after taking one bottle of this vile mixture bade her friends adieu and resigned herself to the undertaker if our citizens can only lay hands on this vagabond they will treat him to a hemp necktie and a wooden overcoat with steel buttons see advertisement headed wanted there was something about that paragraph that made me feel homesick so i started east i didnt stop till i got in new york on my arrival i immediately took rooms at the astor house to be sure i had no money to pay for them but why think of pay if we are only good i have always made it a rule to have the best of every thing even if i am obliged to get trusted for it this sterling maxim was instilled into my mind by a kind old father and as he blest me and turned sadly away methought a tear trickled down his chin though it may have been tobacco juice the old man chawed fearfully i hadnt been at the astor but one day when the clerk brought me my bill is it customary said i to pay by the day it is with men of your stamp he replied what kind of a stamp do you take me for said i you look like a twocent stamp he replied mighty thin but if any body should wet you once youd stick like thunder but we dont propose to try it on you either pay this bill or get out have you got any money said he my estimable young friend i replied you have probably heard of dr ben franklin long since deceased that eminent physician was at one time in the proverb business and did a very good thing he said among other things that time is money now i havent got any money but as regards time i am rich and if you will receipt the bill i will give you a check for as much time as you think equivalent and throw you in a couple of hours for your trouble he made no reply but from the fact of the porters coming up immediately after removing my trunk to the sidewalk walk and hustling me out after it i inferred that i wasnt considered a financial success say mister said a small boy with a very long coat and a cap with considerable visor dont tear yourself away o you let him alone said another his mothers sent for him o world thou art ever ever cruel i immediately called a hackman and told him to take me to a cheap but respectable hotel and the cheaper it is i added the more respectable i shall consider it he drove me to the excelsior house and i told him i was under a great obligation to him and if at any time i could do him a favor i should feel grieved if he didnt speak to me about it if you dont fork over that fifty cents said he therell be a funeral in your family and it wont be your wife nor none o your children but im busted said i if meetinghouses were selling two for a cent i couldnt buy the handle of a contribution box he swore at me awfully and said he would have it out of my trunk so he burst it open but the contents of that trunk were far from valuable for i carry it filled with sawdust it looks just as respectable and in an emergency of this kind is invaluable i will not say that this man looked daggers at me he looked a whole arsenal with a back room full of extra bayonets and as he mounted his box and drove away the air was fairly blue with oaths he got off string after string without making a single mistake and he must have had the devils dictionary at his tongues end i afterwards heard that this hackman was always very wicked and wouldnt go to the sunday school when he was a little boy but when his mother put on his cap with a little tassel to it and gave him a cent to put in the contribution box he would go off with other bad boys and kill toads is it any wonder that he is a great horrid thing and uses oaths when he swears as soon as i could raise a sufficient quantity of spinners autographs i returned home i was gone about three weeks and i found it a very cold world if you are in trouble everybodys heart is at zero and if you want to borrow a little specie the quick silver dont rise womans rights an essay by mrs skinner miss president fellerwimmin and male trash generallyi am here today for the purpose of discussing womans rights recussing her wrongs and cussing the men i believe the sexes were created perfectly equal with the woman a little more equal than the man i also believe that the world would today be happier if man had never existed as a success man is failure and i bless my stars that my mother was a woman applause i not only maintain these principles but i maintain a shiftless husband besides they say man was created first sposin he was aint first experiments always failures if i was a betting man id bet two dollars and a half that they are the only decent thing about him anyhow was a rib and that went to make something better applause what we want is the ballot and the ballot were bound to have if we let down our back hair and swim in a sea of sanguinary gore sensation bring up your little daughters to love and caress the ballot and when they are old and scrawny they will not depart from it teach them that man occupies no position that woman cannot fill even to a pair of pants teach them that without the ballot woman is simply a cooking and washingmachine that with it she can just rule her little roost give

ballots and am cleaning out every thing that looks like a male sex while the band plays see the conquering shero comes such remarks prove that man was created lower than the beasts of the sea the carrion of the air or the rhinoceros upon the prairies my soul is filled with poetry and sentiment and his vulgar remarks grate on my ear for when i hear persons use expressions that are not refined and genteel i want to go through em like brimstone and molasses hear hear im astonished there aint more interest manifested in this absorbing topic this hall ought to be packed from dome to ceiling and a couple hundred climbing up the lightningrod outside a short time ago i addressed an immense throng on boston common at least thirtyseven persons including men and women of both sexes who stood packed together for at least fifteen minutes hanging on my words the enthusiasm finally reaching such a pitch that they insisted on burning my effigy to slow music and were bound to succeed our speakers dont lack brains nor influence but theres one thing i wish they did lack and that is their desire for a husband no matter how rabid a woman is on this question or how much she talks against the men on the platform shell grab the fust one that offers himself and turn right straight round and thats where were weak most women seem to think they were made for but one purpose and that was to have mrs on their tombstone theyd better be missed all their lives and when they die the more theyre missed the better from the creation of the world weve had all the great men on our side theres pharaoh what did pharaoh do recognizing the fact that woman must inevitably rule he issued an order to strangle all the male children if this thing hadnt slipped up twould be money in our pockets mr pharaoh is dead now and hadnt forethought enough to leave the business to some good man herod was also a womans rights man he ordered all the male children to be slain and what sweeter proof could we have that herods head was level my dear sisters we cant all be herods but we can wear his tintype next our hearts and press onward to the goal coming down to the present day where do we find woman we

humstrum convulsion mose skinners great humstrum convulsion it is plain to every thoughtful person that in order to continue in our present state of peace and prosperity we must have another peace jubilee not a puny commonplace affair like the jubilee of  but a regular screamer an apoplectic swelledup sort of thing that will stir up and worry every human being on the habitable globe and make the whole groundwork of our civilization palpitate and quiver with stupendous convulsions and cause three or four hemispheres to jump and kick up and break down with music   and emotion and pathos and jewsharps and humstrums and the bass fiddles and all those things that go to soothe the savage stomachsomething to which the other jubilee will be as a maidens sigh compared to a tidal wave or as a little infants lullaby to a redhot womans rights lecture my other jubilee was such an overwhelming success the blessings of widows and orphans whom i made happy by that sacrifice yet ringing in my ears the smallness of my bank account my patriotism and in fact every high and noble aspiration in my nature prompts me to try this thing again actuated by these noble impulses i have made a tour to london paris germany and other foreign climes to request assistance and cooperation from the crowned heads and to borrow any country bands handorgans street singers tambourine girls and in fact almost anything in that line that they hadnt got any use for to assist in my great worlds jubilee i met with glorious success the great enterprise had been foreshadowed in the cape cod gazette skowhegan clarion and other leading papers of this country and i found all europe in a perfect fever of excitement to get a glimpse of me and hear my plans my photographs were being hawked about the streets the late derby racer had been named after me and there were skinner hats with skinner rosettes on em and skinner collars and skinner cravats and skinner buns for sale at every street corner on my arrival at liverpool the docks were literally thronged with human beings every one of whom had some musical instrument and no two alike as soon as they saw me they all began to play as loud as they could i dont exactly remember what tune they played in fact i couldnt quite catch the air but i know it was something nice and that lots of folks cried leaving liverpool i immediately proceeded to london and went directly to the residence of lord montague to lay my plans before him and solicit the use of a band unfortunately he was nt at home but i saw his footman john and had a long talk with him john was so impressed with the magnitude of the undertaking that he swooned entirely away as soon as he came to his senses he entered into the spirit of the thing and said there was no doubt that montague would get me a band which was certainly encouraging i then went to the residence of duke john fitzeustace acting assistant drummajor in her majestys service he received me very cordially entered into my enterprise with the utmost enthusiasm and at the close of a halfhours interview requested me to call the next day i did so he said my plans official documents etc had been forwarded to count lammyfitte and the count had sent back word that be might grant any band for the worlds jubilee that he hadnt got any use for at home he congratulated me on my success and proceeded i have selected for the jubilee the famous band known as the fusileer veterans   it was originally a good band but they served in the crimea and were never a healthy band afterwards in fact they were a little cut up rather crippled and maimed there are nine members left but as a band they do not aggregate over thirteen legs fifteen arms and a matter of perhaps eleven eyes but they play beautifully i was extremely gratified at my success and have positive proof that they will come as i hold an official letter from sir lionel digby mr skinner my dear sirwith reference to your request for a military band to participate in the great international jubilee of  i would say that the band which formerly served in the crimea known as the fusileer veterans is at your service the band is now quartered tered at st elmo barracks the smallpox has lately broken out in those barracks and carried off some of that band i dont know how many if you choose to go to the expense of vaccinating those that are left they are at your disposal forever and ever signed sir lionel digby bart per smithers this is certainly a most fortunate acquisition and i expressed my thanks with the deepest sincerity the great mass of english people were full of enthusiasm and sympathy the universal opinion seemed to be that this jubilee would do much to cement the bonds of friendship which have always existed between the two countries that expression aint newit has been used by every stumpspeaker and country schoolmaster for more than  years i then went to belgium and called on mr lopez minister extraordinary and i am confident he would have given me great encouragement if be had been at home but he was nt i saw his groom william though william was much pleased with my appearance and offered to let me   ride a vicious horse he was trying to breakhe took my address and said he had no doubt he could prevail upon mr lopez to send me a band and added that he did nt see any reason why this jubilee should nt go far towards cementing the bonds of friendship that have always existed between the two countries i was treated with the greatest respect and courtesy by all these great and influential men from belgium i went to prussia and called on bismarck the comprehensive mind of that great statesman would have instantly grasped my giant scheme and entered into it fully if hed been at home he did nt happen to be in just then though but i saw his cook katrina katrina is a good girl and she said she had no doubt that bismarck would insist on sending two bands at least she also said that bismarck was passionately fond of music and that he and kaiser william when they had company always sung little sparkling duet entitled kaiser dont you want to buy a dog hell make good sausage meat hes as light as a fairy and is nt very hairy and his mother only had three feet she also introduced me to a particular friend of hers oofty wfkztuvlypheil who is the greatest bass drummer in the world he promised to compose some fine music for the jubilee and said that anybody could see with half an eye that a thing of this kind would do much to cement the bonds of friendship that have always existed between the two nations from thence i proceeded to italy and secured four hundred of the best handorgans i could find with the most talented composers and artists of the old world to accompany them together with a corps of monkeys of experience and ability there was some doubt as to the success of the enterprise they seemed to think there was some sell about it but i assured them that my other jubilee was a great success convinced them of the high character of my wifes relations who are to share the profits with me and of the widows and orphans who are not and the general desire of the boston people that the jubilee should be a success especially cially the hotelkeepers railroad corporations and the musical people generally and i exhibited subscriptions from these parties to show them bow disinterested and public spirited we all are over here the enthusiasm its astonishing how the american public are taking hold of this thing there never was such an uprising in the world lots of folks cant sleep nights they are so worked up about it and every family in new england has got my tintype hung up in their spare bedroom and i am receiving tons of letters daily from choral societies and country choirs and sewingcircles and bellringers and pickpockets and prize candy men etc etc asking for particulars the coliseum my first intention with regard to a coliseum was to fence in the horizon with corrugated iron but i was informed by eminent physicians that fencing so many people in so small a circle would make the ventilation very bad i intended to have the backdoor open in canton mass the piazza overlook boston harbor and a bay window in lynn even if i had to crowd the horizon back to do it in that case i should use faneuil hall for an umbrella rack the crooked part of cornhill for a bootjack the reservoir for a shaving mug widen washington street to bath maine and use the state house for a spitoon change of plans but i finally concluded to haul in my horns so i reduced the towering size of this noble structure by cutting of two towers and brought it down by clipping off two wings but what there is left is no fool of a coliseum it is so large now that it can be seen by inmates of the blind asylum and all the horse cars all the hacks all the steam cars all the smallpox ambulances and the black maria will be passing by some part of it all the time twothirds of the interior will be divided off into a clam chowder and refreshment room the bill of fare will be sumptuous and varied consisting of pheasants tongues live sausages with the fur on uncured ham sardines ripened in the shade cottonwool sandwiches sunfish dumplings c c the concert room this is where i have laid myself out and made my creditors feel shaky the ceiling will be elegantly frescoed by some old masters and hung with gorgeous drapery in a variety of exquisite designs with bouquets of rare flowers all through the auditorium and fountains of cologne water squirting all round and velvet carpets and gorgeous tapestry and diamonds and pearls kicking all over the floor which will be inlaid with amethyst and motherinlaw of pearl every now and then there will be a marble table containing a platter of solid gold filled with greenbacks for people to help themselves to and during the intermissions the audience will play ball and pelt each other playfully with nuggets of solid gold the roof will be supported by pillars of gold high studded with diamonds the contractors will be supported by their wives forever after all the female singers will have pink bows and blonde wigs and the country choir will have false teeth and smelling bottles the male singers will have bosom pins as big as banjos in their shirt front and garden sauce in their button holes or perhaps disguised in a clean shirt the organ will be the biggest ever discovered i shall probably have to move it to the grounds first and build the coliseum round it it will take one hundred experienced grinders to worry the music out of it in order to bring out the sound fully some of the notes will have to be set down on very earnestly by fat men and several large elephants have been engaged to walk over the bass notes when it is in full blast queen victoria can sit on her back doorstep and hear it distinctly through a pair of green goggles reserved seats in central park will be for sale at reasonable rates the organ will be profusely decorated with bouquets and garden sauce by an experienced undertaker and after the jubilee it will be embalmed and exhibited throughout the country the foreign bands will also be a great attraction in addition to the fusileer veteran band from england there will probably be a contra band led by the renowned doosenbury the greatest humstrum composer in the old world this band will come over in eight pieces then there will be daniel lamberts great wrist band the largest in the world this band will come over whole in two ships there will also undoubtedly be present the famous gideons band led by gideon himself gid is a selfmade man twenty years ago he was an assistant bass drummer he is now one of the best conductors in the world i shall also have band anna and band joe the big bass drum is really a musical curiosity it is made from the hide of the largest whale in the pacific ocean he having kindly volunteeredwhen i spoke to him about my jubilee he was so overcome by its great magnitude that though a foreigner he immediately stopped spouting and began to blubber saying that he was anxious to be skinned for such an angelic enterprise in fact he is the prince of whales upon one head of this gigantic bass drum will be painted the motto can anything be baser and the immortal words of grant at the last jubilee oh i like them cannon best the sides will be composed of thirtyeight sections on thirty of these will be pictures of the coatofarms of the different states on the other eight will be pictures of coats without arms the whole will be covered with beautiful allegorical paintings such as samson choking a handorgan man the proprietor of a cheap boarding house mangling a man who practiced on a violin so much that the boarders kept leaving etc etc this drum will be played by steam at about forty horse and a mule power using the great elm for a drumstick i have also secured at an enormous expense another great attractionnothing less than a chorus of musical clams flora these clams were first discovered on the banks of the nile it is very difficult to capture them they are so shy an experienced sportsman will never fire at a flock of these clams but he will creep upon them cautiously taking his boots off and holding his dogs back and all that sort of thing among the troupe is the celebrated clam flora this clam is only eleven months old but she stands on her hind legs makes a bow whistles a tune etc etc this child wonder is alone worth the price of a season ticket her grandmother was the most talented clam in the world she acted in a tableau when only two months old other novelties a trombone the size of the hoosac tunnel will discourse national airs on the common day and night during the jubilee in addition to singing a duet with kaiser william bismarck will probably help stir up the pans of red fire and appear in the transformation scene in short clothes if the prince of wales can leave his last pair of twins he will assist in blowing the organ and act as powdermonkey by carrying the electricity to the cannoniers a choral society belonging to indias choral strand will join in the chorus and another from the coral islands all the wooden indians in front of the cigar stores will have a war dance and conclude with scalping all the statues in the public garden after which they will be chawed up by buffalo bill the ladies and gentlemen at the foot of the brewer fountain will take laughing gas and dance a cotillon the statue of daniel webster will deliver a womans rights speech and play a solo on the horn of a dilemma betsey von moltke an italian snake charmer will charm all the stuffed snakes in the museum horace greeley will deliver an essay on the efficacy of vaccination in cases of potato rot george washingtons body servant will be present with the lie that little george could nt tell preserved in a bottle of alcohol i shall also have as a new and interesting feature a grand spinster chorus and leapyear powwow by five hundred old maids it is designed to introduce into this chorus mostly sentimental ballads such as why does my little heart flutter and the pensive melody oh come and be my sweetest love it is also proposed to introduce into this chorus seventyfive eligible bachelors the effect of five hundred ancient spinsters making a raid on seventyfive defenceless male orphans cannot fail to be aweinspiring to promote good feeling between all nations the star spangled banner will be cut up into dishcloths the british lion will give up business on his own hook and retire to a private menagerie near the coliseum where he will be fed on alabama claims and secretary fish and the performers will have their hair scentedup with genuine bears oil taken from two cubs belonging to the russian bear the cubs being slaughtered by alexis for the purpose the guaranty fund the next thing was to get my backers there are four persons interested in the profits of this thing besides myself so i went right to them first comes my wifes brother who keeps tableboarders of course the jubilee would give him a chance to worry abdomens at thirty cents each so he gave me twentyfive dollars towards it and immediately bought a large hash machine with a crank to it the next man i went to was my first wifes cousin who is a railroad director he said the jubilee would be a good thing for railroads so he gave me twentyfive dollars and ordered ten new cattle cars for the accommodation of the chorus i next called on my uncle william who keeps a circulating library and writes ballads he saw at once that if the jubilee came off he could sell a ton or two of ballads so he gave me twentyfive dollars and went right to work perpetrating a couple of fresh ballads entitled make me a dolly varden from the old chintz bedquilt and o city council spare them are trees i next called on a corn doctor he was shrewd enough to see at a glance that this jubilee would draw together a great crowd and in that crowd large numbers of corns would get stepped on and walked over and have to be operated on and so he put down twentyfive dollars then stepping on corns i got ten dollars from a prize candy man fifty dollars from a popcorn man and fifteen dollars each from two undertakers then all these public spirited citizens clubbed together and got my life insured for a hundred and ninety dollars if the jubilee pays they will get their money back of course if it dont pay they quietly assassinate me and make themselves whole out of the insurance money in order that the public may realize what tremendous enthusiasm there is about this jubilee i append two specimen letters out of  received topeka april th  mr skinnermy dearest sir dont you want an artless bewitching fortytwo

added a brief biography of mr skinner boston printed by warren richardson  washington street the hon moses skinner one of the selfmade men of our time the hon moses skinner the subject of this sketch was born october   biographers differ as to the exact locality of his birth some say it was the spare bedroom on the first floor while others of equal veracity assert that he first saw the light of day in the front chamber up one flight he was eleven years old before that fund of humor which has since made him famous began to crop out it cropped out mostly in boils and salt rheum and moses used to move about with a great deal of wariness and a flaxseed poultice and sit down without ostentation with so much humor at eleven it is no wonder that at fiftyseven he is the greatest humorist of the day the bracing air of the vermont hills plenty of brimstone and molasses and going barefooted nine months in the year have given him that vigor of constitution and clearness of intellect which make him a marked man in  he became acquainted with tabitha ripleys bank account and after a short but flourishing courtship he married her it was a happy union no two hearts ever beat one as theirs did and when a few years after mr skinner was left a widower the whole world looked dark and gloomy there was a great void in his heart and a great void in the bank account and when six months later he became acquainted with matilda baxter at a picnic he fell an easy victim to her blandishments and allowed her to marry him in politics mr skinner is a methodist with a mild and genial eye besides being a firm believer in free lunches he is also a prohibitionist and bald headed this baldness is probably the result of a too active brain though it may be the effect of too much matrimony mr skinner stands prominently before the public today as the only man who made any money out of the last great jubilee mose skinners silver wedding mose skinners silver wedding it being just twentyfive years since my first wife died i thought i couldnt better celebrate that event than by a grand silver wedding alas can it be possible that twentyfive summers have glided away it seems but day before yesterday since i returned from her funeral an altered man and asked the undertaker if he couldnt take his pay partly in a secondhand soda fountain and the rest in job printing the great trouble in silver weddings is you are apt to get two presents alike and something that you want very much indeed you dont get at all now this unnatural state of things need not exist if a man only possesses that heavenborn genius tact he can reform this great social monstrosity notice how i did for instance in the first place mrs skinner and i interviewed our stock of silver ware and made an inventory in a little passbook we then put the whole lot on the centretable and held an inquest over it mrs s acted as foreman and the unanimous verdict was that the court could absorb about twentyfive square presents without gormandizing so mrs skinner sat right down and drafted the invitations hinting in a delicate manner what we should like each person to bring like this mrs julia crabtree and husband you are hereby both asked to mr and mrs moses skinners silver wedding jan th please bring silver caster with extra mustard jug mrs ann maria dunbar and husband you are both hereby asked to mr and mrs moses skinners silver wedding jan th our teapot leaks a silver one with a monogram on it is more however than we can reasonably expect in the interval that elapsed before the th mrs skinner was in a terrible stew for fear something would happen to interfere with our plans the most she dreaded was that something might happen to the weather she got the old farmers almanac out forty times a day to be sure we hadnt made any mistake about the th and then she borrowed all the different kinds of almanacs she could rake up in the neighborhood and pored over em till midnight and compared em together and i saw a letter laying on the table directed to hon mr probability washington d c and down in a corner of the envelope the old gentleman all in mrs skinners handwriting and as she had some tintypes taken about that time it is more than likely she enclosed one for she never does things by halves she is a remarkable woman she can walk farther eat faster and fly more flapjacks than any six women of her gender and she can make a womans rights speech thatll make a whole female suffrage bazaar go into convulsions she is in fact full of those numberless little graces that go to make woman an ornament to the male sex well the eventful th came at last and every thing looked promising we had an early supper and after i had wiped the dishes i went upstairs and toiletted i am not by any means a repulsive man and when i had moved into a black swallowtailed coat and a maroon velvet vest with a butterfly fixture a skyblue necktie and magenta kids even my most inveterate enemy could but acknowledge that i was got up in the most labratory manner mrs s was dressed in her usual good taste though she had perhaps a trifle more bustle than was strictly adapted to a moderate sized tenement without folding doors but i wouldnt have said a word if she hadnt insisted on trying to condense her sylphlike form into a pair of number twentyfive corsets she did it though after rehearsing two ours and a half but she couldnt shut her mouth without horrible griping pains all over her and when she took a long breath she had to stand on tiptoe her hair was done up in a new style the french twist i think she called it her left eye was twisted nearly out of its socket trying to convene all her hair into one place her eyebrows havent really set well since she asked me how she looked this was so condescending and affable in her that i will own i was satisfied i told her i had never seen her look so sublime so awe inspiring i told her she reminded me of some grand old ruin she was pleased oh i could see that she said she was proud of me i was so stately and noble she said i looked like an ancient piece of roman architecture refrescoed thus in loving compliment did we beguile the time on the arrival of the guests mrs skinner took charge of the presents with as much emotion as the value of the present called for a silver pie knife she received with a husky tremor in her voice while an elegant silver fruit dish caused her to entirely break down with emotion but she took her smelling salts pretty regular and managed to hold her head up and look tolerably chipper to the very last i stood close by her and she handed me the presents and i went and put each one where it would do the most good i had previously engaged a beautiful band to discourse plaintive strains from a very tasty platform made from the family ironing board and two leaves from the extension table the whole festooned with the american flag and bust of washington which i borrowed from slocums auction room it was a very impressive tableau but as the man who played the trombone was the only one who made his appearance except the bass drummer and as both clamored loudly for their pay before they begun the effect was somewhat marred as good fortune would have it however there was among the guests an italian nobleman who was professor of the hand organ he was such a perfect master of that noble instrument that he could play without notes and look round the room at the same time and we were soon tripping our heavy fantastic toe in the hazy waltz at precisely ten oclock the hon dr toadee president of the old fogy mutual admiration society of which i am an humble member came forward to present me with a goldheaded cane as he opened his mouth to speak every movement was hushed the silence was so profound that flora perkins who was leaning forward to catch every word and lost her balance was distinctly heard to drop flora wasnt dressed with her usual care that evening she was hastily built as you might say and wasnt properly rivetted the consequence was that when she struck some part of her shackling gave way or a linchpin fell out or something of that kind and she dropped all apart like a dissected puzzle i have seen barn raisings and street widenings and house cleanings and burnt districts but i never saw anything look so depressingly chaotic as flora did it took as much as ten minutes to reconstruct her and dovetail all the little odds and ends so she could be made anyways decent and then there was sweepings enough to start a milliner and dressmaking bazaar the idea of floras veneering herself up and ambling round like a young heifer at her time of life is perfectly ridiculous if she ever comes to my silver wedding again without bringing a present ill write something about her thatll make her so mad her false teeth will jump right out of her head and chatter but i digress dr toadees speech was full of pathos and for the most part entirely original this latter i know because i wrote it myself he said mr skinnera party of eleven gentlemen recognizing and admiring your massive intellect your unswerving integrity and those high and noble aspirations which are the keynotes of your smallest action venture to offer you this cane as a slight testimonial of the esteem and admiration in which you are held by the citizens of boston the heart of this great municipality and suburbs throb in sympathy with yours in that sympathy mr skinner which must ever exist between the masses and he who rising slowly but majestically from the masses stands at last a truly great man truly great because of a noble career adorned with noble actions of a pure mind of the very highest morality and most genuine philanthropy and a whole character synonymous with all that makes the world gaze with respectful admiration and say that is a man toadee ought to have stopped here for his copy had run out but the wretched man had got the fever on him and imagined he could give em something pretty nice impromptu so notwithstanding my winks and frowns he proceeded take this cane mr skinner i say take it and may youmay you value it not for its intrinsic worth but for the pleasant associations which cluster around itandand gather around itandand elbow each other around itsirandmay it be many years before you have to lean upon it for support sir and when you do sirmay itmay it support you sirasas well as your first wife did sir mr skinner and we trustand we trustand the man we bought it of trusted too sir bless you mr skinnerbless you and the poor creature sat down bathed in perspiration he actually slopped over but it was a pretty cane and the guests were profuse in their encomiums i carried it back next day to the man i borrowed it of and he only charged me twentyfive cents for the use of it all this time mrs skinner was out in the kitchen getting the treat ready uncle joshua sent us down four gallons of hard cider and a bushel of popping corn for a new years present so we were amply provided for in the way of refreshments for our guests mrs s was perspiring freely on hospitable thoughts intent and the very atmosphere betokened conviviality the whole arrangement was of the most complete order including a dozen extra saucers that i borrowed into mrs johnsons the hands of the kitchen clock pointed at precisely  as my little daughter hortense went into the parlor and rung the dinner bell three times then mrs skinner she marched in with the pop corn and i followed with the cider i hate to see people stiff and constrained on such an occasion so i only carried one tumbler and waited for each one to drink it was much more sociable and the cider went farther too mrs skinner and i felt that in a family where there were young children growing up we ought to save at least two quarts of that cider for medicinal purposes well after the treat was over we had some singing from hannah jane baxter who has been two quarters to the conservatory and gets fourteen dollars a year for singing in the methodist choir she probably thought shed be asked to sing for she brought a music roll about as large as the small end of an ordinary butter firkin she sung a sea side reverie commencing methinks i hear the blue fish scream as the last notes of her exquisitely modulated voice died away every movement was hushed as though all were trying to catch the last faint echo as it died away when my daughter hortense exclaimed loudly marm shall i carry back mrs johnsons sarsers now it is a great grief to me that hortense hasnt the slightest ear for music after this we had a comic song by a young man at which nobody laughed and a sentimental song about moonlight and gentle zephyrs by a young lady who rolled her eyes way up out of sight and puckered her youth seven ways at once trying to sing it with appropriate expression then we had twirl the cover in which a young man had the courage to kiss his motherinlaw and blind mans buff in which a disreputable young man broke my giltframed lookingglassthat i paid a dollar for at slocums auctionand put his foot through our new wash boiler without offering to pay for either then mrs skinner and i stood up and received the silvertongued congratulations of our guests on our happy wedded life but i didnt need em no i should say not when i see a man utterly crushed in spirit and baldheaded at the premature age of fiftyseven with black and blue spots on different parts of his body and a wife who is not only willing but anxious to furnish him with more spots in assorted shades and at the lowest market price i pause ere i congratulate him on wedded bliss not that i would insinuate mrs skinner is not as gentle as a dove in the olive branch business not at all i simply say that in a case or this kind i should probably pause to the extent of a period and two semicolons ere i congratulated him then we had waterproofs coquettish glances overshoes and fond adieus in addition to the presents hinted at above we received silvery beam from the moon a lock of grey hair streaked with silver a share in a colorado silvermine a silver tone from a maidens voice some castor oil taken from a silver caster a silver coffin plate from my soninlaw and two silver halfdollars in a bottle from my brother john to say the affair was a splendid magnificent overwhelming reprotruberistical success would be stating the case so very mild that i forbear there is no word in our language long enough to do the affair justice nothing short of twentytwo syllables with a mansard roof and fire extinguisher would do the affair justice i have spent hours communing with websters dictionary yearning to grapple with the right adjective but without avail he writes a very good book though webster does the plot is fresh and absorbing and the interest is well maintained throughout the chapters are a trifle long however and it ends rather abruptly but i think the moral is excellent no person can read it through attentively without being made better filled with nobler impulses as it were regarding its utility however i should not want to commit myself in its praise that a painful void in the adjective department seriously mars the completeness of the work is to me personally a cause of regret i am glad to hear that it has met with fair success and perhaps if daniel had lived he would have given us something more complete and at the same time less dramatic in its tone so everybody was kind to me and the press particularly so of the dailies the morning lyre edited by my esteemed personal friend montague jenkins esq gave the most simple and truthful account i quote silver wedding the palatial residence of our esteemed fellow citizen moses skinner esq was on tuesday evening thronged with the talent beauty and wit of the modern athensthe occasion being the silver wedding of the genial host and his beautiful and fascinating partner the guests began to arrive shortly after eight oclock and the elegant drawingrooms soon presented a scene of varied beauty exquisite and bewildering strains of music greeted the enraptured ear and intoxicating perfumes rippling laughter and vivacious dialogue floated on the tremulous air fair youth and gentle maiden lent their presence to grace the festal scene and beauty grace and refinement vied with each other in making the occasion an event that will linger in the minds of those fortunate enough to be present while memory lasts the apartments were elegantly furnished a superb chandelier from the well known establishment of johnson  co  john street imparted a soft but brilliant glow throughout the apartments the richest or brussels carpets received the tread as the peaceful lake receives the graceful swan the walls were lavishly adorned with elegant mirrors and superb paintings one of which sunset was the theme of general remark we have never seen but one picture that approached it in delicacy of shading and general fineness of executionthat being in the duke of herefords gallery when we were a guest of the dukes in the summer of  the picture in mr skinners drawingroom is from the easel of mary jane baxter a sister of mrs skinner miss baxter is an artist of no mean ability she has rooms at  j street where she is prepared to take a very limited and select number of scholars terms  a quarter half down and the other half as soon as convenient the gifts presented to mr and mrs skinner were profuse and elegant one attracted considerable attention it was a unique glass case containing silver coin to a fabulous amount it bore the following inscription to my dear brother moses skinner and his estimable partner whose gentle presence and mild affection has smoothed the rugged pathway of his life oh may we all pass into the decline of life with that touching confidence and unbroken affection which characterizes their wedded life yours truly john skinner plumber and gasfitter no  hastings court four doors below the bengal house terms cash another beautiful and recherch gift was an elegant engraved silver coffinplate to mrs skinner from her soninlaw mortimer perrigo esq it was the work of his own hands and in its artistic finish skill and affection were blended it was accompanied with the following card to my dear motherinlaw mrs skinner whose presence reconciled me when on a sick bed to death and who in health i can never forget the publics faithful servant mortimer perrigo undertaker  jennings place call and see our stock before purchasing elsewhere p s i have just marked down my entire stock of coffins to make room for spring goods in the midst of life we are in death reduction for only thirty days we are happy to announce to the friends of mr perrigo that he has just entered into an alliance with the deaths head steamship line and the cross bones railway co and will soon rent the magnificent block corner of k street but to return to the bewildering glare of mr skinners drawingrooms during the evening mr s was the recipient of an elegant silvermounted cane presented by leading citizens of boston it was intended as a surprise to mr s and it proved to be a most genuine one mr s was taken completely aback and was evidently deeply affected as it was some moments before he could master his emotions sufficiently to reply to relieve his embarrassment judge grn led the captivating miss putty to the piano where she poured forth her soul in a gush of melody other artists comprising some of the best musical talent of the day also performed various choice selections making the gorgeous salon a carnival of bewitching music a superb banquet was partaken of at about  p m at which the genial host presided and which was in keeping with his wellknown liberality and exquisite taste we cannot close this hastily written and imperfect paragraph without referring to the toilettes which were perfectly superb we note a few miss huldy jns of milan was elegantly dressed in a gored underskirt of knickerbocker serge with frilled biases to match her neck and arms fairly blazed with jewels procured at a fabulous outlay at a dollar store miss jks  flt street was superbly arrayed in a pairof red morocco slippers and a bracelet and moved in that vast assembly like a thing of life miss bdgt oflty of sh cve was bewilderingly attired in an elegant poultdesoie valenciennes looped up with clusters of tarantula her enormous green beau imported from paris maine was the subject of general remark miss florielle bnjn made her first appearance in enamelled eyebrows and storeteeth and was the cynosure of all eyes miss j smh  bh street was attired in a pair of superb waterproof leggings miss dinah jnsn  jy street a dashing brunette was dressed with exquisite taste an elegant oroide brooch and paper cuffs well becoming her elegant figure she was the acknowledged belle of the evening and as she dashed into the mazy waltz with the count de murphy the fascinating italian duke a hum of admiration pervaded the apartment miss tx  k street was the cynosure of many eyes it being her first appearance in public since she wore a glass eye we examined the eye critically and can frankly assert that it is highly becoming though it lacks the arch expression and liquid depth of the natural orb she informed us however that it bore the glare of light better a town at auction at the annual town meeting held in byetown vermont in march  it was unanimously voted to repair the engine house and put a new fence round the graveyard this left the town eightyone dollars in debt and folks began to ask themselves whither are we drifting and a good many moved away knots of excited citizens gathered on the corners of the streets and various opinions were expressed those who had nothing were for an increase of taxes while those who had were for repudiation and all waited impatiently for the action of the selectmen who had a consultation with closed doors february th the result of that consultation may be found in the following which appeared in the next issue of the byetown chronicle to the legal voters of byetown countymen fellow citizens our fair village is eightyone  dollars in debt it must succumb to this grievous pecuniary burden what shall we do putting our hands in our pockets is not to be thought of for a moment other resources are equally impracticable the only thing left us is to sell the town the idea is not new several towns in new england have as you know changed their names within the past few years for a consideration some on em got a library some got a schoolhouse some a soldiers monument and some got the cash libraries schoolhouses and monyments will do very well if anybody can afford em but they aint vital cash is vital we purpose therefore and whereas to sell this town at public auction to the highest cash bidder at such time and place as may be hereafter designated and we pray the citizens to take action thereon at the coming town meeting signed selected of byetown joseph bilson eli mudgett solomon greggs joel benson the proposition was somewhat novel but it seemed to strike our discriminating community with favor we may be poor here in byetown but we are honest it is our boast that we never run in debt when we can borrow money the vote stood four hundred and thirtythree and a fraction for changing the name to three against it was decided to sell april st and a committee was organized to make the arrangements the chronicle immediately came out with a column of advertising setting forth the beauties of the town and a doubleleaded editorial on the solemnity of the occasion this in addition to a large number of circulars distributed judiciously among members of congress quack doctors and mill corporations had the effect of drawing together a convention of refined and educated persons in fact the town hall was so very crowded that a motion to adjourn to the vacant lot adjoining the cemetery was unanimously carried at  oclock professor bundy of the academy mounted the express wagon provided for the occasion and proceeded to make a few remarks he said this was no ordinary occasion posterity said he will cherish the name of the highest bidder with feelings of awe and reverence and his name will live as long as the town itself with its mellow and variegated foliage its rich undulating woodland and its prolific soil which for corn and potatoes cannot be excelled if you will allow me to quote from the very truthful advertisement in the byetown chronicle then the baptist choir which had kindly volunteered their services enlivened the scene with one of their sparkling dirges after which the auctioneer took his position and began to reel off adjectives verbs nouns and other dictionary furniture at the rate of a panegyric a minute the first bid was twenty dollars from abijah slocum who keeps a livery stable here this was received with groans the next was twentyeight dollars from dr perkins the patent medicine man and author of perkins lightning pills every pill warranted to gripe or the money refunded then the hon horatio slumkin representative from this district stepped forward and amid a deep silence made a bid of fifty dollars which was received with great acclamations the hon gent had just returned from washington with three or four thousand dollars back pay in his pocket which he voted himself and naturally felt pretty flush a clerk in the byetown savings bank emulating the noble example of the hon horatio voted himself double pay for the past two years and took it while the cashier was gone to dinner he abandoned banking pursuits shortly after and the warden of the state prison says he has got that in him which will produce a good shoe the hon horatio had a very spirited opponent however in peleg slawson the tin peddler who has driven through this section for going on forty years pelegs old gray mare and red wagon with corn brooms sticking up all over it is just as chronic round byetown as brimstone and molasses in april and when he bid sixty dollars the excitement was at fever heat he and the hon horatio had it nip and tuck till it got up to ninety dollars and there it seemed to stick i made up my mind that was all the darned thing would fetch anyhow when a bright thought struck me why not buy the town myself what a big thing it would be for me to have in all the papers that a town in vermont had been named for the hon moses skinner the eminent philanthropist it would be more than a big thing it would be a bloated episode and a colossal dispensation saturated with these sublime thoughts i focussed my eagle eye on the auctioneer and bid one hundred dollars one hundred dollars he gasped eagerly one hundreddreddreddred do i hear tentenhundred antendredantendredantendredantendred last chance dredantenbeautiful towndredantenvariegated foliagedredantenprolific soildredantendred goingdo i

moment i was lifted and borne on the shoulders of four strong men to the express wagon and then there arose a cry like the lashing of stormy waves speech speech three cheers for the new town of skinner skinner forever at that moment i felt what it was to be famous and good and looked up to i felt the bewildering sweetness of being truly great but i dispersed the numerous agitation which mangled my bosom and spoke as follows fellow citizens and women folks this is a ponderous epoch cheers in future ages history will place this event side by side with the leading occurrences of the th century and the old farmers almanac will mention it regularly in the same size type as the birth of franklin and the boston fire emotion you are today manufacturing history with a facility and completeness surpassing forty horse power applause in naming your beautiful town for me with such extraordinary unanimity you have conferred a great honor not only upon yourselves but upon your posterity your posteritys children and i may add without egotism your posteritys grandchildren cheers that this very flattering distinction was unsought for by me you cannot for a moment doubt if there is anything i loathe and abhor it is ostentation bursts of applause if ostentation was my forte no man living has more right to ostentate than myself although you may not be aware of it i am descended from a very old family i had three grandmothers that lived to be  and my grandfathers would have done so if they hadnt been drowned it may also gratify you to know that my wife is also of noble blood she was a baxter and is one of the heirs to the baxter property in england this property amounts to four hundred and seventeen millions and there are fortyfour heirs in this country and two in england we have a meeting at the barker house next week to hear the report of our lawyer who has returned from england and to raise money enough to send another one weve sent seventeen lawyers over there to look up our title and theyve travelled all over europe and had a first rate time and weve paid all their bills weve got the names of seventeen more who are ready to go any time on the same terms and every one of em is sure of getting the property the other seventeen had no difficulty in finding the title but there was a slight technical flaw in it we aint felt in any hurry about getting it because it is increasing all the time but as we want a little spare change along in the fall we shall probably tell the next lawyer to bring it over consequently if you should see me

richardson no  milk street  these sketches originally appeared in the wide world newspaper published in this city mose skinner will continue to write for that paper and anything rich rare and racy queer curious or strange that may fall under his observation will be given to the public in the columns of that highly entertaining family paper our great peace festival and powwow our great peace festival and powwow prospectus i wish to propose to the citizens of boston and its suburbs comprising newyork chicago the little west and the southern states a project so gigantic in its conception that at first sight it may seem wild and impracticable but upon reflection i am convinced they will not only favor it but unite with meheart hand and pursein its consummation four years have passed away since r lee esq coincided with gen grant that a longer effusion of blood was a wretched extravaganceand taking into consideration the fact that his army was entirely surrounded by mudsills and were greatly in need of a square mealhe very considerately made gen grant a present of his sword as a testimonial of his regard and the war which for four bloody years and fortyeight bloody months had deluged our country with gore and things was ended we have not as a people commemorated this great event except in the hanging of wirz and the acquittal of surratt and my proposal is that this happy and united country assemble on boston common on the d day of june next which being the anniversary of the chopping down of the cherrytree by geo washington will not cause any unpleasant feelings to arise in reference to the difference of opinion existing between the north and south for the four years prior to april  the object of this gathering is for the purpose of having a grand musical peace festival and powwow for a season of three days in honor of the restoration of peace my first project in reference to the carrying out of this scheme is the erection of a cheap but substantial boardfence around the common eleven feet high which when done will form a grand coliseum capable of holding several millions of people i have consulted several of our leading architects as to the cost of such a coliseum and the most unanimous one thinks it can be done for  and a trifle of ten or possibly eleven cents over this includes whitewashing and the puttying of knotholes to prevent small boys and unrepentant rebels from looking through my present object then is to find  men in boston who will give  each in aid of this great work or  men who will give  each this insures a triumphant success and if the thing works well i may get up some little ones for ten cents the scale upon which i propose to carry out the musical part of this gigantic festival is most magnificent and is called the fairbanks scale i shall allude to this hereafter i will here state that enclosures of money in aid of this gigantic project should be addressed to the undersigned at the office of wide world boston the publics humble servant mose skinner americans and fellowcitizens let us have peace this you can easily do by aiding this great workwhat did gen grant say it is a matter of history that when the democrats and republicans were undecided as to which should nominate him for the presidency he remarked gentlemen it is perfectly immaterial to me only let us have peace as i have several thousand cigars on hand which i want to smoke in quietness what did my noble dog watch say when he stole the bone from the two contending pups see engraving let us have piece what did gen washington say at valley forge when his servant asked him what he would have for dinner and told him there was nothing left but dried peas turning to lafayette in a voice choked with emotion he said let us have peas the great object then is a grand jubilee of peace peace how sweet a word t is a salve for every wounded spirit like a lovely fairy it floats over us and lulls us with its angelic presence as regards those money enclosures they can be forwarded as above o beautiful sweet and lovely peace how happy are we in thy presence poets chant thy lays o peace peace peace if i have omitted to mention about money enclosures they can be forwarded as above since publishing the above idea of a grand peace festival i have received letters from musical people all over the country they say it will be a decided success i have also been waited on by a deputation of the hotel keepers and the leading merchants who are all enthusiastic in their praise they say go ahead we ll back you and theyve set their names against some large sums in aid of the project the contributors will each be entitled to a season ticket admission into any free lecture and anything in the st jokehim for  the proprietors having kindly volunteered to open a branch store in the cemetery adjoining the common the occupants of one of the largest tombs magnanimously consenting to vacate for the purpose the west side of the coliseum comprising the parade ground will be reserved for men who expected to get into grants cabinet and did nt the top of the flagstaff will be reserved for the washington correspondents who knew of whom the cabinet was to be composed several hundred velocipedes will be sent to various parts of the country to bring invited guests and most of the prominent men of the country are expected including miss dickinson theo tilton not the inventor of the tilting skirt and daniel pratt the great american traveler in order to promote harmony of feeling brick pomeroy and ben butler will enter the coliseum arminarm embracing each other fervantly fervently at intervals followed by andy johnson and nasby weeping hysterically on each others bosomsex sec welles will also be present and receive his friends under the great elm previous to retiring permanently to the old ladies home i will now endeavor to convey an idea of my grand programme first day the first day will be devoted to a congratulatory address upon the rebel victories in the shenandoah valley and a psalm of praise because there was nt any more killed at the new orleans massacre the frying of doughnuts for the vast assembly and the preparation of alabama claims for a big stew by reverdy johnsonhis recent experience in mixing up those dishes entitling him to the position vice admiral semmes of the c s navy having furnished the materials for the stew will be entitled to the first dish com winslow will season the dish with some of his famous kearsarge pepper and it is expected the stew will go down as this is a peace festival in every sense of the word it is considered highly desirable to do away with everything of a warlike nature to be found in the country having in view this idea there will be a grand hash consisting of red hot shot unexploded bombshells cavalry sabres old spurs ramrods haversacks minie rifles gunpowder halfcocked army officers hardees tactics ben butlers tactics west point cadets cartridgeboxes knapsacks army mules veteran corpses and in fact everything in any way appertaining to war and all who dont partake freely will be regarded as bitter unrepentant rebels of the deepest dye a solution of whiskey and gunpowder called the fort pillow mixture will be administered to those having a weak appetite and exofficers of the army desirous of picking a bone can have the opportunity a rehash of the impeachment trial will then be served up at the close of which all the hard feelings engendered by the war will be smothered and served up as a dessert with the famous southern braggodocia sauce owing to the prohibitory law there will be no drinks of any kind upon the ground excepting the drink known as the velocipederink although there is some talk of boiling the oriental tea store other preparations for the comfort of the guests will be made a large tank of gore from the brighton slaughterhouses will be placed upon the ground and any of our southern brothers who are of the same mind in reference to wading in yankee gore as they were in  can have the opportunity the last ditch of the confederacy eracy will be removed to the common and no obstacle will be placed in the way of any southern gentleman desiring to die therein i will here state that passengers will be allowed to pass over east boston bridge free and that arrangements will be made to have the great eastern run to hingham and back touching at south boston flats and we have reason to believe that the black maria will make occasional trips to lynn to accommodate invited guests from that city second day the morning of the second day will be ushered in by the crowing of roosters and the howling of a select choir of tomcats who have kindly volunteered for the occasion to be followed by

johnson subjectwas judas iscariot the right kind of a young man for a quiet teaparty in conclusion he will read a list of the persons he has pardoned and an extra paper will be issued every hour containing the names i have received an appeal signed by several of our leading merchants asking me not to hold this festival on the common but in some other spot that no misunderstanding may ensue i here insert it boston marchout  mr mose skinner sirwe have read with surprise and awe your proposal to hold a peace festival on boston common and forward you this our protest we place our objections on the following grounds st in building a coliseum such as you describe viz by building a board fence eleven feet high entirely around the common you would be confining the common to a very limited space it would naturally chafe under this restraint as it has been accustomed to roaming around at its its will d the four ladies and gentlemen who now occupy the position of watchers at the base of the brewer fountain should be considered it is not using them with gentlemanly consideration to thus debar them from their view of park and tremont streets which is the only recreation they enjoy this your board fence would do d serious fears are entertained that the fountain on the frog pond would overflow with indignation at this act of tyranny and it is very evident that the frogs would suffer no small inconvenience from the danger of being bailed out with jeff davis they are not generally croakers but we think that their objections in this respect are very laudable th not only would it make bald headed places on the grass wear out the seats rub the paint off the fences and crowd the flagstaff but such a large number of persons must necessarily carry off large quantities of gravel upon the soles of their boots these our valid reasons do we thus lay before you feeling sure that they carry conviction with them we consider the common holy ground and the time is most assuredly coming when no one shall be allowed within its hallowed precincts it pains our hearts core to see the thoughtless deers as they frisk and gambol oer its surface and we considered it a just retribution that the bear who temporarily there did dwell destroyed one of these wicked creatures in the midst of its sin no o no mr skinner not the common monanywhere elsebut do not insist upon the common oh say you will not mr skinner we objected to new thoroughfares free churches horse cars cochituate water the widening of streets etc etc but the rash and impetuous freebooters who compose the rising generation would not listen to us but the time is coming the time is coming let us hear from you at an early day and that you will accede to our request is the prayer of this petition yours respectfully a fossil o fogy ewell b cust o r u sane u r a retch a mouldy pate and  others if popular prejudice obliges me to select another spot i think strongly of choosing the st james park as i am acquainted with two of the waiters in the st james who would render me all the assistance in their power their names are tom and jerry and they belong to one of the oldest families in boston the above appeal requesting me to select some other spot and giving very sensible reasons therefor has had its effect and the additional fact of my being positively forbidden by the city fathers to hold the festival on the common has led me to reflect whether the st james park would not be a better place and i finally decided in favor of that locality i will state that the work goes bravely on and that money enclosures in aid of the great project are pouring in upon me my correspondence embracing as it does some of the highest musical authority in the country is one of the most flattering proofs of the success of this enterprise state of maine march th  mr mose skinner siri got a letter from you telling about a big concert on boston common in honor of the surrender of lee and the restoring of peace and things to this happy and united country which i indistinkly remember as having occurred some years ago at first i didnt think much of the plan it seemed at this late day too much like setting down and goin into raptoors of joy because your greatgrandfathers last illness was not attended with any pain my wife thot so too on looking at the letter agin however i saw you had rit out an order for me to call on tuttle and git measured fur a soot of close next time i was in boston and as soon as i read that the scales fell from my eyes and i think your mighty project is a tarnation big thing my wife thinks so too it must be a very nice feeling to feel that this whole country will owe its future peace and happiness to you in which you today sir stand in the position of the boss olive branch of th sentry oh mr skinner you must be a happy man to feel that unborn generations will rise up and call you blessed i killed my pig yesterday he ways  pounds sterlin and i am going to send you a spare rib i will send by express and i will not forget to call on tuttle for them soot of close i think your peace festival is one of the biggest things i ever heard of and i am happy to say that my wife abigal jane coinsides with me in this view of the matter tho she thinks she cood be more of a coinsider if you had made some jinral observations in reference to a new bonnet for her in your letter and now mr s may happy dreems be thine and may a select number of fust class angels perform lulabys to you evermore yours with love fernando scriggins blower of the orthydox orgin brunswick  corners me boston march th  mr mose skinner siri received your circular setting forth your prospectus for a grand national jubilee in due season on attempting to read it however i was so struck by the gigantic magnificence of the project that i immediately fainted away and fell under my work bench i soon recovered hovever however  and read three lines more when i again sank into unconsciousness and it was only by repeated overtures on the part of my wife that i finally recovered my sole is filled with awe at the gigantic project and i would cheerfully sacrifice my awl rather then see it fail or would even submit to an increase of my tacks it is very creditable in you to thus assist in heeling up the wounds inflicted by the late war and i hope that you will peg away till you are successful in so doing and this mighty people shall wax strong in reply to your request that i shall whistle when this cruel war is over with variations i will only say that being unaccustomed to whistling anything but yankee doodle for several years i do not think i could furnish the necessary pucker requisite to do justice to that pathetic composition i might however be willing to assist in sounding taps yours

gigantic peace festival is creating quite a sensation in this place and if you have not obtained the requisite number of performers i should like to proffer my humble services i am  years old and unmarried should like to join in your ancient maidens chant oh no ill never marry my voice is a very good falsetto my teeth also are a very good falsesetoh i can c sharp or b flat as occasion requires i am perfectly at home in all the scales from a fish scale to a fairbanks my voice in its rippling cadence resembles my waterfall my nose is a turnup which enables me to scent any air on examination with a pair of tweezers i find i have an excellent ear for music and i am perfectly confident that i could sing any strain without straining my voice hoping to hear from you i remain yours very truly sarah nade among other celebrities from whom i have received letters assuring me that they will certainly be present are clara nett sarah finn major keys and his son minor keys and thomas catt composer of the celebrated midnight olio i originally intended to hold this festival but three days but several prominent gentleman have applied to me for permission to erect near the park various edifices of the gothic style of architecture in appearance neat but not gaudy for the purpose of furnishing the abdomens of the assembled multitude with sumptous viands consisting in part of the mixture known as clam chowder those innocent looking but deceitful tornadoes commonly called cold beans pronounced by eminent physicans physicians of the old school to be one of the most cheerful tonics that we have the leathery substance distinguished from other viands by using the word liver with the prefix of fried a most invigorating article of diet and several thousand yards of that highly nutritious article of food known as fried tripe there will be large quantities of these viands cooked and several prominent physicans physicians assure me that five days is really only a fair length of time for their consumption i have therefore decided in view of these facts to hold the festival five days instead of three and this will give all a chance to spend what money they may bring with them these viands and those before mentioned will be furnished very low aud and there is no reason why anybody should indulge in the wretched extravagance of boarding at a hotel omnibuses will run to the festival grounds at the rate of  a second and the drivers are earnestly requested as soon as their horses fall dead in their tracks to lift them up tenderly and bear them with care to the grand refreshment saloon which may be distinguished from the others by the inscriptions sirloin steak rabbit pie etc as i said before letters are pouring in upon me from all quarters of the most pathetic description eagerly proffering services and money some in their enthusiasm even propose to make me a candidate for state constable kind friends your money i freely accept but your candidate i cannot be i will now endeavor to give some ideas of the programme for the closing days of the great peace festival and powwow the fact of my deciding to hold it five days instead of three has somewhat disarranged my plans i have not got enough raw material in the shape of music to last me five days and i shall either have to depend on one rainy day or else rehash some of the old oratorios and singfunnys and produce them under another name the fourth day will be occupied by the singing of ballads performances on the banjo and a handorgan overture or two the newspaper known as grants cabinet organ will perform the favorite air entitled the dry goods clerks lament or how i lost the treasury by a stewart one of our most prominent composers of music has sent us several new ballads which will be sung in a very pathetic manner among which are the following dear mother must i get up now is it raining dear parent in east boston tell my mother i am bilious i feel im growing bald julia and the famous conundrum song where o where are the hebrew children two hours will then be devoted to playing bluff sevenup and other childlike recreationsthe entire proceeds of which will be devoted to the buying of a linen duster for andy johnson to protect him from the rigors of the approaching season an entirely new piece will then be performed by gideons band entitled the metropolitan horse railroad galop which is respectfully dedicated to the urbane conductors and the careful drivers on the down grades an intermission of three hours will then takes place to allow the assembled multitude to discuss the sumptuous viands for sale at the gothic edifices at an astonishingly low price the rest of the day will be devoted to healing up the wounds caused by the late war and in the outpouring of several large phials of brotherly love including a bass viol and hearts that were formerly wrung with grief will be hung up to dry the fifth day on the morning of the fifth day a grand march of peace by the assembled multitude lawyers will walk together republicans and democrats will drink from the same bottle dogs and bologna sausages will walk along arminarm in the most peaceful manner divorced couples will embrace cordially couples who have been married five or six years will exchange words of love and rival editors will weep on each others bosoms during the march oil and water will mingle freely together and all the extremes in the country will meet at a spot to be hereafter selected the milk of human kindness will flow like water and the cream which collects will be used in the manufacture of ice cream and there is no doubt that there will be many a quartette souls that bowed with grief will pass their best friends without bowing at all and hearts that were heavy with grief will be weighed to ascertain how much they weigh without the grief brows that were clouded with sorrow will have the clouds swept away with a hair brush and fine tooth comb and brains that were overtaxed will take oath before the nearest tax collector that such is the fact eyes that were red with weeping will be read with spectacles ears that were always closed to the wails of the suffering will be open to all sorts of wails including the wailing of infants the whaling of schoolboys and all the whales in the atlantic ocean purses that were always open to the poor will be open to the fat also and even horses will stop at the sound of whoa and give the bit out of their mouth everybody with squeaking boots will have music in their souls a large meerschaum pipe called the pipe of peace will be suspended in a prominent position and as the throng pass under it they will take as large a whiff as they can conveniently hold which they are earnestly requested to swallow in order to promote harmony of feeling after which all the seats in the grand coliseum will be removed thereby giving opportunity for an interchange of borrowed toothpicks pocketbooks hats vests c c thus bringing to a happy close the most imposing musical ceremonies and the grandest national gathering since the battle of antietam or which has ever adorned the pages of any spelling book the price of a season ticket as i said before is  or  persons can easily form a club at  each and thus obtain a transferable check admitting them at any hour of the day or night disposition of the profits the entire profits arising from this national peace festival to be distributed among the exempts and sutlers of the late war and the widows of bountyjumpers who nobly died jumpingthe amount to be in proportion to the number of inhabitants in the city or town where they reside who are in favor of annexation to boston if anything is left over it will be devoted to prevailing on a lady friend of ours who keeps a boardinghouse to part with oar trunk which she has detained in consequence of our being unable to settle a little difference we had with her which commences mr mose skinner dr notes in order to promote kind feelings toward the south and create a feeling of confidence confederate scrip will be considered legal tender on the five days of the festivaland any person passing a greenback on the sidewalk will be subject to arrest onearmed and onelegged soldiers are requested to retire into the country in order that their presence may not cause any unpleasant recollections to arise in the minds of our southern friends thus do we wind up our programme for a grand peace festival hoping that no one will run it down the publics humble servant mose skinner metcalfs stencil rooms name

curing by the assistance of his sanitary methods the world looks on and wonders at the powerful manifestations of gods love and mercy as it unfolds itself to suffering humanity and yet as it was in the days of the blessed nazarine so it is now men disbelieve what their own eyes and ears see and hear and are ever ready to cry out deceiver crucify him crucify him and although multitudes stand forth as living witnesses to the truth yet the world is fail of deception and trickery and every mans heart seems to be a closed sepulchre of rottenness and deceit and no wonder doubting thomass will not believe until they have placed their fingers in the prints of the nails and thrust their hand into the side it will be recollected that in laying on of hands in my system i use various sanitary methods which are original with myself and which after long and earnest invocation have been providentially revealed to me i have cured since coming to boston three months ago an incredible number of old standing cases and individuals whose social position is the first in boston and were their diseases of such a nature that i might refer to them it would cause a most profound sensation among the various diseases which i cure is that of consumption read the following certificate from a gentleman who will be most happy to impart information to any who may call on him boston jan   dr thornedear

recollections of a lazy life recollections of a lazy life i have received the following communication from the prominent capitalists and interviewers of the great city of boston i feel immensely tickled to find myself occupying such a proud position in the eyes of the community mose skinner esq dear sir will you favor us with some incidents of your remarkable and eventful career we want you to such a production would add greatly to the hightoned literature of the day to the aged it would rekindle the smoldering fires of ambition and all pious youth in perusing it would not only burn with fiery ardor but fairly sizzles to emulate the example of a man who today sir stands before the civilized world and new jersey as the sole projector of the most sublime peace jubilee that ever sold for  cents to a doting public who with a motherinlaws solicitude hath watched your guileless career it would prove a tender memento showing to what height a man may attain who commenced public life as editor of the slunkville trombone assisted by a pair of shears and a linen duster under the hallowed influence of an easychair and a spittoon i immediately replied thanking them for a series of backhanded compliments so touchingly conveyed and asked them in case i should die what they would charge to write my epitaph they replied we should be very happy to write your epitaph at the lowest market price let us know when you expect to slip your wind and we will not only have the gates ajar but wide open and if you think it would facilitate your progress we will have the bars let down thus with pleasant jest do great minds often commune with one another my first sqawk of infancy was emitted anne dominoe  a sister of annes on her mothers side officiated as wetnurse and take it all in all it was quite a social gathering i am of noble birth through not exactly a bourbon still i always liked old bourbon and make it a point to treat him well my family is older than mr bourbons i claim a direct descent on my uncle williams side with the estimable female who held the camphor bottle when adam was born even now can be found in the old ancestral castle on the erie canal the mouldy manuscript that tells how the duke de skinneur with seventysix unarmed men held the town of fischbolville against a splendidly disciplined army of seventyseven bloodthirsty manikins receiving as a reward for his valor the paw of the lovely and accomplished countess brownn a direct descendant of the deddbeett dynasty of rottenbones during infancy i was christened twice to humor my mother but it didnt take neither time as i emerged into artless childhood i gained considerable notoriety as a crippler of bullfrogs and a throwist of dead cats into neighboring wells or anon did i playfully rob a birds nest of the only son of his mother and she a widow i will not refer to my once putting a litter of kittens into the stove oven or a chaw of tobacco in the teapot let these pass as the innocent outpouring of a childish nature in the words of the immortal bard o dase of my childhood im a thinkin on ye now when through flowery vales with little pails a berrying i went with my little sister min and our little pails of tin for to put our berries in me and min me and min although this was eminently hunky i never wouldd i were a child again no to me childhoods happy hours were a wretched fraud and signified an exclusive diet of brimstone and molasses and castor oil with a nourishing dessert of measles and whooping cough nothing occurred to mar my lamblike existence till thirtyfour winters had come and gone when i fell in love with tabitha ripley hired girl at deacon slipshods she was an artless creature of thirtynine summers  and as time developed her maiden charms and the golden charms of her bankbook also i concluded i had better go for her and i went our marriage which the parson blessed for seventyfive cents was in due season blessed by twins i never was blessed with triplets but had the fever and ague three winters to make up for it after being married i began to hanker for fame and pine for popularity fame is smoke but the smell of it is bunkum to the nostrils like the american eagle i resolved to soar and soar until i couldnt get any soarer i determined that the name of moses skinner should become a household word and little children should cry for me knowing that a newspaper was lever to popularity to any man with money and without brains i invested tabithas dowry in the slunkville trombone a mirror of choice literature polished sentiment and cheerful anecdote for the genteel home circle the position of editor was one for which i had long hankered toward the easychair especially did my impulsive nature gush forth there is something about an easychair strongly attractive to my sensitive organization as an arduous laborer i do not excel as a workist i am not a success the public will remember the trombone the mere sound of that name will recall to mind in a startling blast my famous doubleleaded editorial on the alabama claims which was criticised so severely by the hull boomerang in an article headed is mr skinner right in his masterly collaring of this subject or is he aint that editorial was a hefty boost up the ladder of fame and honors were heaped upon me i was allowed the freedom of hull with the privilege of strolling through the graveyard i was also tendered a free pass to all the small pox hospitals in the country with permission to kiss the female patients how true it is that fame wins favor i will here state that persons wishing my picture will find an excellent chromotintype at the newsdealer who lives furtherest from my house that even little children may be able to buy them i have reduced the price to  each or  a dozen time passed on and i will here remark that as a passeron time is an eminent success it was in the spring of  that the huge carbuncle of civil war which had been coming to a head for several years burst upon us we all know that j buchanan poulticed that carbuncle instead of lancing it and as a natural result boston was afflicted with a peace jubilee the prominent part i took in crushing the rebellion is too well known to need comment in these memoirs the name of skinner was ever synonymous with gore who was it that with spartan firmness sacrificed his brotherinlaw and two of his wifes cousins in order that the nation might live mose skinner who blessed his stepson and bid him go when the clarion notes of  bounty thrilled the heart of every true patriot mose skinner esq at a veteran reception in slunkville in  i drove the team containing the gallant band who so nobly defended fort warren during three of the bloodiest months of the war will it be considered egotistical if i also state that i was president of a band of heroic souls called a committee for evading the draft and that the name of mose skinner was first on the list of exempts said mr stanton in his letter to our provost marshal in case of another draft i shall rely upon the cheerful graveyard called slunkville for a full quota of exempts led by that veteran whitelivered subterfuge mose skinner thus it always was a skinner was never known to quail in dangers stormy hour my grandfather boldly faced death during the revolution he was sutlers clerk and often speaks of an interview he had with gen washington he asked the general if he should nt hold his horse a little while and he told him to get out of the way this cheerful ancestor of mine is at present  years old his towering intellect yet unshaken he has not the slightest intention of disposing of his mortal coil but gaily trundles his hoop stones bullfrogs and chews slipperyelm with all the vigor of boyhoods sunny hours it is a pleasant sight to watch him as he gaily chats with the village maidens while the modest blush of youth suffuses his brow i should also add that he can easily walk forty miles without spectacles and eagerly bounds oer a tenacre lot at the cheerful sound of the dinner bell the spring of  saw me prostrated with my first great sorrow like a thunderbolt descending from the cloudless heavens did colic descend upon my wife tabitha laying her flat in less than forty winks o the agony of that hour when i watched with a husbands solicitude she and the colic having it nip and tuck both determined to fight it out on that line and both equally determined to wear the belt the result was the colic finally collared her and walked off with her she passed away peacefully and resignedly merely observing to her heartbroken husband mose im off goodbye life is a conundrumi give it up utterly crushed and weak as an infant i crawled to her bureau drawer and convulsively seizing her bankbook i wept like a child twas sweet and balmy spring time the hunkiest time of year when the april showers bring forth may flowers t was then we laid her away away about the middle of may of may o tabitha you died too soon why did nt you wait till june till june n b an eminent artist in alluding to those chromotintypes of mine says as gems of artistic skill they are unsurpassed no family should be without one a picture gallery destitute of mose skinners chromotintype is a miserable failure price  each or  a dozenthe wellknown modesty of mr s alone prevents him from taking his place with the nine muses as we understand he had a very tempting offer to that effect comment is unnecessary           thus my wife died no more would those loving hands pull off my boots and part my back hair as only a true wife can no more would those willing feet replenish coalhod and waterpail no more would she arise mid the tempestuous storms of winter and gaily hie herself away to build the fire without disturbing the slumbers of the man who doted on her so artlessly her memory is embalmed in my heart of hearts i wanted to embalm her body but i found i could embalm her memory cheaper i procured of eli mudgett a neighbor of mine a very pretty gravestone his wife was consumptive and he had kept it on hand for several years in expectation of her death but she rallied that spring and his hopes were dashed never shall i forget this poor mans grief when i asked him to part with this gravestone take it skinner said he take it and may you never know what it is to have your soul racked with disappointment as mine has been and he burst into a flood of tears his spirit was indeed utterly crushed i had the following epitaph engraved upon the stone to the memory of tabitha wife of mose skinner esq the gentlemanly editor of the trombone a kind mother and exemplary wife terms  a year invariably in advance office over hansons grocery up two flights knock hard we shall miss thee mother we shall miss thee mother job printing solicited thus did my lacerated spirit cry out in its agony even as rachel weeping for her children but one ray of light penetrated the despair of my soul the undertaker took his pay in job printing and the sexton owed me a little account i should nt have got in any other way why should we repine at the mysterious ways of providence and vicinity i here pause to drop a silent tear to the memory of tabitha ripley that was she was an eminently pious woman and could fry the best piece of tripe i ever slung under my vest her pickedup dinners were a perfect success and she always doted on foreign missions i did not however allow myself to pine away to any great extent in the person of matilda baxter a gushing coquette of fortyseven autumns did i perceive a salve for my lacerated heartstrings as soon therefore as i could smother my anguish and change my underclothing to matilda bs did i hie myself away on the sweet wings of love never shall i forget our betrothal it was a calm still night in june and all nature had been hushed into repose by a judicious use of mrs winslows soothing syrup matilda and i were walking pensively among the garden sauce back of her house and i was repeating those touching lines by johnny bunyan two beets with but a single head two cabbages with one around us the frolicsome june bug gaily waltzed and the cheerful hum of the mosquito added pathos to the scene while in the adjacent millpond the guileless bullfrog performed a select anthem to departing day afar off in the western horizon the sun was setting which he did in his usual hunky style without bursting ary button off his trousers nothing disturbed the solemn stillness but the gentle heaving of her bosom and the gentle heaving of a small boy in the woodshed who had been smoking a cheroot i was trying to imagine with the pure affection of youth how many stamps she had laid away while she was heaving an elegant assortment of sighs varying from a small to a large size the ecstatic rapture which steeped my soul in bliss oercame me and seizing matilda by her waterfall i imprinted the pure kiss of betrothal behind her left ear she gazed at me in silent rapture and while the lovelight light gleamed with dewy softness from those liquid orbs upraised to mine she said skinner have you taken a bath lately she continued you dont amount to shucks if you mean getting spliced out with it come set the day my ancient fraud my festive baldheaded daffadowndally thus with honeyed words of love did we beguile the time we were married in church my children as chief mourners occupying front seats there were no cards except a game of euchre to see who should sleep the front side of the bed we took a short bridal tour she went to hingham to see her aunt abigail and i came to boston to buy a new set of type for the trombone it was about the time that all was so quiet on the potomac but that day boston was in a fever of excitement because it was hinted in official circles that the commanding general would move as soon as his rent became due though he hated to leave mason and dixons line it was so handy to hang the clothes on on washing days on returning to my domicil in slunkville my wife addressed me in the following chaste language skinner i am now boss of this chebang and i really hope for your mothers sake that i shant be obliged to use the mophandle over your head more than twice a day and once sundays another eccentricity of hers is planting her feet in the small of my back after i have retired for the night and whirling me playfully across the room the first overture of this kind occurred one very cold morning when i suggested the propriety of her getting up and building the fire if my memory serves me right and i think it does i built the fire myself that a m and i have made a point to do it ever since if there is any thing i dote on it is rising with the lark and building the fire n b this is not a joke the spring of  will long be remembered mr bob lee of the southern confederacy annoyed at the conduct of u grant p sheridan and other filibusters offered to meet grant under a sour apple tree to discuss affairs recuss scenes and cuss results connected with the war that little talk ended in r lee taking the confederacy and gracefully shoving it up the spout at the same time expressing a desire to go home become an honest farmer and raise milk for the boston market weeping bitterly because he had nt a tintype of wendell phillips then our brave boys came marching home from canada and the legislature passed an act kindly allowing our crippled veterans to grind their handorgans on the corners of our streets during the winter season great preparations were made in slunkville to receive the returning braves the town was thoroughly aroused and a veteran reception of gigantic magnitude was projected consisting of fireworks decorations and a sumptous sumptuous repast by that eminent caterer the overseer of the poor members of congress and new york pickpockets were invited a delegation of slunkville landlords who were always in favor of a vigorous prosecution of the war were to receive the veterans by raising their rent and all those who had lost a leg or an arm were considerately allowed twentyfour hours to leave the town ice water was also furnished the veterans at the low price of  a glass the decorations were both tasty and elegant in front of the trombone office was a beautiful transparency representing the provost marshal making out exempt papers and the inscription the heart of slunkville this day throbs with pride terms  a year invariably in advance in front of squire parsons was the motto the onionshall it be presarved in the window of the union store were the words awl hale worthy suns of patriotic sires our sprooce beer is still  cts a glass notwithstandin the enormous pressure brot to bare against us by blowtid capitalists at the close of the festivities i was called upon by the schoolmaster for a speech he said will the massive intellect whose genius lights up this warlike scene favor us with a few of his sparkling and caustic remarks i allude to mr skinner the file leader of the american press this schoolmaster evidently has talents i said fellow citizens this is indeed a momentous event when out forefathers landed in america and picked mayflowers off puritan rock they didnt dream of such a momentous event as this no as a momentous event it is far ahead of anything they ever dreamed of a voice cant you say something about momentous event afore you set down old shears i continued in view then of an event so momentous let us adjourn to spooners tavern and moisten our diaphragms this proved to be the most telling point in my speech and was received with a perfect outburst of enthusiasm but enough the proceedings of that day have passed into history about this time my wife was elected president of a womans rights society and commenced giving lecturesher most able production was entitled is man a loathsome beast in which she proved that if there wasnt any men there wouldnt be an broken hearts or any false calves the first time she delivered this lecture it had such an effect upon the female portion of the audience that they passed a resolution to smother every male infant immediately after birth then they marched home dressed in mens clothes and went out on the common and played leapfrog and pitched coppers in imitation of their liege lords and masters my wife is a whole sorosis and ought to be allowed to vote for i am confident she would throw aside all party quibbles and vote for the handsomest man she is not you see a common woman will etiquette allow me to call her a fancy breedone of those rare plants that bloom only once in a hundred years and then make us feel bad because it is nt once in two hundred             in the fall of  my business affairs were decidedly bilious my assistant editor sniffins from living exclusively on the mixture known as beanhash was reduced to a frightfully mixed condition during a revival in slunkville he put all the converts in the lists of births simply because they were born again and put the deaths under the head of turf matters he used to get home late at night put his pants to bed and hang himself over the back of a chair when artemus ward was in town with his great show sniffins tried to elope with the wax figure of mrs cunningham and purloined a pair of rubbers that adorned the feet of judas iscariot he used to go out on the common and stump any boy under twelve to lick him in a fair standup fight and he got so lazy that if he was obliged to get up at eleven a m he complained bitterly of being broken of his rest but he was the smartest eater i ever knew at the agricultural fair that fall he ate the entire collation provided for five hundred persons and then complained of a gnawing at his stomach he had a notion one spell that he wanted to join the church but the minister did nt want him and told him there was nt any vacancy but he said he was bound to join something so he joined the engine company on one occasion he donned his wifes flannel petticoat and went through the streets singing the popular air i want to be an angel and with the angels board after which he proceeded to the ministers study and offered to supply the pulpit or discuss the constitutionality of the ten commandments at a spiritual circle once held in slunkville this wretched man deliberately walked up to the medium and struck her a severe blow upsetting her in a scandalous manner and the only explanation he could offer for this dastardly outrage was that he had been sick and the doctor had told him he didnt live steady enough in fact said dr squilbob you go too much to extremes and if you ever expect to get well you must strike a happy medium sniffins thought this medium appeared to be happy and so he struck her yet there was talent in the family his father was the most finished handorgan player i ever listened to and his aunt hannah could cure a boil dreadful quick at one time there was considerable gossip about his father owing to a little incident which occurred in the family he playfully murdered his wife and motherinlaw threw them into a well and run off with his brothers wife aside from this he was as genial a person as i ever met and could put down his even tumbler of old rye without a murmur the reason i have not described in glowing terms a mammoth flag raising in slunkville in the spring of  is because we never had any a man named slobbs suggested a flag raising no matter about any flag said he lets a hoist mose skinner for he combines most beautifully the national colors h es red nosed white livered and blue all the time the next issue of the trombone contained slobbs obituary notice done up in my hunkiest style which had the effect of ridding slunkville of his carcase he was seen to enter the eastern railroad depot and deliberately buy a ticket for lynn and that was the last of him taking into consideration the flatulency of my business and the perfect cussedness of slunkville generally i determined to leave those classic shades the opportunity presented itself in the fall of  when i was called upon by the directors of the deadbeat mutual life insurance company to assume the presidency of that popular institution i print their letter of request and also their brilliant soulstirring prospectus that the public may see that theres no humbug in the honor they would do me boston fall of  mose skinner esq slunkville vt dear sirwe the undersigned representing the philanthropic interest of boston have recently organized a mammoth life insurance company which will excel in its ramifications every other known company esteeming your wellknown philanthropy and acknowledged talent we unanimously elected you president of our cofeeling assured that in your hands it will find one worthy of its noble purposes presuming on your acceptance we have taken the liberty of using your name in the following prospectus of the deadbeat life insurance company cash assets  liabilities  president mose skinner esq vice president mose skinner treasurer m skinner directors o fleeceem esq will  robem hon d faulter cleen m out this gigantic company representing as it does many prominent philanthropists of new england offers rare inducements to those wishing to insure their lives against the ravages of disease and matrimony although yet in its infancy it hopes by strict attention to business to merit a share of public condemnation the object of our company is not to make money o no we have a loftier object in view than the gathering of coupons it is a wellknown fact that death on his velocipede is going his rounds and unceremoniously entering our families and removing the husbands and fathers thereof without regard to age or sex our object is to relieve death of its sting and make it purely a question of greenbacks and if the widow wants to marry again the company furnishes her with a husband this is a purely protective measure and prevents the funds of the company from being scattered we also give a free lunch to all the policyholders once a month which takes place at the nearest almshouse and is a truly convivial occasion we have secured the services of that able philanthropist mose skinner esq as general draggerin of patrons he will carry with him a demijohn of chloroform and administer the same to such persons as he may select under the subterfuge of a free drink and while the victim is unconscious he will be dragged into our office and insured this is much superior to the style now in vogue of sending out agents to waylay the victim at street corners and offices and by a constant diarrhea of words reducing him to a state of imbecility in which condition he is induced to take out a policy a few facts to be considered if any man who is in the habit of smoking one cigar a day will smoke only half a cigar a day and deposit the rest of the money in the deadbeat mutual life insurance co he will die a millionaire the proceeds of one oysterstew a week for an average lifetime will enable a mans descendants to live on commonwealth avenue with a colored coachman the proceeds of a ham sandwich and a glass of lager beer daily during a considerable length of time will enable all future generations bearing your name to be steeped in luxury  reasons why i should insure in the deadbeat mutual life insurance company st because it is a good thing d because it is the best thing i can do d because i shall double my money in a very short time th because i shall quadruple my money in just twice the time that it takes to double it th if i put my money into the hands of these noble minded directors i shall not squander it for clothes and house rent any person wishing to join the deadbeat mutual life insurance company can do so without undergoing any embarrassing scrutiny we simply ask a candidate the following questions which are both simple and chaste st are you married or a single bachelor if the latter how many children have you d are your children mostly boys and girls d are you in favor of annexation to boston and if so how much of this happy and united country would you annex th do you think the peace jubilee promoted peace and harmony throughout the landor only harmony in st james park th do you think that the whale that swallowed jonah was dyspeptic simply because jonah laid hard on his stomach th do you think that gates ajar has anything to do with open bars any person answering in the affirmative to all these questions will be admitted to membership in the dd bt mu life ins co the dangers of delay michael rooney laborer thought of getting his life insured called at our office for the purpose but concluded he would just ask his wife about it first on his way home from a wake that evening he fell over a policeman who was asleep in his doorway mr rooneys legs were fractured and he died in great agony exclaiming o be jabers why did nt i gone an done itmeaning of course got his life insured mr jones merchant decided to insure with us went home to dinner in at great hurry that day so as to get down to our office as soon as possible wife sick and laid her false teeth on the table cook got the teeth and tried to chew slippery elm with them broke them and one tooth fell into the soup mr jones took his soup did nt see the tooth tooth stuck in his throat and he suffocated instantly family left in indigent circumstances wife ca nt go shopping but six times a week eldest son commenced wandering in his mind finally became idiotic is now a clerk in a dry goods store sad case mr loony tick expected to run for congress in the th district and of course would have to get his life insured on his way to our office attacked by roughs did nt run for congress but run for his life instead had a fight and got stabbeddied soon after family saved the mortification of having a member of congress to answer for i decided to accept the honors so handsomely offered as i saw in perspective a glorious opportunity for following the illustrious example of many philanthropic gentlemen who went into office poor and went out rich as soon as it was generally known that i was to leave slunkville the excitement was intense the grocer and butcher expressed their grief in a touching memorial of several pages commenting mose skinner dr and ending with pleas kall and settle at wonst the good deacon said he should miss those little brass buttons my boys used to drop in the contributionbox the sexton a whitehaired old man came to me with tears in his eyes and said he had long fondly hoped to plant me in yonder quiet churchyard but now this boon was denied him the engine company brought out their machine and squirted for half an hour in front of my office directing the stream into my window with the playful remark that they wanted to keep me from spoiling the citizens generally were aroused and proposed a grand impromptu meeting in the townhall to express their resignation at my departure to attempt to describe that affair would be impossible the halt the maimed the blind the idiotic and bedridden all all were there old cynthia benson who hadnt been off her bed for thirty years vowed to man she would see mose skinner off if she had to go in a wheelbarrow which proved to be the case her son joel on this occasion winning many laurels as an eminent wheelist as i entered the broad aisle escorted by the constable the choir which were stationed in the gallery struck up the soulstirring stanzas how pleased and blest are we to see mose skinner flee over the rostrum was a beautiful transparency representing me in the act of taking the stage and the words we are resigned the schoolmaster was the first speaker he said it was with sorrowful joy that he noted the departure of one of slunkvilles solid men pounds avoirdupoisthe file leader of stovehuggers the champion rester of america in fitting terms he congratulated boston on the acquisition of this brilliant carbuncle of genius in conclusion he hoped i would revisit those scenes where my editorial labors had been so eminently successful a voice i hope so too for he aint paid for that piece of tripe he bought of me the other day parson twitchell spoke next he felt not only resigned at my departure he said but in fact quite cheerful looking at it in the light of a dispensation of providence it was one of providences most gratifying dispensations he had known me long and intimately and he could truly say that to any one accustomed to lending money i would prove a firm friend no one encouraged free lectures more than i did or slept sounder when the contribution box was passed around it was but justice to say that as a tranquil slumberer during service i knocked the spots out of any of his congregation who calls at mealtimes more regularly than mr skinner who is more ready to borrow our bottom dollar his wife and family have long looked to him as their mainstay and support and will probably keep on looking for a good while longer they never had a want untold they simply asked him for anything they wanted and rather than disappoint them he would let them keep on asking all their lives he closed by offering me letters of mark to all the hotels and the run of the public garden with the privilege of looking at the ether monument or lounging on the bridge his speech was a most finished production and occupied about sixtytwo minutes in passing any given point and i gave him a point to start with it was most affecting and at its close there was scarcely a dry seat in the house at this juncture cries of skinner speech hi hi c rent the air and as i arose the enthusiasm of that vast assembly found vent in a perfect outburst of applause i spoke as follows my friends what can i say on this momentous occasionwhat truths can i utter a voicesay youre a cussed fraud oh would i were a webster or a clay that i might do justice to this occasion a voice if this occasion was a square meal youd do justice to it the kind evidences of affection which i everywhere see almost unman me and i feel as though i could not leave you that my departure is a hideous dream a voice it will be a hideous nightmare if you stay my friends how shall i best bid you adieu a voice take a dose of arsenic thus under a cloak of mirthful jest did these honest villagers conceal their grief at the close of the meeting the scene baffles description all of that vast assembly wished me godspeed and quick about it and earnestly hoped that no accident would occur to oblige my return to slunkville little children gathered around me with tears in their eyes and said i was their papa and i was so overcome with emotion that i couldnt deny it which caused a large redheaded female to exclaim god forbid that he should be anybodys pa unless they want to die on a gallus adancin on nothin i had some difficulty in finding a house in boston with the right kind of a landlord my object was to find a tenement where the parties were not inquisitiveabout their rent after a great deal of trouble i finally got the refusal of a house but i kept getting a refusal every time i went so i left in disgust hired a small attic in chelsea and took my meals at the south end till my family arrived then i let my wife look round a little of course these little family matters are between you and i i like boston it is a cheerful hamlet shakespeare was smart but he never produced a cheerful hamlet in order to preserve my family circle intact i brought my children with me of which i have about what is considered sufficient punishment for a man of sin two of my sons are fast rising into a proud eminence in their profession and bid fair to chalk their initials high up on the ladder of fame they are drygoods clerks my youngest boy is a very smart bright boy and i am told that he resembles me more than any one of the children he is studying with a civil engineer at present and i asked his boss the other night how he

by studying hard days and playing cribbage late nights sort to recuperate their overtaxed powers by making a trip to the mountains these three worthies were known by the names of king charles prince albert and doctor johns after due consideration and long deliberation they came to the conclusion thatinas much as their legs were just then longer than their purses it would be inexpedient to incur the expense of riding they therefore decided to huff it we use the clasasic language of king charles behold them then on the morning of june   preparing to start on their travels they are packing their baggage in a wagon to which is at tached a gallant steed this  s the      and this             before gallant steed    the wagon            mentioned illustrations of         the baggage which a portion of             they carried about  oclock they started on their winding way watched by a few friends and many strangers va rious were the comments made by curious bystanid  f at  ers as the party moved away some said they were hard characters whom the police jlge in the kind ness of his heart had granted penisiiiioi to leave the cityfin one hour others thought they were gyp sies wh had been on a thieving tour and were now returning to their tribe  but the prevalent opinion was that they were fenians about to invade canada but however much the crowd differed as to the object of our heroes it was unanimous upon one point viz that they were three tough looking cusses we propose only to make a note here and there as we follow our travelers on their journey nothing of moment occurred the first day as theywended their way through the classic grounds of hooksett passing that virtuous retreatihe halfway houseand on through pembroke with its many sacred spots they saw the green grass growing the yellow grain waving or at least it will be yellow when ripe and the gentle herd feeding by the road side the gentle     herd feeding       by the roadside our tourists tented out the first night in a barn kindly loaned to them by an obliging fari  the rain forbidding them to tent out of doors  they were awakened early in the morning by the shrill crow of chanticleer more commonly called rooster the cock        that crew resuming their march they passed along the shore bf the beautiful lake winnipesawkee upon   the s    d gw      pshire dvertiser june    bosom of which

devlish near catching prince albert  the reader will at once notice the absence of the greater part of the dog the fact is the dog saw the prince was mak ing such good time that he would soon be cut of sight un less he the doe ran fasterand that he might do so he f his bodybehind while his head continued the chase when the above cut was taken the body had not arrived consequently only the head could be sketched hiat night they pitched their tent in a beautiful spot on the borders of the lake beneath the friendly shade of a huge oak tree as they neared the wel comed spot a noble eagle king of birds  etc rose majestically from out its broad branches and soared away they saw him for full ten minutes af ter he was out of sight rising higher and higher and wiukiug at them frst with one eye

in the north part of the pine tree state consisting of three houses and a sawmilll  the inhabitants the village of               newry maine subsist mostly upon spruce gum and blackflies as big as hornets do abound near this place one of our tourists nearly lost his life perhaps the dr started out one morning with his gun with the in tention of shooting a partridge for dinner the natives had told some big stories about bears and  note we are aware this extract reads differently in the advertiser of june  but we claim that the above is exactly as the description appears in the notebook what condition the writer was in when the notes were taken we leave th reader tojudge the doctor kept a bright lookout lest he might run against one of those savage critters the snap ping of a branch the rustling of a leaf or the dis tant murmur of the babbling brook were to his fev ered imagination ominous sounds which portended danger after half an hours travel he reached a spot from which the wood had been clear a few years before but which was now thickly covered with scrub oaks and other low bush s  here thought the doctor is the place for bears just as the thot tashedtherough his mind he heard a rustling in a thicket near him for a moment the power of mo tiol seemed to leave hin iis knees smote together while his trembling hiid could carcely hold his gun with nevrous trepidation le discharged his piece then turned and ran ran with the spied of the frightened deer when lie hear the deep bay of the hound or like the little ragged urchin seen steal ing his mothers preserves who knows full well if caught he will get a sound spanliking ran like iikcike the devil and never ceased running until lie arrived in camp when lie immediately fainted his sudden advent in tlemidst of his com panions filled them with consternation king charles with wonderful presence of mind dashed a dipper ful of hot water in his face while prince albert seiz a poker and commenced pounding him to keep up a circulation of the blood under this skillful practice the doctor soon began to rally and in a short time was sufficiently recovered to tell his story my dear friends the doctor said congratulate me upon my lucky esape from a terrible horrible death i have been chased by a er ybe boysiby  beau    and had i not discharged ny gua full ii r    a  i  k n  t z  his face and thus checked him in his

until i could see the  white of his eyes  and then fired  if you killed the bear why did you run querried the king  why did i ril why i thought he might have some near relatives about there  a

around and how earnestly he listens if but the slightest noise ho hears he knows not but the next moment his dead ly enemy imay be upon himi  ifthou hast seen him thus thou can st form some idea of the cautiouis man ner in which our three worthies approached the spot ivhichh ie doctor pointed ouras the place where he had nearly lost his life in the pursuit ofa dinner it is a momentous period in the life of all a bear znay spring upon them at an y iouieit and their bones divested of flesh by the cruel teeth of cubs lie unbariedbleaching in the boundless forest which surrounds newry maine as the tourists stand close to a bunch of bushes behind winch the bear lay they form a picture which woi d rejoice the heart oft an artist on the right etool prince albert armed wichi slong lnife at his left stood king charles with a huge stake in his hand while dr johns brought up the rear bearing the gun the muzzle of which pointed exactly at the princes stern and if it had been dis charged his pants would have needed to be reseated although he might object to being seated at all now the prince takes off his spectacles and wipes the glass es on his coattail that he might the more readily see danger and be first to run gently he parts the branches and peers over and beholdsa hog quiet ly sleeping  safe we are safe  the three exclaimed as with one voice the king and the prince looked at the doctor the king said ill take whisky the prince said let mine be brandy  the doctor said all rightat the next tavern and thats the reason why the bear adventured did not ap pear in the letters of the excursionists what the     dr said he what he whattheshot       really did    shootat d we have space to chronicle but one more of the many interesting adventures through which our friends passed when near the canada line they were halted by a squad of soldiers and arrested for fenian invaders of canada in vain the doctor protested against and swore about the outrage  in vain the prince argued at great length the laws of nations bearing upon this point the reciprocity trea ty etcin vain the king wrung his hands and wept and blubbered and finally faintedthe soldier knew his duty and was bound to perform it unexpected deliverance came however in the shape of the offi the us soldiers   and     officer of the day cer of the day he ordered their discharge at once a i  for said he such a cowardly looking set of rag rhuffins can do no harm they may frighten the old women and childrenand truly they look bad enough to scare the devilbut will never fight  with grateful hearts our wanderers pursued their way and soon the old man of the mountain broke upon their view old man of the mountain as  he appeared to the tourists after spending a few days around the mountains our travelers moved westward with the purpose of passing into vermont when they arrived at the connecticut river they found a tollbridge interposed between themselves and the green mountain state this was an unexpected barrier pockets were search ed in vain for six cents to pay the toll but only half enough could be found and with sorrowful hearts they turned back it has sorely tried our patience and eyes to de cipher the last few pages of the princes manuscript in fact some portions we have supplied the mss being made up of broken sentences whether this was caused by the writers long exposure to the weather or by partaking too freely of canada whisky we do not see fit to hazzard even a conjecture be low we give a sample page from his notebook to show the reader the great disadvantages we labored under in the compilation of this work a few ex planatory words will be found in brackets first night in the green mountain statepret ty village situated picturesquelyupon the banks of the

in the year  by john p jewett  co in the clerks office of the district court of the district of massachusetts the two altars or two pictures in one ithe altar of liberty or  the wellsweep of the old house on the hill was relieved dark and clear against the reddening sky as the early winter sun was going down in the west it was a brisk clear metallic evening the long drifts of snow blushed crimson red on their tops and lay in shades of purple and lilac in the hollows and the old wintry wind brushed shrewdly along the plain tingling peoples noses blowing open their cloaks puffing in the back of their necks and showing other unmistakable indications that he was getting up steam for a real roystering night hurra how it blows said little dick ward from the top of the mossy woodpile now dick had been sent to said woodpile in company with his little sister grace to pick up chips which everybody knows was in the olden time considered a wholesome and gracious employment and the peculiar duty of the rising generation but said dick being a boy had mounted the woodpile and erected there a flagstaff on which he was busily tying a little red pockethandkerchief occasionally exhorting gracie to be sure and pick up fast o yes i will said grace but you see the chips have got ice on em and make my hands so cold o dont stop to suck your thumbswho cares for ice pick away i say while i set up the flag of liberty so gracie picked away as fast as she could nothing doubting but that her cold thumbs were in some mysterious sense an offering on the shrine of liberty while soon the red handkerchief duly secured fluttered and snapped in the brisk evening wind now you must hurra gracie and throw up your bonnet said dicky as he descended from the pile but wont it lodge down in some place in the woodpile suggested gracie thoughtfully o never fear give it to me and just holler now gracie hurra for liberty and well throw up your bonnet and my cap and well play you know that we were a whole army and im general washington so gracie gave up her little red hood and dick swung his cap and up they both went into the air and the children shouted and the flag snapped and fluttered and altogether they had a merry time of it but then the windgoodfornothing roguish fellowmade an ungenerous plunge at poor gracies little hood and snipped it up in a twinkling and whisked it off off offfluttering and bobbing up and down quite across a wide waste snowy field and finally lodged it on the top of a tall strutting rail that was leaning very independently quite another way from all the other rails of the fence now see do see said gracie there goes my bonnet what will aunt hitty say and gracie began to cry dont you cry gracie you offered it up to liberty you knowits glorious to give up everything for liberty o but aunt hitty wont think so well dont cry gracie you foolish girl do you think i cant get it now only play that that great rail was a fort and your bonnet was a prisoner in it and see how quick ill take the fort and get it and dick shouldered a stick and started off what upon arth keeps those children so long i should think they were making chips said aunt mehetabel the fires just agoing out under the teakettle by this time gracie had lugged her heavy basket to the door and was stamping the snow off her little feet which were so numb that she needed to stamp to be quite sure they were yet there aunt mehetabels shrewd face was the first that greeted her as the door opened graciewhat upon airthwipe your nose child your hands are frozen where alive is dick and whats kept you out all this timeand wheres your bonnet poor gracie stunned by this cataract of questions neither wiped her nose nor gave any answer but sidled up into the warm corner where grandmamma was knitting and began quietly rubbing and blowing her fingers while the tears silently rolled down her cheeks as the fire made their former ache intolerable poor little dear said grandmamma taking her hands in hers hitty shant scold you grandma knows youve been a good girlthe wind blew poor gracies bonnet away and grandmamma wiped both eyes and nose and gave her moreover a stalk of dried fennel out of her pocket whereat gracie took heart once more mother always makes fools of roxys children said mehetabel puffing zealously under the teakettle theres a little maple sugar in that saucer up there mother if you will keep giving it to her she said still vigorously puffing and now gracie she said when after a while the fire seemed in tolerable order will you answer my questionwhere is dick gone over in the lot to get my bonnet how came your bonnet off said aunt mehetabel i tied it on firm enough dick wanted me to take it off for him to throw up for liberty said grace throw up for fiddlestick just one of dicks cutups and you was silly enough to mind him why he put up a flagstaff on the woodpile and a flag to liberty you know that papas fighting for said grace more confidently as she saw her quiet blueeyed mother who had silently walked into the room during the conversation graces mother smiled and said encouragingly and what then why he wanted me to throw up my bonnet and he his cap and shout for liberty and then the wind took it and carried it off and he said i ought not to be sorry if i did lose itit was an offering to liberty and so i did said dick who was standing as straight as a poplar behind the group and i heard it in one of fathers letters to mother that we ought to offer up everything on the altar of liberty and so i made an altar of the woodpile good boy said his mother always remember everything your father writes he has offered up everything on the altar of liberty true enough and i hope you son will live to do the same only if i have the hoods and caps to make said aunt hitty i hope he wont offer them up every weekthats all o well aunt hitty ive got the hoodlet me alone for that it blew clear over into the daddy ward pasturelot and there stuck on the top of the great rail and i played that the rail was a fort and besieged it and took it o yes youre always up to taking forts and anything else that nobody wants done ill warrant now you left gracie to pick up every blessed one of them chips picking up chips is girls work said dick and taking forts and defending the country is mens work and pray mister pomp how long have you been a man said aunt hitty if i ant a man i soon shall be my head is most up to mothers shoulder and i can fire off a gun too i tried the other day when i was up to the store mother i wish youd let me clean and load the old gun so that if the british should come well if you are so big and grand just lift me out that table sir said aunt hitty for its past suppertime dick sprung and had the table out in a trice with an abundant clatter and put up the leaves with quite an air his mother with the silent and gliding motion characteristic of her quietly took out the tablecloth and spread it and began to set the cups and saucers in order and to put on the plates and knives while aunt hitty bustled about the tea ill be glad when the wars over for one reason said she im pretty much tired of drinking sagetea for one i know well aunt hitty how you scolded that pedler last week that brought along that real tea to be sure i did spose id be taking any of his old tea bought of the britishfling every teacup in his face first well mother said dick i never exactly understood what it was about the tea and why the boston folks threw it all overboard because there was an unlawful tax laid upon it that the government had no right to lay it was nt much in itself but it was a part of a whole system of oppressive meanness designed to take away our rights and make us slaves of a foreign power slaves said dicky straightening himself proudly father a slave but they would not be slaves they saw clearly where it would all end and they would not begin to submit to it in ever so little said the mother i would nt if i was they said dicky besides said his mother drawing him towards her it was nt for themselves alone they did it this is a great country and it will be greater and greater and its very important that it should have free and equal laws because it will by and by be so great this country if it is a free one will be a light of the worlda city set on a hill that cannot be hid and all the oppressed and distressed from other countries shall come here to enjoy equal rights and freedom this dear boy is why your father and uncles have gone to fight and why they do stay and fight though god knows what they suffer and and the large blue eyes of the mother were full of tears yet a strong bright beam of pride and exultation shone through those tears well well roxy you can always talk everybody knows said aunt hitty who had been not the least attentive listener of this little patriotic harangue but you see the tea is getting cold and yonder i see the sleigh is at the door and johns comeso lets set up our chairs for supper the chairs were soon set up when john the eldest son a lad of about fifteen entered with a letter there was one general exclamation and stretching out of hands towards it john threw it into his mothers lapthe teatable was forgotten and the teakettle sang unnoticed by the fire as all hands piled themselves up by mothers chair to hear the news it was from captain ward then in the american army at valley forge mrs ward ran it over hastily and then read it aloud a few words we may extract there is still it said much suffering i have given away every pair of stockings you sent me reserving to myself only one for i will not be one whit better off than the poorest soldier that fights for his country poor fellows it makes my heart ache sometimes to go round among them and see them with their worn clothes and torn shoes and often bleeding feet yet cheerful and hopeful and every one willing to do his very best often the spirit of discouragement comes over them particularly at night when weary cold and hungry they turn into their comfortless huts on the snowy ground then sometimes there is a thought of home and warm fires and some speak of giving up but next morning out comes washingtons general orderslittle short note but its wonderful the good it does and then they all resolve to hold on come what may there are commissioners going all through the country to pick up supplies if they come to you i need not tell you what to do i know all that will be in your hearts there children you see what your father suffers said the mother and what it costs these poor soldiers to gain our liberty ephraim scranton told me that the commissioners had come as far as the threemile tavern and that he rather spected they d be along here tonight said john as he was helping round the baked beans to the silent company at the teatable tonightdo tell now said aunt hitty then its time we were awake and stirring lets see what can be got ill send my new overcoat for one said john that old one ant cut up yet is it aunt hitty no said aunt hitty i was laying out to cut it over next wednesday when desire smith could be here to do the tailoring theres

chamber has got o aunt hitty send all thats in the best chamber if any company comes we can make it up off from our beds said john i can send a blanket or two off from my bed i knowcant but just turn over in it so many clothes on now aunt hitty take a blanket off from our bed said grace and dicky at once well well well see said aunt hitty bustling up up rose grandmamma with great earnestness now and going into the next room and opening a large cedar woodchest returned bearing in her arms two large snowwhite blankets which she deposited flat on the table just as aunt hitty was whisking off the tablecloth mortal mother what are you going to do said aunt hitty there she said i spun those every thread of em when my name was mary evans those were my wedding blankets made of real nice wool and worked with roses in all the corners ive got them to give and grandmamma stroked and smoothed the blankets and patted them down with great pride and tenderness it was evident she was giving something that lay very near her heart but she never faltered la mother theres no need of that said aunt hitty use them on your own bed and send the blankets off from thatthey are just as good for the soldiers no i shant said the old lady waxing warm t ant a bit too good for em ill send the very best ive got before they shall suffer send em the best and the old lady gestured oratorically they were interrupted by a rap at the door and two men entered and announced themselves as commissioned by congress to search out supplies for the army now the plot thickens aunt hitty flew in every directionthrough entrypassage mealroom milkroom down cellar up chamberher capborder on end with patriotic zeal and followed by john dick and gracie who eagerly bore to the kitchen the supplies that she turned out while mrs ward busied herself in quietly sorting bundling and arranging in the best possible travelling order the various contributions that were precipitately launched on the kitchen floor aunt hitty soon appeared in the kitchen with an armful of stockings which kneeling on the floor she began counting and laying out there she said laying down a large bundle on some blankets that leaves just two pair apiece all round la said john whats the use of saving two pair for me i can do with one pair as well as father sure enough said his mother besides i can knit you another pair in a day and i can do with one pair said dicky yours will be too small young master i guess said one of the commissioners no said dicky ive got a pretty good foot of my own and aunt hitty will always knit my stockings an inch too long cause she says i grow so see herethese will do and the boy shook his triumphantly and mine too said gracie nothing doubting having been busy all the time in pulling off her little stockings here she said to the man who was packing the things into a widemouthed sack heres mine and her large blue eyes looked earnestly through her tears aunt hitty flew at hergood land the childs crazy dont think the men could wear your stockingstake em away gracie looked around with an air of utter desolation and began to cry i wanted to give them something said she id rather go barefoot on the snow all day than not send em anything give me the stockings my child said the old soldier tenderly there ill take em and show em to the soldiers and tell them what the little girl said that sent them and it will do them as much good as if they could wear them theyve got little girls at home too gracie fell on her mothers bosom completely happy and aunt hitty only muttered everybody does spile that child and no wonder neither soon the old sleigh drove off from the brown house tightly packed and heavily loaded and gracie and dicky were creeping up to their little beds theres been something put on the altar of liberty tonight has nt there dick yes indeed said dick and looking up to his mother he said but mother what did you give i said the mother musingly yes you mother what have you given to the country all that i have dears said she laying her hands gently on their headsmy husband and my children iithe altar of  or  the setting sun of chill december lighted up the solitary front window of a small tenement on  street which we now have occasion to visit as we push gently aside the open door we gain sight of a small room clean as busy hands can make it where a neat cheerful young mulatto woman is busy at an ironingtable a basket full of glossybosomed shirts and faultless collars and wristbands is beside her into which she is placing the last few items with evident pride and satisfaction a bright blackeyed boy just come in from school with his satchel of books over his shoulder stands cap in hand relating to his mother how he has been at the head of his class and showing his schooltickets which his mother with untiring admiration deposits in the little real china teapotwhich as being their most reliable article of gentility is made the deposit of all the money and most especial valuables of the family now henry says the mother look out and see if father is coming along the street and she begins filling the little black teakettle which is soon set singing on the stove from the inner room now daughter mary a wellgrown girl of thirteen brings the baby just roused from a nap and very impatient to renew his acquaintance with his mamma bless his bright eyesmother will take him ejaculates the busy little woman whose hands are by this time in a very floury condition in the incipient stages of wetting up biscuitin a minute and she quickly frees herself from the four and paste and deputing mary to roll out her biscuit proceeds to the consolation and succor of young master now henry says the mother youll have time before supper to take that basket of clothes up to mr sheldinsput in that nice bill that you made out last night i shall give you a cent for every bill you write out for me what a comfort it is now for ones children to be gettin learnin so henry shouldered the basket and passed out the door just as a neatlydressed colored man walked up with his pail and whitewash brushes o youve come father have youmary are the biscuits inyou may as well set the table now well george whats the news nothing only a pretty smart days work ive brought home five dollars and shall have as much as i can do these two weeks and the man having washed his hands proceeded to count out his change on the ironingtable well it takes you to bring in the money said the delighted wife nobody but you could turn off that much in a day well they do saythose thats had me oncethat they never want any other hand to take hold in their rooms i spose its a kinder practice ive got and kinder natural tell ye what said the little woman taking down the family strong boxto wit the china teapot aforenamedand pouring the contents on the table were getting mighty rich now we can afford to get henry his new sundaycap and mary her muslindelaine dresstake care baby you rogue she hastily interposed as young master made a dive at a dollar bill for his share in the proceeds he wants something too i suppose said the father let him get his hand in while hes young the baby gazed with round astonished eyes while mother with some difficulty rescued the bill from his grasp but before any one could at all anticipate his purpose he dashed in among the small change with such zeal as to send it flying all over the table hurrabubs a smasher said the father delighted hell make it fly he thinks and taking the baby on his knee he laughed merrily as mary and her mother pursued the rolling coin all over the room he knows now as well as can be that hes been doing mischief said the delighted mother as the baby kicked and crowed

circle were ranged around the stove for evening prayers henry my boy you must readyou are a better reader than your fatherthank god that let you learn early the boy with a cheerful readiness read the lord is my shepherd and the mother gently stilled the noisy baby to listen to the holy words then all kneeled while the father with simple earnestness poured out his soul to god they had but just risenthe words of christian hope and trust scarce died on their lipswhen lo the door was burst open and two men entered and one of them advancing laid his hand on the fathers shoulder this is the

affairs from which he dimly learns that he is to be sacrificedon the altar of the union and that his heartbreak and anguish and the tears of his wife and the desolation of his children are in the eyes of these wellinformed men only the bleat of a sacrifice bound to the horns of the glorious american altar        again it is a bright day and business walks brisk in this market senator and statesman

sold its only somebody else and so they are very comfortable and look on the whole thing as quite a matterofcourse affair and as it is to be conducted today a decidedly valuable and judicious exhibition and now after so many hearts and souls have been knocked and thumped this way and that way by the auctioneers hammer comes the instructive part of the whole and the husband and father whom we saw in his simple home reading and praying with his children and rejoicing in the joy of his poor ignorant heart that he lived in a free country is now set up to be admonished of his mistake now there is great excitement and pressing to see and exultation and approbation for it is important and interesting to see a man put down that has tried to be a free man thats he is itcould nt come it could he says one no and he will never come it thats more says another triumphantly i dont generally take much interest in scenes of this nature says a grave representativebut i came here today for the sake of the principle gentlemen says the auctioneer weve got a specimen here that some of your northern abolitionists would give any price for but they shant have himno weve looked out for that the man that buys him must give bonds never to sell him to go north again go it shout the crowd goodgoodhurra an impressive idea says a senator a noble maintaining of principle and the man is bid off

upon the shivering earth but as evening set in the frosty crystals began to fill the air the darkness was rendered more impenetrable and the exultant wind seemed to be holding high revel with dismal screech and ghostly song the house of capt faunce stood a little out of the city beyond the reach of horse       slippery pa ths cars and this was a fierce storm to meet in the gathering darkness a light shone from the window out into the gloom upon the de serted highway and blinked and flashed out farther and farther as if in search of some familiar face the pensile branches of the stately elm near the gate swayed and played in the peering light making grotesque pictures on the pearly snow while within the house a bright coal fire glowed in the grate and a warm atmosphere pervaded the room mrs faunce was waiting her husbands re turn from the city a little nervously the tea table had been ready and the chair and slippers in the warm corner much longer than usual and still he came not before the fire little charley with rosy cheeks made rosier by the glowing coal was building mimic forts and camps and his curly head bobbing up and down was making shadow   waiting  pictures on the opposite wall sister mary was busy with some feminine contrivance of ribbons and lace while fred a lad of fifteen was at work upon what he termed a tough proposition it was a bright home picture one that does the heart good to gaze upon the cosy sit ting room was evidently intended for the free dom and enjoyment of the children yet the mother looked upon this picture with secret sadness scarcely acknowledged to herself her husband had served in the army until a wound obliged him to resign but he had returned to bring joy mingled with sorrow to his wife the soldier habit as he called it of using intoxicating drinks had grown upon him in the few months he had been at home and it was on this account that mrs faunce wait ed his return the present evening so nervously       slippery pa th fathers come said mary as the snow bound door screamed a protest against being disturbed mrs faunce saw too plainly that her fears were prophecies papa tome see my tamp and soldiers called charley who was always delighted to see his papa make the soldiers drill and present arms tome quick papa tause suppers weddy come and have supper with papa darling and then play soldiers whispered charleys mamma for she saw the necessity of hasten ing her husband to the table soldiers  soldiers  yes they dont eat they drinkbut capns eat replied the fa ther tipsily father is acting soldier fred whispered to mary as he put aside his books little charley left his toys ate his supper   waiting        g and went to sleep in his high chair was un dressed and snugly tucked into his little bed without even waking for his goodnight kiss after supper the captain dozed in the warm corner fred worked at his tough prop osition mary busied herself with her ribbons the evening waned and the children went qui etly to bed while mrs faunce sat gently rocking and thinking and thinking and rock ing her husband had dozed until he began to be himself again and then he remembered how  tipsy he had been he knew how it grieved his wife and he thought and resolved and resolved and thought then opening his eyes and glancing across to his wife in the op posite corner he saw her drooping head and the dropping  tears and he quickly closed them and thought again and resolved again io     slipper y pa ths what are you having the blues about wife he asked presently i was thinking of your danger what do you mean ellen i mean that your soldier habit as you call it is growing upon you tut tut wifey dont be so foolish i do so wish you would leave off this hab it she continued           o im going to leave off ive told you so before but hammel you must decide now there is no safety in delay its impossible to resist drinking with an old comrade ellen yes that is it unless you have pledged yourself only think how often indecision has led to ruin if you would sign the pledge it would be easier well wellwere not in a temperance    waiting       i i meeting and this is all nonsense ellen i can take care of myself yet sharply retorted the captain then in a gentler tone added you dont know what men have to contend with  so mrs faunce fearing she might irritate when she wished to win him back to the for mer life sought to throw off her sorrow and converse on other matters she felt sure he did not intend to do wrong somehow there was a wrong but not all his he had too easily yielded to the temptations of army life he was too undecided about reform but she must win him back to the path he had left  iyti ii t  aptfaunce had been a lawyer of much promise and had a growing business when he gave up personal prospects for his countrys welfare and with a company of loyal men went to the front but a year in the army had left its stain upon his character and when he returned with a fracturedllarm unfitted to enter at once upon the practice of his profession he was ea sily led into convivial company campaign life was so jolly he would say that i shall die moping at home his wifes earnest words on the evening al    b usiness        luded to had aroused him to the danger more than he cared to own he felt restless he could not sleep it was only a whimhe said to himself women are so nervous the result was a decision to open an office and have something to do hammel faunce attorney and counsellor at law was seen over a door in the city a few days later and captain faunce was again among business  men  gradually former clients returned his prospects brightened and his wife wore the happy face of other days but the sun did not shine uninterruptedly upon the captains family as time passed on he returned home again and again partially intox icated and mrs faunce plead with him again and again to give up this dangerous habit but he always assured her he didnt drink the poor stuff that intoxicates and laughed at her temperance notions     slipper y paths one morning when the captain was kept in bed by a severe headache the past rose up before him like a strange infatuation where was he drifting he queried and why had he disregarded his wifes entreaties what was it that caused the sad look in her eyes he wondered if it was a dream that some one was kneeling by the bed in the night and that he heard a low sob and a whispered pray er he could not look into his wifes eyes nor on her pale face he felt thoroughly ashamed but i will own up to wifey and take care another time he said to his conscience he felt better after he had promised so when mrs faunce returned to sit awhile with him he began abruptly well ellen ive made a fool of myself this time   business        the wife took his hot hand in hers and waited as if for explanation its too bad he went on to make you so miserable wife i did not intend to go so far but col f  and maj e   and two or three others of our regiment were in town and we went into packams andand i got over the bay before i knew it he tried to say allpthis in a careless way but he could not yet look at his injured wife well dear im very sorry for you now will you promise not to taste liquor again asked his wife pleadingly there ellen youve no confidence in me i have in other things my dear but i fear you are not quite strong enough to stand alone in this i didnt think you could be quite so unfor giving ellen i certainly forgive you hammel she re                slipper y paths plied tenderly but it is for your sake i ask it it is for the sake of our children too she added almost in a whisper now ellen you are too rigid in this mat ter ill show you and all temperance preach ers that i can take care of myself without a pledge i dont want anybody dogging after me to keep me from becoming a drunkard he said this angrily but in a moment he added playfully i believe your temperance notions have got into my head for that brandy didnt agree with me last night i wish they might get into your head and heart too so deeply that you would never touch or taste strong drink again replied mrs faunce alittle warmly both felt that the subject had better be dropped till the headache was over but his resolutions to reform were fitful sometimes  vs   business        when he most needed a clear head it was the muddiest and so the winter and spring wore on the evil constantly increasing the tempter entang ling his victim still more often and coil ing secretly in the pathway of those dear children who as yet knew not the power of the wily serpent over their father alas that he so often squats like a toad listens to our hearts secret breathings till he discovers where he may tempt us and be most sure of leading us into some of his bypaths  w         i wo years have passed since we left   capt faunce he could take care of himself has that boast proved true has he resisted tempta tion has he overcome the tempter  or has vice seen again and again lost her hide ousness and been embraced i can take a little without harm was the frequent reply to his pleading wife and still he went on in the slippery way and often bewildered blind and infatuated he neglected his business and drank deeper and was more regardless of consequences    do wnward        his office was closed and his friends were al most hopeless still he laughed at their fearsstill he boasted that he could talke care of himself you have been saying that you were going to leave off drinking for a long time ham mel said his wife one day it is the old story of all who enter this broad road well wife you think i shall soon be in the gutter i suppose im afraid of it she replied softly stuff and moonshine it will do for hyp ocritical temperance lecturers to talk that way but im positively ashamed of you with your common sense to assert such foolishness dr s has often said that brandy and whiskey are excellent tonics but my dear inspiration says look not upon good heavens ellen are you going to      slippery paths give me a temperance lecture every day im not lecturing you i only wish you to see the ruin that is coming upon you and now wife you are provoking are you to tell me what i ought to do and must i promise like a child mrs faunce attempted to speak but her voice failed and she found relief in tears as usual her husband felt that he was the injured one and left the room in anger while she sought strength from above to bear these accumulating sorrows the pleading cry ascended again to the infinite why must this fearful scourge of intemperance desolate our land and ruin so many homes  why this apathy  why is the strong arm of the law palsied still like every true mother she must be strong and hopeful that she might help her children to be so and when she had grown   downward          calm by communing with the elder brother she sought her children and for the first time spoke to them of their fathers danger he has been led away and we must win him back she said i knew ever so long ago that it wasnt all right said fred what can we do mother to win him back asked mary o mother id rather die than to see my father a drunkard and reeling along the streets o mother mother sobbed the weeping daughter it was a picture for angelic eyes to gaze lovingly upon as that mother with her own heart sorely crushed sat and talked to her children of the many ways in which they could seek to keep their father from the company of bad men who would lead him on to ruin thus talking and planning for the future they all grew calm and when they separated it was y      slippery paths with a firm purpose to fight their common en emy thus days and weeks dragged on with al ternations of hope and fear while the fathers love for strong drink grew stronger and every effort of friends to reclaim him seemed fruit less mrs faunce would always say kind ness may yet win him and so she strove to bear all this patiently but this weary waiting was growing more hopeless and the question so often asked but never answered came again to that waiting wifes lipswhy is it   iv  sother   you look sick tonight let biy me stay with you no no darling it is better for you not to  stay your father would be angry to find us both waiting for him but ill go when i hear him coming moth er urged mary and mother i cant sleep if i go to my room and know that you are here waiting may i stay no dear it will be a sad watching for your young heart and trouble comes fast enough my daughter  now go to your rest goodnight darling       slippery paths good night dear good mother and then mrs faunce was left alone an anxious watcher for her misguided husbands return her thoughts turned to her children and the future awaiting them she saw how great was the barrier arising between them and society she felt that society was very much to be blamed for the intemperance that was ruining thousands of homes and blighting millions of innocent lives often giving them no choice but forcing them to share not only the misery of the inebriates home but also its degredation o must it be so with mine o god if it be possible remove this bitter cup from their lips she heard footsteps at the door and hushed her throbbing heart to go and open it two men entered bearing her husband between them for a moment her strength failed but   changes        she soon led the way to her room the men attempted an explanation but the look of ago ny in her pale face silenced them and they quickly withdrew the shock to mfrs faunce was like wrest ing the last hope from her heart the foun dations seemed giving way of what avail were cries or tears for a moment she had lost sight of her guiding star but with the return of calm thought to her bleeding heart came solicitude for her children o must they be dragged down to shame and poverty and misery she cried o my father if it be possible remove this bitter cup from their lips thuso prayed the inebriates wife as she saw the gulf yawning beneath her feet squandered time and money and constant dissipation produced their legitimate results      slippery pa ths downward ever faster and deeper and deeper in vice sank the husband and father the pleasant home passed into other hands the home of so many dear memories of long ago the home of sorrow and misery now the story is a true picture those weary hearts are found in many homes those lov ing clinging hearts watching the dear one drifting drifting driftingand whither the newly born babe in the home of capt faunce brought new care and anxiety to mrs faunce and taxed the willing fingers of sis ter mary who knew but little rest now but the helpless infant appealed to the father as nothing else had since the old happi ness had faded out of his heart the better nature was stirredthe fountain of love was reached and he made an effort to break away from the vice that enslaved him  he remem bered his former boast   changes        i for their sakes he said to himself for their sakes ill give up this miserable life with some vague purposes of reform he re mained at home until he felt that he could en counter his old associates two weeks had passed by and hard fought battles had been waged each day between resolve and desire charley timidly kept near papa as if he would keep him from falling again his wist ful eyes often made the captain wince and inwardly curs himself at length he resolved to seek employment he had so recklessly turned from all who sought to help him that now it was hard to ask a favor  for their sakes he again whispered to himself i musti must for their sakes and he hurried by the drinking house and hoped to escape the notice of old cronies but the enemy of man does not let a victim elude him so easily      slippery paths hallo whats in the wind now capn capn i say capn greeted himand he faltered for a moment then quickened his steps taken to cold water capn shouted the man tied to the apron strings yelled another captain faunce turned and walked deliber ately to the door and shaking his fist growled between set teeth ive been on the road to hell long enough im going to knock off ive fought the rebs south but tis harder fighting the devil at home and turning he walked away shaking his fist and muttering as he went and hurrying on as though the fiends were clutching at him again he stood in business places but so changed so fallen a wreck of his former self helooked helplessly around he hoped fprhe hardly knew whatbut some one   changes          to speak a kind wordsome one to help him return to a better life familiar faces came and went past him as he loitered some nodded a recognition some who had been friends heeded him not he asked for employmentwas refused again he asked and was again refused no one can trust you captain youd be drunk before night but im going to reform if i can pshaw you are out of cash i guess the business man turned to his business and the fallen man passed on asking asking until wearied and discouraged he knew not where to go the little hope he had when he left his home in the morning was fast going out diay after day the contest was renewed and each day wearied ashamed discouraged  from repeated refusals he returned home pass      slippery paths ing the tempting display of bottled demons struggling with appetite and with the jeers of the men at the drinking house he turned once again toward his home in crooked street with the old appetite burning into his soul  now was the tempters hour now when despair was sweeping over him afreshwhen the barrier between him and the better life seemed rising higher and hope but just re vived had been rudely extinguished now the tempter was by his side whisper ing in his ear fool why not drown all this in the sparkling cup it cant be much worse why not the struggle was a fearful one but the evil prevailedthe tempter had done his workthe victory was his but was no one responsible for this when he entered those busy streets asking   cheanges        for employment day after day were there none who might have spoken a kind word and helped him in his efforts to return to industry and virtue were there none who had pre pared the way by unkind words and taunts of past degradation or who sa say that the guilt rested only at the door of him who en tered the grog shop what of him who dealt out the sparkling draught what of those who legalized the sale who advocated placing temptation in the pathway that man may become virtuous by resisting it let such shake the dust from their garments and look up to god thanking him that they are not like others  but a day of retribution will surely come god will reckon with them and let them see to it that they make sure their escape from the woe pronounced against those who put the cup to a neighborslips v  g ary im here mother you are spoiling your eyes sewing in such a bad light dear never mind me mother ill be done pres ently cheerfully as this was said by the loving daughter the tears were even then illing on her work she could not be spared from home to accept a place secured by good dr wil kins so through a kind neighbor she had ob tained work from a slopshop tis hard work for your little hands but   tempted         mebbe youll get used tot said the woman as she helped mary over the hard places and showed her how to make the garments ise knowd what tis to work allers but tis different with the likes of yer my ole man had dilerum tremens and it carried him off kinder sudn there now dont cry i hadnt oughter tell yer mary plied her needle day after day nurs ing her sick mother and caring for baby nell no wonder that sometimes she murmured be cause her lot was so hard no wonder that she recalled the hopes that were blighted just as her girlhood was unfolding late one afternoon mary had completed her work and started on her dreaded errand of returning it to the shop that she might ob tain the much needed pay and also secure more work her last visits to the establishment had      slippery paths awakened an undefinable dread of the clerk in attendance she did not like his bold gaze nor his coarse compliments but she would not tell her mother and thus add to her care perhaps she was too sensitive she must ex pect unpleasant things now thus trying to reason with herself she hurried on and entered the store as she gave the bundle to the man he bestowed such a glance of smirking famil iarity upon her that she felt like rushing from the place there was another person waiting so she felt more courage to remain besides she must have the pay she waited impatiently while the woman beside her received her pay and another bundle of work and went out it was already growing darklights were here and there appearing the gas was lighted in the streetsshe resolved to go just then the man returned and gave her a bundle    tempted        you must take these shirts home again they are not well made said he closely watching her face a feeling of despair came over her she knew his words were false but what could she do without the money as she looked up she saw the same sultry look which had startled her when she entered it was a bad look she knew so taking tho bundle now so heavy when hope was gone she hastened from the store she fancied that danger was near and tim idly hurried on one voice whispered it is i be not afraid and like a weary child she seemed to place her hand in the invisible hand of jesus and walked quickly along the narrow streets soon she heard a step following her a hand touched her arm and she saw that it      slifpper paths was the man who had spoken to her in the clothing store you want your money miss said the man yes my mother needs it go back with me and ill give you much more than that he said quicker than thought mary glided from him and darted down the street at first the man started after her but it would not do at such an early hour so with mnuttered vengeance he turned back mary paused not till she reached her home and even then glanced back to make sure he was not following then sank exhausted and for days could not leave her bed  the bun dle was sent back unopened and the hard earned money lost   vi m sorry i used that bad word be cause you feel so about it but it p keeps me feeling wicked all the time when the boys follow me in the way they did then perhaps you dont try to make them like you fred you will be astonished to see how soon kind words will make friends of them o i dont want them to like me but it is pretty hard sometimes to keep from fight ing them he that ruleth his own spirit is stronger than he that taketh a city replied the mother t                swp pery pahs well mother ive seen them knock off fathers hat and pin paper on his back and i know twas to provoke me and i won bear it if father does drinki wont did jesus try to do good to wicked boys manmma asked charley yes dear cause i told jim piper that it was wick ed to swear and mamma he caught hold of me and said he would cu my tongue off if i preached to him you must keep away from the boys dar ling but i want to be like jesus you can be like jesus if you are loving and kind and perhaps you can play sundayschool with the little boys but you cant do much with these large rude boys my little son o you good mama i wish papa was oood too   tr yivng       mary was just entering the room weary and feeling so wretched she could hardly keep from crying she heard the wish of charley and it found an echo in her heart but she felt almost ready to believe that her father never would be good again  the way seemed so darkthe burden so heavythe faith so weak why is it  why is it she questioned  and there seemed to answer back why she had been assisting in an infant school the term was near the close and she had just been informed that her services would not be required next term she felt that her father was a blight to every hope and effort could she tell mother  i have something very unpleasant to tell you mother she said softly well dear  i shall not teach next term why not o    i  slippery paths   im not wanted and her lip quivered as she strove to keep back the tears mrs faunce crossed the room and kissing her daughter whispered god is only behind a cloud my daughter he is watching your efforts and your reward will be none the less precious because you are not successful but what shaill we do mother dear child god will show you the way only wait sobs choked marys reply i cant help  it mother but it seems so dark mrs faunce felt that the way was indeed dark the network of evil was enclosing her dear ones  their characters must become defamed but she would strive the more ear nestly to counteract the debasing influences and with marys help she could do muchfor her boys but how could she protect her   tryiing        rsalsand snares on dau  ghter frm the many pitfalls   s  o every side de when charley proposed playing sunday school the boys would not listen to it jim will thrash us if e play meetn said a dirty boy who preferred to tie ti dip pers to poor kittens to frighten them we wont tell him replied charley   o hell know it cried another bhe says you are all too stuck up playing sundayschool isnt stuck up persisted charley still trying to interest they yes tis stuck up shouted j  been close by theres your brother feels so nihy rill lick him yet see if i dont and your father an old drunkard this was too much for little charleyeven i in pursuit of his sabbathschool work sohe retreated to his mother telling her all his troubles at      slippery pathss it is very hard my son and i dont think you are old enough to do these wicked boys any good we will ask dear jesus to open the way and by and by perhaps you can have a sundayschool in crooked street and then winningly turning his thoughts to the bright pathway jesus had opened and telling him it could be entered only by bear ing trials she succeeded in encouraging him to enter again the battlefield of everyday life it was much easier to soothe charley in this way than fred who felt that it was an injus tice to them all for god to allow his father to make them so wretched  he did not often express this feeling to his mother but she knew it quite as well as if he had told her each day the disgrace that fell upon him like a shadow from his father soured his poud   tr yiang        heart in spite of all the sunshine of his moth ers words and life as fred was turning into crooked street soon after he saw jim piper shaking charley and swearing at him fred sprang forward and knocked jim down  jim caught fred by his leg and threw hit down too ina moment the street was filled wth ragged oy shouting give it to him  lick him hes a coward  dont let him get off it would have gone hardwith fred but for a policeman who heard the row and came and rescued him the matter was ended for that day ut fred knew that he was watched and that jim would seek revenge   ee montr had passed since the affair between jim and fred and hostili ties had daily been renewed by the street boys fred struggled hard to bear it patiently for mothers sake but he felt that it could be borne more easily if his father had not been that disgraceful thing a drunkard but to bear that disgrace and these insults was too much i will not bear this any longer he said to mary one evening that ugly jim piper does all he can to provoke me and for a    mysteries        month ive borne it without noticing him but i cant bear it any longer i wouldnt care a bit for him fred he is so ignorant but you would care ifyou had seen what he did today  well what was it  just as i turned into this street i saw father stumbling along as he does you know jim knocked off his hat daubed it with mud and bent in one side then put it on fathers head again father swore at him and jim chuckled over it in high glee i knew he did it to provoke me and i could hardly keep from rushing upon him i tell you ill thrash that boy yet continued fred his eyes flash ng as if his purpose could not be changed mary felt as indignant as her brother she felt too that jim richly deserved the punish ment fred threatened but she had the pru      slippery paths dence to keep from expressing this she saw that fred was in great danger she knew how he chafed at the insults of that bad boy and how sorely his fathers conduct tried him so resting her hand on her brothers she re plied gently q forgive him fred i ant mary i know its what you call wicked in me but why dont god hear your prayers for father mr hale our foreman says praying dont do any good for if it did every body would become converted and i think hes pretty nearly right why fred how can you say so  i think mr hale is a wicked man if he talks that way  but why dont father stop drinking and not make us all so miserable and unhappy im sure you and charley and mother are al ways praying for it may be we haventfaith enough but i   mysteries        think father will reform sometime im al most sure of it god is preparing us for some work he has for us it is hard to waitit looks dark and we may think god takes no thought of us but dont you remember the beautiful words of jesus the very hairs of your head are all numbered i dont see what you make out about the present unhappiness  what is the use of tak ing all these round about views replied fred impatiently you know fred it would be hard for father now to resist the temptation to drink when he sees everywhere in the city open bars and free liquor if he did not see it he would give it up he does try now some times mother says that makes no difference mary about the prayers being unanswered  why dont god hear the prayers of all good people and stop      slipper y paths all this business for other hearts are break ing besides ours i asked mother that question once and she said that was taking up the great question of gods allowing any sin so as doctors of divinity dont understand it you and i must not try to decide the why mother says god has wise purposes for allowing sin and after we have sinned he gives us a way of escape from the punishment we deserve so we had better not blame god but try to act rightly now mary i dont want to talk any raore about that i cant think as you do but i think i shall go away from all this soon i tell you so you need not worry if i dont come home some night fred im ashamed of you to think of such a thing how can you add to mothers troubles in such a way  that is the great reason ive not done this   mysteries        before i knew mother would feel so about it but it might be better for her here i work and work and then must give part of my wages to father for him to use disgracing us it is a great wrong you had better suffer wrong than hto do wrong replied his sister gently well about jim he thinks im a coward i dont care so much for what he thinks though but he shant go on in this wayill conquer that boy try and make him your friend be kind to him that will conquer him as mother says  when charley has trouble with the boys  it will be a blessing to jim to have a good sound thrashing and ill conquer him that way        x         vm frirpei ded onthemidf  fire fire firesounded on the mid night air men and boys rushed past the black house in crooked street taking up the cryfire ireand louder and louder grew the noise fred hastened to join the throng the fire was nearjust around the cornerin an alley ome old buildings were all aflame and the rind was still bearing destruction to others he sight of the crackling blaze the smoke nd cinders the water pouring from the en ines only to be licked up by the thousand   conquered        i red tongues and the flames shooting higher and higher was fearfully grandit was life struggling frantically with death high up in one of the windows a head was seen then quickly was gone breathlessly the crowd gazed while ladders went up and the water drenched the windows a moment more and a youth rushed from the blazing building dragging with him a dazed and blinded lad nearly his own size just in season to escape the filling roof a shout went uphes safe hes safe as the deliverer fell to the ground nearly suffocated and badly burned he was carried out of the alley and the lad whom he had rescued was also conveyed to a place of safety it was fred faunce who had impulsively risked his life as he saw the peril of the boy it was jim piper whom he saved jim did not suffer very much so that in a      slipper y paths few days he was out again and he kept the noisy boys away from that part of the street while fred was confined to the house when any of them followed the captain to pbn rags on his coat jim terrified them by threatening to whip them that starchy fred has killed me off jim old the boys i thought he was a spoony le kept so nice but hes no coward i tell as fred recovered his impatience at the rcumstances that controlled his life grew donger he did not trouble his mother with discontent but to mary he often uttered e bitter thoughts which these hours and ys of inactivity strengthened mary reported the change in his old enemy  and added mother says god has opened ray for us to do some good in crooked et   conquered        if father was a man we could do some thing even here fred replied i almost wish i had died in the fire only im not good enough to die i suppose vwell fred i think sometime father will stop drinking he never will may so long as he can get anything to drink its no use to talk that way well it might be worse our father is never cross when hes been drinking mrs riggs says that some men beat their wives and children and she told me of a man who chopped off his little boys hand when he opened the door to enter the house after he had driven him out into a storm  so it isnt so bad as it might be youre just like mother always finding a true storythe man was afterward reformed       sipperyaths some bright side or something hopeful im thankful if you can enjoy it just then mrs faunce entered the room and heard freds reply and cant my son find a bright side she asked when this bad ignorant boy has become your friendnt it a bright side that through him you can reach all those poor boys in crooked street if you choose but mother god makes things easy to ome and they never feel a hardship all their ives and others just as good have nothing asy but everythzng hard and wretched vhy is it if we had remained in our old home and ur father had never been tempted into ong doing you would have seen the easy e you speak of somebody was having a rd side then lid we pity such and try help them think of it my sonand    conquered        try to learn the lesson god is teaching you fred was softened a little but in a moment the bitter thought came back yes mother i see what you mean but why didfgod make such a difference he could have made everybody happy do you think it right for god to fred frea do not go on so but i think it so strange motherand sometimes i get quite confused with such questions it seems as though god only loves a few and bestows his favors upon them but the important question for you fred is whether or not you love god do not think so much about the hard or easy side one thing is certain god does not love us for what we have but for what we are fred was thoughtful and silent and his mother softly repeated the words of inspira tion      slippery pa ths how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been his counsellor be not overcome of evil but overcomeevil with good after weeks of suffering fred was again at his place in the printing house and mary had gone to work with a dressmaker and capt faunce was daily drinking up a part of v  their earnings the future looked darkthe way out of this misery uncertainand the long deferred hope was wearing away the life of mrs faunce charley was now earning a little as errand boy and was quite delighted to be able to help mamma as he said little nell was the sunbeam of the house hold  she had no memories of another and better home and could not realize the poverty   conquered        of the present one as her mother stitched away upon the work she obtained through kind mrs riggs nellies prattle beguiled the weary hours jim piper had asked fred to forgive him for treatin him so mean you saved my life he said and now im going to work and behave better fred forgave the past and sought to help him in his new purpose and soon found employment for him jim told charley he would help him play sunday school now so charley coaxed the b ys to meet in a shed near his home and hear him read stories jim helped get the boys in and then he staid by to make them behave he said but he was very ttentive and by and by when charley asked the boys to learn  verses from the testament jim took part with the others and so those lives were working out their i o      slipper y pa ths separate problems and the monotony of pov erty was making deep hard lines in the char acters of each but to fred now fast growing into man hood the influences were most dangerous not that vice of the type around him in crooked street could lure him but his em ployers were too mnch absorbed in their busi ness to think of the morals of the young men employed by them and so fred with his intemperate father and the temptations to spend his evenings with jolly company had no restraint save that of dear mother and sis ters love he often tried to believe that god did not notice anything about him and this was the quicksand beneath his feet pf    ix bright spring sunshine was gladden ing and warming the expectant earth early flowers were peeping from their sheltered beds and the grass sent up its soft blades a delicate foliage had taken the place of dry twigs the birds were returning to their sum mer resorts and the balmy air sent a thrill of delight through all nature the old black house in crooked street had one overhanging tree and a few shrubs and the shimmering sunbeams glanced upon all with a kindly beaming      slipperyths but all this gladness of nature and genial sunshine seemed a mockery to that suffering household  capt faunce had entered his home a few hours before partially intoxicated and crazed by bad whiskey and as he stumbled against a chair and then the table he thought that the room was whirling about him his wife at tempted to help him but with an angry oath he pushed her from him next little nellie was in his way and catching her by the arm he attempted to swing her over his head and dropped her into a kettle of hot water just taken from the stove the mother caught her child but too late she was fearfully burned and she now lay in her arms moaning and convulsed dear nell the loving pet knew not thegen tle hand of her mother nor the caress of her sister the doctor came but gave them   the demon cast out     i no encouragement that she could survive god has need of these little buds he said  and after all is it not in mercy that he sometimes takes them mrs faunce felt the force of his words she knew that for her innocent child it would be far better to be taken from misery and temptation and danger so with a subdued heart she watched the little sufferer and bathed her with cooling lotions when charley came in and found nellie in this condition he was overwhelmed with grief his mother whispered to him of jesus and that nelhe was one of the little ones till she soothed his bitter weeping fred had entered unnoticed by his mother and was listening to marys story of selles suffering    the mother looked up and was startled by the strange expression in the eyes of her boy      slipperyths motioning mary to attend to nellie she arose and stood by fred she tried to speak but words failed fred led her to a chair and gently smoothed her hair upon her brow then kissingher whispered mother do not fight against god fred it is better for nellie to go away from all this to a pure life if god is just he will bring retribution upon those who sell liquors and those who li cense the sale i saw father in that accursed shop in h   street and here is nell dying and he killed her mrs faunce saw that words were useless she felt too that it was better for her son to allow him to give expressioi his thoughts and she saw also that a new life had sprung up in his heart he seemed to have burst the shell of boyhood and suddenly stood before her a man this gave her strength for she   the demon cast out      longed for some manly arm to help and strong mind to guide for the moment she thought not of the danger that might come to him through this new spirit before the morning light returned the death angel had borne the little one to a brighter home above when all was over and the children had left the room mrs faunce knelt by the little bed and entreated the elder brother to guard those he had left her and save them from the many pitfalls hidden in their pathway in the morning mrs faunce led her hus band to the little bed where lay the child the pet not a word could she then speak to him who had so forgotten his own family and neglected and disgraced them when he saw that life had fled and the little form was cold he sank into a chair and     slippery paths covering his face groaned piteously his wife rested her hand on his shoulder and wept with him she did not attempt to console she only waited till he should speak to her he arose and walked the room in agony can heaven forgive me wife groaned the wretched man tell me how i did this then she told him how he entered intoxicated and crazed and how nellie came to her death oh my god my god have idone this have i blighted this dear life how blind how mad ive been after the precious dust had been consigned to the earth and the family were again in their desolate home the father told them that he had resolved never again to taste the intox icating cup days came and went and yet he resisted his appetite the struggle was often a fear   the demon cast out      ful one but wife and children helped him by tender forbearance by memories of long ago by histories of those who had overcome still it seemed doubtful whether good or evil would prevail the weakened moral the diseased thysical powers were on the side of the enemy while conscience and love stood over against them and reinforced by wife and children re sisted their assaults upon the shattered consti tution but soon a fever prostrated him and during hours of fearful delirium he needed strong men to guard him for days this lasted and at times he thought he was among vipers and fiery serpents and demons and in vain he struggled to escape from them doctor wilkins said if he could keep his patient along a few days he might be a re deemed man  and when one morning he entered and found him pale and helpless but      slippery pa ths calm and with returning reason beaming from his eyes he felt that the crisis was passed strength slowly returned to those feeble limbs and painful indeed were the medita tions of the humbled man yet the demoniac had been freed from the grip of the demon and was now in his right mind for many days life seemed to hang by a slender thread but each day strengthened the hopes of wife and children that a new life was dawning in the soul of him they so ten derly ca re for and watched over it was nwjune and one little rose bush that in spite ofall obstacles had taken root beneath the windoa of the dingy walls sent out its buds and succeeded in gaining strength to expand them into full bloom capt faunce now convalescent had been helped to a seat near the window the sweet fragrance reached him and awakened thoughts   the demon cast out      of the past that had long slumbered the bright home and happy faces of dear ones came back like a sweet picture mary was sitting near busily at work her father watched her in silence until his wife joined them and also commenced sewing with an energy that necessity and hope alone can inspire this with the memories awakened by the roses caused the invalid to groan and press his hand upon his head both wife and daughter started thinking he was suddenly ill no no said he i was thinking of the past do not father it will make you sick again yes i must speak for i need your sym pathy as well as your help in my new life then he spoke of his purpose to reform af ta      slippery paths ter nellies birth and his weary efforts to find emp ymenthis groping brooding bitter thoughts and then his turning to the old life and madly going down down in the slippery way his wife had warned him of so often now god had left him to take the life of his child the god he had mocked had left him to his evil ways and now he could see his hand and was humbled the retrospect was painful and mary quiet ly withdrew while the injured wife anderring husband sat together in the deepening twilight communing as they had not for years with a reciprocal tenderness and with hopes of bright er days nothing but strength from above will ena ble you to keep the purpose you have made to seek the safer pathway you long ago left i think i have sought that aid wife and i wished to speak of that too and to tell you   the demon cast out      that i trust in your savior and feel he has forgiven me for hating him one evening when my sins seemed like mountains between myself and god i heard charley softly read ing the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin and then i heard him pray for me he did not know that i heardhe thought i was asleep but it was that promise and that prayer that brought peace to me and there in the deepening shadows they prayed together and felt the baptism of the holy spirit upon them     r x four  years have passed and again we look into the home of capt faunce just outside the city a few miles from its din and bustle he has rented a neat cottage health has returned to his weakened frame happiness to his heart his wife once more wears the sweet smile of love and the cheer fulness of long ago her hair a little silvered her step a little less buoyant than when we first saw her yet to mary sunshine and spring flowers and song of birds come only to relieve her    sunshne         i weariness the exertions and exposures of those years of poverty and sorrow were too severe for one so delicate no one knows bet ter than she that the slow fading of her life is nearly over but she dwells not upon the past she is thankful that her dear father has been saved and her mother rewarded for all her long suffering and faithfulness her father is a respected citizena disciple of jesus is not this enough and fred too has ceased to pry into the secrets of the infinite his saviour is his el der brother he seeks to lead the fallen back to irtu ous and industrious life and to surround them

scores and perhaps hundreds of our readers have seen the good ship fleetwing and someperhaps remember to have stood on her deck not a pretentious vessel either in model or carrying capacity a thveequarter clipper of a thousand tons register she has made some tventy voyages around the horn this was her third or fourth she had for a captain a cape cod skipper by the name of howes who had before made two aroundtheworld trips in the same vessel according to my observation and comparison of sailoraccounts he was in many respects a much better character than the average of his class and he loudly boasted of his humanitarianism and it was understood thit he did not wish the officers to kick or otherwise maltreat any of the crewwhile he was on deck so our cuffing was carried on principally in the night time the mate was a state of maine man hailing from portland and as to the relative merits of the harbors of boston and portland i recollect some very earnest discussions between the captain and the first officer while i was at the wheel the mate was a gob hearted man though he would fly into a passion and swingjitg boot with an emphasis during the morning watchi if any fthe men or boys attempted to  soldier  when hauling on the mainbrate i suspect that much of the captains talc in favor off htimane treatment of seamenwhich came up to us oecasioially tirough the

fleetwing as she lay in the stream in new york har bor in the summer of  was a little baldheaded gentleman with out hat or coat who was pacing up and down by the binnacle i supposed at the time that he was the captain and for several hours during that day i watched his actions and observed his countenance  as i had the opportunity for the purpose of determining in my own mind what was the nature of the master for the voyage towards evening as i looked back from the forecastle deck i thought i saw  is anozther but very similar individual walking up and down or across the main deck in front of the cabin doora person bearing a strik ing resemblance to that one whom i had mistaken for the captain it proved to be the same person now covered with a large heavy wig and a continental caps and exhibiting a very blue coat thickly garnished with very bright brass buttons this was our passenger  our only passengerb the officers saluted as doctor by the crew nicknamed oldslipand goeasy he was a

professedly minute and exact account of the monotonous rout ine of sailor life few if any of the youthful readers in any degree appreciate the rigor and wearisomeness which it is intended to de pict

including four boys socalled and a carpenter i suppose the majority of california clip percrews were in those daysas indeed i resiume they are now motley gatherings with unique specimens of humanity from widely separated portions of the globe we had represented besides our own nation englard ireland scotland holland and sweden and there was one ordinary seaman namedsebastopol who claimed to be the descendant of a russian military officer and a french lady and whose countenance tended to confirm his distinguished genealog ical boast sebastopol was a a character he would trip along the deck in a kind of half minuet stylealways restless always intolerant of any sitting work where he could not be in sitting proximity to a ship matewith a mode of utterance which was very dignified and even stilted andapparently quite out of keeping with his nervous and even fantastic predisposition of body many a time have i worked with him on the spars which lay on deck or on the shrouds or out on the jibboom and i always felt conscious of th fact that he was boss when we two were comparatively alone togetherhhe would direct me in his shortoff style to attend to this or that part of the job which our officer hail assigned to us and then he would demand of me whenever sof disposed certain matters of inform mationusually a record of somne part of my lifewhich inform ation or record i now remember i had no more thought of my right to withhold from him than iould have questioned when a child the authority of my father to ask me to give an account of my where abouts and actions during a day of constructive truancy long tom another leading member of our watch must also have a paragraph of description for indeed he acted a prominent part in many another notable sceneon our voyage as well as on the occasion to which i shall particularly efer long tom was six feet two  born in sweden but from sixteen to thirtyfive the age at which he had then arrived sailorbred in the american merchant marine he did not appear to be well built though of sufficient diameter of chest when taking our usual estimate from the height but in truth he was a remarkably powerful as well as active man there truth e   was a remarkablypow             c was no aristocracy about tom he was always considerate and gener ous toward the boys and on more than one occasion he interfered to prevent the hollander named harry  from abusing jim woods in the night timle  for this interference harry on several occasions swore at tom in a vast quantity of broken dutch calling him among other things a  chickenhearted coward  tom further illustrated his goodsense and temper by replying to such assaults from diminu tive harry with simple advice to i try and be civil harry was a rmean fellow noisily boasting of his courage his abil ity to whip aidyman of his size and his inclination to make a match with any man twice his size before he would take any sass jim wtodswasa boy of about nineteen who

too steep for him s his sentence on account of incorrigible wildness was commuted to theforecastleof ourclipper jims own story about his offenses oin land did not make him out a very wicked hoodlum indeed it seemed ctto  me that the worst crime in the catalogue to which he confessed was theconnecting of the doorbell handles and wires of the neighbors houses with a strong galvanic battery con veniently located via the vicinity with the ivory or glass knob neatly covered wi i tin foil he hadl surprised a succession of visitors to evening patmson numerous occasions in a manner productive accordingtd i s accountof remarkable epileptic and st vitus maneuvers he related one or two instances in which very sancti monious mifiisters of the gospel had laid a zealous hand on the presumably nonconducting knob and thereupon momentarily had forgotten their professional propriety of speechindulging in ex clamatory repetitions of the various names of the deity with a tone and manner essentially different from that scrupulously observed in the regular pulpit exercise of decorous prayer i think that jinm was by birth or breeding past reclamation as a practical joker a short time before entering harbor he urged several members of our watchincluding your humble servaftto engage in a conspiracy the executive plan of which was as follows the captain was somewhat of a portly man and after walking up and down the poop deck four or five times he was in the habit of leaning on the roof of the diningroom and pantry cabin to rest himselfplig his rounded chin into the converging palms of his     hands woods had ciphered precisely where the captain was in the habit ofocating his elbows he proposed that a well emeryed sailneedle should be rigged underneath from the outer aft corner of ahe stewards pantry so that by means of a string run down the side of the pantry and under the gangway steps and thence along the spare main yard the little dagger might be made to play into the flesh of the skipper this audacious propositionwhich if acceded to and carried out would probably have resulted in bring ing all the guilty parties concerned before judge hoffman under an indictment for mutinywas modified by the council of the more cautious mariners who were willing to agree to a practical joke in this line so as io have its piercing point in an accustomed sitting place of the somewhat unpopular steward there was a young englishman in our watch a chubby fellow of about twentyone years of age who had seen service in a british frigate in the crimea fie it was who baptizedsebastopol for which office he was not beloved by the russofrenchman of whom i have spoken a little scotchman with a remarkable falsetto voice and great natural gift for music was also a member of our watch and his singing of plaintive sailor songs dwells in my memory tonight with a pathos that seems to mne unequaled by any ballads i have heard upon the land the recollection of his weird chanting of a scottish herringbank psalm haunting me many times with its ineffable sweetness oscar arnold from sandy hill new york was the youngest boy on board  not over fifteen at the outside he was rather a quiet lad for his years with a large bump of secretiveness and jim woods used him as a convenient implement for carrying out vari ous plans for vexation and torment against any of either watch who undertook to put on airs with jim woods oscar subsequently made a second voyage around the horn and then from eighteen months working in the brokerage business in san francisco in  and his office being on washington street near montgomery herealized about twenty thousand dollars clear profit with this sum as a sufficiency he has returned to his eastern home there to live and lounge upon the interest of his capital  i must detain you to mention another shipmate his name was m inewlls then about twentythree or twentyfour years of age  heis widowed mother was a wealthy lady residing in brooklyn his       sister had married one of the nabobs of tat city he had enjoyed the best of opportunities for a firstclass education and had been crammed up into the sophomore year of columbia college he was on board the fleetfwingg as he informed me as an undergrad uate on detached servicea happy combination phrase evidently made up for condensed reference to his collegiate and militia com pany training i have been told that during a number df years since our arrival tom was an eminently useful copyist and a very modest actor at a place called the new bella unionwhich mr pickering says is the name of a  minor theater in san francisco tom had evidently been a hard drinker before he came on ship board and i suspect he was more than half anoutlaw from the maternal mansion the carpenter was a great burly englishmana man of very rare intelligence and full of ready romantic information concerning the thousand and one ports he had visited the cook was a little irishman not larger than oscar as good natured as he dared to be but evidently instructed by experience that it was necessary for him as a rule in his intercourse with sailors to stand on his reserved rights blessings upon him for the titbits of softtack and sunday plumpudding which he occasionally left at a point of rendezvous for his favorites in the forecastle i lately heard with great distress that while acting in his professional capacity on board an english guano brig he was tripped on deck by a  sea which came over the cathead and washed him through the disproportionately sized scupperhole the steward was a sickly man of about forty years ofage he incurred the hostility of a majority of the crew at the outset of the d voyage from suspicion to the effect that he had  blabbed  to the captain about some remarks which the first officer made concerning the ignorance of the chattering skipper on some indifferentsubject i am satisfied the suspicion was unjust but the steward suffered many things on account of itinclusive of the projection of the emeryed needle mentioned before in this manuscript he played on the flute with considerable skill and good taste and sometimes  accompanying the little scotchman during the dogwatchwehad  an entertainment which was highly appreciated byall o bboards ainid  seemed even to humanize thesecond officer himself   s i  we made a broad offing from the harbor of dnew yorkit  cleai   the west indies and the outermost brazilian cape ra anrd l         a     s         t       passage to the line and extraordinary showerbaths for the new hands during the night when the equator wascrossed no incident of any note in the north atlantic except the meeting and exchange of salutations with the intrepid off the river la platte came our first experience of a storm be fore which we rode toward the cape at the rate of fifteen or sixteen knots an hour   when we were within a few degrees of st johns land i over heard the captain telling the mate that we would take the outside and as i was then at the wheel i had some orders to change the course in accordance with this instruction long tom had a lame hand and i agreed to take his trick for him at the morning watch it was a beautiful moonlight night and the moon was undimmed in its splendor though it had reached the westernmost quarter of the heavens when i took the wheel at four oclock we had passed st johns land and were close to its southern extremity when this watch began suddenlyshooting out from the haze of the sea all hands on deck simultaneously saw a ship coming up about four points off to leeward i noticed very shortly that the intention on the part of the officer in command of the approaching ship was to hail us from the windward i was venturing something myself with a view to prevent this maneuver when i heard the voice of the cap tainhe speaking from his stateroom belowordering the man at the wheel to keep her up in a few minutes the captain was on deck and manifesting a considerable amount of uneasiness which greatly surprised me from so phlegmatic a nature th at ship didnt get to the windward i think the main yard would have been backed before the man at the wheel would have given up hopes of prevent ing such a catastrophe our rear racer gave up that windward job and slid close up to the leeward and there sounded hoarsely over the billows ship ahoy what ship is thatour captain replied the fleetwing what ship is thatinstead of replying with her name the master of the ship which had come up to us from the channel inside st johns land repeated his question and added is that the benjamin peabodyour skipper again replied as before when the response came ship lord morpeth bound for valparaiso after stating our hailing point and destination the captain of the lord morpeth shook out his fore and mizzen royals and unfurling the british banner from his spankers peak ex asperatingly saluted us with good night little yankee land    moved rapidly ahead to this last salutation and intended val edictory our skipper made no reply in his excess of caution he had ordered not only our main skysail but also our fore and mizzen royalyards sent down a full week before this night his orders now were mr goodwin all hands on deck send up those yards i guess those yards went up in just about as expeditious a manner as any business of that kind was ever transacted i can feel the tears coming in my eyes now when i think about it it seems to me now as if those sails were bent on by some sleightof hand i remember a long thrill in the roots of my hair when the halyards were simultaneously pulled and the little bellies aloft began to draw it didnt need a hint much less a command from the captain to put our clipper right on the white canvas of lord mor peth and clearer and clearer is it seen as the fleetwing glides up like a bird of prey after its victim up and up nearer and nearer now we are abreast therie has been a little bundle dangling over my head for several minutes past let her fly yelled our cap tain to the first officer and with a goodbye john bull fairly crashing through that boston trumpet the sharpedged vessel of yankeeland flew away from the tardy keel of old england leaving a wake of laughing waters behind herwhile the flag of the union whipped out its saucy stripes in the breeze moonlight was being superseded by daylight as through the glass the first officer declared he had lost sight of the rival vessel of the morning andlthen the winds began to  blow blow blow in de gree and temper fully sufficient to vindicate our latitude off the famous promontory of the south before the night closed in uplon us we had a full view of some of the snowclad mountains which we were told constituted a part of cape horn proper and which were only twenty or thirty miles distant from its outermost point we hoped to see the literal extremity of the cape on the follow ing daya point of vision of which sailors delight to boast but we were driven too far south and had in this matter only the captains speculation delivered to his officers to the effect that through his glass he believed he saw the bigtoe of south america we had a full season in the fleetwing on that trip off and below cape horn and for the benefit of the inexperienced as well as an exclusively legitimate part of my story i must tell of the new rout ine and predicaments exigencies and intimacies which pertain to an average cape horn season   io according to our log we were plump thirtyfour days from st johns land until we began as pat expressed it to pull up out of the patagonian climate the regular labors of the sailor in the cleanin anand polishing and painting and repairing of the vessel are suspended almost altogether in this sense there is an easier life than when sailing in a temperate or comparatively stormless zone the business of the watch on deck is principally confined to the sailing management of the vessel so that during the daythe active watch is often as idle as the men and boys below this is to my purpose because you will all now understand the relative novelty of the situation how the closer acquaintances are formed in that tem pestuous latitude in the unusual time for protected and unreproved intercommunications and here for the first time with us all hands were called on deck in the night time to take in sail or aid in wearing ship and such scenes such lively cooperation contributed to our mutual familiar ity  in short it is the fact that members of different watches though bunking in the same house might land at a distant port com parative strangers to each other if the voyage was altogether fair and sunny i became acquainted with that crew as a congregation of sailors during that cape horn season by the conversations the anecdotes and tales which i heard es pecially during the fifteen days in which we never took off our oil skins i commenced to appreciate my society withlthe exception of jim woods and myselfoscar arnold being too young to pos sess a combative judgmentthere was the most implicit belief on the part of the crew in ghosts and goblins in hydras and chimeras dire although i had by this time acquired something of that cau tious disposition which i have intimated belonged to the cook in my participation in the talks in the forecastle i had the unwise hardihood to laugh incredulouslyi was not so courageous as to sneer outrightat some of the seaserpent and human apparition stories withwhich the cape horn circle of entertainment was opened even my hitherto very staunch friend long tom was not only man ifestly shocked at my sign of disbelief but he distinctly gave me no tice of his suspicion that i was assuming patronizing airs in the premises thought i knew a little more than anybody else and so  forth i discovered that it wouldnt do to smile even when an an cient mariner legend was recited i further ascertained thai the       m second mate was according to his own admissions as superstitious as any of the crew while keeping watch on the forecastle deck during this season i was frequently visited by the first officer who had found it agreeable to talk with mewhenever he could do so without observation on the part of any of my shipmates from him i learned that the cap tainwhom he exceedingly dislikedhad a slavish fear of astro logical signs  a fact which he gathered or correctly inferred from the repeated voluntary untimely unnecessary disclaimers which the master made and this i confirmed by my own unavoidable listen ing when at the dinner hour i stood at the wheel which was not above ten feet from the captains dining tablethe rear door of the house aft opening five or six feet distant from the binnacle p the staple conversation during the season was founded on ghostly historiesat once the delight and terror of the igno rant sailors on one occasion pat mercer ventured an expres sion of disbelief after the english boy had related a yeritable account of the appearance and doings of a mermaid in the bay of biscay o whereupon there was a thoroughly chorused prop osition to throw the paddy sonofagun  over the gangway of course pat was not seriously alarmed by this extravagant threat but he took it as full of notice and he admitted with undoubted sincerity in reply to a question by no less a personage than the carpenter that he believed there were such things as mermaids he had no doubt that the genuine article had been seen on one or two occa sions within the enclosures of the giants causeway tom wells not only informed me in a very friendly manner that i would get my head broke if i threw any doubt on such stories or perhaps if i failed to acquiesce in the claim for their truthfulness but he also privately and therefore sincerely informed me that he had no sort of question as to the possibility  of any of the stories which he had heard although in each particular instance there might have been some exaggeration such were my associations and i will confess to you with the confident expectation that it is to go no further that from motives of pardonable policy and perhaps subsequently out of a feeling of pride in the discovery of some little talent on my part for this class of fabrications at about the middle of the cape horn season i opened and thence continued to extemporize legends and visions which proved to be exceedingly palatable to my hearers and which i  i  am sure were sufficiently horrible to have satisfied the appetite of jack halyard or midshipman easy within ten days from the date of my accession to the circle of duly accredited storytellers i was consciously transferred from the position of a  sub  to the full com fort arid glory of a favorite storyteller in the forecastle of the clip per ship fleetwing i only suffered one twinge of misgiving or remorse of conscience and that was momentarywhen our doctor passenger oldslip andgoeasy who had by some means learned of my newly obtained position contemptuously remarked in my insignificant presence and for my hearing that there was one fellow in the forecastle who was stuffing the rest of the crew with all the cursed nonsense that they would hold after reflection i thought i was justified in my extem porizings but the remark convinced me that our passenger was far above the reach of any kind or quality of superstition on the twentieth of december it was announced through the cook who had the information from the stewardthe competent authority at secondhandthat in three or four days we should be out of the woods  a land phrase brought into the nautical diction ary one or two centuries ago and probably at the same time that the celebrated mothergoose song was originated concerning the redherrings that grow in the groves and the blackbirds that grow in the sea in four days at the furthest it was estimated we should catch some available winds on the southern ruffled edge of the south pacific trades then we had been a full month off that terrific cape and we all knew we had earned an outcome into better weather pat mercer was the first one to inform or remind the crew in one of our sociables that christmas was at hand as about a week before the date last mentioned he bethought himself of his religious obli gations and refused to eat meat on friday and pat told us many a really delightful tale of fairies and witches and protecting disem bodied saints and tormenting demons who had been known to cut up all sorts of capers in old ireland he took the lead i may say in this species of history while long tom followed closely in the van tom wells and pat however boldly rejected santa claus and it was unanimously agreed that the early visits of that patron of childhood had been succeeded in great britain and the united states by direct human agencies have i conveyed to you the idea and the impression that our crew were thoroughly possessed by a complete and unhesitating faith in                   that class of appearances a belief in which are especially denomin ated superstition but i have not roused a suspicion concerning the effectwhich such associations may have upon the vaunting en lightened mind an effect only awating special demonstrations to develop those four days of promise and of hope wore slowly away but we knew we were making at least one hundred miles northing every twentyfour hours on the third day it was suggested and accepted as a happy omen that we would teach fair pushing winds on christ mas day it was christmas eve we had bent on arid made more sail during the afternoon and we felt convinced that the prophecy that had come to us through the cook was to be fulfilled on the morrow the sun set that night amid a great wealth of crimson clouds the high running sea softened down asthe shades came on the wind too gradually fellaway at least there were no more gusts with much less of sea and wind we were maintaining our speed our watch came on deck that night at eight oclock i remember when we came out of the forecastlelooking at the gibbous moon the southern cross and orion  bottomsideup and smiling within myself as i thought of what the mate had told me the light before concerning a division between these luminaries by clouds which the captain said he didnt believe signified anything  jim woods was to keep the first lookout i the second i walked up and down from amidship to the cooks galley in company with long tom until two bells then we sat on one of the water casks until it became time to relieve the lookout the mate came for ward as four bells was struckand inquired who was to take the watch by the forestay and he enjoined it upon me to keep wide awake for he said we were in a locality in which we might expect a company of strangers  ayeaye sir i replied and took my station jim woods said he couldnt sleep if he laid down behind a sparthe usual bunking place on deckand so he would keep me company for a little while he had not been with me however more than fifteen minutes when the mate sang out for the watch to come and haul on the main brace presently i heard the familiar yoheave  heaveyo and then the final order  belayi was waiting in expectancy of jim woods return when suddenly i was startled by a hoarse whisper which i at once identified as coming from the mate but which startled me and put me in a terror never e           theless the words were my god sumner turn round and look up at the port end of the foreyardi first turned of course and looked toward the spot from whence the voice proceeded the mate was standing on the deck leaning up in the corner made by the starboard roundhouse and the forecastle platform deck he was looking in the direction indicated and as the moon shone squarely upon his face i saw that he was livid pale of course this increased the trepidation which his words had caused me and it was with considerable effort that i turned my eyes toward the port end of the fdreyard for some reason the studdingsail boom which was rigged above that yardarm never had been sent down it projected a foot and a half or two feet beyond the outer ring there seated outside that boom was the figure of a man dressed in white overall or drawers tucked into longlegged boots with a seajacket with a heavy fur cap decorated with many feathers the view was of the back or at an angle to the side of the figure i felt my heart thumping within me like a piece of ice i believe i have been able ever since to describe from that one sensation the exact locality of that central organ of my bodyincluding all the valves and arterial passages adjacent thereto but i was not beyond reason i thought like lightning of the possibilities that that figure was the person of this that or the other member of our crew and knowing the ca pacity and limitations of their wardrobe i took all the possibilities into consideration it transpired afterwards that the mate had done the same before he hailed me my pulse had warmed a little during the instant in which this argument was accomplished but it went back into the frigid zone at the conclusion thereof then i turned toward the mate and as the result of all the resolution i could sum mon i huskily said what is it the mate replied not but after a few moments more of fixed staring at the awful object above he put his hands behind him and shoving himself out started and staggered toward the foot of the foremast he was a full quarter of a minute making that distance of less than fifteen feet he dropped rather than leaned down upon the timbers and took hold of the tongue rope and commenced tolling the bell i swung around and looked up there was no change in the position of the figure as soon as six bells were struckone more than could be due i heard exclamations aft which of course increased in number and vehemence as the mate kept on tolling that bell jim woods came running forward and sang out what in h is the matter with   i t i      i you sumnerhe was followed up closely by the hollander harry who cried out that the mate ought to come forward and kick me down the steps they both saw and recognized the mate before i could reply they drew up in such an attitude of astonishment as you can well imagine and then they heard me sing outfor i had recovered my voice and perhaps something of my courage look up at the port end of the foreyard jim woods looked up first thrust his thumbs into the sides of his pantaloons and walked back ward against the forecastle deck stairs after looking at the mate for full a minute harry turned round and looked up he swung around in his tracks and dropped flat on the deck as if he had been shot the exclamatory talk and shouting aft had ceased and i knew that there had been a discovery in that quarter i looked all around my horizon of observation nothing in sight i walked past the capstan and down those forecastle deck stairs although i was perfectly paralyzed from my hips down so far as any physical sensation was concerned and it occurred to me right then and there that i had been playing a game of brag during all the youthful days of my life                  i put my hand on the matesshoulder when he irediately stopped that dreadful bell and interpreting my purpose said to me and to jim still in a whisper lets go aft stop a moment said jim woods he seized the end of the strap which was attached to the cooks bailingbucket and which by some accident had been left under the steps went to the side to the leeward threw the canvas bucket over and drew it up full he immediately emptied the contents on the prostrate form of the hated hollander exclaim ing as he did so that squares us for what i got on crossing the line this action had not only an immediate arousing effect on the fainting victim but served to reassure or supply manly stimulus to the mate and myself the mate at once spoke out in his usual tone jim woods youre thebravest man on this ship well replied jim as we were walking aft  theres no use being scared before you are hurt i think that is oldslipandgoeasy with the night mare as jim said this we had nearly reached the main hatch way and we had passed half a dpzen terrorstricken souls leaning against watercasks or standing by the side of the captains cabin the englishman standing up as stiff as a pokerlike a corpse on end tom wells in a delirious shiver pat mercer crossing him self but at the same time ejaculating ill go up ill go up with i any other man the mate at once replied to jim woods sur mise i wouldnt wonder if that was it he ran into the cabin door with the well understood intention of verifying the suggestion by a visit to the doctors stateroom jim woods sang out his theory of the case and at once there was a rally from all points and a low commencement of a general laugh over the alarm andconsternation from which it was supposed we had unnecessarily suffered and harry was coming aft with growling but indistinct articulation which caused jim woods to shift his knife around into a more convenient place for grasping we heard the voice of the captain as he went up the back stairs and demanded of the man at the wheel whats all this disturbance wheres the matelong tom was at the wheel he had seen nothing but confessed he had been alarmed by the ringing of the bell though he had not the remotest idea of the cause i had ventured clear aft and was standing by the edge of the houselon the poop deck when the captain turned from long tom to seek information elsewhere i did not wait for any question i told the captain at once what i had seen and what the mate had done and i said that the mate must have passed the captains door on his way to the doctors room only a few seconds before the captain came out i wondered how they could have missed meeting just then the mate came up the aft cabin stairs on to the poopdeck and addressing me instead of the captain said once more in a whisper the doctor is asleep in his bunk so is the steward and the second mate i getting up whats the meaning of this disturbance mr goodwin sharply inquired the captain have you lost your senses this rebuk ing question thoroughly sobered the mate so to speak and from that moment on he was perfectly selfpossessed and gave no sign of fear he asked the captain to walk forward on the leeward side at this moment the second mate came up i saw by his countenance that he believed the first officer had been frightened by a sea gull or some such innocent object and i thought i could read a gloating gladness at the probable disgrace and humiliation of his superior somehow i knew i was not trespassing but was welcome company when i walked close behind the captain down the port poop deck stairs and then beside him up to the cooks galley there was the figure to be seen as before when the captain first caught sight of it he trembled and leaned up against the galley docr saying i knew those clouds meant something the second mate went right   i   i down on his knees and commenced bawling and praying there were no more orders from the captain that night the mate turned around and asked e to go and take the wheel and send long tom forward at this moment the steward appeared with the well known wig of the dpctor in his hand he had heard of the cause of the sensation from long tom had gone down into the doctors stateroom and found his wig on the pillow but the doctor not there there was a simultaneous cry it is the doctor after allbut the words were hardly out of our mouths when the  doctor himself appeared on the scene half dressed and more than half dead with fright from the recital which long tom had just given him when he saw the object he flopped over on the hatchway like a wet dishcloth and laid there until he was camphorised half an hour afterward just at that moment there was a shrill scream heard coming from above uswe all knew from whenceand the figure slid for ward and fell down feet foremost into the seathats a human being said the mate very calmly but quickly and he added in his usual shouting tone all hands on deck and get one of these boats overboardjust then from some unknown impulse i sprang to the side of the ship and looked over there was a large sixoared boat alongside tied to the forechains it contained two casks and a chicken coop i dont know how i made the announcement the mate ordered me again to the wheel as i started aft i saw him push over the second mate and i heard mr goodwin say something very bad long tom went forward and made a glorious illustration of his courage and seamanship the mate long tom jim woods and sebastopol got into that boat and cast off we were going at about the rate of two knots and the sea was almost calm an object could be distinctly seen there had been no cry after that scream i watched the progress of the boat as it made toward and approached the object i saw a figure lifted into the boat in less than thirty minutes the boat was alongside again i heard the mate say it is a young man he was raised carefully to the deck while in an unconscious state restoratives applied as he was laid out on the cabin roof brought him to within the hour but he was not in his rightr lnd until the next day then we learned that he had been wrecked twelve days previous that he was an english episcopal missionary on his way o l isj to the sandwich islands via san francisco in the ship fairfield that his waterlogged vessel had been abandoned by officers and crew he having been placed in this boat in which he had met the rleetwing and supplied with provisions and water sufficient to last him a fortnight the captain of the fairfield had saidwheth er profanely or derisively i did not learnthat the minister could take care of himself by himself indeed the cause of this isolation was never satisfactorily explained to me this young manrev geo m cooperhad become crazed with his long and solitary drift ing at the time whenhe was fairly magnetized up to our ships a  sideas he expressed it he had a vague recollection of fasten ing his boat wrapping a rope difepreservers around him and going up a long flight of stairsand out on a corridor from which he thought he was pushed by some passing fiend having two cork lifepreservers upon him he was kept above the water and saved on the day of his return to reason and a realization of his wonder ful recovery he obtained permission of the captain to hold a christmas service of thanksgiving upon the main deck of the fleet wing we all attended that service and when he extemporized an earnest prayer of recognition and thanksgiving for the kindness of the almighty to him we all said heartily amen    r j e in j  p  i r philadelphia malignants philadelphia malignants  b y tartan philadelphia wrii  co  south thnd stiitrt  the malignants chapter i  now it came to pass in the latter days that the people of the yan kees waxed great and possessed all the land between the great seas even from the suns rising unto the set ing of the same and in the sight of the other nations they were as giants and so were they in their own sight  and all the people were of one language and speech and whatsoever they did set themselves to do behold they accomplished and it was said of them the yan kees can do any thing  thus the whole nation was puffed up and some of the people even more so than others and among these latter were certain sons of belial who said let us divide the land and thereby become twice as great as now the m alignants the mb lign ants  and the wise men and elders forbade tose but they cried out so much the more iying greater is the two halves than the whole and they gathered to them a great multitude of the baser sort and set them in battle array and lo the nation was di vided but the  land was not  and the division was on this wise part of the people were busy from morn until even at some useful work each with his own hands and taught his children so and an other part were idle and loved swift horses and strong drink and said unto the other part lo ye are grovelling and not fit to con sort with us thus the nation was divided even between the idlers and the workers  and the idlers became suddenly indus trious for mischief and they seized some of the strongholds of the nation and gathered a great army against the chief city and thus there was fierce war in the land  now the chief city was a great one but in certain things only it had divers great houses there and when men looked from one house over unto the next house lo the distance was great the temple where the elders and rulers met was very great   tile malignants      and the money that was given out thence was the greatest of all howheit the men who sat there and did make the laws were not great and the wisdom which they spake was very little but the city was called by the name of one truly great man and the sweet savor of his faith fulness did consecrate the city to the whole people  nevertheless there was another city which in the beginning was the chief city of the yan kees and the two cities were thus noted of the wise the younger city seemed like unto jerusalem where the tribes of israeel met yearly in the time of their slrengh and pride but the elder city was like unto shiloh where the fathers came to gether from the wilderness and agreed upon their inheritance and sware one to the other to be one nation  now this elder city was known among mel as the city of the broadbrims for it was builded by the sect of the broadbrims at the first whose chief rule was that men should not go to war nevertheless though they es chewed soldiering they were fond of uni form dress of the color celled drab and as for their hats they had ample brims so they were called broadbrims       the malignants  but the founders of the city called it philadelphia which being interpreted is jove of brothers a good name and a kindly but dike friendship a name only likewise they called themselves the sect of friends and knowing it was said by them of old time that a good name is better than great riches they thought that to have both would be best of all and lo in their generations many of them did so attain to their wishes as to be friends only to themselves and tolove no thing but money  now there wasalso another rule among said friands and it wasthis that all men should work and when the war of the idlers d id arise both old and young of the sect were much moved and they said this is of the wisdom that is from theeath  now it came to pass scan after that the broadbrims had founded their city ibero did come among them certain imen of a very different clothing and temper for they were men of war and their dress showed more colors even than josephs coat neverthe less they were keen for trade and diligent in business and they helped to build the city cesar himself had caught sight of their fa   i i i i i   thers in his day and he called them painted men and men of the woods howheit they cared not for cesars report of themthey gave cesar hs own and asked for theirs in return  and these men of the gay clothing were called covenanters and they dwelt among the broadbrims and so do their de scendants even to this day and when the war of the idlers did wax fierce the broad brims were greatly stirred in spirit thereby for they said lo here is either work and war or peace and idleness  then came near to them the cove nanters dnd uncovered to them a great rys tery and these opened to the broadbrims the great book of truth where it is writ ten the wisdom which is from above is first pure then peaceable  and their eyes were opened and they saw that until there is purity there can be no peace and the young men of the city rose up together even three score thousand as it were in one day and went forth to bat tle against the idlers  thus did the elder city in the hour of peril while the younger city looked this       the maiignants way and that way and made no sign of hope and the nation was greatly encouraged be cause of the counsel and the deeds of the elder city even philadelphia for they said this day is trie city well named  howheit there were in the same city certain men of whom it is written anathe ma sons of satan whose end is to be burned one of these was iiamed of his mother ouilliam bee rid for she said the day will come when he shall be rid of all his true friends and another is jorjemr war towrn who believeth in four surplices at allhallow tide and there is also one rend all whose doonm is one day to be torn in pieces  now the acts of these and of other children of wrath and their fearful end are they not written in other chapters the which men may read if they will  chapter it  now of bee rid and of war town and of rend all whoso readeth let him under stand it is thus written they have all gone out of the way   and it was so that bee rid and his   the malignants      father and his grandfather did dwell in the city of the broadbrims and the first dealt deceitfully with the nation and the second did so with the city and the third likewise with both city and nation and it was on this wise  notwithstanding of his father and his grandfather yet bee rid had other kindred who were most honorable and true and these did put him forth into high place while he was as but a lad and thus was he ad xannced until nicholas the money king did make him to be one of his counsellors fur thermore when the covenanters did move the bones of one of them to a new grave who of old was a warrior and had been slain in battle lo bee rid was the orator at the burial thus was he held in high es teem and the people did bring unto him both riches and honor  but even as it is written the swine that was washed is returned to wallowing in the mire   and itcame to pass after certain years that there arose a chief ruler among the yan kees whose name was buqh anan the same is james the faithless and he       the ialignants cast about him for counsellors and chose tiln cunning men instead of wise ones and he sent ambassadors to many nations be yond the great seas and to the farthest of these even to china he did send bee rid and all the people did marvel at this for aforetifme these two had contemnned and de rided each the other but like unto pilate and herod they were now made friends and men called the ruler james the faithless and the ambassador they did call china bill  now the land of china lyeth at the uttermost distance from the land of the yan kees they being half the circuit of the earth apart so that the people of the chief city of the land of china and the people of the city of the broadbrims do stand upon the earth as it were foot to foot so the learned say that they are to each the other antipodes and o ever since that china bill hath come back from said embassy he hath been di rectly opposite tothe welfare of his own city in all things  and when the war of the idlers came upon the land china bill did become their champion for he was a lawyer even from his youth downwardhe hald a tongue to sell   tie malignants      for silver and a right hand to pledge for gold and they brought unto him many shekels thereof and when men went unto him for counsel it was as though one went to inquire of the devil lo therefore he sitteth every day in the chair of the scoffer and taketh his part with the blasphemers and murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers eventhe rebellious and he waggaeth his head proud ly in the city of the broadbrims but  ili feel shall slide in due time  now there was much diversity in the religion of the yan kees even many sects beside those of the broadbrims and the co venanters and one of them was the sect of the surplices and war town was of this sect the same was adignified sect proud as the pharisees and rich as the sadducees of old and of its votaries were many true mren but like the net cast into the sea it had gathered of both good and bad and of these latter are poulk who is called the re probate and hop kins the deceiver and will mur the contumacious and lastof all war town the infamous  and the surplices had it for a rule when three years were gone by to have a     the maklignants great convocation of priests and holy men find in this council lo war town was used to sit as chief scribe even as satan came among the sons of light and whlen pouik was arraigned for altering the very prayers of the sect lo war town was instant withi loud voice to praise him and justify him  now the surplices were not all of one mind in all things for all sects of the yan kees had liberty they all had respect un to the holy book but some loved its gra cious words the most and other some did love most its scarlet binding and war town was of the binding party and it carme to pass when the war of the idlers did arise lo many of the binding sort did couin tenance it and did gibber at the nation in their prayers in the sanctuary and if it fell out so that they did meet an ettiopian by the way they muttered  cursed he ham howheit they did keep on eating bacon and turned not away from pork and became more and more swinish at their devotions  and among these war town was held in much reverence and they behoved to be touched with even the tip of his finger but the men who loved the spirit of the law   the malignants      above its letterabhorred him for tley re membered when he stood among them even as gamaliel and their hearts were grieved to very bitterness for his apostacy and they saw him as he did stumble on his way to the dark mountains with the curse of his country upon him and they turned away from the sight as men turn away from in famy  now the third is rend all he sit teth among the covenanters but he came of the water sect whom some do call divers and he hath disappeared and come up again so often that men think him to be a diver still but his coming away from the sect of his fathers wason this wise  said water sect have a custorn among them of which the memory of man runneth not to the contrary namely that men should give money whenever they do worship pub licly and among their officebearers there be certain men who bear a little bag or a little box unto every person that sitteth in their synagogues now rend all loveth money to take but not to give so he removed from the water sect because of their pertinacity moreover there was much law controversy  if     the malignant amcng the covenanters and they gave tile i awyers much moneytherefore behold no more needs be said   but besides the sects of their religion the yan kees had other divisions and com panies aronog them some for politics and some for policy and some of the politicians were called loco focos and others were cal led as it wore hairy caps and there was strife between them and rend all was of the hairy caps  and among the sects that were neitlher of religion nor politics was a company that was the apron society and it was for po icy only now many of the very salt of the earth did belong to it and some also whom no salt will save and rend all was among them and he was even a chief of them so that he might wear twro aprons as it were f but as man is born unto sorrow so even are all of his works and evil days did arise upon the aprons and they did come to much grief sufficient is it that so it was and the people rose up and cried that none of the apron men should be rulers and one writ ner whose name is joseph a bold   the malign ants  man and a valiant was made governor of a great province of the yan kees and his party did call themselves the untie aprons  and lo the apron men did lie low and the unties did ride overthem and rend all rode along with the unties and some report that he did put his apron into his pocket and in the fullness of time the tumult was abated and the apron men rose up slowly and gat them smaller aprons ant they stood by the nursery doors and as tile rising generation came out from their plain aprons they showed them the spangled ones and tied them on and the young men were pleased and the old ones were delight ed  and rend all came again among the aprons and they received him and made much of him and put upon him as it were three aprons and men thought that it was very odd but some did say that he was a very odd fellow  now rend all waxed gray instead of great and he assumed to be a patriarch and he boasted saying i have shaken the hand of each and every chief ruler of the yan kees from the beginining then one who      the malignants stood by answered to himthen have all said rulers touched pitch and been defiled thereby and the saying was very bitter and rend all looked upon him with anger nevertheless he smote him not for he re membered times past and he boasted no more but he went on his way even as did aaron the burr whose name is accursed  thus did these three mighty in m is chief but all their acts of shame time would fail to telland the end is not yet chapter iit  and there were also other malignants in the city of the broadbrims in the days of the war of the idlers sonis of worthy fathers who brought gray hairs to shame foul birds that defiled their native nest lo of such it is written their names shall rot  now among these was bee dull whose name is charlesj the same is the son of ni cholas the money king now of said mo ney king who shall write the truth itwere much to be desired at a fitting time how beit not now nevertheless the son did join   the malignants      iands with them who smote down the fia tlher and consorted with the betrayers  now it was a rule among all the na tion of the yan kees to send men to answer for them in the great council at the chief city and bee dull was sent with others to answer for the city of the broadbrims and when he came into the great council he did deal falsely by the true cause and humbled himself before the idlers and had no mercy on the poor and the oppressed but wagged hiis tongue against them and the men of the city even of philadelphia were wroth against him and did send another man in his stead to the great council  so he returned back to the city and walketh with other malignants both men and women and thay do call their company unmixed society which meanoth that it is evil only and that continually  moreover this bee dull did play the soldier for a while and gat him clothing of blue and scarlet and brazen garniture most abundant but it was play merely for as job sayeth of the horse he smelleth the battle afar off so was it now only that in bee dulls campaign it was not the horse o    rthe malignants lbut the ridert that smelled the battle and cried alia and miade haste another way  and now he feleth himself to be out of the way of harm and sporteth himself in the heyday of his life sitting upon horse hair instead of horseback and lying upon damask and also upon paper walking in shining sandals with his hair and his ker chief sprinkled with perfume he would fain appear in the odor of sanctity to win votes for the party but though he canvass the ward diligently and woo never so kindly he cannot make it a wooed ward  lo these are parts of his ways but the shame of his position who can understand his lot was cast pleasantly from the begin ning few outside of eden have had fairer view or reach at the tree of knowledge than he but his own right hand hath plucked down infamy so he will have it  and there was joined with him sundry others lad low whose father was chief of the school of the prophets and ky ler the son of cornelius not the centurion  and one of these was a judge and the other one was a counsellor and in the tenm plewhere they both did minister they took off the bandage from the eyes of the effigy   of justice and did bind it on the eyes of the jury and they did thus grope there in the dark  and both the judge and the counsellor were of the party of the loco focos now in this name there is to many a great mys tery especially to the learned who say the words do mean respectively place and fire and they thus are in fear that the party do mean to set every place on fire but this is the interpretation said name is taken from an invention which was named from luci fer after his fall it is a little stick one of whose ends is to be burned the which when struck cunningly doth burst into flame with stench of brimstone and its use is to set other things on fire hear therefore the conclusion of the whole matter the lit tle stick is a match for all mankind young and old and the politician so named is a match for the devil  now ky ler was not only a coun sellor but also a councilman which is tile name of the city elders and there be two companies of said elders and one is called in the law select and the other is called common which denominating answereth well to the fact that said bodies have even      the malignants embraced many very common men and some select scoundrels  and ky ler was of the select com pany why he was selected let no man an swer hastily and in each company part were of the loco focos and part were of the hairy caps and they did separate them selves in their halls of convocation each party gathering upon one side but though they did sit apart they did all lie together and they had no rites nor priestly ceremo nies at their meetings saving and excepting only that at each there was always a great sacrifice of truth  and thus was the custom in their as semblies after much wrangling and false witness each councilman was called for his vote yea or nay but it was a rule that a given number of living men must ihe present in order to make a law now it came to pass on a certain day that a law was called to be voted which ky ler liked not and when the scribe did call his name lo he an swered not making to believe  that he was not there and when he was chidden for said deceitfulness hedid offer to prove his ab sence by his presence then men were used to say of him that if a crow should   the malignants      alight upon his chimney top that he would prove it to be white howheit the crows have hitherto kept aloof from him which may indicate a change in their love of car rion  thus they went on their way among men the judge and the counsellor and old imen who had a knowledge of their fathers even john of the university and cornelius of the marble safctuary did marvel say ing where is the promise unto the seed of the righteous for both of the fathers were men of faith and prayer  then answered to them one who was of the craft of typographers how is this that ye do err not remembering all the word for is it not written that though eli was the high priest yet that his sons were the great est of reprobates and as for the saying that the seed of the righteous shall not go a beg gingdepend on them bor this that there be men alive who will never begwhile they can steal   and the old men were astonished at the doctrine and could not answer it but did lift up their hands and say of a trutl there is nothing new under the sun   so with ky ler and lad low and      the malignants bee dull were joined others of sumptuous living and fine raiment and they were ar rayed like solomon in his glory and their hands were soft and as white as the lilies of the field buttheir hearts were dark as the sepulchre  behold also they did set themselves to get a new governor for the province of penn and they urged the people much for their favorite seeking haply to catch them with guile but the people said in their heart surely in vain is the net spread in the sight of the bird and they did turn northward and eastward and westward and even southwardbut they turned not to wood ward and thus the malignants did labour in vain chapter iv   now besides the malignants that did vaunt themselves against the nation and against its true glory saying as it were evil be thou my good there were others who did harm stealthily even as the thief in the night and one of these is called jorje bee glo rious   the malignants       the same was a cherished child of the city of the broadbrims and when the war did break forth and the old chief captain did fall away because of his infirmities lo bee glorious was lifted into his place and was loaded as it were with honor  and he had thousands yeaanrd tens of thousands of valiant men for his army and kings sons for his lieutenants and armour and chariots without number and money without measure and the love and blessing of his country above all  but all these were in vain for he did loiter and halt ever in the summer he did wait for the coming of rwinter and when the winter was come he did call for summer again and the men did die by the way by hundreds and by thousands even as the leaves of the forest when they do fade ard when at certaintimes the battle was joined and any of his captains did fight valiantly and come near to smite the enemy lo he drew back and did abandon the captainl even as joab did unto uriah thus he did waste hundreds of days and thousands of lives and million of dollars until the heart of tie nation did grow sick of him and they bade him away for they said his hand is      tie malignants with the workers but his heart is with the idlers  howheit when he was dismissed he did ride furiously and travelled farther in one week then he had marched in a year then the malignants did provide for him a palace for his dwelling and he doth live upon the fat of the rand and he holdeth out his hand every month for his pay fromn the people whose cause he betrayed and he eateth meat and drinketh wine with the un fatithful   now the other acts of bee glorious and some things that he did are they not written in his own chronicles which he styleth a i report which consumed three hundred days in the writing thereof and the scrolls of which loadeth as it were an oxcart and which no man can read from the beginning unto the end and live  furthermore the sons of belial do shout around him when he maketh a jour ney even as did the silversmiths of ephesus of old time saying gieat is bee glorious and he shall be our ruler and some of them do urge him to become even his own trum peter and they do furnish him with moutii   the malignants      pieces but lo it doth so fall out that what ever instrument he doth essay to use whe ther horn or bugle or trumpet it becometh in his hand a penny whistle  and in the same path with jorje bee glorious goeth the man of wax now he is named not after the wax of the bee nor yet after the honest wax of the shoemaker but after the wax of wax hall and his christian name is richard  now richard personally hath striking developmentshe may be called an embodi ment ot capillary attraction in speech he is fluent in oratory indescribable in of fice ridiculous in politics loco foco on the highway he twirleth the small staff as if he were born to wield it and all the lads at girard his college do envy his proficiency therein and do hold him in fellow feeling  now the father of richard was of the original broadbrims as men might say a very hebrew of hebrews the leading vir tue of which sect is to be humble and some of them did lead off so actively as to become proud of their humilitybut no names are given the father gathered riches and good fame the son enjoys the one and wastes the other but the religion of richard is not      the malignants definable yet his principal belief is in a fine head of hair  but richard goeth with the party because he hath been going to parties all of his life he knoweth nothing else when he did journey to europe he still went to parties until at one he did dance even with the english queen the precise figure they did cut is not recorded but discreet judges believe it to have been a waltz for his head bath seemed to have been turned ever since that his body did return but he not only goeth with the party but as men say he goeth it blinds and therefore he goeth for woodward  what time the idlers did imminently threaten the city richard felt it due to his name that he should melt and proposed to mollify the invaders by certain dissolving views of himself expressed in the great hall of the independants but happily for others haply for himself the opportunity was post poned and as richard sticketh to the party as is the nature of wax when the party goeth to perdition it is presumable that he will go there likewise of a surety in contemplation of such a fate is it not as it were a mockery to say farewell   i i i travels of the de le telle family travels of the du le telle famly letters from europe by thankfulla buffalo buffalo thb courier company printers  prefa c e my friends after the urgent importunities of the press and the repeated solicitations of book publishers for a volume of the travels of our celebrated family my scruples have been vanquished by the indefatigable bonner who knows so well how to overcome obstacles my repeated refusals to bring these letters before the common mind of a promiscuous people arose from the knowledge that the untraveled publiccannot appreciate with the discernment of con nosieurs the refinement of nations and the specimens of art which we have had the privilege of enjoying to an unusual degree mr bonner having finally appealed to my benevolenceoffered to give the profits ofthis work to some charitable objectthus putting refusal beyond my power i shall clothe this book in the simplest language hoping that my own countrymen and women will be instructed as well as amused the history of our famous family is so familiar to the public  that it requires but a passing notice there are few who do not know how the sale of our sheep farm of forty acres placed us in affluence and made us the welcome guests of crooned heads and the nobility of foreign countries the family in ancient times bore the cognoment of dolittle but upon our first visit to france             preface we were able to prove our french extraction and found that the classic name of du le telle had been corrupted by the vulgar isms of americans into dolittle during our first trip of six weeks we visited all the countries in the known world and with a tractability never equalled some of the members of the family became masters of all the lan guages both dead and living thus enabling us to pass from one country to another receiving the most brilliant ovations and familiar greetings truly our fame had proceeded us after our return to our own country time hung heavy on our hands the climate did not agree with us and wemissed the soci ety and refinement which had been ours while abroad and deter mined to make a second voyage the family consisting of our mother the widow du le telle her two daughtersremarkabella and thankfulla aunt stebbins and caleb jr sailed on the twentieth of october and after a pleasant trip of ten days arrived in london from which place my first letter is dated  letter pfrstlondonour mutual friend chariespage     letterp from the du        e   elles letter   first london vobv   dear friends the next morning after our arrival in this place we received at an early hour our mutual friend mr charles dickens an acquaintance of our former visit he having been informed of our arrival hastened to call upon us and escort us to some places of interest he is a very simple pleasant friend and he has a great love of america and the americans but of course he is vastly more grand in england where everything is so much more mag nificent he insists on our calling him charles because he dotes on familiarity the first thing that attracted my notice as we started on our walk was the transparency of the atmosphere enabling persons to see at great distance and giving a person the idea of perpet ual sunshine london is quite a place it has a great many chim neys and a great many brick also some few streets but mostly alleys regent street looks rather nice and the strand and oxford are sometimes lively but the people think and talk the most of the river tems although i think it looks larger to them at ome than it does to us although small sized boats can navigate it the terns  is the great glory of charles here he says is one of the crowning glories of the world what are other streams to thee limpid lovely l tems glittering on thy bosom flash the watery gems d    letters from europe only with the ripples gaily flash along some poor lifeless feline murdered for its song or some defunct canine proud of the tide he stems swollen with the glory of dying in the tems pure and lovely river let me quench my thirst from thy scented bosom till im fit to burst here was a pause charles having given vent to his over burdened national affection was rather inclined to subside into himself but while he was subsiding we got a chance to take a view of the city from this point here everything bore evidenee of the characteristic fastness of the english we next visited hyde parkit is built mostly of grass and trees the land is i believe owned by mr hyde but if was found to be unsaleable aind so he lets the people ride and walk there at the entrance there is quite a good sized statute that used to be owned by mr wellington and there was another big figure there that they told us was a killer it was erected by the ladies out of guns and shooting irons the english women are a great deal smarter than our countlywomento do such heavy work   i think that mr hyde must like farming pretty well for i see he still keeps his sheep and cows pastured here well i would advise him to hold onto it he may be able to real ize as much from his sheep farm as we did from ours but on we go hurrying on to the tower of london this was the work of william conkrer and his son william r conkrer has put a great many improvements onto itand after a time they hired two splendid workmen thomas becket and bishop ely longchamps to finish it now it has the appearance of having been built a long time a great many criminals have been con fined here and they sometimes felt pretty bad too for the jailer told us that they had many times washed the floors with their tears but the place where william wallace was shut up i was   the du le telle fami y  most interested in he wrote a great deal of fine piano music during his incarceration one of these being le rave no wonder the poor man was raving shut up there i suppose he must have stolen something the building and its horrible sadness so affected us that charles insisted on our going directly to windsor castle as it was near dinner hour and victoria would expect us to dine with her after a charming ride we entered the garden of the castle and found the prince of wales waiting on the stoop he escorted us to his mother and after an affectionate greeting victoria thanked us for the compliment which we had made her in coming to see her and was delighted at the prospect of the information which she could obtain in regard to america from our own lips she asked what we thought of bunker hill monument and we told her that we had always been told that the cemetery where it is was very pretty but as we had never been in florida we must give her the impressions of others instead of our own she asked remarkabella to tell her about niagara falls she told her that it was quite a watering place they had a good tavern a big bridge and a large paper mill and she never heard of the water being dry again she asked if we had ever heard the big organ of boston play miama told her that she never allowed us to look out of the windowswhen they went byfor organ grind ing was considered a very low calling with us victoria expressed herself really charmed with our intelligence and said that it was unusual for americans to be so familiar with their own country and after doing ample justice to the roast beef plum pudding and brown stout we spent some time in the royal apartments exam ining the gobbling tapestry which seemed very much like paint ings victoria then insisted on it that we should all visit her in her summer residence buckskin palace and she wanted mamato sleep with her some night as they were both widows and such good friends the prince seconded the invitation to us and took us into the kitchen to see the preserves that his wife had been making up he is quite proud of his little wife soon after this we took our leave our mutual friend charles wishing to          letters from europe visit the bank of england during banking hours he deposits there the bank of england is a rather pretty building and most of the english put their money there for safe keeping it is very safe there and very little of it ever finds its way out as the met were not in a mood for talking we went opposite to see the exchange and although this is a great visiting place we found ourselves the observed of all observers and the extreme humility of all classes towards us evincing the unbounded admiration of the people for us affected our modesty so much that we felt that we could stay no longer  so on we went to westminister abbey this is the english burying ground but i think it is not select enough there is no distinction between poor and rich high and low poets kings soldiers and all grades are mixed together but there was some wonderful pieces of statuary on the tomb stones although i saw no pictures here by great artists i thought the two always went together over in the poets corner we missed the name of mr lord byron  we always liked his child harry  so much shakspeare also lies here he was a firstclass player and some oldfashioned people read his plays now days we noticed a great many other great folks names but did not see anything of mr waverlys name who wrote so many pretty novels but among the henrys richards charleses ones twos and threes we found something for a little calculation while we stood there trying to enlighten ourselves a hired girl from winsor castle made her appearance with a message from victoria offering us the coronation clair that stood in the abbey but after examining it we concluded that it was so old that it would not pay for bringing home and repairing when we declined taking it she gave us our choice of the jewels deposited in the tower remembering that we had an engagement to take tea with the countess of birmingham who used to teach school in our district at home we hastened back to the tavern knowing that on the morrow we should be whirling away to the land of the scots the dulbtelle famly          letter second edinburgh vov   dear friends on our entrance into edinburgh we were saluted by the calls of the bussman dye gang to the red lion supposing this to be some sort of a show caleb jr thought we had better go and see it a red lion was certainly a new sight and aunt steb bins who had not accompanied us on our first voyage declared that seeing the animals in a country was better than any other part of the show she had always heard tell that folks that went to europe always went to see the elephant by the way we are getting tired of having aunt stebbins in our party for she is so thoroughly american that we are shocked by her vulgarity she would insist that everything she saw arf eat in london was so pesky poor that she wondered englishme could eat so much of it but to return to my story the bman drew up in front of a small house with a painted  on the sign when aunt stebbins exclaimed you dont say you keep your lion in the housethe man seeing her confusion said  ye dinna ken by the sign at the dure that it be the public house for mon and beast my dinner can by the side of the door la sus what do you mean you must be dreadful observin when you seen all my luggage was a bandbox and a portmanteau  gang and tell your mither my mon that heres friends that wad tak a het supper and jumping up he flourished his whip and we entered thebest tavern in edinburgh we soon had a supper of oatmeal porritch and bannocks and it being night we thought we would not go out until morning after sleeping very well for as aunt stebbins said we were clean beat out we enjoyed a breakfast of oatmeal porritch and bannocks and started for edinburgh castle this used to be the old homestead and it is still standing on the land belonging to the scotts there was a pretty large family of them and the boys were always quarreling until the old man         leters from europe scott settled it by taking all his jewelry and putting it in an old chest and locking it up the old man died soon after and his folks forgot about the chest until finally some of the english who had got possession of the old house by means of a mortgage opened the chest and found all the old mans jewelry since then everybody that goes to see the scotts takes a good look at the jewelry but i wonder that they dont have the stones reset for these settings are dreadful oldfashioned as this was all we wanted to see here and there was none of the scott family living there now we thought best to keep on to the palace of holy root it is said that this mr root was a very excellent man and he had a daughter mary who married a mr darnley who was a jealous sort of a customer and he killed a hired man of his who was an italian because he thought that mary liked him pretty well and she taught him evenings to read and write and spell mr darnley was pretty mad about this and so he came in one evening and tackled him and pushed him into her auntys room and finished him they have saved some of the bloodspots and keep them for a show remarkabella says she thinks it is most too bad that all these great deeds should have happened in the old countries because now our american pictorials cant have any bloodandmurder stories to illustrate i think myself it wouldimprove their style somewhat to put something interesting in them mrs darnley had a great many convenient things in her bed room but i dont imagine she was a very good housekeeper for everything looks as if it had never been cared for but she did some very nice worsted work and remarkabelia is going down there some rainy day td take off the patterns she can use mrs darnleys workbasket instead of her own it will be so convenient standing right there here there was a strange party of men entered and we concluded to go down to see where bob burns was buried he was a son of bill burns and was a great flirt and he wrote love verses to a great many girls at the same time but he has got a very pretty tombstone over him and the girl that he finally married had a good picture of him which they put   i q letter secondedinbargthe meeting of the clanspage i    the du le telle famly         on the stone here are some lines of his which have never been published out of regard for his wifes feelings they were written to a girl in america after his marriage oh rusha i wad ye ken my love sae mickle and sae true ye wad gie ivry ither mon a fecht till bobby could see you in leaving this place we were filled with grandeur and inspira tion at the exquisite appearance of the highlands the farms here are the most productive in the world the dwell ings are beyond description and the manners and customs of the people are elegant their dress is a little odd the men folks wear frocks and long stockings and all their clothes are checkered they wear their hair in ringlets the prevailing profession of the country being hairdressing there is no country equal to them in this respect every scotchman understands curling their style of dressing the hair explains the reason why the men wear bonnets but with all their womanish arrangements they are a ferocious set glory ing in the  kilt our landlady knowing the next morning would be our last in edinburgh invited the bart family to breakfast with us air mac donald bart  t pherson bart i  dugald bart   gregor bart accepted the invitation the rest of the family being out of town our meal was a sumptuous onea barn dare chucky oat lmeal porritch and bannocks the company could not understand our haste to leave edinburgh but we explained to them that caleb jr had received a telegraph from egypt urging him to go there right away because mr powers the man we hire to sculp for us has found in the catacomb where he has been digging lately a runaway circassian slave and he wanted caleb jr to come right on and tell him what to do with her he could not work very well with that woman there and as we were paying him fifty          letters from europe cents a day and his board we did not want him to lie idle long caleb jr will probably be gone some three or four days and we intend in the meantime to go to dublin andfrom there te paris being in time to meet him there napoleon is all the time hurrying us up he has written six letters to ma in two days urging us to be in time for the great ball at the two lerries letter third dublin nov   dear friends the first person we saw on our arrival was george francis train he had just come out of jail we knew him well in our own country he used to tend sheep and do the milking for grandfather he worked for his board until he got into a love scrape and the girl he wanted sacked him this made him crazy and he has never recovered from it the people of ireland feel great pity for him and they let him stay wherever night overtakes him when we met him he was hurrying on to get to phoenix park he was going to lie on one of the benches that night we asked him to assist us in finding mr odonohue and this he was pleased to do so on we went up sackvill street until we came to an alley and there standing on the head of a barrel with his shellalah flourishing was the odonollue indade and is that you miss dolittle the top of the morning to yese i was givin an

bring her to us and if possible make her his wife he wished us to hasten our visit in dublin but to be sure and see dublin tricks before leaving and tell him that he was anxious to measure arms with him we therefore decided to see all we could that day and leave for paris on the morrow we visited trinity school house and the irish bank this is well patronized by everybody for there is scarcely an irishman but what owns his mansion it is a very flourishing country and the people love those in authority over them with devotion their rulers are very just and kind people where is the blarney

blarney stone         leers from europe  letter fourth paris noov   dear friends when we entered the depot we were met by napoleon and all his court the city was alive with excitement the bells were ringing the cannons firing and confusion was general we intended going to the grand hotel but napoleon insisted that we should put up with him he said eugenie was expecting us and she had put the spare room all in order the house was pretty well occupied just now with some of their cousins that had come in from the country to go to the ball but he should give us the best places in the house if he and eugenie had to sleep up stairs when we arrived at the palace eugenie stood at the hall door waiting with open arms ishe looked very pretty and clean she had on a white lace dress with spangles on it and white satin slippers she kissed ma rapturously and was then introduced by ma to her distinguished sister madame de stebbins we were ushered into the best parlor and after taking off our things eugenie took us into the dining room and told us that if we wanted to wash up a little before dinner we would find soap water and towels in the other corner of the room we were glad of the chance and i washed my hands vigorously not only because they were dirty but because i had on a ring with seven big diamonds in it that i bought of a pedlar for five dollars i wanted this to shine pretty well because i thought it was larger than genios  pretty soon napoleon came in and we all sit down to dinner we enjoyed our meal immensely our host being very agreeable he objected to our calling him napoleon it was so formal he would esteem it a great favor if we would say nap it was more friendly after dinner we strolled through the apartments noticing the new improvements the whole house had been fieshy painted and whitewashed the day before our visit we the du le telle famly         spent the rest of the day alone the remainder of the company being by themselves when evening came nap wished us to sing for him he said that the french were not a musical people and he had not heard any fine music since we were there before would we please favor him with that national air polly hopkins at ten oclock we concluded to retire and we were shown to our rooms ma and aunt stebbins slept in the spare room and remarkabella and i occupied a cot bed in the throne hall the room was fixed up very pretty a very nice lamp was hung in the middle of the room and gobbling tapestry around it we slept very well indeed considering the strange place and the noise of the rats we arose at six and after dressing we met the family in the hall of the council this room is good size is hung in gobbling and has some good crockery vases in it the chimney piece was carved by johny after exchanging the daily courtesies we all went into the kitchen to wash this is the style with all the first families in europe and especially amongst the royalty while in the kitchen aunt stebbins made a discovery she saw one of the girls skinning some kind of animals and she asked what they were they told her squirrels for soup but she said they were the funniest looking squirrels that she ever saw their tails were long and just like a file she did not believe them creturs ever climbed a tree during breakfast the conversation turned upon america nap thought it the only perfect government in the world he said it was his experience that hired help would always do better for you if you let them do as they liked he never believed in bossing much give them full license and masters and servants were a great deal happier he said he had heard that andy had a good deal of trouble with his hired men but he thought if he would give them a little more freedom and let them express their minds just as they wanted to that they would know their places and keep them better letters from europe tie asked us if victoria gave us anything when we were in england we told him that she gave us our choice of the crown jewels of scotland and offered us the coronation chair he said  that was just like her so parsimonious he guessed she had a sort of a mean feeling towards us on andys account but he should not wonder if that canal boat alabama business stuck in her crop and if it was him he would not pay her another cent on that but he would not have anything to say about it it was none of his business and he despised meddling so much that for that reason he declined having anything to say about the mexican affairs  he was afraid that andy might feel a little putchy towards him because he would not speak a good word about that mexican farm but he thought that it might look a little like his wanting it himself and he had already more farm than he could well cultivate he asked us next to tell him how our countrymen enjoyed themselves and spent their time remarkabella told him that our friends at home were rather  verdant and unsophisticated in such matters that balls operas and concerts and theatres were things that the americans knew i nothing about  they had paring bees husking bees house warm ings and general trainings and in chicago and new york they sometimes have cock fights americans are a very rough people and their style of enjoyment is equal to their appreciation ah indeed said nap one would suppose them to be the most finished people in the world judging from your illustrious family we   have become accomplished by means of our travels and associations with the learned and royal of the old countries said my sister it was most fortunate for us that aunt stebbins did not under stand french for she has a bad habit of interrupting conversation when it concerns her own country people whom she thinks are the most remarkable people in the world breakfast being ended we separated to prepare for the great ball of the evening throughout the day the brooms and dust ers were flying and before night the house was in perfect order   the du le telle famly         eugenie asked mas advice about serving the teatable she finally concluded to pass the tea around and our dresses for the evening became the subject of attention for the rest of the day the ball opened at six oclock by nap leading in madame du le telle followed by eugenie and aunt stebbins and remark abella and myself mamma in sealskin dress with embroidered flounce eugenie in white bobinet lace robes with muskrat panier aunt stebbins in tarletanred white and bluealways retaining her national colors and selecting cotton goods that will be sure to wash remarkabellathe belle of the eveningin mauve chintz and blue and gold swansdown  and my humble self in gro de rnap in honor of our host quantities of admirers thronged about us eager for the oppor tunity of dancing with such celebrities lord s remained near my sister the whole evening urging his suit upon her in the most importunate manner it is true that lie is a married man already but that does not signify in france divorces are very easily obtained whether she reciprocated or not remains to be seen in the future the gay ball closed at eleven oclock and we dreamed until the morning of counts and kings and crowns but with the morning came the information that caleb jr and his fiance would arrive the next day fiancy what a pretty name and how did nap know what her name was we were of course crazy to see this wonderful prin cess the next question was how to receive her at last we decided that dear nappy should go to the cars and we should all assemble in the senate hall in full dress and be seated in order so that on her arrival she might not be chilled by our formality that subject being disposed of we concluded to take a stroll through the garden and see something of the surrounding houses as we were leaving the house by way of the pavillion of flore we observed some large crockery vases and speaking of their being rather pretty nap said you must not return to your own country without visiting some of the potteries of europe  is        lerierts from europe aunt stebbins understanding this in part said oh yes the will just suit me weve lived on soup so long that i am starvir for a good mess of pot victuals i was wondering the other daj if there want nobody in the country who could get up a biled dir ner i dont care a fig for french cookin and i shall be gla when we git there nap laughed delightfully and talked of aunt being interestin and eccentric but i think if shet belonged to any other famili than the du le telles her eccentricity would be called ignorance nap has a very pretty flower garden and their house is in a vert good neighborhood and i think they must be quite sociable tfo they have built on purpose a place of carousal and a place c concord very near is the house of the louvres they have very good museum in it and possibly barnum might buy it vert low to add to his collection a little beyond this is the hous that louis phillips used to live in for some reason the neigh bors did not get along very well with him and so they wen there one day and mobbed and destroyed the house in the garden i saw a statue of ulysses but i do not think i looks much like him i guess the person that scalped it neve had seen him i might detail very minutely the trees and grass but it is mj purpose to speak only of things which it has not been the privi lege of other tourists to view there is little to interest in fact in the city of paris the population is so small that it will nol warrant any great outlay of expense and yet the place is really more thriving than any other european city france is doing a large business in importing and their exports are principally french cooks this will in time enrich them beyond estimate the people of paris have considerable manners but no taste it is a great pity that eugenie should be so untasty for the folks pattern after her quite a good deal our family has been of great benefit to her in selecting becoming habits and in fact almost all the articles of her present wardrobe were dictated by some member of our family her chignon was a present from the        letter fourthparcaleb jr and guide on their way to radenpage xg   tiie du le telle famly         king of ethiopia by our solicitation but why am i writing of fashions and follies they are masculine and unwomanly and we have at present enough on our minds to contemplate in the meet ing with fiancy she who is to be so intimately associated with us in our future morningthe hour has passed and the greeting is over we have found fiancy quite interesting nap is really infatuated i think eugenie feels his neglect but she says but little of course dear nappy insists that we must have the wedding in rome and that the pope must marry them he is willing to accompany us there and give the bride away if caleb jr will pay his expenses of course this will be the most distinga and by a little financier ing we can accomplish its ma advises caleb jr to go to badenbadenin advance of usand replenish his purse and then to meet us at rome on the eighteenth we will wear the same dresses which we wore at the grand ball they are not known in rome and their elegance will make them attractive it will be more economical too which is quite an object the bride must be dressed elaborately of course and we will borrow eugenies chignon for her caleb jr must wear his elegant blue coat and we will rub up the but tons a little it seems nappie is somewhat of a hurry to get to rome  he has business of importance with the pope he is in no hurry to get rid of us of course and thinks it would be raore agreeable for us all to go together i think we shall start tomor row i shall not write again until we reach rome p sthis letter being from france i wish you to remember that all of our conversation while there was in french and i should have written in that tongue if i had not always been opposed to the mixing of languages in books i have ventured  it in english thinking that it may possibly be understood but if it is not i shall writehenceforth in frenchentirely         lwitas from europe letter fifth rome ov   dear friends when we got to the vatican we found that the pope had gon out to make some calls we therefore had some chance to loot about us the house is built with wings to it and the pope sleeps in the right wing here we found a great many interesting pictires a man who was waiting on us told us that he was glad that we came that day for the pope was feeling pretty well and some times his health did not permit of his seeing visitors we spen an hour very pleasantly before the popes arrival and were sur prised when a very pleasant face looked in upon us and a pleasant voice said thank you ladies for this unexpected but agreeable meeting you do me honor napoleon in bringing me the society of ladies you are thrice welcome to the house of pio neno  nap then explained that the party had come all the way from paris for the purpose of having the wedding ceremony performed by him and who is the bride to be he asked the fair fiancy the crown princess of the king of circassia mama answered only too happy said pio remain with me until tomor row and i will perform the service at st peters at eight oclock the following morning a wagon drawn by two roman oxen made its appearance at the door to convey the bridal party to st peters church when it became known that the pope would perform a wedding service at the church all rome turned outto witness it it was a gay scene and one never to be forgotten in the annals of roman history artists were there by scores to paint us and for weeks after paintings and prints were sold about the streets illustrating the famous wedding      d   mtkll fifthromleo str peters churchwhere the sledding eeremony was per formedpage  letter    fifthromethe bride at her toiletpage     the du le telle famly         when the services were concliuded and we were about to leave this most beautiful church caleb jr took out his wallet to pay the pope he had intended to give him fifty cents but mama whispered that he had better make it a dollar for he had done it up quite nice we were glad to have caleb jr do the liberal thing although at home you can get married by a justice of the peace for twenty five cents but i liked that service better because you get more for your money and it is more popular in foreign countries we purchased of a celebrated painter here a picture of the wedding which we shall carry with us when we return to america the picture is in such demand here that we paid for it the fabu lous sum of one scudo tomorrow we bid good bye to nap who returns with dear eugenie to paris and we shall remain here for a day or so to make collections from the works of art and to improve our style of music somewhat fiancy is wonderfully gifted in voice verdi considers her superior to any singer in rome he thinks that she can perfect herself in the italian language in a couple of days and will be fitted for any stage last evening we heard the most finished of verdis scholars perform she had been singing for some time before i noticed her and finally hearing what i supposed was a scream and hastening to the window i saw madame torleni accompanying a hand organ verdi is justly proud of her i asked him once why he did not send her to america her fortune would be made at once if she were there  i know that he replied and i have six others to go with her i am at present confining my attention to training and exporting organ girls they most all of them secure a fine posi tion as soon as they reach america but i must tell you right here of a note which arrived today from leopold insisting on our spending some time with him we shall be obliged to decline this invitation as i feel that i cannot deny myself the pleasure of climbing the alps and we cannot accomplish both          letters from europe oh italia land of the sunny skies chuck full of classic lore rich for thy gems and arts would fill a great big store could we forever rest on thy pure snowy breast rain hail nor thunder pest could drive us from the nest there is something about this country that is very inspiring it is here that the muse delights to make it her home every new object of interest fills me with grandeur but these rapsodies unfit me for the sober realities of life and i must chop right off and proceed to business we shall start for the alps in the morning stopping at genoa to get some velvet i will give an account of our ascent of the mountain in my next letter    sixth berlin vfov   dear friends we started at sunrise to make the ascent of the alps and when it was suggested that we should ride remarkabella and i objected so the rest of the party concluded to ride and we to walk id rather walk ten thousand times than ride upon a donkey and maybe if im cast away ill meet with some poor monkey remarkabella was sure that they had monks there because they always had them on very high mountains after a perilous ascent and many hairbreadth escapes we reached the summit of mont blanc here under the influence of the wildest emotion i wrte these lines which i send to you because they are considered superior to colebridges   e     letter sixthberlinpreparing to climb the alpspage  k g          i   the du le telle   famly         high upon the tops im standing oh thou mighty lofty alp i with the wind and snows around thee one might almost freeze their scalp i have climbed thy lofty summit up thy sides ive found my way but thy head is cold and stormy i dont think id care to stay ive no doubt the lightening flashes wiggle round thy hoary head and id rather youd excuse me cause i have no feather bed and perhaps the white capped cloudlets have their fits of kissing you but ive no umbrella with me and maybe i id get wet through so ill leave thee mighty mountain leave thee in thy glorious pride and maybe when next i view thee i will think it best to ride after we descended the mountain we stopped at a swiss house long enough to inquire for the veil of chamouni and to take a look at the shammy the woman of the hut was gone out and so we could not get a look at the veil entering our velocipede we started for berlin which we reached after a two hours ride i will state here that we have adopted this mode of conveyance because we find it takes us over the ground with more speed and indeed you will see by the dates that our journey could not have been accomplished in the same time in any other way here we are in beautiful berlin i am sorry that america has never offered any inducements to the german people to emigrate to our country they are such a funloving people that they would teach us how to enjoy ourselves         lelters from europe of course never having seen any germans you cannot appre ciate what i say of them but tley are very intelligent and boast of their literature we are staying at present with mr bismarck and i saw in his library this morning two valuable works by their great authors goethe and schiller the fair sausage vender of saragossa and the red robber of the rhine mountains they are very readable and a great acquisition to any library the language of the people is very smooth and flowing and easily learned at the first outset you encounter what are termed jawbreak ers and after you are well through with the operation there will be no further trouble having had our jaws broken on our first visit to this country we were of course under no inconvenience at all the next morning after our arrival mr bismarck was cutting up some meat and of course called it by its german name fleisch asking aunt stebbins if she would have some she looked up with holy horror be these the folks that the missionaries tell about that eat each other up be these people cannibals dear me i thought it was bad enough to eat frogs and all sorts of things as the french folks do but it is a dreadful sight worse to eat human beings an explanation soon satisfied her that her life was not in dan ger and that she could eat without affecting her conscience any mr bismarck is worthy of his fame we were very hospitably received and entertained we had the great german delicacy sourkrout as often as we could wish it and the softest of feather beds under us and feather bags over us i think this must be very comfortable in warm weather how our own beds sink into insignificance beside these of the germans when visiting the thiergarten we pass through the brandy burg gate on the top of this gate is a brown cart drawn by brown horses i believe they run away once and followed napoleon to paris but they got them back and they have not stirred since   km i l letter sevenithvenicethe czar taking leave of his wife to take ma out on his handsledpage  if  i   the du le telle famly         the thiergarten is a great place for visiting i was surprised to see so many beer rooms near it as that is a beverage that is little known in germany and the people are not fond of it i saw in this place a new kind of geese which are all feathers and can be picked six times a year i suppose that raising geese forms quite a prominent part of womans work there for i know that the women are delicate and not used to hard labor but i must hurry on to my description of pottsdam mr bis marck desiring that we should visit the house of the great fred erick fred was considerable of a chap or he made the folks think that he was he was a pretty good house builder and made quite a business of training dogs he used to fiddle some times besides although he was a jackatalltrades he must have died pretty poor for his body was lying in a plain lead cof fin and never has been buried his remains are in one of the pottsdam churches although the house where he lived was at san souci fred was very fond of adventures and he had a great reputa tion as a fighter and for seven years he followed that profession almost entirely there was a large barn back of the house and we gave it a glance as we left we spent last evening at a literary gathering and refreshed ourselves with lager and bretzels and when we crawled into our feathered nest we felt sure that mrs bismarck was in the goose business pretty extensively         lbrtees from europe letter seventh venice jbvv   dear friends since writing my letter from germany we have visitedby urgent invitation of the czarst petersburg and on our return to italy we took greece in our way i shall give you a short account of what we saw in these places before closing my last letter from europe st petersburg is quite a growing village they have a very large meeting house and several other big buildings the popu lation are very united and there is no distinction or cast amongst themone man is just as good as another we went in one day to see the czar and his court in session and found that their manner of holding court was different from any other nation they were living persons lying in state it is generally very good sleighing there and the czar drew mama around to see the statute of peter the great on his hand sled the rest of us walking behind as near as i can describe this statute of pete it is a very big man on a very big horse on a very big stone and a snake under the horses feet it is all brown and i suppose it is the efect of the weather they have but very few shows there and indeed i have not seen a circus since we left america they have not any very good looking jewelry there and the czar picked out the best diamond which he owned and it was presented in court to mama the czar making the speech and ma responding mama sitting and the czar kneeling it was a beautiful tableau greecewe are more familiar with this spot than with almost any other the people of greece are very honorable and will rank among the greatest tradespeople in the world they deal principally in hogs hair oil butter salves candles perfumery grecian bends and

immensely they are very princely in their way of living and of course we feel perfectly at home mr dodge has been building some very nice yachts and he takes us out sailing very often particularly eemarkabella he seems very much smitten with her charms as indeed who is not i have often been asked if she did not take daily baths in the fountain of perpetual youth i cannot answer certainly in regard to this but if she does it is on the sly i shall not attempt a description of venice until i have con cluded my visit and then i can write more interestingly when you hear from us again we

snubbed i   last year as every body will recollect new england was visited with a terrible snow storm which not only suspended travel for the time being but put an embargo upon business in general railroad trains were snowed up at outoftheway sta tions and travelers with private conveyances were detained for days at lonely farmhouses business called me across the northern part of connecticut and as the public conveyances could not be made to subserve my convenience i was traveling with my own horse and sleigh the storm overtook me while on the road between windsor and putnam i awoke in the morn ing to learn that it had not only been snowing for several hours but that the light feathery flakes still filled the air while a fierce wind from the southeast was fast driving the volatile element here and there into huge drifts having but little fear for the results of a new eng land snow however i determined to press on hoping to reach my destina tion by dark at all events with each additional mile the snow became deeper and more drifted  but i had a good horse and resolved not to halt until i was obliged to early in the afternoon i overtook a lone pedestrian slowly   plodding along the almost forsaken highway i stopped and offered him a seat in my sleigh he gladly ac cepted it stating that he had en gaged a livery team to convey him to putnam but becoming discouraged after going a few miles the driver had set him down in the road and re traced his steps the stranger was trying to reach the town on foot al though greatly fatigued when within about ten miles of my destination the drifts became so formidable that i could urge my wearied beast no farther night was coming on apace and i re marked to my companion that we must get out and lead the creature to the next dwelling in hopes of secur ing shelter until morning fortunate ly a glance down the highway revealed the outline of what i took to be a farmhouse near the  roadside jumping from the sleigh we man aged to urge the horse to the gate and up the short sidelane towards the house as we neared the dwelling how ever i discovered in its surroundings the appearance of wealth if not aris tocracy and making a feint to turn my horse about i involuntarily ex claimed there is too great a show of worldliness here to warrant hospitali ty to such as we are my friend id rather brave the snowdrifts again than seek it before my companion could reply the wide sidedoor was thrown open and a welldressed man of forty made his appearance he bade us good evening iin a cheery tone anticipated our misfortunes by a considerate reference to the unforseen contingen cies of so rare a storm condoled with us over the annoyance of being hin dered in our journey and begged us to accept the hospitality of his home until the weather should permit us to travel we thanked him and gladly ac cepted his invitation i gave up my horse to a boy and we followed our host into the hall after removing our overcoats and brushing the snow  from our boots we were led into the e warm wellfurnished parlor lights were ordered and soon i brought in  my attention was drawn i to my traveling companion who all  at once seemed rather ill at ease he  fixed his eyes firmly upon our host t for a moment then quickly dropping t them  to the floor a shadow passed v over his face          a what may i   call your name the host asked him taking a seat be v side us evidently with the intention st of entering into conversation  lie answered in a  low tone buti ha understood him to say  benton t and yours to me     le thomas i  replied    hi thank you both my name is wilkinson it is well to know names cl even if we remain strangers still cc besides i  shall want to introduce you is to my family when the host pronounced  his pe name benton gave another quick ni nervous look and  he remained in quiet while mr wilkinson and i pro ai ceeded to compare notes     an our host said that he was born in the western new york where he also married but had removed to his pres do   id ent home here he engaged in manu lin facturing and had been very success ful my manifesting as he did such confi nn dencein us and such candor in refg de erence to his own affairs i made d known my business to him advan ed ces so frank on his part proved that lte he was to be regarded as a friend n rather than a stranger even the th seemingly taciturn benton was drawn n out and was soon conversing with us mr wilkinson with all the familiarity ie of an  old acquaintance indeed to long before supper was announced i was ready to pronounce him one of c the most genial men i had ever met y and notwithstanding the fact that i r had been thrown upon his hospitality g by the force of circumstances i felt n as much at home as if we had been e schoolmates i ere long mrs wilkinson came in n she was rather above the medium a height she possessed a calm blue  eye and welltcut features but she d was lovely rather than beautiful by t the easy grace of her manners and  the cordial seconding of her husbands i welcome i saw that she was as much a lady as he was a gentleman just as tea was announced a ser vant entered saying there was a stranger at the door who wished to see the gentleman of the house we had stepped out into the hall to pass to the supperroom when the host left us standing begging us to excuse him for a moment goodevening   said a figure closely wrapt in a fur cap and over coat  can you tell me how far it is to a public house it is a good two miles sir im possible for you to reach there to night the snow is drifted terribly in that direction will you walk in and mr wilkinson  stepped aside and waved his hand invitingly toward the light and warmth withinl   thank you but i have a horse down here in the road he can wal   low through i guess replied the stranger pulling his coat closer y around him and with a bow turning  to go away the going sir is worse for t beast than for man and i advise you to proceed no farther tonight in  deed i should not feel easy to have you go away from my door under the circumstances there are two trav i elers here already who have just ac i cepted quarters for the night and i if you come in you anrd they may l sympathize with and console each other in your kindred misfortunes  and the host turned toward benton and myself and gave utterance to a complacent laugh  thank youthank you sir your welcome is not to be slighted i will lead up my horse and then ac cept a corner in your dwelling   and the traveler was about to descend the steps stop sir my man  will take care of vour horse walk in the stranger wasalmost draggedi into the hall by the sanguine ilost who assisted him in removing his outside coat and overshoes he was then led to the bllazing fire in the parlor in a moment he declared himself perfectly comnfortable now for supper said the host i find myself in connecticut to day for the first time in my life sir added the stranger touching mr wilkinson significantly upon the shoulder and if this is a sample of the hospitality that grows out of vour bluelaws and steadyhabits  shall hereafter regard the state as a paradise for snowedup benighted travelers a laugh all round was the only re sponse this sally called forth my fellowtravelers and myself were now seated with the family two small children besides the par ents at the bountifullyspread supper table where we were at once made to feel perfectly at home   the newcomer proved to be a young lawyerfrom the west and like myself was only a few miles from his destination his name he told us was gates supper over our host led us into  his library and placing cigars before us said now gentlemen i wish you to make  yourselves at home let neither of you entertain the slighteast feeling of enmbarrassment because you are tonight the guest of a stranger against your will perhaps id bet ter say for it many lead you indirect ly to becomne more reconciled to your fate that my two boys started this nmorning to return to their scllool at hartford but at noon i received a tel grlnam from them stating that the trlain was blocked up at plainfield and thley would probably have to re maifn at the station all night an agent of mine left hlere last night on imnportant business in providence butthis afternoon i was notified by tclgraph tihat lie is quarterd in a private family a t quidnic unable to lproceed falrther alhother agent also on pressing business is blocked up at worcester  and  verily believe that not a single railroad train in this part of new england has gone its full route today i you offer these facts i presume as evidence of your faith in the truth of the ld adae   misery loves com pany  said gates with a smile yes yes gayly returned mr  wilkinsonl and for fear that may not be effectual in setting you wholly  at ease i laml disposed tooffer a lit tle philosophy some men seem to be snowbound all their lives no sooner do they embark upon an en terprise than something turns up to f frustrate their plans however hope r ful and enegetic they may be they  never attain success  r   that is so continued gates e  there is a man in our section who never met with a real success how ever insignificant dependent upon his own efforts in his life more than that nobody ever shows him any respect there is something in his very mien that repels all venera tion and every body takes the liberty to snub him when opportunity occurs although he is rkh his property was all inherited and can buy out half a dozen of his wealthiest neigh bors theres not a laborer in the township who ever speaks of or to him in any other than a tone of con ternmpt  his history must be remarkable let us hear it said our host certainly the narrative proba bly will help us to forget our anxieties and serve to while away this long winter evening i ventured to say gates lighted a fresh cigar and commenced  the story i am about to tell is a kind of barroom and countrygrocery tradition as the principal events oc curred some twenty years since  i have never seen any of the parties excepting the hero although i  be lieve they are all still living as well as the hero and his wife i am in debted to a brother lawyer living in the immediate vicinity for the narra tive hugh   winterblossom of cross c ville moved into blanktown  years s ago bought an  estateand settled x down to enjoy  life he possessed a t large property inherited from his e father but he never engaged in any i stated business from first to last his d neighbors frequently said he  knew hi only enough to cling to what wealth g lie owned and the more spiteful of te them declared he was only a few re si moves from anatural fool marry e ing a  woman almost as weakminded cl as himself supposing  her to be so wealthy he was sorely disappointed in to learn after the knot was tied that he had made a   sad mistakeshe af hadnt a  dollar        c   on  old winterblossom as he is gener re ally called is a singular specimen of im humanity both physically and men in tally physically he  might be ra classed with the genus  stubby   for rty he is short and thickset in the whole rs and in all his parts his head is ty large but short and deficient in brain mut with a short stout body and limbs h of like proportions one can not help he thinking that nature was arrested to in her work while moulding him and n failed to draw and finish his franme so elaborately as she first designed e his shaggy brows covered with long gray hair project over and shadow a his stern stonylooking eyes his s nose is large and broad at the base ig with wide nostrils his long upper y lip bulges out and hangs over the id lower one giving his large mouth any thing but a prepossessing ap pearance and his square halfsha a ven chin is short maintaining its uni y formity with his other features i with such rugged lineaments ai phy i siognomist undoubtedly would have s given him a character of the most in  domitable determination and  fixed  l ness of purpose but in reality he is  an ignorant vacillating pusillani n mous rider of hobbiesa  victim of  the most errant whims having no respect for the rights and feeling of  others every body by common con s sent seems to regard him as a kind of i traveling absaloms pillar at which ithey may unhesitatingly throw the stones of their contempt for all that is odious in human propensities in deed nature seems to have violated her usual rules in his formation she generally stamps a persons charac ter on his exterior but winterblos soms destiny was put in lieu thereof he was snubbed by nature and in consequence was  doomed to  be snubbed by all with whom he came in contact old winterblossoms first exploit after he settled in blanktown was a cheese speculation a farmer be   came indebted to him for a small m amount and being short of cash of w fered to turn over to the old man a hi lot of cheeseabout three hundred at pounds rather than run any risk s by waiting winterblossom took the d cheese but it was valueless unless h he could get it to market the nearest d one being buffalotwenty  miles h away one morning his neighbor s james wilson was passing on his way to the city with a small lot of d butter hailing him hugh asked what he would charge to carry three r hundred pounds of cheese too buffalo how many pouns did you say i returned wilson  three hundred  waal abouta cent a poun will  be the fair thing i guess deliberated the farmer dallying with his whip  across the back of his wellfed horse too much that ll mount to three dollars and youre going right there thats so but that shouldnt make no difference you couldnt git sheriff pullet to hang you for any thin less n his reglar fee even ef he used the same gallers on which he was gointo hang me at the same time an yeou couldnt hire a man to go a purpose to carr that cheese for twice that mount howsomever neigh bor winterblossom ill tell yeou what ill do ill carr them cheese on the follerin terms to wit as the lawyers say yeou pay me one mill for the fust mile two mills for the secon four mills for the third an so on doublin on each mile up to twenty yaas ill do that returned winterblossom without the least hes itation chuckling in his sleeve at the prospect of  shavingwilson and getting his cheese to market for a very trifling sum it is very obvious from this tran saction that winterblossom knew but little of the rudiments even of mathematics to say nothing of geo   metrical progression his accounts were always submitted to a niece of his living with him and at this time attending the district school so as she arose from the dinnertable that day he stated the cheese bargain to her and asked how much would be due wilson on his return taking her slate she in a few minutes an swered one  thousand and  fortyeight dollars fiftyseven and a half cents the dogs must have made a mistake exclaimed winterblossom no uncle  that is impossible for it is a very simple problem look here and ill show you how it is done  thunder and mars dont care i how it is done will be jest like i wilson to stick out for the thousand e odd dollars but ive one vantage  over himthar want no witnesses o to the bargin t  when  this story  leaked out t cheese  was on every bodlys tongue t and for months afterwards it rang in t old hughs ears continually   winterblossoms nearest neighbor e is daniel thornton born in the is town he has grown up into an honest  upright citizen and enjoys the re r spectand confidence of every person e in the county a practical farmer a i thorough mechanic and capable of u turning his hand to almost any ordi se nary persuit hi opinion is regarded ie as conclusive in all matters of local ill economy and utility but he is much ie given to recreation no man in the so neighborhood can beat him at hunt to ing fishing trapping wild pigeons and gathering wild honey ed  having no business to occupy his s hands and being of a disposition he that demanded some hobby on which id to air his semistagnant ideas old a winterblossom began to ape thorn ton in his various recreative pursuits xn every hoby praised the skill and ac w complishments of daniel and to be of able to outvie him seemed to be the eo height of hughs ambition during the first spring of his resi dence in  blanktown he   closelj watched daniels manoeuvres for trapping pigeons declaring repeated ly that he could catch birds as well as thornton winterblossom passed the whole summer in boring his neighbor about how it was done and in getting his nets ready at length when spring and the pigeons came again he prepared for extensive operations one day the air was filled with birds thornton quietly adjusted his apparatus while his rival took up his quarters in the next field having every advantage of situation a large flock was toled down by winterblossoms dicoys he sprang his traps and captured half a dozen birds daniel then called the flock in his direction and in a very few minutes secured over four thousand birds hugh was mad dened with chagrin and after re peated efforts he gage up in despair spitefully declared that dan thorn ton had bewitched all the pigeons in the county for months afterwards this ex ploit of winterblossoms was taunt ingly thrown into his face by man  woman and child it wa s no uncom mon thing fora ragged laborer to stop him in the road and crack a  joke at the expense of some of the  old mans foibles and it was the a boast of many a dirtyfaced urchin s that from the retreat of some stone c wall or hedge he had asked old r winterposey how the pigeon bisness r was during the summer thornton fre  quently interspersed his seasons of to toil in field and workshop for he h was a wheelwright as well as farmer with adays sport along the trout se brook witlh hook and line or through f the forest with rifle and he al at ways met with good   successnot do through luck as his still persistent es imitator affirmed but because he was hi a careful studentof the habits of the ar   si game he sought he always returned ly with a wellfilled bag while his sple or netic rivals oftrepeated tramps only d resulted in weariness and disappoint as ment he  after the autumn harvests thorn or ton commenced operating for wild ig honey his manner of procedure was that usually pursued by beehun le ters he would bait a fugitive bee r with honey note the line he took in le returning to his hive and then fol n low him up one day after recon e noitring for a few hours he succeeded e in finding five nests from which on f the following day he took upwards of d a hundred and fifty pounds of honey when   winterblossom  heard of i this his eyes opened with astonish i ment and he determined to watch  horntons movements and learn the rknack of hunting bees it was daniels custom to devote  his leisure hours to beehunting and when he   had found a number of nests take a day for felling the trees and securing the spoils it is a rule amonghunters when a  beetree is identified for the finder to score it with his initials and this mark is considered a  sacred title to the honey by all honest men finding a nest one day on his own land but provokingly near wii  terblossoms line daniel hesitated about marking it it was in plain sight of his neighbors chamber win dows and he feared that the old sin ner was not only watching his move ments but that he would take the first opportunity to pilfer the honey however thornton finally decided to mark it and keep a keen eye on his neighbors manaeuvres having no children winterblos som had adopted a niece already re ferred to whose parents were poor and living in a distant town his design was to make her his sole heir ess providing she never disregarded his wishes but unknown to him an intimacy had existed between the   niece and a young man living near her former home when the fact eventually came to her uncles knowledge he declared he would put a stop to their intercourse at the same time forbidding her ever to al low the youth to visit her however he was growing up into a promising young man and janette could not well forget her first love so a clan destine correspondence was main tained by them each hoping that the old man would consent to their union but they were doomed to disap pointment in that respect as old winterblossom dabbled in every thing it is not strange that he should try his clumsy hand atmatchmaking for a long time he had had lhis eye upon a young man in the town where lie formerly resided whom he de signed janette should marry and when she had reached a suitable age julius bently was invited by hugh to make him a visit for the purpose of becoming acqunainted with his niece the young man was wealthy and this fact fully satisfied old win terblossom although there was nothing objectionable in his appear ance or character the girl could re gard him only with common polite ess and courtesy because her love was given to another just at this moment mrs wilkin son entered the library for a book but the young lawyer was so wrapped up with his story that he did not no tice what i could not help remark ing that she was confused to a greater degree than could have been occa sioned by the mere conviction that she was causing a momentary inter ruption of the narrative nor did he see the peculiar glances she and her husband exchanged bentons con duct too arrested my attention for he had partly turned his back upon gates and seemed intent on reading the titles of the volumes on the shelves    near him and so the lawyer went on with his story j it was about thiis time while win terblossom was operating flor honey that julius bently visitcd lllanktown the old man  received him  with marked attention and entertained him like a lord hugh proved to be a very exact ing host he compelled hisivest to accommpany him on all his excursions and made him a confidant in all the little hobbies and whims of his dwar fish brailn of course  winterblos soms society and confidences must have been in the main detestable to a younyg man of juliuss make but it was evident tht lie liked the appear anceof janette and endleavored to tolerate her uncle for the tinle being in hopes of vinning  her in the end for at least twenty  times a day the old curmudlgen would slap his guest on the shoulder and withl a conceited chuckle exclaim  yaas yaas julius  shes a little offish now cause shes young but jest keep up a good heart my boy and youll come out all right bynby ill warrant that as thornton feared winterblos som was not long in seeking oult his last beetree regarding the half decayed oak with covetous eyes for a moment   or two hugh remarked to bentley who had accompanied him pretty  close to my line julils not much chance for old thornton to make a fihss if i chop it down but guess well take it some day when hes away from om such tan oppornitity occurred that very afternoon daniel passed on his way to mnill with several secks of grain to  ascertain how  long  he probably would be gone old itugh resorted to a  little stratergy ice hailed his neighbor nwith  hallo thornton take a   grist for me certainly daniel returned reining up spect to wait for your grists yes for were nearly out of both flour and meal  wall do as you please bout waiting for mine he added as the hired man threw a couple of sacks into the farmers wagon john can go for it tomorrow if you dont bring it reaching the mill dniel found the stones all taken up and the mil ler and his assistants engaged in pick ing them so he left his load and re turned immediately as he neared the house he discovered a heavy smoke in the direction of his timber thinking all was not right he stopped his horse and cut across lots in a great hurry winterblossom and his hired man t were engaged in burning a clearing e adjoining daniels timber and the wind was fast driving the flanles tow t ards his beetree at a glance the d farmer saw it wasthe old scamps de a sign to let the fire reach the trunlk i burn it down which would have been an inevitable result as it was h quite dry and then he could secure tl the honey and leave the flames to w complete their work  the affair s would then lhave the appearance of di an accident while thornton would a have no positive proof that the sac ja charine contents of the old oak had tr been pilfered          i thornton restrained his anger and in without uttering a single word to his w crafty neighbor at once proceeded to sa head off the advancing  element th this accomplished lie hastened to the house and soon returned with an axe fiv and two pails felling the tree he on very leisurely gathered up the honey wl old hugh approached and looked on on with envious eyes while his neighbor he skirmished with the bees    so quite a haul friend thornton  bi said the old sinner       iou yes daniel returned in a sar has   led castle tone  but i shouldnt have been so much in a hurry about gath  ering it if id had honest neighbors oth bees will work for two weeks yet  if my fire had got into that tree out twould a made quick work with the your honey and the old fellow aks tried to look very funny lan daniel had to bite his lips to keep ng from   boiling over but having al ready decided upon a plan for re nd venge he resolved to have no alterca il tion with the unreasonable man so k after a pause he said re mr winterblossom i found an ed other tree yesterday and from the vy appearance of things i should judge r there was a hundred weight of stutf ad in it  a  a   hundred weight o honey in one tree i declare you do have n the luck of ithugh exclaimed in ig astonishment but where is it e  oh you want to let your fire run  that way dont you but its in the e direction of the huckleberry swamp  and if you find it youre smarter than  i take you to be  e  daniel carried his honey to the s house and then glided down toward e the  swamp winterblossoms eyes  were upon him approaching a big r sound hemlock upward of six feet in f diameter which stood on the lau or i a neighbor the farmer pulled out his jackknife and cut his initials on the i trunk turning to retrace his steps he caught a glimpse of hugh dodg iing  into a thicket this was just what daniel wanted  he was now satisfied that his tormentor would bite the bait set for him the next morning daniel arose at five oclock and sat down to study on some machinery he was contriving when he heard the sound of an axe on the still air of dawn listening le heard it again and again the sound came from the direction of the big hemlock giving utterance to a loud laugh he seized his hat and hastened toward the spot crawling   up as near as he could without being  observed he concealed himself be i hind the trunk of a tree and recog nized old winterblossom and julius bently stripped to their shirts and pants chopping away on the big hemlock as if for dear life it was as much as daniel could do to keep from laughing outright they paused in their work and our listening friend heard the following few more blows will fetch her julius but its been an allnight job with us my boy and winterblos som pulled out his old watch and scanned it by the advancing daylight why its half past fiveweve been at work over eight hours  it will be a dear job too if wil son should prosecute us for felling this fine tree was bentleys reply prosecute us why aint old thorntons name on it and wont that be the strongest kind of evidence aginst him chip chip chip went the axes again and in a few minutes the tree fell with a fearful crash but the choppers were so far from any house that they feared no disturbance at that early hour now for the honey said win terblossom in a triumphant tone walking up the prostrate trunk to look for the supposed hlollow that should contain the sweet compound a fifteenminutes closest scrutiny of all parts of the trunk and boughs proved the tree to be perfectly sound affording not the slightest retreat for bees it was then that daniel real ized the truth of the old adage list eners hear no good of themselves for curses both loud and deep fell upon his head alike from the lips of old hugh and his victimized companion for full five minutes they stormed away until the surrounding trees seemed to bow their heads in horror then picking up their axes and the vessels designed to contain the honey these amateur beehunters walked   quickly away tho the elast was already streaked with coming sunlighlt shall i help you carry your honey mr winterblossom asked daniel in a tone of the bitterest ar casm crossing their path and retreat ing toward his liouse another volley of curses wao all the response old hlugh made bentleys countenance fell now this ll be known all over the neighborhood before night mut tered the clhagrined julius who wish ed from the bottom othllis heart he never had seen old winterblossom tlet himin tell it there are two of us and our words il go as far in court or community as hsn i guess let him tell it if he dare as winterblossom nearecd his man sion his sleepy eyes fell upon the figure of his spouse standing upon the doorstep with disheveled locks and troubled air evidently she was very much excited whereve you been all night you old fool a pretty husband you are to steal off in this way she vehe mently exclaimed as soon as the old t man came  within hearing  that poor hoptown goodfornothing has  been here and janettes goneoff with  him to be married i spectand not  a soul here to hender i  thunder and mars voiferated winterblossom dropping axe and pail f  wheres john s  he wouldnt do a thing might  have locked the srieaking scamp into r th barn but lhe saidtwas none of his  affairs   the dog  ill discharge him at r onlce n  wihterblossom turned to appeal to d his young companion for counsel but i he had suddenly disappeared bent d ley evidently thought his presence s would prove any thing but agreeable r to his now troubled host and hostess e and wisely took himself away y the honey affair in connectio d  with the elopement of janette soon leaked out and betore the lapse of a week the story was current all over town every bodyfirom selectman down to the veriest ragged urchin was rallying winterblossom onl the superiori y of hemlock honey eivery body also was glad llhat his

propelrty     the host lwho thrloughout this re cital had listened apparently with no be deeper interest than mvseif laugh to ing immoderately now and then at tol the misfortunes of the hero here ve jumped up and commenced pacing edl the room while he gave way to fre a quent outhursts of humor that must ni have seriously threatened his sides as and buttons at length fixing his w twinkling eyes

no  apology sirlno apology soo   of a whatever wilkinson replied with over another ringing laugh that put gates man entirely at his ease i never allow in a good story to be spoiled for rela the tions

you will think my feelings have been in the least de gree assailed by anly thing said to night  and benton arose and warlm ly grasped first the hend of wilkin son and then that of the lawyer and friend gates interposed our host that you maynot take to yourself the credit of touching off all the fireworks tonight  will add that i perhaps have given mr win terblossom a worse snubbing than he ever received from any one else soon after i married his niece she   indeed did feel a little conscience stricken because she had left him so abruptly mind she didnt care an iota for his gold but she wanted to be reconciled to her uncle and aunt be cause she was indebted to them for lher education so janette promp ted by a sentiment of gratitude alone wrote her uncle a letter but it was quickly returned simply endorsed with a few words of the bitterest corn ment wethen removed to this vi cinity fortune favored us and now we have a competency after a lapse of some eighteen or twenty years mr and mrs win terblossom happened to hear how prosperous we had beenin fact it was last summer and we then were living in a smaller house near town they came with honeyed words and made us a long visit of course we both treated them with the same hos pitality and kindness that we should had nothing unpleasant ever occurred not a word was said in allusion to the past the day before they  were to leave us a town cart drove up to our gate with a complete outfit for a par lor and two bedchambers    i  w hat does this mean  i asked as the teamer began to unload the j goods and deposit them according to i the directions of winterblossom oh this is a present from us to your wife wasthe old mans reply in a very obsequious tone  we didnt  cording to custom make her any present when she was married and  weve decided to do it now better  late n never  you know not in this case mr w inter   blossom i responded decidedly my wife was standing in the door be side me looking fully as indignant as i felt we can not accept those arti cles i know our furniture is worln but we can readily replace it when ever we choose you are welcome to stay under our roof as long as you please and you both shall be well treated but not one cents worth of any thing can you leave here a gift of onequarter the value of this would have been gratefully received once but we do not wish it now so the furniture was at once re turned to the dealers and withllout any show of illnature old hught has been snubbed so many times his pachydermatous sensibilities are proof against all ordinary manifestations of spite the old couple bade us goodby the next day we expect another visit fromn them next summer we had a mirthful time at the breakfasttable the next morning in which mrs wilkinson took as cheer ful pal t as any of us referring with much goodnature to her visit to the library while the lawyer was so lost in his story and humorously dwelling upon the difficulty she had to refrain from laughing outright at his unconsc ious allusions to herself the roads were now broken and we travelers proceeded on our respec tive journeys but i never shall for get that snowstorm nor the remark able circumstances which brought to gether after a lapse of years persons once so singularly related to hear from thelips of a stranger a story concerning their own experiences anna mowbray or tales of the harem by greenhorn author of venus in boston gay deceiver adventures of a libertine julia king kate montrose c c new york henry r j barkley anna mowbray or tales of the harem anna mowbray or tales of the harem introduction in which the author scrapes an acquaintance with the reader the writer of the following tale has frequently had the honor of appearing before the public in former productions and the general success that has attended these unpretending efforts has induced him to add one more to the offsprings of his humble pen most of the incidents comprised in the romance of the house breaker are strictly true some of the most exciting scenes herein depicted may create a feeling of incredulity and yet such scenes are far more replete with fact than with fancy indeed imagination has had but very little to do in the composition of this worka somewhat extended knowledge of the world and an intimate acquaintance with real life as it is having enabled the author to produce a tale of considerable interest without any great departure from the actual truth we have in this story endeavored to illustrate the position and delineate the character of a young man compelled by the pressure of unjust circumstances to adopt a course of life very repugnant to his principles and feelings we have nothing to urge in extenuation of henry stuarts faults but we cannot help pitying his misfortunes and we must rejoice at his reformationfor as soon as he recovers his rights he abandons his dishonorable profession and becomes an excellent and useful member of society his admirable conduct with respect to jane carrwhom he rescues from the lowest depths of misery and eventually places in a most elevated and brilliant sphere without ever trying to take advantage of her unprotected situationthat noble conduct we say should entitle  henry stuart the reformed house breaker to the forgiveness of that community which his transgressions had wronged though justice be thy plea consider this that in the course of justice none of us should see salvation we do pray for mercy and that same prayer doth teach us all to render the deeds of mercy with these preliminary remarks we ring up the curtain and present the first scene in our little drama chapter i the flash cribboy jacka motley crewthe cripple and his daughtera scene of horror drawn from real lifeguinea billthe rescuethe house breakers and their spoilsthe surprise and escape keiths alley is the name of a long narrow and dark passage that runs out of ann street in the city of boston it leads to various old and crazy wooden buildings rotten and crumbling with age and decay these miserable houses are tenanted by myriads of wretched and starving poor including irish negroes and the lowest dregs of a vast citys population keiths alley is also a lurking place for the votaries of crime and it affords concealment to villains of the most desperate and abandoned character who find comparative security in its foul dens in the garret of one of these houses upon a dark and wintry night many years ago were assembled twenty or thirty persons including both sexes all colors and almost every age the garret was large and was by no means uncomfortable being perfectly weather tight well lighted by half a dozen tallow candles and warmed by a huge redhot stove that stood in the centre in one corner was the bar constructed of rough boards behind this upon wooden shelves was arranged a motly collection of bottles decanters and glasses the delicacies of the bar were dispensed by an amazon who responded to the gentle title of boy jack this woman was possessed of extraordinary strength and couragein the science of pugilism she was singularly expert and it was her boast that she could whip any man in ann street she was rather a comely female with a good form and regular features but shockingly profane and obscene in her conversation standing behind the bar with her arms folded she awited the calls of her patrons and contemplated the scene before her with an observing eye and such a scene hogarth would have been in extacies and cruikshank gone wild with delight small deal tables were scattered about surrounded by various groupsat one a huge negro was playing penny bluff with a small halfstarved white boy who was risking the few pennies he had gained by selling newspapers in the hope of increasing his scanty store at another a bloated old prostitute in a state of maudlin intoxication was sipping vile gin from a gill measure hysterically laughing and weeping by turns at the same table a miserable halfnaked man was ravenously devouring some cold victuals that he had carried in his hat while upon a bench close by lay a man without legs or arms this unfortunate person had been all his life a most desperate drunkard and one winters night he was so severely frozen on his way home from a rumshop that all his limbs had to be amputated to save his life and he was left a miserable and helpless cripple his poor wife was dead but he had a daughter who at the time we speak of was fourteen years of age the father cripple as he was still retained his appetite for strong drink he gained a precarious subsistence by begging being drawn through the streets by his daughter in a little cart having no home he and his poor child found an occasional shelter in the dens of keiths alley often when the wretch of a father had spent his last penny for rum they passed the long winters night beneath some shed or outhousethe cripple lying in his cart in a state of drunken stupefaction and the poor girl shivering in a corner of the desolate building she had been often urged by benevolent people to suffer her father to be carried to the alms house in which case she could have secured a home in some respectable family as a domestic she would have embraced the kind offer with thankfulness but her father would not consent to the arrangement he cursed her fiercely for suggesting it saying that he could get no rum at the almshouse and declaring that he would die sooner than go there poor jane such was the daughters name would not permit him to be sent against his will and she faithfully remained with him through every hardship and peril with a beauty of filial devotion as rare as it was touching the father was of course dependent upon her for everything she placed the food in his mouthshe raised him and laid him down he was more helpless than a newborn babe and yet more savage and vindictive than the worst ruffian in ann street when his anger was aroused against his child he would curse her with fearful bitterness and eye her with savage malignityhis teeth gnashing with impatience at the impotence of his wrath at such times it seemed that had he but the power he would have murdered his hapless child upon the night to which we referred at the opening of our present narrative john carr the cripple having begged a shilling or two during the day had requested to be conveyed to boy jacks crib the name of a thieves den where he soon drank himself insensible in copious draughts of the poisonous liquor he was then stretched upon the bench and left alone in his helpless misery alone did we say not so for near him sat a pale and young girl thinly clad it was his daughter she was pretty and had a very meek and patient look her dress consisted of an old faded gown of calico and a miserable straw bonnet and there she sat hour after hour waiting for day to break and her wretched parent to awaken from his beastly lethargythen to commence their weary pilgrimage why did she remain there in her purity and innocence among that ghastly crew whose touch was pollution and whose every thought a crime why did she not fly from the accursed den as from a charnelhouse and seek a refuge in the arms of virtuous benevolence because that bloated thing beside her was her fathera holy link that bound her to him through all the horrors of his loathsome career she would not leave him it was past midnight when the cripple awoke he called to his daughter jane raise me up and get me a gill of gin for im dably dry jane carefully and tenderly raised him up and propped him against the walland said timidly the money is spent father and the money spent hussy you lie you have been eating i know you have and paying for itcurses on you father there were but two pennies left and i was faint and hungry for you know i had no food today so i ventured to buy two penny rolls see i have saved one for you deardo eat it she held it to his mouth but he only frowned upon her savagely how dare you buy such trash when the money would have bought me a gill come herelet me whisper to you with some hesitation she inclined her ear to his mouth with a rapid jerk he caught the ear between his teeth and bit it till the blood came she screamed with pain and said piteously father how you have hurt me i meant to d you growled the brute and he laughed horribly you think blast you that because i am a cripple you can do as you please and stuff that maw of yours while i am dying for a drink yes you join all the rest of the world in persecuting me but ha ha although i cannot beat you i can bite you may eternal the ruffian here pronounced a dreadful curse upon his child who answered not but wept in silence meanwhile the big negro had broke the little white boy with whom he had been playing penny bluffthat is had won all his money from him the boy probably with good reason accused the negro of cheating him whereupon the latter seized him and beat him cruelly until boy jack rushed forward and with a blow of her fist knocked the negro down she then ordered the miserable white lad to quit the garret saying clear out young fellowif youve lost all your money youve no business here the boy sneaked out and the negro ensured his welcome by immediately purchasing a gill at the bar just as he had disposed of his cheap and agreeable refreshment the attention of all present was attracted by the scream of poor julia carr writhing under the pain of the injury inflicted by her brutal father the negro went forward to ascertain the cause of the disturbance upon learning from the lips of carr himself the nature of the offence the daughter had been guilty of the negro looked at her for a moment with a villainous grin and whispered in the ear of her parent for some time the result of this conference was that he the negro drew from his pocket several small pieces of silver which he placed in the mouth of the cripple he then procured half a pint of gin at the bar which he carefully poured down the throat of carr who after draining the last drop rolled over on the bench and resumed his beastly lethargytwere profane to call it sleep and now heaven help thee jane the lamb in the clutches of the ravenous wolf has a better chance for mercy than thou in the power of that black and hellish ruffian he sits down beside her and whispers in her ear words of hideous import he throws his villains arm around her shrinking and trembling form and glues his vile lips to hers in a villains kiss she struggles and shrieks for help and is answered by roars of laughter and words of mockery from the infernal throng that huddle around the tables boy jack shook her fat sides with merriment and pointing to a small room partitioned off from the garret requested the negro to occupy it with his intended victim guinea bill the negro lost no time in complying with this hint taking jane forcibly in his arms he carried her into the room and fastened the door shriek after shriek did the poor child utter in the agony of her terror but thank god she is saved the garret is entered by two athletic young men who lose no time in kicking open the door of guinea bills retreat they are just in timeanother moment and they would have been too late why you infernal black viper exclaimed one of the young men administering a welldirected blow upon the negros countenancewhat are you here with this child for away with you or by the gods ill split that baboon skull of yours as i would a cocoanut the negro drew a riggers knife from his belt and aimed a vigorous blow at the heart of his opponent he was immediately knocked down with a chair by the other youth who saw the movement in time the strangers with little jane emerged into the garret leaving guinea bill bleeding and insensible upon the floor of the room boy jack now came forward and appeared to recognize the strangers she dropped a profound courtesy and her manner towards them instantly became highly respectful you do me great honor captain by entering my poor cribboth you and your friend are welcome said she slow it said the one she had called the captain in a whisper we have cracked a crib and the pigs are after us and these shyse coves must not spot us let us have a room with some good lush where we can ogle the boodle and reg up these words london flash literally translated signify very nearly as follows be careful what you say we have broken into a house and the officers are after us and these loafers must not betray us let us have a room with some good liquor where we can examine the booty and divide the spoilsjonathan wild was the originator of flash  years ago these cabalistic words were easily comprehended by the talented lady to whom they were addressed she immediately conducted the two strangers to a room beneath not badly furnished upon the table she placed a bottle of liquor which she assured them was excellent she then left them alone together promising to have an eye to the safety of little jane and to see that she was not further molested by any one the person whom she had called captain seated himself at the table after throwing off his coarse overcoat his other attire was rich and elegant of the finest material and fashionably made he appeared to be about twentyfive years of age he was of a tall figure wellbuilt muscular and symmetrical his features were decidedly handsomenot the less so for an expression of bold reckless daring that pervaded them his noble brow was indicative of intellectual powers of a high order in short his entire appearance was that of a gentleman his companion was a short thickset person seemingly of about the same age his dress was plain and his features though neither regular nor handsome were rather prepossessing and expressive of determination and courage he treated the captain with a degree of deference evincing that whatever might be the nature of their pursuits his position was inferior to that of the other he deliberately drew forth from the pockets of his overcoat and placed upon the table a brace of pistols and then filled and drank off a glass of liquor with evident satisfaction and relish produce the booty tom said the captain abandoning the flash as unnecessary when alone with his companion ay ay sir responded tom and he forthwith proceeded to bring forth from the depths of his capacious pockets various articles of value a superb gold repeater with a massive chain attached a gold locket containing a miniature a diamond pin of prodigious value numerous rings bracelets necklaces c last and greatest of all tom produced a purse stuffed full of gold coins and a pocketbook equally corpulent with bank bills the captain regarded all this wealth with surprising indifference excepting the miniature which he examined very attentively it was the portrait of a young lady of surpassing beauty what a divine creature he said half aloudand by all thats sacred i will almost swear that i have seen the original of this picture somewhere tis very strange       he sat for some time in abstracted contemplation of the portrait while tom busied himself in dividing the money into two equal shares suddenly the door opened and boy jack rushed in her face pale with alarm saying shoot the pit ladsthe hounds are out guinea bill has betrayed you at that instant the noise of many feet was heard ascending the stairs tom instantly thrust the money and jewelry into his pocket and grasping a pistol rushed to the door and locked it boy jack threw up a window and the captain seizing the remaining weapon prepared to make a desperate leap followed by tom at a distance of fifteen feet beneath the window was the roof of an adjoining buildingtom follow me ay ay captain they both leaped and landed in safety upon the roof below just as the officers had begun to break down the door they rushed in but too latethe birds had flown chapter ii the burglars home and mistressa tale of wrongdeath of the cripplethe saint and sinnerthe burglarya tomcats sagacityand various other matters of interest to the reader the captain and tom maddox gained the street in safety it was now near daybreak and they hastened towards their place of residencethey entered a house of genteel appearance in prince street by means of a nightkeyand separating in the hall tom sought his chamber below stairs while the captain ascended to his in the second story he paused before a door and knocked softly in a few moments the door was cautiously opened and he was admitted a pair of soft white arms were thrown around him and a voice murmured dear harry how glad i am that you have returned in safety the chamber was luxuriously furnished but contained a large number of very singular articles upon the wall hung every implement used by house breakers in their lawless callingfalse and skeleton keys in flash termed dubs dark lanterns glims small iron crowbars london jimmies and various othor articles peculiar to the profession a profusion of fashionable female clothing lay about with wigs false hair curls c the uses to which these things were put shall be hereafter explained yes dear anna said the captain returning her ardent embrace and then beginning to draw off his bootsi have not only returned in safety but have come off with a splendid booty yet i am sick of this wretched lifeand when i have accumulated money enough to be independent i shall quit it forever we will purchase some little cottage anna far away from this accursed city and pass the rest of our lives in peace quiet and repentance for the past anna was a woman of noble appearance and great beauty her form was the most seductive her bust the most distracting and her eyes the most passionate that ever graced woman and both form and bust could never have been viewed with greater advantage than at the moment of her first introduction to the reader a very slight dishabille revealed not concealed her beauties the captain was soon in the arms of morpheusbut not until other arms had twined around him in a more ardent embrace than the sleepy deity bestows it is now time that we present our characters in due form the captains real name was henry stuart his parents had died leaving a large fortune to be divided between henry and a younger sistertheir only childrenthe property was placed in charge of a person in whom mr stuart had every confidence yet this person had proved himself a villainfor by some trickery or other he had seized upon the orphans substance and had left them penniless the little girl he placed in a respectable and wealthy family who adopted her as a daughter but henry whom he had always hated for his independence of spirit he turned out of doors in vain did the poor youth seek redress in vain did he implore the villain who had wronged him to grant him the merest trifle to keep him from starving he was driven with curses from the door to add to his misfortunes he knew not what had become of his sister all his inquiries and searchings for her had been without avail in the thickly populated city of boston such a search was indeed hopeless particularly as every precaution was taken by his villainous guardian to keep all knowledge of his sisters residence from him henry had sworn to be revenged on this wretch roberts by name a lawyer who had robbed him of his rights and was then enjoying his wealth and also his sisters he waited patiently for the time to arrive when he might consummate his vengeance five years had passed away and henry stuart became the leader or captain of a regularly organised band of housebreakers the gang consisted of twenty and tom maddox filled the station of a first lieutenant they held their meetings at certain secure places where they divided all the spoils arranged plans for future depredations and transacted all necessary business we shall afford the reader an opportunity of being present at one of these meetings in due season the woman whom we have introduced as anna had deserted a good home and attached herself to the fallen and desperate fortunes of henry stuart out of one of those romantic attachments that often spring up under the most unfavorable circumstances she ostensibly became his mistress and being an accomplished and talented woman not overburdened with scruples of conscience she used to practice a very ingenious fraud upon jewelers and tradesmen which we shall describe hereafter having made these explanations we take up the thread of our narrative a few nights after the events lastalluded to the captain and tom maddox issued from the house in prince street about ten oclock evidently bound on some secret business they were both disguised and had the appearance of ordinary laboring menturning into hanover street they perceived a small crowd collected on a corner they stopped to inquire the reason and learned that a man had been frozen to death they made their way through the crowd and found a girl weeping bitterly over something in a small waggon it was poor jane carr weeping over her dead father it was just as might have been expected it was fortunate for the poor child toofor his fate might have been hers had she lived that wretched life much longer but oh touching grief faithful to the last she is the only one that mourns for the dead and now they take her forcibly away and drag the waggon with its ghastly freight to the dead house to await the coroners investigation some one took poor jane by the arm and suggested that perhaps it would be as well to lodge her in the watchhouse as a vagrant the individual who made this benevolent proposition was a holy man wearing broadcloth and a white new cloth sure sir ye wouldnt put the poor child in jail im an honest man and faith she shall stop with my children at home till she can find a better one the person who made these last remarks was a sinner in cowhide boots and delapidated castor he had however what the saint had nota heart harry stuart stepped forward asked the laborer where he lived and squeezed a  gold piece into his hand saying take care of that young girl good man and i will see you in a day or two and pay you well for your trouble the man promised to do so and led jane to his humble but hospitable home the rev saint strutted off muttering something about the impudence of the lower orders the crowd dispersed and the captain and tom resumed their course up hanover street it was now eleven oclock and snowing violently the streets were almost entirely deserted yet a cheerful ruddy light streamed from the windows of many an oyster saloon and barroom on their way they turned into court street and kept on until they were within a short distance of the common here they paused and the captain pointing to an elegant building opposite whispered to his companion tom do you see that splendid pile over there its door guarded by two lions sculptured in granite that house is minebut go and read the silver door plate and you will find engraved upon it the name of one roberts now should i knock there and crave a lodging this stormy nightin my own house mind youthat thrice damnd villian would order his vilest menial to thrust me from the door oh tom he continued bitterly you have often wondered that i with my talents and education should be a house breakerbut my wrongs have driven me to it that saintly villainfor he is a church member tomwho now reposes in yonder luxurious mansion upon a couch of down shall feel my vengeanceshall restore my sistershall give back that stolen wealth we must crack that crib tonight tom very good sir replied the otherit looks like a good job harkthe clock is striking twelve it is time to begin work saying this the captain led the way to the rear of the house where a stout oak door set in a massive stone wall of great height communicated with the garden this door was firmly locked and fastened tom produced a brace and bit from his pocket and went to work in an expeditious and highly scientific manner in two minutes he had bored a hole through the door large enough to admit his handby this means he removed the inside fastening and in three minutes more he had adapted a skeleton key to the lock and opened the door jack sheppard himself that prince of house breakers could not have done it better entering the garden they closed the door and fastened it and then advanced to the house at this moment a huge bulldog rushed upon them with a savage growl the captain spoke one word and the animal recognizing him began to manifest the most extravagant delight by jumping on him licking his hand c the dog had belonged to henrys father and had not forgotten the young man although several years had elapsed since he had seen himordering the animal to go and lie down which was instantly obeyed our adventurous burglars gained an access into the kitchen of the house by raising a window and to their high satisfaction they found a fine fire glowing in an ample gratefor they were by this time quite chilled through after warming themselves tom maddox went to a closet and finding a cold ham some pastry and a bottle of wine set these delicacies upon the table and forwith commenced a vigorous attack upon them the captain also partook of the refreshments and when they had concluded the repast they proceeded to business tom lighted a dark lantern and they both ascended the kitchen stairs and reached the hall above where the captain directed his follower to remain while he should explore the upper part of the house tom leisurely seated himself upon the carpet while the other having drawn off his boots mounted the stairs and being well acquainted with the plan of the building found no difficulty in making his way to the particular chamber that he sought mr maddox remained for ten minutes or so in a state of peaceful contemplation of the profound darkness then he began to think that this waiting while another does the business is confoundedly dull pretty soon he thought he might as well get up a little amusement on his own account under this laudable impression tom stole softly up stairs as noiselessly as a cat and having mounted four flights found himself prevented from ascending higher by his head coming in contact with a door producing rather a loud noise and creating a considerable bump upon toms sagacious headpiece at the noise a female voice exclaimed good gracious whats that mowow said tom giving a very correct imitation of a cat its only that blasted tomcat said a mans voicescat the tomcat retreated to the foot of the stairs and paused to listen i must slip on my clothes and go down bridget continued the same voice and then followed a disrespectful allusion to a certain saline composition the unhappy individualwho was no less a personage than mr tubbs butler of the establishment the lady being of course his wifehaving attired himself with a rapidity that denoted the urgency of the case bolted precipitately down stairs passing tom on the landing and narrowly escaping being pitched over by the crouchedup form of that humorous intruder the butler made a hasty exit from the back door when tom who had followed close at his heels silently locked it thus effectually shutting the unfortunate mr tubbs out mr maddox then descended and fastened the kitchen doorso that should the butler get in at the window he could not get out of the kitchen after waiting for a few minutes tom deliberately mounted the stairs entered the sleeping apartment of mr and mrs tubbs and earned for the butler a reputation for qualities which the lastnamed gentleman never enjoyed we now follow the captain in his adventure on leaving tom he went up one flight of stairs and traversing a long passage or gallery felt his way to a door before which he paused for full ten minutes listening attentively to catch the faintest sound from within all was silent however he attempted to open the door but found it locked inserting a piece of wire in the keyhole he ascertained that the key was in the lock on the inside and with a pair of forceps a sort of pincers he turned the key and entered the chamber a lamp was burning dimly upon a table casting an uncertain and flickering light upon the objects in the room a luxurious bed occupied one corner towards which the captain directed his steps he silently drew the curtain and gazed long and fixedly upon the spectacle before him two persons were sleeping thereone of these was an elderly man with gray hair sharp features and an expression of mingled duplicity and cunningthe other was a young female of about sixteen exceedingly beautiful but pale and with the traces of recent tears upon her cheeks but the captain started in astonishment when he recognized in her the original of the portrait which so attracted his attention while dividing the booty at the crib of boy jack ah villain said henry stuart gazing fiercely upon the old man who was tossing about in uneasy slumberhow easily could i take thy reptile life and send thee to face thy maker with all thy sins upon thy hoary head whom hast thou there at thy sidesome hapless victim to thy lust or one that thou hast forced or cheated into a mockery of marriage by heavens he wakes the captain stepped to the foot of the bed out of sight just as the old man awoke and started up in bed i have had a dream he muttered a fearful dream i thought that young stuart stood over me about to tear out my heart for the wrongs i have done to him but pshaw twas only a dream after all yet im a villaini know it conscience tells me so no matterthe world thinks me a saint ha ha he laughed so loud at the verdancy of the world in thinking him a saint that the young female was awakened and inquired the cause of his mirth ill tell you was the reply i was laughing to think how beautifully i got possession of the property belonging to your brother and yourself then thrust him into the street and married you on a false pretence girl what were the conditions of our marriage why need i repeat them they were that you should seek out my poor brother and give him at teast a sufficient and comfortable maintenanceand also that i should be your wife only in namethat you should never claim the marital privilegein short that our marriage should never be consummated you shall see how faithfully i keep my promises pretty fool your brother should die like a dog on a dunghill before id give him a sixpence and you shall be my wife in more than name this very nightthis very instant and the lecherous old wretch would have been as good as his word had not the spirited and determined resistance he encountered produced a physical result that effectually disqualified him from the accomplishment of his purpose then it may well be supposed that henry stuart was shocked and astounded at what he heard that young girl his sister and married to roberts his bitterest foe and yet she had sacrificed herself to himto secure as she thought his comfort and good he admired the affectionate devotion of the generous girl and respected her for her rigid adherence to the condition of the marriage he could scarcely restrain himself from rushing forward when the old scoundrel attempted to violate that condition and wreaking summary vengeance on him when he saw that the attempt was unsuccessful and not likely to be renewed soon he determined not to reveal himself at that time but to secure what money and articles of value he could in the house and depart thankful that he had found his longlost sister and glad of an opportunity to regain from the clutches of his foe a portion of his own property accordingly he waited until the inmates of the bed slept again and then proceeded to look about him with much interest and extreme caution a mahogany writingdesk in one corner attracted his notice he was convinced that it contained articles of value chapter iii meeting of the house breakersspeeches of the captain and cranky dickcrib of the counterfeitersa benevolent gentleman relieves a seedy cove c c the captain finding the desk locked applied a small knife which opened it in a twinkling he was astonished and delighted at the amount of wealth that met his view a pile of banknotes and a large sum in gold were soon transferred to his pocketshe then opened a small drawer and from it took a bundle of papers and a miniature satisfied with the amount of booty obtained he now determined to decamp and accordingly left the room and descended the stairs he found tom at his post in the hall for that worthy having enjoyed himself to the utmost and afforded great satisfaction to the butlers spouse had returned to his station to wait the orders of his captain the burglars left the house by the way they had entered in the garden they found the poor butler halfdressed and shivering with cold seeing them he manifested the most ludicrous terror and rushed past them into the house exclaiming murderthieves tom related his adventure and received a severe rebuke from his superior you have done very wrong sirlet the offence never be repeated or we travel together no more in seeking for your own gratification you endan the angel over the right shoulder or the beginning of a new year or the beginning of a new year  by the author of sunny side   andover warren p draper publisher boston j p jewett and co  entered according to act of congress in the year  by austin phelps in the clerks office of the district court of the district of massachusetts press of w f draper     there a womans work is never done said mrs james i thought for once i was through but just look at that lamp now it will not burn and i must go and spend half an hour over it dont you wish you had never been ma ried said mr james with a goodaid laugh yes   rose to her lips itt was checked by a glance at the group upon the floor hses her husband was stretched out and two little     tthe angel over urchins with sparkling eyes and glowing cheeks were climbing and tumbling over him as if they found in this play the very essence of fun she did say i should like the good without the evil if i could have it you have no evils to endure replied her husb and that is just all you gentlemen know about it what would you think if you could not get an uninterrupted half hour to yourself from morning till night i believe you would give up trying to do anything there is no need of that all you want is system if you arranged your work systemat ically you would find that you could command tour time well was the reply   all i wish is that you could just follow me around for one day and see what i have to do if you could re   the right sioulder        duce it all to system i think you would show yourself a genius when the lamp was trimmed the conversa tion was resumed mr james had employed the  half hour in meditating on this subject wife said he as she came in i have a plan to propose to you and i wish you to prom ise me beforehand that you will accede to it it is to be an experiment i acknowledge but i wish it to have a fair trial now to please me will you promise mrs james hesitated she felt almost sure that his plan would be quite impracticable for what does a man know of a womans work yet she promised now i wish you said he  to set apart two hours of every day for your own private use make a point of going to your room and locking yourself in and also make up your       the angel over mind to let the work which is not done go undone if it must spend this time on just those things which will be most profitable to yourself i shall bind you to your promise for one monththen if it has proved a total fail ure we will devise something else when shall i begin tomorrow the merrow came mrs james had chosen the two hours before dinner as being on the whole the most convenient and the least liable to interruption they dined at one oclock she wished to finish her morning work get dressed for the day and enter her room at eleven hearty as were her efforts to accomplish this the hour of eleven found her with her work but half done yet true to her promise she left all retired to her room and locked the door   the right shoulder       with some interest and hcpe she imme diately marked out a course of reading and study for these two precious hours then ar ranging her table her books pen and paper she commenced a schedule of her work with much enthusiasm scarcely had she dipped her pen in ink when she heard the tramping of little feet along the hall and then a pound ing at her door mamma mamma i cannot find my mit tens and hannah is going to slide without me go to amy my dear mamma is busy so amy busy too she say she cant leave baby the child began to cry still standing close to the fastened door mrs james knew the easiest and indeed the only way of settling the trouble was to go herself and hunt up the      the angel over mnissing mittens then a parley must be held with frank to induce him to wait for his sis ter and the childs tears must be dried and little hearts must be all set right before the children went out to play  and so favorable an opportunity must not be suffered to slip without impressing on young minds the importance of having a place for everything and everything in its place  this took time and when mrs james returned to her study her watch told her that half her portion had gone quietly resuming her work she was endeavoring to mend her broken train of thought when heav ier steps were heard in the hall and the fas tened door was once more besieged now mr james must be admitted mary said he  cannot you come and sew a string on for me i do believe there is not a bosom in my drawer in order and i am   the right shoulder     in a great hurry i ought to have been down town an hour ago the schedule was thrown aside the work basket taken and mrs james followed him she soon sewed on the tape but then a button needed fasteningand at last a rip in his glove was to be mended  as mrs james stitched away on the glove a smile lurked in the corners of her mouth which her husband observed  what are you laughing at asked he to think how famously your plan works i declare said he  is this your study hour i am sorry but what can a man do he cannot go down town without a shirt bos om certainly not said his wife quietly when her liege lord was fairly equipped and off mrs james returned to her room a      the angel over half an hour yet remained to her and of this she determined to make the most but scarce ly had she resumed her pen when there was another disturbance in the entry amy had returned from walking out with the baby and she entered the hnrsery with him that she might get him to sleep now it happened that the only room in the house which smrs james could have to herself with a fire was the one adjoining the nursery she had become so accustomed to the ordinary noise of the children that it did not disturb her but the very ex traordinary noise which master charley some times felt called upon to make when he was fairly on his back in the cradle did disturb the unity of her thoughts the words which she was reading rose and fell with the screams and lulls of the child and she felt obliged to close her book until the storm was over   tiie righlt shoulder    when quiet was restored in the cradle the children came in from sliding orying with cold fingersand just as she was going to them the dinnerbell rang how did your new plan work this morn ing inquired mr james famously was the reply i read about seventy pages of german and as many more in french i am sure i did not hinder you long no yours was only one of a dozen inter ruptions o well you must not get discouraged nothing succeeds well the first time persist in your arrangement and by and by the family will learn that if they want anything of you they must wait until after dinner but what can a man do replied his      the angel over wife he cannot go down town without a shirtbosom i was in a bad case replied mr james it may not happen again i am anxious to have you try the month out faithfully and then we will see what has come of it the second day of trial was a stormy one as the morning was dark bridget overslept and consequently breakfast was too late by an hour this lost hour mrs james could not recover when the clock struck eleven she seemed but to have commenced her monmings work so much remained to be done  with mind disturbed and spirits depressed she left her household matters  in the suds as they were and puctually retired to her study she soon found howeer that she could not fix er attcnftion upoa any intellectual pursuit   tiie right shoulder       neglected duties haunted her like ghosts around the guilty conscience perceiving that she was doing nothing with her books and not wishing to lose the morning wholly she commenced writing a letter bridget inter rupted her before she had proceeded far on the first page what maam shalt we have for dinner no marketing hant come have some steaks then we hant got none maam i will send out for some directly now there was no one to send but amy and mrs james knew it with a sigh she put down her letter and went into the nursery amy mr james has forgotten our mar keting i should like to have you run over to the provision store and order some beefsteaks i will stay with the baby      the angel over amy was not much pleased to be sent out on this errand she remarked that she must change her dress first be as quick as possible said mrs james for i am particularly engaged at this hour amy neither obeyed nor disobeyed but nan aged to take her own time without any very deliberate intention to do so mrs james hoping to get along with a sentence or two took her german book into the nursery but this arrangement was not to master charleys mind a fig did he care for german but the kitties he must have whether or no and kitties he would find in that particular bookso he turned its leaves over in great haste half of the time on the second day of trial had gone when amy returned and mrs james with a sigh left her nursery before one oclock she was twice called into the kitch   the right shoulder       en to superintend some important dinner ar rangement and thus it turned out that she did not finish one page of her letter on the third morning the sun shone and mrs james rose early made every provision which she deemed necessary for dinner and for the comfort of her family and then elated by her success in good spirits and with good courage she entered her study precisely at eleven oclock and locked her door  her books were opened and the challenge given to a hard german lesson   scarcely had she made the first onset when the door bell was heard to ring and soon bridget coming nearer and nearerthen tapping at the door somebodies wants to see you in the parlor ma am   a      the angel over tell them i am engaged bridget i told em you were tohome maam and they sent up their names but i hant got em jist there was no help for itmrs james must go down to receive her callers she had to smile when she felt little like it to be sociable when her thoughts were busy with her task her friends made a long call they had nothing else to do with their time and when they went others came in very unsatisfactory chitchat her morning slipped away on the next day mr james invited compa ny to tea and her morning was devoted to preparing for it she did not enter her study on the day following a sickheadache con fined her to her bed and on saturday the   tiie rigiit shouldelt     care of the baby devolved upon her as amy had extra work to do thus passed the first week true to her promise mrs james patiently persevered for a month in her efforts to secure for herself this little fragment of her broken time but with what success the first weeks history can tell with its close closed the month of december on the last day of the old year she was so much occupied in her preparations for the morrows festival that the last hour of the day was approaching before she made her good nights call in the nursery she first went to the crib and looked at the baby there he lay in his innocence and beauty fast asleep she softly stroked his golden hairshe kissed gently his rosy cheekshe pressed the little dimpled hand in hers and then carefully draw      the angel oyer ing the coverlet over it tucked it in and stealing yet another kissshe left him to his peaceful dreams and sat down on her daugh ters bed she also slept sweetly with her dolly hugged to her bosom at this her moth er smiled but soon grave thoughts entered her mind and these deepened into sad ones she thought of her disappointment and the failure of her plans to her not only the past month but the whole past year seemed to have been one of fruitless effortall broken and disjoint edeven her hours of religious duty had been encroached upon and disturbed she had accomplished nothing that she could see but to keep her house and family in order and even this to her saddened mind seemed to have been but indifferently done she was conscious of yearnings for a more earnest life than this unsatisfied longings for something   the rig ht should    er which she had not attained often clouded what otherwise would have been a bright day to her and yet the causes of these feelings seem ed to lie in a dim and misty region which her eye could not penetrate what then did she need to see some re sults from her lifes work to know that a golden cord bound her lifethreads together into unity of purpose notwithstanding they seem ed so often single and broken she was quite sure that she felt no desire to shrink from duty however humble but she sighed for some conforting assurance of what was duty her employments conflicting as they did with her tastes seemed to her frivo lous and useless it seemed to her that there was some better way of living which she rom deficiency in energy of character or of principle had failed to discover as she lean      the angel oveir ed over her child her tears fell fast upon its young brow most earnestly did she wish that she could shield that child from the disappointments and mistakes and selfreproach from which the mother was then suffering that the little one might take up life where she could give it to herall mended by her own experience it would have been a comfort to have felt that in fighting the battle she had fought for both yet she knew that so it could not be that for ourselves must we all learn what are those things which  make for our peace the tears were in her eyes as she gave the goodnight to her sleeping daughter then with soft steps she entered an adjoining room and there fairly kissed out the old year on an cther chubby cheek which nestled among the pillows at length she sought her own rest   the right shoulder       soon she found herself in a singular place she was traversing a vast plain no trees were visible save those which skirtedthe dis tant horizon and on their broad tops rested wreaths of golden clouds before her was a female who was journeying towards that re gion of light little children were about her now in her arms now running by her side and as they travelled she occupied herself in caring for them she taught them how to place their little feetshe gave them timely warnings of the pitfalls she gently lifted them over the stumblingblocks when they were weary she soothed them by singing of that brighter land which she kept ever in view and towards which she seemed hastening with her little flock  but what was most re markable was that all unknown to her she was constantly watched by two angels who      the angel over reposed on two golden clouds which floated above her before each was a golden book and a pen of gold one angel with mild and loving eyes peered constantly over her right shoulderanother kept as strict watch over her left not a deed not a word not a look escaped their notice when a good deed word look went from her the

pilgrim until he observed penitence for the wrong upon which he dropped a tear on the record and blotted it out and both angels rejoiced to the lookeron it seemed that the travel ler did nothing which was worthy of such care ful record sometimes she did but bathe the   the righit shoulder      weary feet of her little children but the angel over the right shoulderwrote it down some times she did but patiently wait to lure back a little truant who had turned his face away from the distant light but the angel over the right shoulderwrote it down   sometimes she did but soothe an angry feeling or raise a drooping eyelid or kiss away a little grief but the angel over the right shoulderwrote it down sometime her eye was fixed so intently on that golden horizon and she became so ea ger to make progress thither that the little ones missing her care did languish or stray then it was that the angel over the left shoul der lifted his golden pen and made the entry and followed her with sorrowful eyes until he could blot it out sometimes she seemed to  advance rapidly but in her haste the little      the angel over ones had fallen back and it was the sorrowing angel who recorded her progress sometimes so intent was she to gird up her loins and have her lamp trimmed and burning that the little children wandered away quite into forbidden paths and it was the angel over the left shoul der who recorded her diligence now  the observer as she looked felt that this was a faithful and true record and was to be kept to that journeys end the strong clasps of gold en those golden books also impressed her with the conviction that when they were closed it would only be for a future opening her sympathies were warmly enlisted for the gentle traveller and with a beating heart she quickened

seemed to reconize her self startled and alarmed she awoke in tears the gray light of morning struggled through the halfopen shutter the door was ajar and merry faces were peeping in wish you a happy new year mamma wish you a happy new year a happy noo car      the angel over she returned the merry greeting most heart ily it seemed to her as if she had entered upon a new existence she had found her way through the thicket in which she had been en tangled and a light was now about her path the angel over the rigtt shoulder whom she had seen in her dream would bind up in his golden book her lifes work if it were but well done he required of her no great deeds but faithfulness and patience to the end of the race which was set before her now she could see plainly enough that though it was right and important for her to cultivate her own mind and heart it was equally right and equally important to meet and perform faithfully all those little household cares and duties on which the comfort and virtue of her family depended for into these things the angels carefully looked   the right shoulder       and these duties and cares acquired a digni  ty from the strokes of that golden penthey could not be neglected without danger sad thoughts and sadder misvingsun defined yearnings and ungratified longings seem ed to have taken their flight with the old year and it was with fresh

to america the youth ful emigrd landed in safety and crossing the alleghany mountains the poor exile only arrested his wandering steps upon the lovely banks of la belle riviere there in the wilderness surrounded by cruel and savage foes clustered a few loghuts inhabited by a small colony of french many like poor jean thus rudely transplanted from a city the climax of material civilization and intel

jeans father he welcomed the poor boy with warmth and delight to his home and insisted that he should remain with him it was a gleam of blessed sunshine to jean the doctor was always cheerful eulalie his pretty wife only a few years older than jean cheered and consoled him with the sympathy and affection of a sister nor was the happiness of this secluded home incomplete a lovely childgods best and most precious boon was theirsa member of this happy family the turbulence of paris was no longer la mented by jean        idealities the full glory of october crowned the majestic forests of the west when first he knew them what gorgeous fancy of the old world can fully have pictured them can words paint upon the vision the varied vistas of forest trees corrus cating in their approaching death of

loved study and he would only have been too happy to occupy himself entirely in investigations similar to those he had pursued with ardor and under more favorable circumstances in paris well it suited the dreamy mood of eulalie to listen to the doves seated beneath the roof coo softly finding in their plaintive notes pure blendings with many accents of innocent baby prattle nor did       idealities           i the drear voices of the night overwhelm the timid heart of the young wife and mother in their rude log hut let the deathwatch click its dreary warnings in the wall every fall of its little

must be avoided for wherever nature said stop and admire or come and rest there lurked the red man with arrow pointed and tomahawk raised aloft ready for the work of death yet dr villiers considered it an impera tive duty to attempt to dispose of the ther mometers upon which he had expended so much time and so he embarked upon his long voyage eulahe was confided to the care of jean who had become even as a dear son to the chemist a shadow rested upon the household but young hearts left in congenial intercourse       idealities do not wither and perish daily jean worked in the pretty little

     melted his heart he must forget his own loss and try to comfort her it was simply a duty jean must be cheerful and strive to infuse some brightness into the long win ter eveningsonce so

eulalie and hope like the rainbow spans earth touches heaven but fades away bathed in tears the last warm breath of the year vouch safed in the indian summer revives eulalie how delicious the bland

cold nights succeed to the glories of autumn like a miserere chanted are the solemn strains of weirdmusic creeping through the dismantled branches of desolate trees jean was ever untiring in the effort to        idfalities cheer and console the mourner and so in deed as many months passed away her sadness was gradually dispelled by the charm of so grateful a presence congenial in thought and soul these young hearts had much in unisonmany intuitions and sym pathies forever unknown to common natures jean suffers a fearful conflict of emotions he has discovered that the companionship of the widow of his friend is necessary to his happiness for his high sense of honor it seemed a treachery to love eulalieit was almost to rejoice in the death of his friend and benefactor nor yet could he resist such varied attractions he strives to rea son and recall the past of his life yes he has left paristhe wonderful climax of civi lizationto search in primeval forests for the pale

intellectual cul ture her society cannot deaden as the em brace of the parasite but she adds a sweet ness in her dependence like the wild rose worldly women are true parasites because although they appear to adorn and beautify with their gaudy covering of leaves the stately trunk upon which they depend yet noxious and chilling is their influence but can jean hope to gain the love of this true heart he had witnessed the tenderness of her devotion to her husband then she was some years older than he and could she would she ever regard him as other than a brother harassed by such a complication of feeling jean becomes melancholy eula lie sighs over the change she rallies the forces of her soul and strives to console the despondent youth and devotes much time and thought in devising gentle means but       idealities the endeavor is of no avail the influence of jeans sadness is magnetic both again are sorrowful and they sorrow for each other their tender glances have a mystic meaning which penetrates the heart words common words which everybody can care lessly exchange flash through brain and heart and at last comes the clearer con sciousness the mutual confession when the soul shaping unconscious words only makes of them the irresistible expression of that which they knew and felt before human life is fleeting but not more so than human affections how transient when the idol is of earth and yet so short a time since the angel of death had cast his shadow over that future into which she had looked with radiant eyes her child had been an accessory to her happiness but ever a secondary attachment she had fancied the memory sacred enshrined now   idealities       oh vanity of human life another idol is up lifted and eulalie loves againdearly truly entirely she stands before god as ready for all womanly selfsacrifice for the object beloved at first it had seemed to her that only did she direct the love for her lost hus band heavenward and gained another minis tering spirit to lead her to the pure and holy this religious impression had fortified her soul but left her human heart very desolate a greater congeniality than she now dis covers could not exist for it fills her heart entirely she loves jean as one destined from all time to love her and make her happy she has faith to believe that the divinity which shapes the course of men has given to them  this impulsion it is a sin not to be grateful and jean and eulalie thank god who in such mysterious ways has placed them together they have intuitions of each others character which        idealities like prophetic glimpses discover all the inner life and gives an entire perception of each others tastes but above beyond all so delicious is the fusion that lovelove is the birth again does the glad earth wear the royal crown of summer and our lovers with peace and joy revisit the beauteous woods and thus their hearts overflowing with tender ness they apostrophize surrounding objects dear birds and insects i ween ye look for us gray rocks with patches of green seeking to invest yourselves with freshness but feeding only parasites as the stony hearted must it is kindly to offer us repose tender green bushes screening us beneath your peaceful shade wild glen which re ceives us in your gentle slope where young breezes lie cradled the livelong daywe salute you  all would that a language could be invented replete with vowel sounds   idealities       sending into banishment all ugly consonants then uttering these harmonies we would seek such woods as these and add the wild rose blooming without the thorn and then thrill out our souls as the foolish birds do love lasts but a season with themwith us it should be so perennial that we must needs find within our enchanted forest a fountain of youth to  ve inthat warm hearts beat not too violently incrusted by the snows of old age our lovers were poetic and inno cent as highminded although the little community in which they lived recognized the report of dr vil liers death as undoubted and evidence suffi cient to satisfy every one must be conclu sive yet jean nobly resolved to obtain in person every possible trace of his friends sad fate the courageous youth determines to em bark for new orleans as dr villiers had        idealities done and returning with the circumstantial and certain facts of the manner of his death claim the lovely eulalie in marriage with christian resignation she recognizes the ne cessity of such an attemptindeed it was but a mutual thought with them jean departs in a boat similar to that in which her husband had left them ah what painful suspense for the young life so bereft to love as they love and to be separated is fearful when added to this misery comes the desolation of silenceit is like being walled alive shut out completely from the lifegiving sun of her existence tortured overwhelmed with misgivings what a sad period of trial sen sitive as the dewdrop exhaled by morning light through dreary hours of expectation what tones of mockery haunt that mild spirittrust in god was her serene prayer but despair brooding near tolled over her soul its

eulalie replies in simple act of faith i believe and i know that eye is omnipre sent gazing into the depths of the blue sky she seeks to elevate her soul to god that never may she be blotted out of his re membrance in eternity not long does she endure this ordeal of weary uncertainty only an interval of several weeks has elapsed and she sits in the twilight hour oppressed by batlike fancies suddenly the silence of her desolate home is broken by the sound of familiar steps and eulalie in mortal anguish receives the em bracenot of her youthful lovercertainly of no ghostbut of her cruelly forgotten husband how utterly abased she feels to hear applied to her in endearing accents of       ideatties great joy those words of magic earnestness  my wife my own wife on the threshold of the cottage door pale overmastered by honest shame and contrition stands jean as if awakening from a fevered dream he had met his friend while descending the ohio returning to his home and his idolized wife embraced as a beloved son by the man hehad injured he had been forced by his affectionate importunities to turn back with him  dr villiers had been unsuccessful in new orleansin selling his thermometers he then went to havana where he had been very sick of a fever and it was reported in new orleans that he was dead slowly convalescing for many months he remained too feeble to endure the rigors of the jour ney home and thus the long delay and the voyageurs story of his death were ex  plained the           a    idealities        prone and wrecked was eulalie in every pulse of soul heart and body the whole world unrolls itself as a vain phantasm things lose their substance and pass be fore her ask illusions in agonyshe bends as if crushed by heavens thunderbolt but triumphant is

good to be de ceived ever have i known you noble full of high resolves and above men in majesty of feeling commencing thus she mournfully and truthfully narrates the story of her weak ness how losing the true dignity of widow hood she had so quickly ceased to mourn his loss and learned to love his friend  she knows herself absolved before high heaven when falls softly and caressingly her hus       idratties bands hands upon her silken tresses in for giveness and benediction god forever bless you eulalie for the bright candor of your soul replies the generous man then clasping in his arms thecontrite jean he exclaims how i pity you my poor friend for truly you have lost a good wife    dream from an earache i am a young widow i trust this an nouncement may arrest as it probably will the eye of some querulous bachelor or de mure spinster but even under the sinister glance of a congregation of such uhfortu tunate beings again i throw my gauntlet and reiterate what must seem to them so indelicate an avowal for the public eye sincerely earnestly for several years have i deplored the losswhich even yet appears to me irreparable as day succeeds day the heavy hours are fraught with much of gloom and sadness to me and i would once have supposed that every dear friend even every casual acquaintance would com prehend at least something of the desolation        idealities of a young life so bereft and pass lenient judgment ah not so am i sad do my eyes bear traces of recent weeping is my countenance pale am i clothed for many seasons in dress of sadness mali cious comments are only

electrotyped by smith  mcdougal  beekman street mark twains burlesque autobiography and first romance a burlesque autobiography two or three persons having at different times intimated that if i would write an autobiography they would read it when they got leisure i yield at last to this frenzied public demand and herewith tender my history ours is a noble old house and stretches a long way back into antiquity the earliest ancestor the twains have any record of was a friend of the family by the name of higgins this was in the eleventh century when our people were living in aberdeen county of cork england why it is that our long line has ever since borne the maternal name except when one of them now and then took a playful refuge in an alias to avert foolishness instead of higgins is a mystery which none of us has ever felt much desire to stir it is a kind of vague pretty romance and we leave it alone all the old families do that way arthour twain was a man of considerable notea solicitor on the highway in william rufus time at about the age of thirty he went to one of those fine old english places of resort called newgate to see about something and never returned again while there he died suddenly augustus twain seems to have made something of a stir about the year  he was as full of fun as he could be and used to take his old sabre and sharpen it up and get in a convenient place on a dark night and stick it through people as they went by to see them jump he was a born humorist but he got to going too far with it and the first time he was found stripping one of these parties the authorities removed one end of him and put it up on a nice high place on temple bar where it could contemplate the people and have a good time he never liked any situation so much or stuck to it so long then for the next two hundred years the the house that jack built jack family tree shows a succession of soldiersnoble highspirited fellows who always went into battle singing right behind the army and always went out awhooping right ahead of it this is a scathing rebuke to old dead froissarts poor witticism that our family tree never had but one limb to it and that that one stuck out at right angles and bore fruit winter and summer early in the fifteenth century we have beau twain called the scholar he wrote a beautiful beautiful hand and he could imitate anybodys hand so closely that it was enough to make a person laugh his head off to see it he had infinite finite sport with his talent but by and by he took a contract to break stone for a road and the roughness of the work spoiled his hand still he enjoyed life all the time he was in the stone business which with inconsiderable intervals was some fortytwo years in fact he died in harness during all those long years he gave such satisfaction that he never was through with one contract a week till government gave him another he was a perfect pet and he was always a favorite with his fellowartists and was a conspicuous member of their benevolent secret society called the chain gang he always wore his hair short had a preference for striped clothes and died lamented by the government he was a sore loss to his country for he was so regular some years later we have the illustrious john morgan twain he came over to this country with columbus in  as a passenger he appears to have been of a crusty uncomfortable disposition he complained of the food all the way over and was always threatening to go ashore unless there was a change he wanted fresh shad hardly a day passed over his head that he did not go idling about the ship with his nose in the air sneering about the commander and saying he did not believe columbus knew where he was going to or had ever been there before the memorable cry of land ho thrilled every heart in the ship but his he gazed a while through a piece of smoked glass at the penciled line lying on the distant water and then said land be hangedits a raft when this questionable passenger came on board the ship he brought nothing with him but an old newspaper containing a handkerchief marked b g one cotton sock marked l w c one woollen one marked d f and a nightshirt marked o m r and yet during the voyage he worried more about his trunk and gave himself more airs about it than all the rest of the passengers put together if the ship was down by the head and would not steer he would go and move his trunk further aft and then watch the effect if the ship was by the stern he would suggest to columbus to detail some men to shift that baggage in storms he had to be gagged because this is the house that jack built cause his wailings about his trunk made it impossible for the men to hear the orders the man does not appear to have been openly charged with any gravely unbecoming thing but it is noted in the ships log as a curious circumstance that albeit he brought his baggage on board the ship in a newspaper he took it ashore in four trunks a queensware crate and a couple of champagne baskets but when he came back insinuating in an insolent swaggering way that some of his things were missing and was going to search the other passengers baggage it was too much and they threw him overboard they watched long and wonderingly for him to come up but not even a bubble rose on the quietly ebbing tide but while every one was most absorbed in gazing over the side and the interest was momentarily increasing it was observed with consternation that the vessel was adrift and the anchor cable hanging limp from the bow then in the ships dimmed and ancient log we find this quaint note in time it was discouvered yt ye troblesome passenger hadde gonne downe and got ye anchor and toke ye same and solde it to ye dam sauvages from ye interior saying yt he hadde founde it ye sonne of a ghun yet this ancestor had good and noble instincts and it is with pride that we call to mind the fact that he was the first white person who ever interested himself in the work of elevating and civilizing our indians he built a commodious jail and put up a gallows and to his dying day he claimed with satisfaction that he had had a more restraining and elevating influence on the indians than any other reformer that ever labored among them at this point the chronicle becomes less frank and chatty and closes abruptly by saying that the old voyager went to see his gallows perform on the first white man ever hanged in america and while there received injuries which terminated in his death the great grandson of the reformer flourished in sixteen hundred and something and was known in our annals as the old admiral though in history he had other titles he was long in command of fleets of swift vessels well armed and manned and did great service in hurrying up merchantmen vessels which he followed and kept his eagle eye on always made good fair time across the ocean but if a ship still loitered in spite of all he could do his indignation would grow till he could contain himself no longerand then he would take that ship home where he lived and keep it there carefully expecting the owners to come for it but they never did and he would try to get the idleness and sloth out of the sailors of that ship by compelling them to take invigorating exercise and a bath he called it walking a plank all the pupils liked it at any rate they never found any fault with it after trying it when the owners were late coming for their ships the admiral always burned them so that the insurance money should not be lost at last this fine old tar was cut down in the fulness of his years and honors and to her dying day his poor heartbroken widow believed that if he had been cut down fifteen minutes sooner he might have been resuscitated charles henry twain lived during the latter part of the seventeenth century and was a zealous and distinguished missionary he converted sixteen thousand south sea islanders and taught them that a dogtooth necklace and a pair of spectacles was not enough clothing to come to this is the malt that lay in the house that jack built divine service in his poor flock loved him very very dearly and when his funeral was over they got up in a body and came out of the restaurant with tears in their eyes and saying one to another that he was a good tender missionary and they wished they had some more of him pahgotowahwahpukketekeewis mightyhunterwithahogeye twain adorned the middle of the eighteenth century and aided gen braddock with all his heart to resist the oppressor washington it was this ancestor who fired seventeen times at our washington from behind a tree so far the beautiful romantic narrative in the moral storybooks is correct but when that narrative goes on to say that at the seventeenth round the awestricken savage said solemnly that that man was being reserved by the great spirit for some mighty mission and he dared not lift his sacrilegious rifle against him again the narrative seriously impairs the integrity of history what he did say was it aint no hic no use at mans so drunk he cant stan still long enough for a man to hit this is the rat that ate the malt that lay in the house that jack built him i hic i cant ford to fool away any more amnition on him that was why he stopped at the seventeenth round and it was a good plain matteroffact reason too and one that easily commends itself to us by the eloquent persuasive flavor of probability there is about it i always enjoyed the storybook narrative but i felt a marring misgiving that every indian at braddocks defeat who fired at a soldier a couple of times two easily grows to seventeen in a century and missed him jumped to the conclusion that the great spirit was reserving that soldier for some grand mission and so i somehow feared that the only reason why washingtons case is remembered and the others forgotten is that in his the prophecy came true and in that of the others it didnt there are not books enough on earth to contain the record of the prophecies indians and other unauthorized parties have made but one may carry in his overcoat pockets the record of all the prophecies that have been fulfilled i will remark here in passing that certain ancestors of mine are so thoroughly well known in history by their aliases that i have not felt it to be worth while to dwell upon them or even mention them in the order of their birth among these may be mentioned richard brinsley twain alias guy fawkes john wentworth twain alias sixteenstring jack william hogarth twain alias jack sheppard ananias twain alias baron munchausen john george twain alias capt kydd and then there are george francis train tom pepper nebuchadnezzar and baalams assthey all belong to our family but to a branch of it somewhat distantly removed from the honorable direct linein fact a collateral branch whose members chiefly differ from the ancient stock in that in order to acquire the notoriety we have always yearned and hungered for they have got into a low way of going to jail instead of getting hanged it is not well when writing an autobiography to follow your ancestry down too close to your own timeit is safest to speak only vaguely of your greatgrandfather and then skip from there to yourself which i now do i was born without teethand there richard iii had the advantage of me but i was born without a humpback likewise and there i had the advantage of him my parents were neither very poor nor conspicuously honest but now a thought occurs to me my own history would really seem so tame contrasted with that of my ancestors that it is simply wisdom to leave it unwritten until i am hanged if some other biographies i have read had stopped with the ancestry until a like event occurred it would have been a felicitous thing for the reading public how does it strike you this is the cat that caught the rat that ate the malt that lay in the house that jack built awful terrible medieval romance chapter i the secret revealed it was night stillness reigned in the grand old feudal castle of klugenstein the year  was drawing to a close far away up in the tallest of the castles towers a single light glimmered a secret council was being held there the stern old lord of klugenstein sat in a chair of state meditating presently he said with a tender accent my daughter a young man of noble presence clad from head to heel in knightly mail answered speak father my daughter the time is come for the revealing of the mystery that hath puzzled all your young life know then that it had its birth in the matters which i shall now unfold my brother ulrich is the great duke of brandenburgh our father on his deathbed decreed that if no son were born to ulrich the succession should pass to my house provided a son were born to me and further in case no son were born to either but only daughters then the succession should pass to ulrichs daughter if she proved stainless if she did not my daughter should succeed if she retained a blameless name and so i and my old wife here prayed fervently for the good boon of a son but the prayer was vain you were born to us i was in despair i saw the mighty prize slipping from my grasp the splendid dream vanishing away and i had been so hopeful five years had ulrich lived in wedlock and yet his wife had borne no heir of either sex but hold i said all is not lost a saving scheme had shot athwart my brain you were born at midnight only the leech the nurse and six waitingwomen knew your sex i hanged them every one before an hour this is the dog that worried the cat that caught the rat that ate the malt that lay in the house that jack built had sped next morning all the barony went mad with rejoicing over the proclamation that a son was born to klugenstein heir to mighty brandenburgh and well the secret has been kept your mothers own sister nursed your infancy and from that time forward we feared nothing when you were ten years old a daughter was born to ulrich we grieved but hoped for good results from measles or physicians or other natural enemies of infancy but were always disappointed she lived she throveheavens malison upon her but it is nothing we are safe for haha have we not a son and is not our son the future duke our wellbeloved conrad is it not sofor woman of eightandtwenty years as you are my child none other name that hath ever fallen to you now it hath came to pass that age hath laid its hand upon my brother and he waxes feeble the cares of state do tax him and be already duke in act though not yet in name your servitors are readyyou journey forth tonight now listen well remember every word i say there is a law as old as germany that if any woman sit for a single instant in the great ducal chair before she hath been absolutely crowned in presence of the people she shall die so heed my words pretend humility pronounce your judgments from the premiers chair which stands at the foot of the throne do this until you are crowned and safe it is not likely that your sex will ever be discovered but still it is the part of wisdom to make all things as safe as may be in this treacherous earthly life oh my father is it for this my life hath been a lie was it that i might cheat my unoffending cousin of her rights spare me father spare your child what huzzy is this my reward for the august fortune my brain has wrought for thee by the bones of my father this puling sentiment of thine but ill accords with my humor betake thee to the duke instantly and beware how thou meddlest with my purpose let this suffice of the conversation it is enough for us to know that the prayers the entreaties and the tears of the gentlenatured girl availed nothing they nor anything could move the stout old lord of klugenstein and so at last with a heavy heart the daughter saw the castle gates close behind her and found herself riding away in the darkness surrounded by a knightly array of armed vassals and a brave following of servants the old baron sat silent for many minutes after his daughters departure and then he turned to his sad wife and said dame our matters seem speeding fairly it is full three months since i sent the shrewd and handsome count detzin on his devilish mission to my brothers daughter constance if he fail we are not wholly safe but if he do succeed no power can bar our girl from being duchess een though ill fortune should decree she never should be duke this is the cow with the crumpled horn that tossed the dog that worried the cat that caught the rat that ate the malt that lay in the house that jack builtnotethe brand t gp may possibly refer to the great public or the great people or something like that my heart is full of bodings yet all may still be well tush woman leave the owls to croak to bed with ye and dream of brandenburgh and grandeur chapter ii festivity and tears six days after the occurrences related in the above chapter the brilliant capital of the duchy of brandenburgh was resplendent with military pageantry and noisy with the rejoicings of loyal multitudes for conrad the young heir to the crown was come the old dukes heart was full of happiness for conrads handsome person and graceful bearing had won his love at once the great halls of the palace were thronged with nobles who welcomed conrad bravely and so bright and happy did all things seem that he felt his fears and sorrows passing away and giving place to a comforting contentment but in a remote apartment of the palace a scene of a different nature was transpiring by a window stood the dukes only child the lady constance her eyes were red and swollen and full of tears she was alone presently she fell to weeping anew and said aloud the villain detzin is gonehas fled the dukedom i could not believe it at first but alas it is too true and i loved him so i dared to love him though i knew the duke my father would never let me wed him i loved himbut now i hate him with all my soul i hate him oh what is to become of me i am lost lost lost i shall go mad chapter iii the plot thickens a few months drifted by all men published the praises of the young conrads government and extolled the wisdom of his judgments the mercifulness of his sentences and the modesty with which he bore himself in his great office the old duke soon gave everything into his hands and sat apart and listened with proud satisfaction while his heir delivered the decrees of the crown from the seat of the premier it seemed plain that one so loved and praised and honored of all men as conrad was could not be otherwise than happy but strangely enough he was not for he saw with dismay that the princess constance had begun to love him the love of the rest of the world was happy fortune for him but this was freighted with danger and he saw moreover that the delighted duke had discovered his daughters passion likewise and was already dreaming of a marriage every day somewhat of the deep sadness that had been in the princess face faded away every day hope and animation beamed brighter from her eye and by and by even vagrant smiles visited the face that had been so troubled conrad was appalled he bitterly cursed himself for having yielded to the instinct that had made him seek the companionship of one of his own sex when he was new and a stranger in the palacewhen he was sorrowful and yearned for a sympathy such as only women can give or feel he now began to avoid his cousin but this only made matters worse for naturally enough the more he avoided her the more she cast herself in his way he marvelled at this at first and next it startled him the girl haunted him she hunted him she happened upon him at all times and in all places in the night as well as in the day she seemed singularly anxious there was surely a mystery somewhere this is the maiden all forlorn that milked the cow with the crumpled horn that tossed the dog that worried the cat that caught the rat that ate the malt that lay in the house that jack built this could not go on forever all the world was talking about it the duke was beginning to look perplexed poor conrad was becoming a very ghost through dread and dire distress one day as he was emerging from a private anteroom attached to the picture gallery constance confronted him and seizing both his hands in hers exclaimed oh why do you avoid me what have i donewhat have i said to lose your kind opinion of mefor surely i had it once conrad do not despise me but pity a tortured heart i cannot cannot hold the words unspoken longer lest they kill mei love you conrad there despise me if you must but they would be uttered conrad was speechless constance hesitated a moment and then misinterpreting his silence a wild gladness flamed in her eyes and she flung her arms about his neck and said you relent you relent you can love meyou will love me oh say you will my own my worshipped conrad conrad groaned aloud a sickly pallor overspread his countenance and he trembled like an aspen presently in desperation he thrust the poor girl from him and cried you know not what you ask it is forever and ever impossible and then he fled like a criminal and left the princess stupefied with amazement a minute afterward she was crying and sobbing there and conrad was crying and sobbing in his chamber both were in despair both saw ruin staring them in the face by and by constance rose slowly to her feet and moved away saying to think that he was despising my love at the very moment that i thought it was melting his cruel heart i hate him he spurned medid this manhe spurned me from him like a dog chapter iv the awful revelation time passed on a settled sadness rested once more upon the countenance of the good dukes daughter she and conrad were seen together no more now the duke grieved at this but as the weeks wore away conrads color came back to his cheeks and his oldtime vivacity to his eye and he administered the government with a clear and steadily ripening wisdom presently a strange whisper began to be heard about the palace it grew louder it spread farther the gossips of the city got hold of it it swept the dukedom and this is what the whisper said the lady constance hath given birth to a child this is the man all tattered and torn that loved the maiden all forlorn that milked the cow with the crumpled horn that tossed the dog that worried the cat that caught the rat that ate the malt that lay in the house that jack built private office board of directors err positively no admittance to any but directors when the lord of klugenstein heard it he swung his plumed helmet thrice around his head and shouted long live duke conradfor lo his crown is sure from this day forward detzin has done his errand well and the good scoundrel shall be rewarded and he spread the tidings far and wide and for eightandforty hours no soul in all the barony but did dance and sing carouse and illuminate to celebrate the great event and all at proud and happy old klugensteins expense chapter v the frightful catastrophe the trial was at hand all the great lords and barons of brandenburgh were assembled in the hall of justice in the ducal palace no space was left unoccupied where there was room for a spectator to stand or sit conrad clad in purple and ermine sat in the premiers chair and on either side sat the great judges of the realm the old duke had sternly commanded that the trial of his daughter should proceed without favor and then had taken to his bed brokenhearted his days were numbered poor conrad had begged as for his very life that he might be spared the misery of sitting in judgment upon his cousins crime but it did not avail the saddest heart in all that great assemblage was in conrads breast the gladdest was in his fathers for unknown to his daughter conrad the old baron klugenstein was come and was among the crowd of nobles triumphant in the swelling fortunes of his house after the heralds had made due proclamation and the other preliminaries had followed the venerable lord chief justice said prisoner stand forth the unhappy princess rose and stood unveiled before the vast multitude the lord chief justice continued most noble lady before the great judges of this realm it hath been charged and proven that out of holy wedlock your grace hath given birth unto a child and by our ancient law the penalty is death excepting in one sole contingency whereof his grace the acting duke our good lord conrad will advertise you in his solemn sentence now wherefore give heed conrad stretched forth the reluctant sceptre and in the selfsame moment the womanly heart beneath his robe yearned pityingly toward the this is the priest not shaven and shorn that married the man all tattered and torn unto the maiden all forlorn that milked the cow with the crumpled horn that tossed the dog that worried the cat that caught the rat that ate the malt that lay in the house that jack built doomed prisoner and the tears came into his eyes he opened his lips to speak but the lord chief justice said quickly not there your grace not there it is not lawful to pronounce judgment upon any of the ducal line save from the ducal throne a shudder went to the heart of poor conrad and a tremor shook the iron frame of his old father likewise conrad had not been crowneddared he profane the throne he hesitated and turned pale with fear but it must be done wondering eyes were already upon him they would be suspicious eyes if he hesitated longer he ascended the throne presently he stretched forth the sceptre again and said prisoner in the name of our sovereign lord ulrich duke of brandenburgh i proceed to the solemn duty that hath devolved upon me give heed to my words by the ancient law of the land except you produce the partner of your guilt and deliver him up to the executioner you must surely die embrace this opportunitysave yourself while yet you may name the father of your child a solemn hush fell upon the great courta silence so profound that men could hear their own hearts beat then the princess slowly turned with eyes gleaming with hate and pointing her finger straight at conrad said thou art the man an appalling conviction of his helpless hopeless peril struck a chill to conrads heart like the chill of death itself what power on earth could save him to disprove the charge he must reveal that he was a woman and for an uncrowned woman to sit in the ducal chair was death at one and the same moment he and his grim old father swooned and fell to the ground the remainder of this thrilling and eventful story will not be found in this or any other publication either now or at any future time the truth is i have got my hero or heroine into such a particularly close place that i do not see how i am ever going to get him or her out of it againand therefore i will wash my hands of the whole business and leave that person to get out the best way

be  ginning i miss katrine phaeton was a young lady of cucumberland born of rich but respectable    parents her hair a pae aeeewas golden hereyes brdy    thgray she had a carel ousew d g ashion of

       kniwaoyown to none as   xi pi  for her eyes she had kate phaeton and her eyes photographed a way of turning br bradyr s them on slowly as careful housewives dogas so that the victim could not fail to observe two thigs first that they were grand and beautiful orbs though the pupil was without a master secondly that they were overlooking him instead of looking at him some persons would have thought  her cross eyedbut it was only a way she had   l ipffith lank        so contemplated by such curious eyes a man feels queer he doesnt know whether he is being looked at or not she was rather charitable and made no bones of giving all the cold victuals about the house to the poor all she required in return from those around her was that they should be ro mana catholics and do precisely as she wished them to do in every thing singularly enough much uglier and richer girls married on all sides of her but this eccentric beauty remained miss phaeton at two times twenty she hunted once a month and was at home in the saddlebut did not give her receptions there so admirably balanced was her charac ter that notwithstanding her love of the manly sport she had no ambition to be a jockey nor a groom but one day they drew yewtree bow and out shot a fox a hedger saw him shoot and gave the view halloo and away across country like new brooms swept dogs horses and men but notwithstanding all this enum eration duv famina facti and so it was deuse takes the hindmost it was a gallant chase and our dreamy vir gins back got up her golden hair streamed and her gray eyes watered as lithe and blithe she sat upon her great white gelding riding over huntsmen as well as hounds and jump ing dithes and hedges where the stoutest stee      liffith lane plechase riders of the county were stuck and staked  having outridden and jumped over every body and every thing miss phaeton was naturally soon next to the fox and saw that sagacious animal when he not wishing to be run over glided into doewood un der ore  the huntsmen   and hounds were at this time so far in arrears that they mistook the great white geld and the backhbair of the dreamy vir ni for his brush at miss phae ton so long and still upon her horseo at the cor ner of the under wood that she fell into a deep reverie and did not see he fox when he stole out though her eyes wereient   if pith lanx        in that direction the fox thought she was look ing at him but here the peculiarity of those grand and beautifiul orbs made itself apparent she was overlooking him huntsmen and hounds were swearing and tearing in all directions but miss phaeton sat quietly and turned over in her head a plan for converting all the world to roman catholicism not so her horse  he plunged and then didnt and then trembled all over and planted his forefeet together at this angle  at the same moment he slanted his hindlegs thus  the following was then the position   it mayilbe mathematically stated thus so braced he could not move a peg a horse divided against himself can not stirquod erat demonstrandum but he looked a deal more statuesque taan any three statues in england as may readily be imagined and by the by the gentlemen who carve horses in our native style did they ever see one in that fixout of a picturebook     the whipperin came up and was somewhat surprised at the attitudes of both horse and rider prom that of the former he thought that the fox had popped out from that of the latter that liffith lank who was in the neighborhood had either popped or was expected to it never occurred to his simple soul that a meeting of the hounds could be converted into a meeting of the congregatio de propaganda fide      lijpfith lank however a huntsman came up andmade bold to touch his hat and ask her if she had seen nothing of the fox  she toyed with the horn that hung at her girdle looked him dreamily in the face and replied yes he blew his own horn lustily and asked which way pug had gone upon which miss phaeton looked him dreamily in the face again and made answer that she did not know but didst not say thou saws t him not so sweetheart said she laying her hand upon his arm softly and smiling sweetly you asked had i seen nothing of the fox and i replied yesband i have seen nothing of the fox thereupon the huntsman took a small but sizable flask from his pocket put it to his lips and wound another horn for he now saw what the dreamy virgin was at he understood that she had overlooked the fox couple up and go home to supper said miss phaeton sublimely disregardful that it was not suppertime and of the objectwhich had brought forty dogs and men and horses and her self to the field the fox is in his hole by this time and touching spur to her horse she jumped over the astonished huntsmans head and cantered slowly home across country as  though nothing had happened   pfith lank        courage mes amis remarked the huntsman to his friends as he rearranged the amidon which the hoof of the great white gelding had grazed and damaged thinking the while that it was the fall fashion and had cost ten dollars courage mes amis le diable est mort  miss phaeton had not ridden many miles when liffith

have thought it mark you the woman there why think you the grand and beautiful orbs overlooked the fox when he broke cover at dogwood undermore i why think you she broke up the hunt let me whisper it

soft ly looking him dreanily in the face lifflth muttered a word which under the cir cumstances might be called an allowable rhyme and dashing the spurs into his horse rode fierce ly away a casual

servants to assist himt and he very seldom got into bed without taking off his boots when he did he was especially careful to remove his spurs on one occasion when liffith forgot himnself with both spurs and boots mrs lank remon strated with him but he turned upon her and called her a prurient prude and threat ened to drag her before the public seeing her error she confessed it on the whole their mar ried life rippled on about as happily as ever mar ried life does the main trouble was about help  mrs bank was prejudiced against goodlooking cham bermaids and liffith was opposed to roman catholic servingmen who excelled in polish in every thing except in the matter of polishing boots this brings us to the openinug of our story i say the hussy shall pack mrs lank had remarked       liffith lank she had asked him a few seconds previously to bring out his viol da gamba alas her speech i had the effect of bringing out a vialof wrath  say i then that losel shall never blacken my

follow that throw them she should every morning in her husbands face inor strictly speaking by the letter of the law were they her boots whether paid she for them or not as well have claimed his breeches might she and these she coulding more have filled than his boots autnqunquam tentes autperfice besides for the matter of that they were not boots at all they were a patr  of hob nnaileet shoes sometimes liffith thought that he had got an elephant on his handsthat he might as well have married mademoiselle djekfor at times he did indeed feel much dejectedand been a jack of all trades at once mrs tlank had in her employ a lady named ryderand ride her mistress she did with a ven geance in combing mrs lanks long and beau tiful hair tshe tangled and pulled it viciously capillary attraction exerted its force to soften her obdurate hearth in vain ask you why ryder   ffpith  lane        was so relentless and remorseless  she loved  jiffith and pulling his wifes hair was the only way she had of showing it cmsa laete vis est  notissina           combing it rather strong in short ryder was a dangerous female and i would not like to ride alone with her on one of the english railways where the carriages you must know  are small and seldom filled not content with pulling out her mistresss hair she was always and forever putting fleas in her mnas ters ear it maynot have been before remarked by our treader but liffiths chief besetting sinaside from his unfortunate habit of getting drunk was lunacy  on the subject of priests he was monomaniacal  he had a way of strangling      lippfith lani them when they ventured upon his grounds which was not only inconvenient to the priests but distasteful as well to his wife who had a re mlarkable respect and fondness for the cloth sending them soups and gravies till one might have thought it was a tablecloth and ryder was always egging him on  one day she nagged and egged him so much that he determined to break the yolk so he collared a poor devil of a priest with whom his wife happened to be discussing the vicarious powers of the pope and shook and trampled him till there was seemingly no life left in him black and blue and livid those who picked the poor priest upthought he was suffering from an attack of the malignant collarer so liffith thinking he had killed his man fled the county taking with him all his wifes jewels in his desperation he never drew bridlerein till  hle reached an inn in the next county a good twenty miles away called the packhorse why he did not go further know i not but per chance he was fearful of faring worse there he proceeded to unpack and having nothing better to do fell to drinking on an empty stomach until he drank himself into a brainfever giffith was alwaysin luck and at this inn he foundanother woman with grand and beautiful orbs but this was a doveeyed angel when mercy vintner looked at things she saw them    ffith lank         which was more than could be said of mrs tiank had not iliffth possessed the constitution of a horse he would have succumbed to the fever and perhaps it was because of his possessing the constitution of a horse that a farrier sue  ceeded in curing him after a regular physician had given him up similia si nilibus curantur any way what with mercys nursing and the glauber and aloes which the farrier prescribed for him tliffith got sufficiently well to decline wearing the shroud which a kind old lady wws embroidering for him and call for a shirt the next thing he called for was a parson and he and mercy were made one much to the delight of the parents who thought that such a sonin law behind the bar would bring custom to the packhorse had they known his habits they would have trembled on trusting him with the keys for than liffith there were few squarer drinkers in the county the farrier who had been engaged to mercy came in just as the ceremony was over fox a moment he staredwoefully at the picture and then said very dryly i am too late for the wedding and too early for the funeral methinks that you be paul said mrs intner cheer fully  she is meet for your master if he be taken sick again the devil may dose him growled paul and leaving the room in dis       l ifflith la nk gust he withdrew his custom from the pack horse forever on being asked the reason he replied that he did not like the new barkeeper      o      cthapter vi ifllitl might have shown his gratitude o to mercy in a better way than marrying gus  her when he knew very well that he had a wife and child in the next county it was scarcely the right thing to do for there is a popular prejudice against a man having two wives and one should always endeavor to con form to the customs of society but i am writing of a period withwhich fielding dealt and can not forget my double character of moralist and artist ltiffith lank  is no worse than tom jones or ferdinand   count fathom  so while all these fellows are batting at me why do they not do a little fielding this tale hath float ed the argosy and sustained the atlantic the reader will remark that i have floated the floater in deference to the absurd prejudices of society i have already omitted a great deal that would have added to the interest of the story and its success among the massesexemnpli gratia the mrs potiphar business between ryder and iffith all this i intend to publish in a sequel if   ffith lank         the matter can be satisfactorily arranged with my publishers and it can be without donbt for it is a mistake to suppose that i consult them or any one else regarding the morality of what i write the only thing i discuss with them is bulk and priceprincipally bulk for i am an artist as well as a moralist andars longa etc my art chiefly displays itself in the length of my stories verbum sap to return to my story matters did not go dn very thrivingly at the packhorse after the marriage theprudent parents who had thought that liffith was a highwayman and would bring purses home occasionally found to their great dis appointment that he was a gentleman and exceed ingly awkward behind the bar moreover he drank like a fish nay he drank not like a fish for a fish drinks but water and little of that drank liffith it was ale and sack and sherry possets until every thing was empty he drank them out of house and home and creditors threat ened to sell out the packhorse reproached by mr vintner lifith requested the old man to cease his taunts and proposed to  buy him out  to this a ready agreement was made for the packhorse was old and the sign needed new painting and the custom was poor the best customer about the house was liffith but he did not even charge himself withl what he drank       l fppith lank the question of price was soon settled that of bulk had already been disposed of for it was in bulk that the inn was bought and the only thing that remained was payment it became a quest tion of cash very hha rd cas at mention of this tiffiths face fell for he had spent all the money he took from the priest at leaving and what he had raised from selling and pawning his otherwifes jewels suddenly a bril liant idea occurred to him he would go back to that other wife and borrow of her enough money to set himself and this one up in business so it is the words of the old song came true nous revenons toujours  a nob premiers amours and he saddled his great black horse and set roff to see the other mrs lank his fatherinlaw who thought he was going out to the high road to follow his old tradesof  stand and deliver bade him godspeed but the doveeyed angel sighed for he might come to grief thought she and it would not be pleasant to be widow of a man who was hanged tiffith delayed two days upon the road for he began to feel he was riding on an awkward errand having turned over in his mind the way he should conduct the disagreeable but necessary business he determined to conduct it upon business prin   fith l ank         ciples only and if collaterals and an indorser were required to get his fatherinlaw to back his paper  singularly enough he found his wife exactly where he had left her she was looking carefully over the ground in accordance with her usual custom to find the purse that had been dropped in the scuffle with the priest aside from being dressed in a magnificent irish poplin she was not much changed from what liffith remembered her ryder had not pulled all her golden hair out and she was still a passablelooking woman she threw herself on tliffiths neck panted on his shoulder and asked him what was the news you are but a woman said heas though that were dews to herand put her roughly  away i came not to make love but to make a loan mrs lank was a proud woman  an that be the case said she  we will go into the house and talk it over seated in the house my jewels that you did me the honor to take would not last you long i feared said she  so i expected some thing of this visit a man cannot live on hearing of sermons and smelling two rosebuds replied tliffith n bthat was spoke sarcasticul as sylva nus the sugary says       l ipliffith la nk the upshot of it all was that mrs lank ad vanced him five dollars on his personal recog nizance it being nightfall before the necessary negotiations were concluded tliffith generously consented to stay to dinner and as a matter of course got drunk a separate apartment had been aired and placed at his disposal but by an effort of organic memory he managed to mistake the roomnor did he discover the mistake until it was too late to remedy it such little mistakes will occur in the best regulated families  especially when one man maintains two living in separate counties early the next morning he mounted his horse and rode away to the doveeyed angel carrying five dollars in his pocket there said he flinging the postal currency down on the table i come not to thee empty handed nor i to thee while thou wast saying stand and deliver see what i did said mer cy with a heavenly smil pointing to a cradle which tliffith had not before observed it con tained a boy three years old on the whole he thought hed go back to kate and mercy on hearing the whole story coincided with him in the opion that it was the best thing he could do under the circumstances tiffith proposed utah if his other wife could be brought to consent but the doveeyed was not willing to dovetail into any such an arrangement   ffith   lank          so back rode he to cucumberland     but here found he himself in a sad pickle     for mrs mit

suddenly and simul taneously occurred to all the wellbred guests  and that idea was that they were perhaps de trop griffith saw them leave with a sinking heart for well knew he what was coming mrs

before hanging her however it was necessary to find the body now a little distance from the house was a mere filled with carp and eels and   s liffith lank         pike and other fish always fresh and fit for the table from the fact that they were fed principal ly upon parsons and peddlers il was a mere suspicion that the body was here but they de termined to drag the mere for some time they dragged nothing to the surface but parsons and peddlers and tin pots and broken jugs but at length they clawed hold of something else draw slowly said the contractor and if it is be men and hold fast

their testimony and mrs lank subjected each to a severe crossex amination upon the dogmas of the church at the conclusion of the case for the prosecu tion the prisoner stated that she should only call one witness for the defense mercy vintner cried she and mercy vintner who had been consulting the spirits in a sideroom stepped forward state to the court what you know about the case said mrs tlank

quietly tooks a note from her reticule and handed it to him the note was from tliffith and was addressed to the judge it briefly stated that he was alive but that he did not like to present himself for a family reasonor rather for a twofamily reason he had read about jailsmin a work by a popular author entitled never too late to end and did not wish to make close acquaintance with the punishmentjacket and cranks cold douches and visiting justices he concluded by asking the judge to dine with him when he happened to drop down his way paid a score of compliments to both his wives and threatened to whip any body who hanged either of them the court was at once dismissed and mrs lank apologized to a jury of her countrymen for the trouble she had given them she entered no legal

to be serious and instructive tis likely that i shall make people laugh for to be funny when i mean to be serious and serious when i mean to be funny is a faculty which i share in common with some of the most eminent humorists of the age if any lean and misshapen jokes be found remember that this line of writing is fearfully provocative and know that i have manfully resisted the temptation to alke very many more of all men in the world i am perhaps the most incompetent to write about wicked womenfor i do not know any nor indeed do i think that an amtsing book could have been built up on the basis which this title arbitrarily implies to smile at the repulsive is quite as bad asto shudder at the ridiculous and i pity but have no de sire to please the man who could laugh over a john allen the wickedness of a woman no matter how ludicrously drawn would be rather ghastly material for mirth but at the follies of the girl we may legitimately laugh a certain probability should underlie even creations of the imagination since one can neither laugh nor cry with good grace over what is impossible and on the principle that mustard is only relishable when it seasons meat i hold that all comic pictures should have somewhat sober and truthful backgrounds it is well to have good principles though we fail to illustrate them in practice and having put forward my claim to their possession i have

tangle with cologne bottles and       the wiokedest woman pincushions and crimping irons and put it aside for her maid to brush  before dressing your hair you must first catch your hair as mrs glass suggests in her most ex cellent cookery book the maid had no trouble in doing this for it lay ready to hand no one would have thought at first glancenor indeed at a secondthat this was or could be the wickedest woman in new york for her eyes were a beautiful blue fringed by long sweeping lashesand when she let these lashes fall on men in a careless way it was time for the interference of mr bergh strange to say the softer she laid them on the harder twas to bear her hair you see some of it there on the chair was a delicious brown and her maid did it up so her complexion was of that exquisite blending seldom seen but generally known as  strawberries smothered in cream  any berry let me remark like a home is but a small potato without its smother which perhaps explains why most young gentlemen were always ready to do a few spoons on her to the utter neglect of many maturer maidens who thought and not without reason that their age and irreproachableness entitled them to some consideration but as for her figure there was a wavy grace about that which passes de scription never too late to bend she thought so when it became settled that twas to be the fashion she adopted the grecian not the common style how ever by the assistance of an ingenious modiste she contrived a mechanism so arranged that when she threw either foot forward it worked a lever which pried her backpried her back forward i mean at the most singularly graceful angle known on the promenades             you know what the mechanical forces arecords and pulleys screws levers and wheels   m n ew york         she did not walk thus because she had proud but because she was pried so completely was she geared down in fact that she might be said to always travel in cog under such circumstances how could her value be recognized ignorant of the lever at her back how was one to know what a pur chase was there and so it happened that a great many shrewd men passed her day after day in the street without having the least idea that she was a good thing to buy but the right man for the wrong place always comes along at last as will be seen in the sequel undoubtedly not a few of my readers would like me to explain the mechanism above hinted at and give patterns after the manner of the bazar by which they could get up the thing for their own wear but it will at once be seen that a drawing could not be understood unless the machine were shown adjusted to the personand by no possibility could it be treated as an outside garment with mr wegg i can only remark at this juncture that a fuller explanation would not be proper in the pre sence of ladies and express a wish that nothing fur ther be said about it well ive got my heroine up but what am i to do with her now shes not dressed and to tell the truth i wish we were all well out of this cer tainly twill never do to leave the wickedest woman       tlihe wicedest woman in new york alone for a single minute still i do not know

i use a lay figure this for several reasons  first because lay figures cannot lie second propriety must be considered i sincerely hope that i am  guilty of no impro       the wickedest womang priety in introducing such subjects or objects in these pages they are prominently shown in all shopwindows and dangle like shrimpnets over shopdoors so that it is difficult to get down town without having your head caught in one certainly i do not think they are pretty and never would have chosen cuts ofthem for purposes of ornamenta tion they are used for illustrations sake alone the reader who expects that i am on the point of telling right here how the wearer gets into these things will be disappointed young ladies require no instruction and as for young men tis rightfully decreed that it shall cost them something to yearn go to young man go to or rather go to church two and come home one tis like that then youll know all about it there is crimping and twisting and braiding oh finette you pull awfully you do you great awkward thing to most young ladies this world it will be ob served is a world of things if the feminine nomen clature be right hamlet was not wide of the truth in

what the girl brings no mistake on the part of the oflaherty i these are indeed the shoes of the periodsoles thinner than writingpaper heels six inches high set in the middle of the foot and tapering down to the size of a fivecent piece besides being painful to wear they are undoubtedly productive of positive and per manent injury to the health were i a physician instead of a metaphysician and permitted to dispense pills as well as puns if a girl so shod came to me for advice complaining of numerous aches and pains i should say young woman go heel thyselfbut not in that way get shoes that you can walk comfortably in and use them persistently how voung women are shod may be no affair of mine but my right to  shoe  them when they vol untarily appear as guys is as inalienable as that to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness under diffi culties and i protest in toetoe against the footing on which women now seek to put themselvesthey can get up their backs sufficiently without the aid of such heels in making ladies shoes i trust that for the future the cobbler will stick to his lastand not build quite so far beyond it      cthie wickedest woman but all this while our young lady has been dress ing perhaps it was well that i distracted attention from her feet avoid extremes she is now ready for the streetand i submit whether or not she does not look as though she belonged to it she looked when fresh from her delicious sleep be fore this  getting up i ask do you not consider              i it superlatively  iicked to spoil gods handiest work in that fashion    in new york        e lapter    i forgot in the last chapter to state that the young lady got her breakfast while we were turning over her shoes if you insist that she had not time oblige me by supposing that this morning she went without it for tis certain that shes already on the avenue leading cupid by a string cupid is her dogwhich perchance may howl anon or anonymously it always seemed to me that he had better been called sirius being a skye ter rier but theres not much in a dogs name after all unless a man happen to get it a gentleman in allusion to cupids disposition to make universal war once asked his mistress why she did not call him mars  because hes not mas hes mine she replied mythology was not taught in the boardingschool where the young lady graduated nor for that matter was astronomy the pupils however were perfected on the piano and taught most modern languages except english one should not expect women to know a little of everythingnor much of anything i regret to record that cupid did not behave well on the street but rushed about with head to the ground on some invisible trail with the air of a ver itable cognoscenter dragging his mistress at his tail as though she were a tin can moreover he had a hatred of beggars and barked at them furiouslyun mindful of the danger which sometimes ensues from accidentally barking up the wrong tree this morning he bit a man who put out his hand for a penny  in parts of the country where a beg gar asks for a bit to give him a bite might be considered rather a good joke but this mendicant       the wickedest woman failed to see the thing in quite that light retorting with a kick which nearly landed cupid in that heaven where the dogstar is properly permitted to ragethe land of canine may we not call it our young lady reprimanded the man sharply and called him both a brute and a fellow threatening to tell her papa and the policeman had the police man been at his post on the corner twould have gone hard with the man for he wore very bad clothes but that preserver of the peace happening at the moment to be making love to a cook down an areaway under pretence of examining the fas tenings on the gate the caitiff escaped for that time nor i regret to say was the young lady much ap peased when the poor man showed his calf by no means a fatted one out of which cupid had taken a piece considerably larger than a biscuitwhich was imprudent in the dog in this day of false calves i dare not so much as touch veal pie to return to our mutton or rather to cupids our young lady fairly turned up her nose at the poor mans calf nor did she forgive him for his treatment of her favorite even when she saw how much had a                    im avew york        been taken where there was so little to spare on the contrary her sympathy was excited for the dog be cause of the great mouthful he had swallowed she feared it might not agree with himfor he was not accustomed to eating beggar and she pursued her way past all the clubswhich she faced with the daring of a pocahontas twas nothing that when opposite the eclectic so called because theres not much to choose among the membersall were in the window for they al ways are there but to have the fossils of the union the megatheriums of the manhattan and the nar cissuses of the new york rush from their whist tables and lookingglasses showed that something unusual was indeed in the wind and sailing down the avenue i dont think i have yet mentioned the hat here it is what do you think of such an owl head on young shoulders down town to the drygoods stores for she had shopping to do it is worthy of remark that she avoided places where female clerks were employed preferring to patronize those in which young men stood behind the counter alnd i observe that this is a feminine peculiarity noticeable even in those            i thte wickedest woman lwho insist that man shall fill no vocation which woman can attemptwhether or not because young men are better judges of goods or more patient and polite i cannot determine have you any canarycolored silk  yes miss the drygoods clerk knows that he can never go

so on through the different departments tangling precious yards of round point dangle terre valenciennes brussels honiton cluny and making a sad jumble of french and irish poplins shawls mantillas and the like to show you one counter will do for all expede   tw lew iv m      lok ctis not expedient in this case to show you more  f would you not call this an exhibit of counter irritation now putting those worthy youngmen to such great trouble may not have been wicked but i scarcely think it could be called good chapter  rerujeoaun home she found a bouquet from augus tusof whom by and by opening her inlaid writingdesk she selected the       the wickedest woman worst pen she could find and a piece of perfumed paper and wrote him a note in which she thanked him for his bouquet and pronounced it beautiful spelling beautiful with a big b and two ls she was given to that sortof thing but augustus didnt mind it there is a tide in the affairs of men when they are indifferent to orthography at this time he was too much under the spell of her eyes to much care how she distributed the other letters of the alphabet augustus was a young man who had a good time coming he hoped and a moustache come he had patentleather gaiters which held the bootblacks those little sons who  shine for all at bay and his pantaloon legs were cut so small that twas easier to put his legs outside of them than in his coat ended exactly where it should have continued in which respect the tail did not resemble the one i am writing and the lappels were turned so widelyover and so far back that one could almost see his backbone he danced well carried a little cane came of an old family and was in business in wall street re belonged to a club or two and believed in ritualism and augustusoutside of which beliefs he had no religion at all not a good fellow according to my interpretation of it i will not under take to say that he was a bad one such as he was however there are many like himthe mores the pity te had met our heroine in the usual way and been in attendance on her ever since they were not exactly engaged but it had come to be on his part at least an  understood thing she allowed him to attend her to balls and operas to send her bouquets and do her little errands about town which she should not have done if her intentions were not honorable in return for this devotion she danced with young brown whom he did not like   in new york         praised young jones whom he detested and did not flown down the attentions of old biggs of whom he had reason to be jealous augustus was to accompany her to a ball that eveninghence the bouquet the lunchbell ringing just as her little note was sealed with blue wax the young lady turned from lover to lobster with her customary versatility taking the flowers with herto waste their sweetness on the dessert air  after satisfying the inner woman she made a charming toilet to regale the outer man and came down into the parlor seating herself at the piano she played a number of airs from la duchesse and barbebleu with an abandon which few of the most abandoned ladies of the offenbach stage could equalnot remembering that her mamma was lying down in the room above suffering from a nervous headache while the sabre de monpere was still ringing on the air young brown was announced and she pro fessed herself delighted to see him though in reality i     tshe wickedest wotman annioyed at his coming as she expected young jones and feared she could now have a tetedtte with neither one nor the other young brown fell into line at the pianoand faced the music turning it over for her while she rattled off italian airs and sweet plaintive ballads bowling her eyes at him over the tender in a way that took him clean off his pins but never losing her own poise once to this day he does not know what he said nor what she sung a rosy cloud lay over his senses but he has a clear recollection that it was superlatively nice and that he doubted at the time if ever there   in new yark         was such another artless affectionate truehearted girl in this world and all this while the flowers at her side breathed their fragrance through the room in mute intercession for the young man who paid fifteen dollars for them that morning when the caller took his hat to go she plucked one of the sweetest rosebuds from the vase and with her own fair hands pinned it in his buttonhole with the language said he she turned on him a glance to which no language can do justice and he went away feeling fine as a fiddle and casting about in his mind who should be his groomsman the young lady watched his going through the blinds for a moment and then caught up her dog in her arms with a light laugh why hes got crooked legs and he turns his toes in why didnt you bite him cupid  a judicious speculator would have sold young brown stock short after that i think ere she had time to pick up the sabre of her father where she laid it down the bell jingled again and young jones dropped in he was a chatty fellow and they talked about parties and balls apropos of that she hoped he would be at mrs flamtoddles that evening she should be quite au desespoir if he were notand as she said this she looked at him that look cooked his goose at once and hebecame confiding and slightly incoherent      he talked to her of his business and told her how it flourished and how he hoped to form a connection the next week that would increase his profitsjlargely and then and then then what she innocently asked he would be in a position to marry and if only if only  gracious me its nearly halfpast three and i      x the wickedest womanr promised to call for clara an hour ago shell be so imad if i keep her waiting youll tell me all about it another timeand comesoonwont you young jones went down the steps elate with both a rosebud and a heliotrope in his buttonhole so elastic was his tread that you might have thought a spring sidewalk was laid ondthat side of the street though twas the middle of summer oh its such fun said our young lady as she watched him through the convenient venetian blind seating herself at the piano she dashed off jaime le militaire jaime le militarwe though the proceedings of the afternoon that far would argue that she had no particular objection to civilians strange to say she forgot her engagement with clara as soon as young jones had gone and it was quite as well she did so for a few minutes after old biggs rung himself in biggs a fat but rich old gentleman did not care for music and so the young lady brought out plan chette as soon as possible would he please put his hands on with her at first he wouldnt for he didnt believe in it it wouldnt move for him and there was no use in his trying but she was sure he was mistaken with so much magnetism about him they two could surely move itand wouldnt he try to please her  of course he would who could resist such bland ishments and so plumped down his paraffine paws as though demanding change at some bank counter in resting her hands on the board she contrived to bring them in contact with his fluffy fingers under such circumstances tis not surprising that old biggs soon concluded there was more mag netism about him than he had before dreamed of especially when the board began to walk about            i             in nve york       ask it something said the young lady and biggs at his witsend for a question inquired how old he wastrembling terribly immediately there after at his indiscretion thirtyfive wrote planchette he was fifty five if a day is that right mr biggs queried the young lady i believe so he replied quite delightedly and drawing a freer breath but didnt you make it do that i she said reproachfully lifting her long lashes and whipping the pool of his shallow eyes with one of her most killing flies oh mr biggs  how could you think i would do such a thing indeed i did not                        the wickedest woman then mr biggs who like all fat people was easily affected in warm weather waxed quite senti mental and gushed a little asking a number of ten der questions would he ever marry and could he make a home happy and was there any one in the world who could care for him c c all of these questions being answered in the affirmative he asked whats her name oh mr biggs cried the young lady i how inquisitive and as the board began to move i declare if it is not writing my name sure enough there was julia plain as a pike staff why the naughty naughty thing she cried and hid her blushing face in her hands then mr biggs turned from planchette to ask julia questions and he put them in such a practical business way that she blushed more and more and when he attempted to take her hand in his it was not altogether in affectation that she struggled to with draw it for she once picked up a jellyfish on the seashore and somehow his hand was suggestive of that experiment but when he went on to tell how much he made by one contract to clothe a single regiment of soldiers during the war and spoke o     in new york         of a house he intended to build on a lot hehad just purchased on the avenue three feet six inches wider than the sarsaparilla mans and ten feet deeper she became so interested that the afternoon was gone before she knew it old biggs waddled away with all that remained of the bouquet and the young lady sent finette down to the florists on the corner to get one as near like it as possible gus wont know the difference and anyway it was about spoiled she said watching mr biggs from the window staggering under the immense bouquet even in the roseate light of its flowers he looked but like a greengrocer       the wickedast woman with a cabbageshe thought he was scarcely so graceful as gus and she remembered besides a rumble in his throat as he spoke of his projects for the future it occurred to her that though shed like to sit in his carriage she could very well dispense with the rumble but at dinner she remarked to her mamma that mr biggs had called and that really she had no idea he could be so interestingso entertain ing what think you of the summing up of the young ladys afternoon three fellows fixed like cock chafers on a pin to buzz awhile for her amusement and then be let go carryin the holes with them i know that generally this thing is not considered superlatively wicked but it seems to me that the woman who does it stands in need of the prayers of several congregations there are milkandwater streets where special missions to these deepdyed and highstepping sinners might with propriety be estab lished as well as in the one which it was lately under taken to regenerate c lapter i ir the evening came augustus and the ball julia was in high spirits for her dress was a tri umph mme millefleurs had been at work on it for a month she wore i quote now from the description of the jenkins of the occasion address of yellow tulle bouillonnee with a black corsage embroidered with gold a tunic in the form of a court mantle looped   in new york         behind with broad black ribbons and over all this a green satin sash the panier was a wonder in its wayand indeed in the way of all present by a singular coincidence the band was playing the campbells are coming as she entered the room lest i be accused of not knowing how to dress a heavy swell of the feminine persuasion let me re mark that my heroine wears the same dress which the princess metternich came out in at a diplomatic entertainment lately tn her hair she wore several jewels and a string of precious stones was clasped round her throatthus all were enabled to see where the precious tones came from with which she pelted a parlor when she took her seat at the piano the worst that criticism could say of the balldress was that like the ball itself it began and ended too late julia was in her elementthat being understood to ebe gaslight in french she did not greatly excel but she was great on the german how many times a she danced i am not prepared to state with that pre cision which is the soul of statistics but she lost very little timeif we except a necessary stop of fifteen minutes to take in oysters truffied turkey and spar ldling moselle the wickedest woman   and how she flirted i there was one captain in particular a captain fitzfaddle if i remember rightly who entered the army when peace was de claredand had remained there ever since he thought it much pleasanter to open a ball than to be opened by one evidently and i dont know but that he was right he wore a new uniform with all the buttons that the regulations would allow and had on his epau lets for the occasion he was a much nicerlooking soldier than those horrid old veterans who have wooden legs and queer makeshifts for arms and smell of powder and armiy rations i dont wonder that julia took to him  but it so offended old biggs that he never came near her and julia secretly felt rather glad of it for as already hinted he was shortbreath ed and when he danced youd have thought a locomotive was going round the room on an up grade she flirted with young brown and young jones as well or rather as badlyand gave each of them a chance to say something to her in the conservatory when the wine was in their foolish heads and then laughed in their faces and protested it was too ridiculous and did any one ever hear of such a thingwhich quite spoiled the remainder of the evening for them as for poor augustus who accompanied her there and sent a preliminary bouquet besides stripping the table at supper and creating comments on the enormi ty of his appetite when in reality he was waiting on her she scarcely noticed himwhich was simply natural and precisely what might have been ex pected either this treatment or some secret trouble weighed upon his spirits he was less vivacious than usualand in consequence appeared much better   in new york   it is only when a tinpan or a brainpan rattles loudly that one knows for a certainty there is little in it poor young man on this particular evening my earnest sympathies were enlisted in his behalf his moustache drooped visibly and it was only by con stant coaxing that the ends could be made to do their duty at all he tried to perk up and led his own forlorn hope into a bright bevy of ladies but he signally failed to tell the jokes he had borrowed during the day as though they were his own and though he introduced some very clever conundrums when others gave them up he could not remember the answers himselfwhich in a measure deprived them of point altogether his career that evening was not a success and he labored under the addi tional disadvantage of being thoroughly conscious of it all the while but if that muscular young heathen suffered and felt like going home think of julias mother pic ture the distress of that poor femecovert who lit erally had not where to lay her headfor she did not waltz the young men dodged her at supper and the gentleman of the old school who took her in got her nothing to eat too dignified to crowd up to the table she did not succeed in getting there until everything was gone  certainly she could sit or stand with her back aainst the wall and talk with mrs tolderol and rs dorame but this was neither novelty nor luxury each of those most respectable ladies talked about her respective daughter and when the one expatiated upon her claras obedience and the other dilated on her annas economy mrs mcdoo dle felt that they were really casting reflections on her julia but trust the mother of the period for ability to      lthe wiokedest woman retaliate in kind she should always be thankful she said that julia outgrew a slight lameness with which she was troubled when a child one would scarcely notice any awkwardness now particularly when dancingjuha was graceful as a fawn on the floor while clara tolderol moved through the mazes like a bewildered kangaroo she was glad too that julia didnt get her nose from her father no girl could be pretty with a pug artna dorames was by no means grecianit had the bend certainly but twas upward julia made no return for the battle which her mother did with these accumulated ages in her be half despite of nods and winks and repeated mychild  mychild  itistimetogohomes  snap shots taken at her as she flew by in the danceshe made no response other than once to cry if it is time mamma why dont you go   not until four of the clock and only by incessant scratching then did our poor fidgetty mother succeed in gathering thig flighty chicken under her wing and getting her into the coupe our young lady made a number of men miserable that evening turned night into day in contempt of the order of the universe and worried her poor mother nearly to death yet a great many girls do all these things frequently and would start in surprise if one called them kicked   n new york          lapter  the next day julia breakfasted so after time that it might have passed for a late lunch or an early dinner she was subdued during the day and pensive not on account of her sins though indirectly they underlaid it all no belle more than any bow can endure a constantstrain after eight hours dancing and dissipation it was no wonder that julia found herself unstrung in a direct proportion to her former tension finette oflaherty had an unhappy time of it too she could do nothing rightly but was scolded upstairs and downstairs as well as in the ladys chamber so it is little wonder that before night she came to the conclusion that her countrys wrongs were nothing to hers mr mcdoodle never saw much of his daughter and seldom expressed a wish to see morebut this day after dinner he signified a desire to speak with her in the library she acquiesced readily enough for not caring to dress she did not intend to go into the par lor that evening in the absence of young men to flirt with i am not sure but that she had an indistinct idea of flirting with her own father certainly she would have campaigned against the old gentleman had he been what mrs mcdoo dle thought he wasthe only man in the world julia said he shutting the door i think it is about time you quit having so much to do with young de lollipop this was the young ladys opportunity she had long been dying for a grievance               the wickedest woman give up augustus papa she cried yes daughter his habits are bad this was about the weakest argument that mr mcdoodle could have advanced and had he known as much about the female heart as he did about bar soap and pot and pearl ashes he would have been aware of it there is a romance about the young man who smokes some drinks a little and gambles a great deal peculiarly fascinating to the young lady whose heroes are fashioned after the paradoxical patterns of fascinating viciousness found in popular novels you are prejudiced papa she said some malicious person has been telling you lies about gus            no a friend of mine saw him out at fordham last week and he bet on the losing horse julia didnt like that it was bad enough to bet but on the losing horse dreadful however the parent being set against the thing custom made it imperative that the daughter should insist upon it though she at heart cared no more for the young man than she did for one of the chi nese mandarins that were nodding on the mantle shelf sweet are the uses of perversity to the feminine mind so she at once declared that he loved her and that she loved him dearly and she never never would give him up i should die papa she said nonsense id go into the tombstone business if girls died so easy returned the old gentle man upon which the fountains of the deep julia were broken up and she burst into tears sobbing that she nevnevnever would treat poor augustus so unununkindly and that if she diddiddidnt   marry him she never would marmarmarry any body but hes ruined girl said the stern parent be trayed by this unexpected depth of devotion into briining up his heaviest artillery sooner than he had intended whwhwhat  ruined asked julia open ing her eyes through the delugeletting her soul come to the windows of the ark as it were bustedsmashedgone to thunder replied the old gentleman irretrievably papa erie erie yes erietrievably mr mcdoodle with all his dickering had done nothing in diction aries that was what did it julia paused a moment a look of almost divine      in new york the wickedest woman resignation stole over her face i will never dis obey a parents wishes she said looking up through her tears  no i will always be obedient though my heart should break papa and she kissed her father filially on the left cheek certainly she lost no time in complying with her fathers wishesdutiful daughter tired as she was with the previous evenings excitement before she laid her head on her pillow that night she wrote a note to augustus de lollipop spelling beautiful this time with a little b in which she said that her papa disapproved of their intimacy and that as it made people talk it had better be discontinued though there really was nothing in it if he liked her more than sho had imagined he did she was really very sorry for it and now for the first time saw how imprudent she had been  she liked him very well as a friend but could never entertain any other feelings for him and even if she could would never marry against her fathers wishes her father would never be induced to give his consent under any circumstances owing to some things which had come to his knowledge c c c i rather think that was a settler she hadnt loved him and didnt and couldnt and wouldnt if she could if hedid not see his case was hopeless in the light of that letter i pity the young man moreover it was contrived that after all he should only have himself to reproach owing to some things c c c left a wide field for speculation on his part as to what he had done and he could roam through it at leisure what do you think was the effect of that letter on augustus what would it be on any young man  but i will not repeat the old story of a broken heart and a noble career blighted by the faithlessness and cruelty of woman   in new york      it is enough to say that he abandoned business went into politics made speeches at ward meetings and at last accounts was in danger of being run for congress contemplating this wreck and ruin am i not right in arraigning the young woman who wrought it for wickedness chapter  the end was not yet the young lady by no means intended to immolate herself on the altar of duty for nothing her parents were reminded nearly every hour of the day of the sacrifice she had made for them no request of hers could be denied all her extravagances must be gratified it was found necessary to bind up her lacerated affections with goods of cost and pearls of price her poor fluttering heart beat beneath a number of new bodices and her aching brows were bound by a band of jewels she had long aspired to but for which she had never dared ask moreover notwithstanding all that was done for the assuagement of her sorrows she still insisted on being a blasted being she read melancholy poetry in bed by gaslight to the injury of her eyes she went sadly about the house and looked re proachfully at papa when he asked if he should not send her another piece of mutton she got herself up in a sort of mitigated afflic tion style to the great worriment of finette on whom all the trouble fell she even put the ofla herty to her witsend by insisting on trying a hc wickedest womnw widows cap just to see how twould look but how ever deep her woe she never forgot to crimp her hair nor omitted to give a touch of bistre to her eyes this latter thing being more necessary now than ever she took to keeping a diary and writing verses bottling her tears in poesy that she and others might contemplate them at leisure more than this she insisted on having her poetry published and the paternal mcdoodle on his way down town each morning had to call at numerous newspaper establishments true to his instincts always finding his way into the businessoffices on handing his contributions across the counter he was somewhat surprised at the sum total demanded of him for insertion but on going over the lyrics after publication and multiplying the number of lines by the price per line he invariably found that the bill was correct julia on her part was delighted with the page on which she was published it was the most expen sive column in the paper her papa told her and tears nearly came to his eyes when he reflected how well that money and space could have been utilitized in setting forth the value and virtues ofhis best bar or intended for the toilet alone indeed he might have made his expenditure available had the idea occurred to him for the public after becoming familiar with julia i quote from her own statement of the situation sitting in her   jlone lone bower all through the sad sad day and weeping every hour for one far far away morning after morning in the personals of the herald began to speculate with some curiosity as to what the climax of this ingenious but expensive   in new york   ima ta  w r w  w i l r   if   dodge was to be they looked forward to see her sorrows alleviated by a hair lotion or something of the kind and had her papa been so minded he could have advertised on alternate days that the distressed julia would find relief in a package of mcdoodle  cos i best brown windsor or that a cake of that firms honeyscented was balm to the wounded breast it always seemed rather strange to me that no other shrewd dealer availed himself in some such way of julias sad measuresher motto for the moment was measures not men and she took up with lame onesbut none did if i remember rightly all were averse to her lyrics i think it very wicked to write and publish such verses even in advertising columns yet a great many young ladies as i am well aware write and publish worse ones occasionally even asking to be paid for them without thinking they do very wrong    jrfatty i do think that some genuine tribulation underlaid our young ladys sad habilimentsthe hatchment was not hung out altogether causelessly it was not however that she would see her augustus no more no more that she sorrowed but because there seemed a likelihood that she had taken her last look at old biggsat least in the character of a suitor since the ball when she flirted so outrageously with captain fitzfaddle he had not been near her and it was reported that he was actually going to marry clara tolderol who was awkward and didnt know how to  entertain company didnt know how to entertain company does any one realize the wilderness of barbarism which that implies to the feminine understanding that julia harbored any very deep affection for old biggs i do not for one moment believe but has there not been a new commandment pronounced by the stern voice of society to the repeal of about all the old ones viz thou shalt love thy nabob as thyself and is not this considered as specially binding on young ladies in any event she didnt want to see him marry clara who was her most intimate friend and so would enjoy a triumph over her to the full think of having to stand up as bridesmaid to a girl who had not half her attractions playing second iddle instead of first before a great and critical audience in grace church of course the general comment would be that in the long run behavior told better than good looks   and that the steadiest girls were sure to get the best husbandsmeaning men like old biggs the thing was too fearful to contemplate and she turned from it with a shudder and shiver of her white shoulders to scold the oflaherty for some thing in which she was nowise to blame thus it was that when papa mcdoodle came home one evening with a piece of news which was duly communicated to julia through that most legitimate channel mamma mcdoodle she bright eled up and the next morning put more color in her cheeks than she had been showing lately there were more strawherries and less cream about the same time she discarded her diary put her rhyming dictionary and various aids to english composition on back shelves and came out of the bower in which she had been chronically sitting for a month or two past she also laid aside the robes of mitigated affliction and attired herself in hues as gay and variegated as the autumns forests were then putting on the news which wrought all this change was simply that old biggs had formally requested per mission to present himself as a candidate for her virgin affectations that waxy but worthy gentleman indulged in no nonsense over the preliminaries there was julia with her youth and sympathies and paniers and like sweet incumbrances in one scale he simply proposed to throw himself into the other and if he could not pile in sufficient securities and collaterals to bring her down he expressed himself content to go up on julias mamma explaining the situation to her she said she would see about it now when a young lady says that you may consider a thing done seeing in such cases is doing as well as be lieving      t wickedest woman how the courtship sped i cannot narrate in de tail for i have no experience in that line of course mr biggs took the young lady to the opera and sent her diamonds and things his charming presentsif only combined with his agreeable absencewould doubtless have won the most obdurate female heart the wheeziness which we have already noticed must have interfered somewhat with the romanee of the affair and i scarce think the young lady could have requested him to breathe those words of love once more nor do i imagine he would have com plied with the request had it been madefor as has once before been hinted he had no breath to spare very certain am i that i should not like to have old biggs put his arm round my waist though i do know a number of persons of both sexes who would consent to be embraced by a cuttlefish for a consid eration thiiik of it one of the finest houses on the ave nue one of the best equipages ini the park serv ants without endoften without aim money galore youth and beauty all her own and the only in convenience a husbandhe apoplectic so it is little wonder that julia after a careful estimate of old biggs fivetwenties consented to take upon herself the bonds in the end augustus had less reason to complain than others she only jilted himshe marred biggs he worthy member of the chamber of commerce badly as he may have swindled soldiers outrageously as he may have adulterated tea sugar and coffee did not deserve the terrible but veiled retribution which you see standing by his side this last act of julias in my opinion was not the least wicked of her life and fairly establishes her right to stand on the titlepage of my little book for clearly enough she sold herselfand i do not   in new york         see that getting more for herself than she was worth betters the thing at all her holloweyed sisters those gerfalcons of the night who hawk themselves upon the street corners do no more than this yet society refuses to recognize themperhaps because they did not in the beginning drive better

by m doolady agent in the clerks office of the district court of the united states for the southern district of new york   re velations chapter i  the revelation  the war  the patriarch  the brig adiers  shoddee  the patriarch clothes his brigadiers  temple of high shoddee  the patriarchs little story  behold o    my patriots the mystery is revealed even unto babes and sucklings  in the reign of the patriarch horrid war filled the land with wailing even the fair land of jonathan  from morn till night and from night till morn there was no rest for the people for did not the voice of the patriarch continually cry raze it raze it theres nobody hurt theres nobody hurt   so the brigadiers went up and down the land seeking whom they might devour  in that nevertobeforgotten reign there arose in the city of the gothamites many who were possessed of a devil the word devil means niggero in the originad who were denominated         revelations in the census of the mighty city ripuplicanas which signifies the followers of beelzebub alias shoddee  and they were not like other men for they believed black was white only a little more so  but they cried unto the patriarch and the patriarch was their friend  now as the patriarch grew plucky he summoned his brave brigadiers and answered unto them and said behold my valiant cocks your seedy toggery your shocking bad ats your hungry soles i even i the patriarch will cover your nakedness ye shall stand adorned with the blue of the skies and stars shall bedeck your shoulders  whenl the patriarch had dried up the assembled throng gave him a tigahah and went their way rejoicing  then there was naught heard throughout the land save the noise of the shearers as they sheared their sheep and the buzz of the wheels within wheels of the mighty works until the martial hosts the patriarch had summoned were equipped as their worshipful lord had com mlanded   so when all this was accomplished tle ripuplicanas the followers of beelzebub alias   revelations         shoddee were full of glee and gold for did not they sheda the sheep  and did not they move the wheels and werey not they the priests of the new order of shoddee and theirs the blood of the prophets  then did the ripuplicanas followers of beelzebub alias shoddee wax fat and saucy and they said one to another let us up and build us an altar even in the place of our high shoddee called fifthavynew there let us build it and place upon it the figure of our god even a molten niggero and fall down and worship it in the sight of all the people for we shall thereby find favor with our father the patriarch  so they straightway went and did accord ing to their counsel and behold an altar of brown stone richly carlved and above it the figure of the idol of the great shoddee which may be seen there even at this day  and the noise of their rejoicing reached the ears of the patriarch and he was exceeding glad and unto his chiefpriest and scribe he answered and said that reminds me of a little story thereupon he related the following narrative in the days of the lawgiver certain of the people forgetting that it was because of their observance of the compact they had been brought in safety out of the land of egypt did        revelations with malice prepense gather themselves together unto abraham and said be thou our ruler and abraham  saw it and did as they desired then did the spirit of the lawgiver cry the people have corrupted themselves but abra ham  answered and said the compact is played out i have put my foot down and when i raise it again it will be felt in the seat of war   here the laugh of the patriarchs chief priest and scribe came in upon which the cab inet of the patriarch was adjourned  behold o my patriots the end of the first chapter chapter ii  the wail  webfoot  morgahno  the gourd story  the brigadiers down on webfoot they desire a seafaring man  the cottonade  loyalty  after thes e things there came a wail from the great deep for mighty was the damage the foe had done thereon  then the patriarch clapped his hands and summoned unto his presence his seacretary called webfoot and answered unto him and said buy ia          revelations         me ships wherewith i may float my brigadiers to the battlefield to crush the cottonade  and when the patriarch had ended his speech his seacretary webfoot clapped his hands and summoned unto his presence his faithful morgahno whose name was great on change and answered unto him and said buy me ships wherewith i may or may not float my brave brigadiers to the battlefield to crush the cottonade  so his faithful morgahno did as he was com manded and the wail returned to the deep and many were the ships that the faithful morgahno bought so that soon did he jostle the crowd of devotees at the altar of high shoddee and great was the stir in their midst as he counted out his goldoffering  then did the seacretary webfoot go straight way into the presence of the patriarch and unto his majesty did say look out o patriarch upon the deep and tell me what thou seest and the patriarch rose up and gazed upon the face of the waters until a mighty storm arose and floated his brave brigadiers from his sight  and the patriarch cried with a loud voice unto his chief priest and scribe o seaword cover me with a gourd   then unto his seacretary webfoot he an     revelatios  swered and said that reminds me of a story there was a certain man named jonah who cried unto the people saying let them turn every one from his evil way and from the violence that is in their hands they turned and jonah was angry hence the gourd story  now my webfoot which of us resembles jonah the most  echo answered who  so when the ripuplicanas followers of beelzebub alias shoddee heard of all the gleat things that had been done upon the sea they were filled with rejoicing and said who so great as the patriarch and webfoot is his prophet  but the brave brigadiers were down on webfoot and his faithful morgahno and they prayed the patriarch to grant them  another seacretary even a seafaring man  moreoveir notwithstanding nevertheless the patriarch disturbed not his cabinet furni ture and he did continue to declare to the people the wisdom and greatness of his seacre tary webfoot  then did it come to pass that the ripupli canas followers of beelzebub alias slloddee see ing the mind of the patriarch did take and load many ships with merchllandise and sail thlem to     revelatons o the cottonade and there barter the merchan dise for the treasure of niggero and return with their vessels heavy laden to bow    the knee anew at the shrine of the great shoddee  and thus did the ripuplicanas followers of beelzebub alias shoddee testify their loyalty to the land of their fathers  and continually did they cry unto the patriarch and the patriarch was their friend  belhold o  my patriots the end of the second chapter chapter    iii  the war  the needy brigadiers  the

of their murmurings  the remedy  achancammerone goeth abroad  a great feast   and   the war was grievous in the land  and   it came to pass that there was sore need among the hosts of the patriarch so that the brave brigadiers cried aloud unto the pa tiarch  o   most lengthy  potentate  didst thou not command    the heavens to clothe us and the t       beveations           stars to glitter on us   alas alas  no sooner was thy command obeyed than our toggery van ished like the baseless fabric of a vision leaving no rag behind be merciful unto thy servants even as scotchplaidy was merciful unto thee  and the spirit of the patriarch was stirred within him he arose and viewed his brave brigadiersand wept  then with a loud voice he cried unto them  this reminds me of a little story  there was ascertain king who had an hon est minister  one day the spirit moved the king to com mand his minister to tell his mind concerning him  whereupon the minister fell upon his face and said o     thou mighty one thy servant must speak the words of truth and soberness thou art weighed inthe balances and found wanting  thy kingdom is divided  and when the patriarch had made an end of speaking the multitude shouted long live the patriarch our great potentate   and every man went his way  and the patriarch entered into the palace of the  whiteman even into the innermost chamber   there  did the patriarch remain  fasting   revelations        many days and nights until the shadow of the patriarch had nearly disappeared  then summoned he unto him his familiar yclept achancammerone surnamed bellicose  and thus did he discourse  i pray thee tell me my familiar why all this disquiet among my brave brigadiers   why do they rage and imagine a vain thing a  whereupon achancammerone bhe patri alrchs familiar surnamed bellicose answered hillm and said  it becometh not thy servant  thou wisest of mortals to show thee what thou already seest  rather let me be numbered with those who have merited thy displeasure  but o patriarch i make me bold to say thy brave brigadiers imagine not a vain thing they rage but there is method in their ra ging  the patriarch bade his familiar speak on  now know most elevated one that the children of this world are wise in their genera tion  therefore do i declare unto thee my whole counsel  the patriarch bade his familiar speak on  give thou o dispenser of patronage i       revelations unto these men to plume themselves witlh the spoils as becometh the victors to do bid them feather their nests with the fat things which are the pride of the foe say unto them gather the gold and precious stones and bedeck ye yourselves and your wives your children and servants and clothe ye your households in fine linen even in the royal purple  speak thus unto them o thou most honest ruler and as thy servant liveth thou shalt no more be vexed  and the patriarch saidnary a word  however there was great spoil taken of gold and silver and precious stones linen and royal purple and great was the prey that was taken both of man and of beast  and great was the rejoicing of the people and gayly did the brave brigadieris drive their fast horses in the broad ways before the temple of high shoddee   but certain ofthe scribes and pharisees who dwelt in the city of the temple of iligh shoddee murmured against the patriarchs familiar achancamnmerone surnamed bellicose  and the noise of their murmurings reached the ears of the patriarch  so it came to pass that the patriarch hid himself as before in his most secret chamber  h                 v   bevelations         and after much fasting he clapped his hands and summoned again unto him  achancammerone his familiar surnamed bellicose    and thus did he discourse  i pray thee my familiarl tell me why the moneychangers quarrel in the place of high shoddee   why do the scribes write bitter things against their ruler   why do the pharisees put on airs  and the patriarchs familiar answered him and said  behold o sagacious sage as thyservant liveth i will speak the truth  the patriarch  bade his familiar speak o  do thou o  warrior of the whitehouse bid them gather weapons of war for thy brave brigadiers  do  thou bid them lay up ofthe treasure which thou controllest  do  thou create new posts of honor for them which shall fill them to repletion with the great mammon  and as thy servant liveth they shall no longer vex thee o most amiable sovereign  alid the patriarch wasmum        revelations  then there arose a great shout in the palace of high shoddee  and the scribes sang the praises of the patriarch throughout the length and breadth of the land  the pharisees forgot the samaritans in their glee  and all the people united in the shout long live the patriarch and achancammerone his propet  so the fame of achancammerone spread abroad and he was known far and near  thereupon the patriarch bethought him to send his familiar achancammerone surnamed bellicose to foreign lands that the name and fame of the patriarch might be known through out the earth   for the patriarch was ambitious  so the patriarch sent his familiar to a far distant country to tell the heathen of thee great patriarch who ruled the western hemi sphere  and the patriarch saw what he had done and was satisfied  but his familiar achancammerone sur named bellicose saidnary a word  then there was a great feast in the place of the high shoddee and the air rang with tilhe     rvelations     shouts of the multitude and the great idol niggero glittered and glistened in the sun  for the scribes and pharisees were as an army with banners  and the people cried unto the patriarch and the patriarch was their friend  behold o my patriots the end of the third chapter e  chapter iv i horace

skilled in metallurgy and astrology and daily did he study the one and nightly did he delight in the other  so it came to pass one night as he sat gazing at the stars that a lucky thought struck him

patriarchs latest joke   i  now it came to pass that certain leaders of the brave brigadiers who had buckled on their armor at the eleventh   hour because of the tidings of the great spoil their brethren had taken from the foe did beseech the patriarchs to declare unto the people the statute known as con fiscation                                        revelations   for said they if thou doest but  this o most illustrious ruler thy brave brigadiers shall be as the sands of the sea for multitude and we most noble patriarch will lead them on to victory  and in an evil hour the patriarch raised his foot  so the brave brigadiers returned to the war and they were led in the way of the cot tonade by him whom the patriarch called boo tyler   and in the way of the niggero by him whom the patriarch called bearfremount  and great was the wailing of the women and children at the cottonade  and the spoil of bootyler was more than the ships of the patriarch could transport  and hisdeeds if they should be all written i suppose that even the temple of high shoddee itself could not contain the books that should be written  but bearfremount looked not alone to spoil for was he not lord of mariposa  therefore did he seek occasion to gain the favor of the false god niggero that he might betray the patriarch into the hands of the philistines so he bade his heralds declare to the        reevelations people wheresoever he tarried the new dispen sation of whichh he was the sole originator and dispenser d  and he did establish his court and issue his decrees as though the patriarch had de ceased and was gatheredto his fathers  but a bird did carry the news to the house of the whiteman and to the ear of the patriarch and he  became exceeding wroth even foaming at the mouth in his great indigna tion   for the patriarch read the thought that was in the breast of bearfremount as though bearfremnount had said oh that i were made judge in the land that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me and i would do him justice  so the patriarch dispatched his messen  gers to bid bearfremount to come unto him  but sorely vexed were the patriarchs messengers  yet did they persevere until by wonder ful strategy they placed the patriarchs command before the dread bearfremount   then did the tidings of their success thrill the heart of the patriarch like as it were the tidings of a glreat victory  so when bearfiremount was come unto       v ations          tn  the house of the  whiteman the patriarch ushed forth and fell upon  his neck and em raced him saying never

the ear of the patriarch and  he said unto the contentious ones quarrel ye concerning the captives even e face of the foe          evelationts   and they answered him and said it is for the good of the captives we dothis thing  but the patriarch read their thoughts afar  therefore did he declare unto the people a  in which aused new statute called emancipation which caused all such spoil to fall to the share of the patriarch  for behold my people said the patriarch i will takle possession of the fairest lands of the foe and i will cause these my captives to till the soil thereof and great shall be the gain to the patrirth   arch was well pleased with emancipation o then said the patriarch to the assembled  then said th multitude that reminds me of a storyl  a certain man named abram went up out of egypit he and his wife and all that he had and lot with him into the south  and abram was very rich in cattle in silver and in gold  and he went on his journeys from the south even to bethel unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning between bethe  unto the place of the altar which he ha made there at the first and there abram calle on the name of the lord   re v ei jation       and lot also which went with abram had flocks and herds and tents  and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together for their sub stance was great so that they could not dwell together  and there was a strife between the herd men of abrams cattle and the herdmen of lots cattle and the canaanite and the perizzite dwelt then in the land  and abram said unto lot let there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee and between my herdmen and thy herdmen for we be brethren  is not the whole land before thee sepa rate thyself i pray thee from me if thou wilt take the left hand then i will go to the right or if thou depart to the right hand then i will go to the left  and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plains of jordan that it was well watered everywhere before the lord destroyed sodom antd gomoirah even as the garden of the lord like the land of egypt as thou comest unto zoar  then lot chose him all the plain of jordan and lot journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the other  and when the patriarch had made an end                v         revelations of speaking the assembled multitude sent up a shout in praise of the patriarch for the patriarch was their friend  and horacethe grilleyte and henry the raymite wrere among the multitude and they remembered the patriarchs stolry  behold o my patriots the end of the sev enth chapter opap  er vii  the wax  the patriarchs speech  and there was a jpause  the onlyspeaker left  yet did the war desolate the land and the prophets saw no signs of peace  so the patriarch summoned all the wise  len of the land to the house of the whiteman that they might take counsel together concerning the war  and when they were assembled in the presence of the patriarch he spoke unto them saying   ye men of the fairyland of jonathan i ap pear before you on this august occasion that i may see you and be seen by you although i summoned you hither it was but for this great purposeto see and be seen   s rkvkiatrtons       and that i might call your attention in particular and public manner to the only clause of the compact that i decreed should be per mitted to stand  o ye men of the fair land of jonathan have you forgotten that these immortal words were the first your patriarch uttered in your ears  have you forgotten how often your patri arch has since their first utterance repeated them to you   and now i again say that the great privilege you enjoy as my subjects and the only one left you from the compact isto see and be een sensation  oh that you would live up to the spirit of these words    i  if you would but seeand be seen there would be an end to war  if you would but see and be seen i could bid adieu to my bodyguard  if you would but see and be seen i could remain your patriarch and live and die seeing and being seen  but ye are a stiffnecked and perverse people therefore have i caused a new statute to be promulgated to be called the expatria

the wise men depart in silence  and no one durst speak thr to be loyal ie must only see and be seen  and it came to pass that silence brooded ver the once fair land of jonathan and there vas no sound heard throughout the length and readth thereof save the clicking of the instru nents called telegraphs which carried the atriarchs immortal proclamationee and be eenfrom pole to pole  in the place of

book and      i a loud voice did he utter  the words of wise men are heard in quiet    a  i        re e lations more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools  the patriarch turned on  there is an evil which i have seen under the sun as an error which proceedeth from the ruler    the patriarch closed that book and opened another  christianity quite annihilates the disposi tion for martial glory   to sacrifice our lives for the liberties and laws and religion of our native land are undoubtedly highsounding wordsbut who are they that will do it who is it that will sacrifice his life for his dountry will the sen ator who supports a war will the writer who declaims upon patriotism will the minister of religion who recommends the sacrifice take away glorytake away war and there is not a man of them who will do it  the patriarch threw that book down in disgust and opened another  you would perhaps die to save your country but this is not the question a sol diers death does not save his country the question is whether without any of the circum stances of war without any of its glory or its pomp you are willing to resign yourself to the   revelations        executioner if you are not you are not willing to die for your country  the patriarch mused a moment then turned on  christianity does not encourage particular patriotism in opposition to general benignity  as long as mankind shall continue to bestow more liberal applause on their destroyers than on their benefactors the thirst of military glory will be the vice of the most exalted char acters  the safety of nationiis not to be sought in arts or in arms war reverses with respect to its objects all the rules of morality it is nothing less than a temporary repeal of all the principles of virtue it is a system out of which almost all the virtues are excluded and in which nearly all the vices are incorporated in instructing us to consider a portion of our fellowcreatures as the proper objects of enmity it removes as far as they are concerned the basis of all society of all civilization and virtue for the basis of these is the good will due to every individual of the species  the patriarch shook his head and turned on  there is but one community of chris tians in the world and that unhappily of all communities one of the smallest enlightened        reevjilations enough to understand the prohibition of war by our divine master in its plain literal and undeniable sense and conscientious enough to obey it subduing the very instinct of nature to obedience  the patriarch grew red in the face slung the book behind wim and opened another  they who defend war must defend the dispositions which lead to war  the patriarch adjusted his spectacles read the passage again andturned on  i am persuaded that when the spirit of christianity shall exert its proper influence over the minds of individuals and especially over the minds of public men in their public capaci ties over the minds of men constituting the councils of princes from whence are the issues of peace and warwhen this happy period shall arrive war will cease throughout the whole christian world   morality and religion forbid war in its motives conduct and consequences  the patriarchs countenance assumed a grave cast he laid the book carefully down and took up another  be at peace among yourselves see that none render evil for evil to any man god hath called us to peace     r evelations         avenge not yourselves if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink recompense to no man evil for evil overcome evil with good  it has been said thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment but i say whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in dangerbof the judgment  the patriarch was disturbed  all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword  the patriarch could read no farther but fell back upon his couch in a deep and painful revery  for a long time he remained silent  then he arose and paced the chamber with a firm step and an air of resolution  and thus did he soliloquize  if these things that i have read be true if it be true that there is a new commandment which is to be obeyed instead of an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth then i must at last adopt apolicy what shall it be        at that moment the patriarchs eye fell upon a page of the book as it lay open before him and read these words  the preacher sought to find out accept  ss       rvvilations able words and that which was written was upright even words of truth  ah happy thought the patriarch cried i have found a policy  and thus did he reason within himself  are not my preachers called to declare the things i this day have read is it not their mission to proclaim peace on earth and good will to men  is it not their duty to fell the people of the  new commandment   this very day the patriarch continued will i publish my policy and it shall be known in the land

the length and breadth of the land to the palace of the whiteman                    and when the people had assembled them selves before the patriarch thus did he address them  ye men of the western hemisphere give ear unto your patriarch  your patriarch is well pleased with your obedience to his mandatesee and be seen  he is well pleased with your obedience to it that he has directed this mandate to con tinue in force until the end of the war ap plause  your patriarch summoned you here today in order that he might say this to you and that he might see you and be seen by you on this glorious occasion  he has also something new to make known unto youhe has a policy sensation  this policy is called the conscription breathless silence  the patriarch thus understands this poli cy the brave brigadiers are to be called back from the cottonade and their places are to be supplied from the ranks of the clergy  thus will the patriarch place his preachers where they may give practical effect to their teachings and to their labors does the patri arch look for the return of blessedpeace  the patriarch here became too much af          o        evelations fected to prolongi his rematks and the multitude returned to their iespective abodes  and there was great rejoicing among the people because the preachers were chosento go against their enemies for said every man are they not called to proclaim  the glad tidings of salvation and to publish peace  blessed peacemakers  they shall deliver our unhappy land from the scourge of the sword  then did all the people speak one with an other of the great things the preachers should do  and greatly did they magnify the wis dom of the patriarch saying behold a wiser than solomon  but the preachers weremum  and the patriarch caused the preachers to be gathered together according to the con scription  and when they were assembled without the camp the patriarch with his bodyguard and the chiefs among his brave brigadiers went forth to meetthem  and when the patriarch drew near every man of themwas debating with his fellow touch ing the war and great was the confusion of their tongues for as yet they had no leader so itcamo to pass that when the patti   evelations        arch saw they had no leader he waxed exceed ing wroth  and the patriarch said unto them where is he who did so loudly proclaim the gospel of sharps rifles he even the beecherite shall lead you  but the beecherite could not be found for aforetime had he taken counsel with himself and said  i will get me to the far distant angle land and there will i tarry till this cruel war is over  and the patriarch said unto them where is he who calleth niggero his better he even the cheeverite shall lead you  but the cheeverite could not be found for he had fled for safety to the temple of the woollyheads  and the patriarch said unto them where is philip the amalgamator he shall lead you  and some answered him and said be hold o patriarch we have sent messengers unto philip the amalgamator to bid him be  one with us but he hath replied your banner is not my banner therefore will i not go  and other spme answered him and said we pray thee o patriarch to be charitable unto philip the amalgamator for perchance he nary have taken him a wife from among the        revelations daughters of niggero and therefore he cannot come  then did the patriarch again address them saying tell me which one from among you shall be your leader  and the assembled preachers as with the vice of one man each for himself did cry i will be the leader  and the patriarch saw what was in their mind and he was satisfied  so he commanded them to go forth upon their mission taking naught with them but their great commission  and the end was not yet come the

street   introduction the great interest and anxiety manifested in the public mind concerning this unfortunate adventure has induced me to write the following narrative no one so well as the author could conceive the feelings and conduct of two fellowbeings placed in the perilous con dition and amid the surroundings of the few hours of desolation experienced while passing over a bound less waste of water tle scene most assuredly presented a gloomy aspect for a portion of the time especially in that mournfull hour of twilight in which they hovered over the schooner guide when their ballast had evi dently been exhausted to all reckless aeronauts who run their cloudscrap ing coaches with a disregard for consequences or who in other words essay to fly without making due calcu lations and preparations to alight this little narrative is dedicated never jump before you know  where youre going to land  the fate of donaldson and grimwood it was a glorious day in july when i was making preparations for a balloon voyage it was on the th day of that hot month in the year  and while my contemplations were running upon more pleasant tlings than ballooning with all my heart and earnest devotion to the art volante that i felt a misgiving as by some mysterious providence disturbing my thoughts during the time i was engaged in getting my balloontraps ready for an evening sail from chicago over lake michigan as i was turning over and over the dilapi dated folds of my tattered old cloudcoach it seemed to me i should never get done finding defects in the envel ope an indescribable internal tremor pervaded my whole nervous system and i involuntarily let the balloon drop from my hands i became possessed of a feeling that i must get my journal and note therein my thoughts and feelings during the few hours of the early morning occupied in preparing for the aerial voyage to come off in the evening when i sat down in my chamber to write my eyes wandered over the sheet of water spread out before me the sight caused a sludder and as by a stroke of    fate of donaldson and grimwood apoplexy my mind suddenly became obscure and con fused with just sufficient reasoning power to dream as it were upon the duties that lay before me i heard a continuallyrepeated sound saying shall i do this thing this perplexed me sorely now while i was not affected much with superstition i nev ertheless took the premonition as no augury of good i was afraid of making known my feelings even to my nearest companions and this only served to enhance the perturbation of my mind shall i do this thing was all the time ringing in my ears all of a sudden i shouted out in a loud voice yes i will do this thing and why should i not do iti remarked in a more sober mood casting my eyes slowly over the glassy sheet of water it occurred to me that i was about entering upon a duty that was not very promising of a successful result that tattered balloon was rather a leaky vessel with which to cross chicago lake that is so wash a something whispered in my ear now what is to be done in this emergency to go or not to go thats the rub if i go i shall be called a fool if i dont go i shall be called a coward i finally concluded that it was better to be a dead lion than a living ass but then life is sweet even to a jack and mores the pity that a man must at times play the donkey but may i not be able to play out this piece of tom foolery witl the lionskin over my shoulders and pos sibly come out in the end heroically life is sweet and if i must perish in the illdevised adventure i will not be alone if my companions who are really as innocent as children of the real danger in the matter   fate of donaldson and grimwood      persist in going it will never do for me to tell them there is death in the pot thus i reasoned the mat ter over in my own mind besides i had determined long ago that i would stand at the head of my pro fession come what might one hundred and fifty miles of water shall never make me so fainthearted as to back out of a balloon voyage no no i vill never show the white feather in this business besides i am employed to do the job as i lad done it before even on the ragged edge of despair to be sure it is only a mountebank speculation that i am working for but then the tiling is popular and all the world and its neighbor run to see the congress of nations and barnums balloon with washington h donaldson as the main figurehead of the greatest spectacle that barnum has yet concocted from his fertile brain of shows i will go i shall have company and misery ever loves company the die is cast go i will but can i not arrange matters so as to make a tolerably good margin for a probable safe outcome  yes i will take only one of the three candidates that will secure me more ballast and then if i rise up into the eastern current i can cross the lake in two or three hours and the old ragbag ought to float that long i summoned my companions to a consultation and informed them that i could take but one this caused a general murmur i said gentlemen dont grumble draw lots who is toi almost said involuntarilydie but quickly swallowed the word and said go lit tle did those innocent reporters know the thoughts that were running through my brain    fate of donaldson and grimwood while the inflation of the balloon was going on i be gan to think more seriously of the perils that seemed to present themselves on every side the wind is a fickle element and even thea ret eastern current is at times to be found only at an altitude to wvhich my balloon could not aspire until considerable loss of gas by overflow would render it unfit for a long sail since there would be no more ballast remaining or at least not sufficient to compensate for leakage of gas to which the balloon was inevitably subjected  while these things were perplexing me sorely it came into my mind that it would have been better for me had i attempted the sensation trick of telegraphing to the hippodrome managers at philadelphia that i had fallen out of my balloon car in new jersey and was killed had the story been true in that case i should have passed from time to eternity as an aeronautic hero of great renown and with the glory and reputation that i had gained in my aerial voyages in philadelphia at the expense of one of the most favorable seasons for aero nautical success that i ever experienced let it be re membered that when tlnh aeronaut meets these favorable conditions of atmosphere the generousmiided public attributes his success to his superior skill and on the other hand when the atmosphere is adverse to success fill airsailing the ungenerousminded public attributes his misfortunes to ignorance of the art and to a blun dering way of managing its performances and so with the case before me if fortune favors all will be wll but if it frowns fool will i be called and fool surely will i be but the time for temporizing and halting was passing   fate of donaldson and grimwood    fate of donaldson and grimwood away and my wellintentioned partner mr grimwood was growing eager for the fray he had drawn the deathwarrant in the lot of the three candidates and while i was strongly minded so to tell him i did not dare to do so for fear of betraying cowardice the balloon had now become inflated to its fullest ca pacity and fretting and chafing to plunge into the air above only sooner or later to dive into the water below was waiting for the sacrifice of its victims it bounded and rebounded puffing out its great swollen sides with spasmodic efforts to get away determined to give us no time for firther considering the perils that must soon environ us onward and upward it was straining with angry surges ten thousand excited faces were watch ing my every movement perhaps not one of them sus pecting the agony of mind that was torturing me all this time it was only the more painful to me that my unconscious companion was taking things in such a cheerful manner and looking upon the matter as a holiday excursion the aerial monster being now harnessed to its car and ready for a start it was cut loose from its trammels and soon we passed over the sea of faces turned upward with expressive misgivings as to our fate i had often been excited in my feats of ropewalking but never before did i feel my heart sinking into sych despondency as it did when the aerial ship loomed up and out over the lake it was a dreary sight over the esert of water i quickly turned my face to the land as my thoughts reverted to the one on earth most dear to me shall i ever see that loving atnd beloved face againi will   fate of donaldson and grimwood     fate of donaldson and gumwood come back my dear were the last words i spoke to her as we parted yes i know you will come back was her response and she sealed it with a parting kiss oh that i had only formed the resolution and said no i will not go out to sea in a leaky boat i felt the life oozing from my finger ends as the ragged airship was exhaling its precious gas through the cracks and fissures that time and hard usage had carved in the thin muslin fabric all this was still unknown to my friend and companion grimwood he remarked however a few monents be fore we started that i seemed to berather moody and preoccupied for so interesting a display of which we were the figureheads under more favorable circumstances i could well have partaken of his cheerful humor as he exclaimed now we are sailing over the vasty deep as the old leaking gasbubble was sluggishy cleaving its way into the heavens above while he was running his nimble pencil over the leaves of his memorandumbook lhe exclaimed now we are monarchs of all we sur vey yes i replied  but the survey is a monarchy poorer than the swamplands sold by the government at a shilling an acre  besides our reign may be of short duration what is the matter donaldson any thing wrongi could no longer keep up appearances and would fain tell my companion the worst of the situation but my tongue stuck fast in my mouth wrong at length burst from my lips wrong did you say grimwood again i dssayed to let out the whole truth but again my pride held me back from an expression of apprehension that might in the end sub   fate of donaldson and grim wood     ject me to the insinuation that i showed a faint heart while in a critical situation i who had thus far won the reputation of having un daunted lbravery and of being one of the most skillful aeronauts livingi who annonnced to the world that i would sail across the atlantic ocean with a balloon and who now quailed before the danger of a freshwater fishpond a span of a hundred milesi could not bear to say to grim vood it looks ratler blue as regards our safety by a kind of instinctive arithmetic i could still figure out another hours sail and a reach of dry land again grimwood hailed me from the car below while i was sitting in my perch il the lookout above busily engaged writing out my experience that i had more than an hour ago resolved to transmit to the wavxcsbelow so that i might leave a memoir of my last voyage in the event of a fatal termination griniwood now inquired of ime how fr are we fioin the michigan shore and he addedl our ballast is nearly spun out  god only knows was my reply balloonsailing has in it the peculiarity of keeping one entirely unconscious of the speed the balloon is making or the direction in which it is moving when you are among the clouds and the clouds are sailing with you and at the same time nothing but a monot onous waste of water is underneath it is singular that so limited a sheet of water as lake michigan should present to view so few vessels to the eye of the aeronaut well it is about  miles long and  miles broad anll this gives us an area of  square liles now    fate of donaldson and grimwood if  sailingvessels were spread over the lake at any one time it would present on an average only one vessel for every  square miles or in other words one vessel on every plot of  miles square professor wise told me that in his sail down tile middle of lake erie from one end tothe other he did not see half a dozen vessels and in crossing  miles of lake ontario only one vessel was intercepted i fully realized this fact in my own experience over the lakes and the sparseness of seacraft visible below gave the situation an intensified dreary aspect i now turned my face to grimwood and requested him to look out for some lakecraft since we could not expect to remain afloat much longer as the ballast was so nearly exhausted wont the balloon hold out all night said my companion you frequently let your balloon stand out all night and reascend with it the next morning hopefully ejaculated my cheerful partner yes was the response that is when the balloon is new and in perfect order but remember this is a leaky old tub you dont pretend to intimate that we are going to be soused into the lake for want of the balloon holding out to reach the land why certainly i said if we dont discover land very shortly we shall be compelled to take to the water and trust to providence donald sol aint you joking said grimwood no was my reply then if i fallfall through these cloudsi may exclaim with the poet how wretched is that poor mall that hangs on aerial favors   when he falls he falls like lucifer never to rise again  i now resolved at all hazards to state the situation   fate of donaldson and griiwood      fairly to grimwood as certain destruction seemed to be staring me in the face and tell him to prepare for a doom that had foreshadowed itself to my mind all day long i had been sailing under false colors long enough it only made my anguish of mind greater as i pretended to assume composure and thought that i had taken along with me a gentleman of culture and talents to be lost to the world and for the simple benefit of a show spectacle that had so little real merit in it as to be com pelled to hang its financial success on the miserable at traction of acrobatic ballooning and thus through me to commit a moral homicide my heart was throbbing with emotion as i contemplated the whole situation perhaps grimwood will grow desperate if i let out the whole truth he may become revengeful and grapple with me for the decision as to who is to take the last chance for life for what twill a man not do to savre his own life one or the other of us must in a very short time leave the balloon or both of us perish together in the angry waves how shall i arrange this matter now better one should be spared if possible than that both should per ish and in the event of my history submitted to the  waves never drifting to shore no tidings of our voyage or its consequences ever be learned it is solemn to think of making ones exit in that wayto go to that unknown world from whose bourne no traveler returns i had now fully resolved to be a man in every sense of the word and give grimwood the little remaining time for a last autobiographical sketch in the event of his going overboard mine being to the present extent    fate of donaldson and grimwood ready for a doubtful transmnission in the like contii gency grimwood are you prepared to hear the worst of our situation i am always ready for an item donaldson good or bad high or low up or down pitch in donaldson and give us the news this goodtempered response rallied my drooping spirits again and i began to hope against hope i strained my eyes to the east and the west and the north and the south in tie llhope of espying something that should promlise a ro k of safety for two wandering spirits of the air really i began to feel more likea dreaming spirit than a ping irantl grimwood was all this time writing down rldldly olur words and the scenes around us seemingly reliant on a safe inding to the perilous voyage ships seem to be as scarce as land donaldson he muttered but we have lifepreservers and if it must come to that we will battle for lifb in the waves i now proposed to hm inasmuch as our time was wellnigh spent that we draw lots for the chance of one of us remaining with the balloon while the other should take to the water with a lifepreserver so that we should be prepared for the emergency when our ballast should come entirely to an end i am agreed was the ready reply of grimwood prepare the drafts and as i was never lucky enough to draw a prize in a lottery i am sure to draw one in this either of wind or water besides said lie the prize may be a ship so let us hold up to the last grain of sand in the hope of intercepting a craft below and   fate of donaldson and grimwood     in the event of falling in with one we will pounce down upon it like a hawk upon a sparrow full of life to the bitter end was my jocular compan ion and now i began to feel that it was better to take things in a good humor since destiny shapes our course rough hew it as we may if we are born to be drowned we shall never be hanged though hanging like bob tails to a kite at the present moment i prepared a dozen sticks of matches i had in my pocket all of different lengths and handed them to grimwood to dispose of the game as he desired he said never mind donaldson keep them in your own hands i will draw one you another and he who draws the longest shall have the choice and i do not care much about the choice because it is a hobson to me at best since i would be as badly off in the crazy old balloon without ballast without experience and without know ledge in the art of airsailing as i shall be in the water with a lifepreserver if the choice falls to me i will  sell out cheap anyhow should providence send a vessel in sight atld near us in that event i would sooner take to the water lot than the air plot as he reached out his hand to draw his lot he re marked your liand trembles  and so it dida thing that seldom occurred to me never mind donaldson all is nolt lost that is in danger and if lost we must be i have prepared a bot tle that will hatnd us down to posterity as is handed lown the history of two other equally foolish fellows named icarus and daedaluswho went outon a similar expedition and were doused in the zegean sea if i    fate of donaldson and grimwood mistake not they belonged to the grecian hippodrome run by aip old stager named jason who was as great an old humbug as our noted showman barnutm grimwood you are ahead of me in that as i never studied the classics beyond gymnastics of the ring such as they performed in the old amphitheatres of greece where they played leapfrog and the like and before long we may have to try our luck in some aquatic gym nastics of the same sort but since you are in sucle good humor i will sing with you  never die and abide peacefully by the result though we should both sing like the dying swan the sun was now going down behind the cloudbank of a goldenfringed horizon all nature was still as death i imagined that the gold and purplecolored drapery that appeared to curtain the chamber behind it represented the mausoleum of our approaching resthig place grimwood sat motionless in the car his hand resting on his notebook his coluntenance indicative of deep thought his face fixed as that of a statue for the first time he seemed to realize the solemnity of the occasion he refused to measure lots with me he said in a very serious mood donaldson it is all for the best i am ready god be with us and his chin sank slowly upon his breast the scene unnerved me i turned my eyes once more to the setting sun and there i saw de licted in the cloud formation an old man with a sickle inhis hand oh what a solemn scene was before me i was ready to sink down with grief for now were flitting through mly mind the scenes of my childhoodthe happy days of    fate of donaldson and grimwood youththe pangs of despised love thoughts of the two little offsprings of my own flesh and blood of the one whom i had won and to whom i was betrothed all these and a thousand other things were flitting through my brain i never before felt such a horror over an approaching calamity no one can imagine what a desolate wilder ness it seems to be where you can see nothing but water underneath you and that surging and foaming as it were with internal convulsions to be hemmed in with such faint prospects of escape and to be fixed as it were in the middle of creation pinned fast in the ethereal vault as if some invisible power was holding you there ready to drop you at any moment down down into the seething yawning gulf of water there to drown and then to become food for fish and all that without the solace of an attendant and friend almost drove me to desperation and made me think it would be better for me to die first and let my deluded companion have the last thread of safety that was available under the circum stances oh what a calamity a man can bring upon himself we had now sunk low enough to hear the dreadful mur muring of the troubled waters it was the aeronauts dead march i thought again i rallied my spirits as grimwood sang out here it comes what comes friend grimwood a sail a craft cheer up don aldson with trembling fingers and doubting muscle i pulled the valve down down we came we plunged car deep into the water not a moment was to be lost night was cloaking its sable mantle around us grimwood thrust his lifepreserver over his shoulders    fate of donaldson and grimwood threw his sealed bottle overboard and plunged into the lake never looking whether he had drawn long or short in the lot but alas the vessel had vanished from our sight in another moment the car was slowly emerging from the ruffled water and lazily the old leaky hulk was lifting itself up in the sombre twilight i now looked over the car into the water and there i beheld grim wood buffeting the waves that were tossing him up and down i shouted out goodbye grimwood god bless you and he must have heard me for he raised his hand above his head and swung it around in recognition of my call i felt likejumping overboard and making an end of my troubles but my journal must be disposed of first i do not want to go to hades and leave no record behind i will continue to write until the last glealn of hope for sakes me and now as the balloon rises it is getting lighter so that i can again see to write i looked out again for my struggling companion but the shades of night had now so obscured the surface of the water that i could not see anything on its face poor grimwood as well as the vessel had vanished from my sight and i could see his manly form no more i will now finish my journal and submit myself to the waves that must sooner or later swallow me up unless some miraculous escape should await me i will of course not be able to chron icle the final result of this adventure should i be doomed to die here so i may as well close up this narrative seal it up in the waterproof cas and drop it overboard as i am sinking down fast now from gas leakage and the cooling atmosphere of the evening may god have mercy on my two bereft children and lead them through the storms of life safely and finally may it never be   fate of donaldson and grimwood     the lot of any aeronaut to undertake that which reason teaches him should not be undertaken although the crowd may clamor and the ignorant cry out coward since it iy better to have the approbation of one sensi ble person than the shouts and huzzas of the herd who ever applaud most when your feats promise selfimmo lation in the end i ask the world to deal charitably with me should my body be found give it decent burial and write for an epitaph here lies the body of a man whose reckless ambition
