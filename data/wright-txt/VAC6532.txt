The heavy swell of the vast sea of New York City life had subsided into a calm, and its restless waves of bustle, labor, and feverish excitement were for a moment still. The streets were' deserted, and no sounds broke their silence, save, perhaps, an echoing footfall of some pedes- trian, overcome with surprise at the lateness of the hour, and hasfening anxiously home, or the clear ring on the pavement of the club of some policeman, faithfully on the watch at his post. On the sidewalk in Park Row, opposite the Fountain, a solitary person was standing, with his eyes fixed in eager inquiry on the illuminated clock, which surmounts the     6  THE FOUNTAIN AND THE STATION HOUSE. top of the City Hall. His features were pale, and a shade of despair seemed to pass over them, as turning his gaze from the scrutiny of the hour, and suffering his head to drop on his breast, he muttered to himself-- "Home I cannot go; it would be in vain. I cannot wander in the streets, and yet there is a fearful mystery about me, which brings me a rude repulse whichever way I turn; but necessity knows no law, and I will try once more:" and the young man, for he was evidently in the flower of his life, turned his steps towards one of the many hotels which surrounded the spot where he stood. The doors were closed, and with a tremulous touch he pulled the handle of the bell. After a few moments de- lay, the bolt was withdrawn, and the young man found himself standing face to face with the half-awakened por- ter, who, even through the mists of sleep, cast a suspicious glance on the visitor. "If you please," said the youfig man hesitatingly, "J should like to have a bed for the night." The eyes of the porter had by this time dilated into full consciousness, and taken in the whole form and fea- ture of the person of the applicant. "No-hav'nt any room; besides, when I look at you, I know you--you're known all over New York. You can't come in." And with this gruff salutation, the por- ter gave the young man a shove, more remarkable for its force than its politeness, and which placed him on the wrong side of the door, to discover at the same instant. that it was slammed in his face.   THE FOUNTAIN AND THE STATION HOUSE.     7 "Again I again!" exclaimed the young man, as he rushed across the street; " what does it, can it all mean? what is the mystery which marks me for its victim?" and entering the Park, he threw himself on a bench by the Fountain, and buried his face in his hands. "Halloo, neighbor! get up and move home," said a burly personage, with a brass star on his breast, as he came up to the bench and roughly shook its occupant. "Hands off," answered the young, man, springing up, and for the first time evincing some spirit. "I have com- mitted no offence, have a right to stay or go where I please, and am a gentleman.'" "That's a good one," returned the bearer of the star, with a broad laugh; "a gentleman, indeed! when you are as well known in New York as- Trinity Church stee- ple. I know you, my man; so come along with me for your impudence. It's my belief, from your appearance, that you are prowling about for no good." With a groan of despair, the victim of a mysterious mark, which seemed to brand him as with fire, yielded to his fate, and five minutes afterwards was thrust into one of the dark cells of the Station House. The moments seemed ages, as he tossed in agony on the wretched pallet of his prison. "Officer i for the love of Heaven, let me out of this horrid place," he cried aloud. "Shut up and keep quiet, or it will be worse for you," was the only response. The gloom of his prison house deepened thicker     8   THE FOUNTAIN AND THE STATION HOUSE. around, the air became more stifling and overpowering, and the victim sank senseless on the floor. Daylight streamed into the Station House, and the offi- cials began to stir themselves. "Halloo I Rouse up here and come along," said one of them, opening the door of the cell and looking in. The victim of the mysterious mark had recovered from his swoon, and was now sitting in a half-upright position. He arose, without making a reply, and followed the offi- cer with some twenty other prisoners of the night. It was a large, square apartment to which the officer led his train.. The main characteristics of the room were dingy walls and a dirty floor. The upper end was divi- ded off by a wooden railing, behind which, on a low'plat- form, rose a long counter-like desk, flanked by three arm- chairs covered with leather. In the middle chair sat a portly, well-conditioned man, on whose broad and rubi- cund face, the rays of the morning sun, streaming through the window, fell red and mellow. A person, of less mag- nitude of bulk and flower of feature, was seated at a smaller desk placed on the floor beside the platform. The large man was a magistrate, and the small one was his clerk. The open space without the railing was crowded with a heterogeneous mass of men, women, and even children-the refuse of the streets of New York, which the police had swept up during the night. The air of the room was redolent of every other perfume but ,that of roses, and the confusion of tongues was as loud and discordant as that of Babel. Thus was the morning   THE FOUNTAIN AND THE STATION HOUSE.     9 justice of New York seated on its throne, and thus was the misery and crime of the night arraigned before it, to hear its mandates. The eye of-the magistrate fell first on the victim of the mysterious mark. "Officer, what is the charge against this man," said he, covering, at the same time, the victimwith a scrutinizing glance. "Drunk principally, and' taken up on suspicion gener- ally," answered-the officer. "With reference to the intoxication, your Honor, the charge is false," meekly replied the victim. "As for taking me up on suspicion, the officer is undoubtedly right, for he had no other ground, however unjust that may be, on which he could pretend to molest me. - I am a respect- able man, keep a store at No. - in --- street, my name is -- --.  I have committed no offence, and I ask to be discharged." "My friend," returned the magistrate, cc there is a cer- tain mark about you that would justify any officer in ar- resting you by night or day. I have recently heard of a number of men of your description about town. The fact is, they are too prevalent. in this community at the present time for their own or the public good. However, as this is the first time you have been before me, even if you were a little elevated, as the officer says, you may go. Officer, bring up the next prisoner." The victim went forth into the street, his breast tor- tured with agony on account of the indignity and suffer- 1"!     10   THE FOUNTAIN AND THE STATION HOUSE. ing which he had undergone during the night, and his brain in a fever of excitement in the endeavor to imagine what could be the fatal mark of mystery and misfortune which seemed to be fixed upon him.   CHAPTER .II THE LANDLADY-THE CUT-AND THE THEATRE. THE victim of the mark hastened with nervous steps to his boarding house. The Landlady, a maiden of some fifty years, with features of a geometrical description, in which acute angles prevailed, met him at the door. "Fine time of night to come home," was the greeting she gave him; "but no matter, you'll do me a favor to find another boarding house; I can accommodate you no longer. The rest of my boarders declare, that if a man, with such a mark about him as you carry, remains any longer in the house, they'll leave. That's all I have to say." "That's quite enough, Mrs. Smith," answered the vic- tim, assuming a dignity which he forced up with effort from the deep well of his mortification, "I never stay where I am not wanted. I disdain to ask you what is the mark to which you refer, although I am unconscious of possessing any repulsive or evil one. Send your boy     12   THE LANDLADY, THE CUT, AND THE THEATRE. to my store at eleven o'clock with your bill and I will settle it,' and he ascended to his room. The victim washed his hands with deliberation, or rather with desperation, packed up his wardrobe, returned again to the street, and called a carman. Two hours af- terwards, he had arranged the attic of his store for his bed-room, and determined henceforward to take his meals at an eating house. The day was fine and bright, and after paying, with an air of satisfaction, the little boy, who waited with Mrs. Smith's bill, the victim left his store and walked -towards Wall:street. He had not pro- ceeded two blocks, when he met a hale, well-dressed old gentleman, whose whole appearance gave evidence that wealth and ease had taken him into their embrace. "Good morning, my dear sir," said the victim, reach- ing out his hand and accosting the old gentleman with the concentration of cordiality. "Beg your pardon, sir, but you have the advantage of me, have not the honor of your acquaintance, or of any person of your appearance," and the old gentleman drew himself to his full standard of height, and passed on. The victim looked after the retreating form in blank astonishment. "Is it possible?" he exclaimed to himself, striking his forehead as if to drive from it the solution of the mystery; " that man is in my store every day, has bought hundreds of dollars worth of goods from me, and now in the street he gives me the cut direct-what can be the accursed and proscribed mark which I bear?" and the victim, again in despair, returned to his store. *   THE LANDLADY, THE CUT, AND THE THEATRE. 13 He had not been there ten minutes, when the identical old gentleman, who had cut him in the street, entered, greeted him pleasantly, and asked to look at some cloth for a coat. The victim was a cloth dealer. The goods were produced, and while the customer was examining the cloth, the seller alluded incidentally to having met him in the street. The customer remarked that he had no recollection of such meeting. The only person he recol- lected having noticed, was a man who presumed to claim acquaintance with him, on what ground he knew not, and who was one, whom from his appearance, even ]lad he known him, he could not possibly have recognised in a public thoroughfare without risking his reputation as a gentleman. Blacker and blacker grew the mystery around the vic- tim of the fatal mark, and in the tumult of his agitation, he cut'off five, instead of four yards of cloth for his cus- tomer. It was night, and to drown his bitter reflections, the victim took his way to the Theatre. The house was crowded, the play was sterling, the actors entered into the spirit of the scene, and the victim, resting his elbows on his knees, resigned himself to the illusions of the play. He was aroused from his pleasing reverie by the loud and ominous cry,- from the pit, of "' Hustle him out, hustle him out!" and he soon became aware, that he was the person meant, for a sea of eyes was turned towards him, and the rough shake of a hand was upon him. He remon- strated at the outrage, words ran high, again a brass star     "THE LANDLADY, THE CUT, AND THE THEATRE. made its appearance, and before he knew it, he had, much against his will, and by no means leisurely, accompanied the star into the street, and was there told to go about his business.   CHAPTER III. THE ATTIC AND THE MAIDEN. THE victim sat alone in his Attic, his dress disarranged, and his features wild and haggard, from the rough and insulting treatment which he had received at the Theatre. The candle burnt low in its socket, and the flickering blaze cast a gloom around the apartment, but it was a tri- fle, compared to the gloom which filled the breast of him who sat in its midst, like despair upon a monument. "Thrust from a hotel, locked up in a Station House, cut in the street by a customer, and hustled out of a Theatre," he muttered to himself, "what shall come next from this fearful mystery?" He paused a. moment, a shade of comfort seemed to pass over his features, and he continued: "A beautiful young woman, with hair and eyes as black as the raven, cheeks like the rose of summer, lips like the luscious red cherry, and a voice like the soft sighing of the evening breeze, has been at my store fifty times, has never noticed this hateful, unaccountable marl of mine which others     16     THE ATTIC AED THE MAIDEN. see, and has asked me to visit her. She says she is the only daughter of an aged father, and is her own mistress. Fool that I was, not to think of it before. I'll go and see her to'morrow, ask her to marry me, and in the joys of wedded life forget my troubles," and with a flush on his face, called up by the glowing picture which he had drawn of his future bride, he threw himself on his bed and slept. The morning came, and the- victim of the mysterious mark, after arranging with his clerk, the business of the day, sallied out to the house of the lady of his sudden love. He found her at home, and entered the parlor, in the style of the ton, with his hat and switch cane in his hand. The Maiden was alone, seated at a frame of embroidery, and the first flush of the morning was not more beautiful than she. The Maiden looked up with astonishment on the entrance of her visitor; but before she had time to speak, the visitor, with the desperation of one making a last leap for life, jumped at once into the middle of what was uppermost in his thoughts, and said- "Good morning, Miss Brown; from the first moment I beheld you, my heart has been consumed with love. I can restrain the feelings of my heart no longer. Will you be mine? I have enough of money for us both. I love you madly. Consent, and make me happy." "Sir," answered the young lady, rising with dignity, ( I know not for what reason I am thus insulted. The servant told me that it was a gentleman of my acquaint-   THE ATTIC AND THE MAIDEN.      17 ance in   street who wished to see me. You are a perfect stranger to me, and I beg you would withdraw, or I must ring the bell," and she moved toward the bell handle as she spoke. "Stay a moment, for Heaven's sake," cried the victim, laying his hand on her arm. "What mean you? I am that gentleman of your acquaintance in   street; do you not recognisej me as such?" (No, sir; you bear some slight resemblance to him- but he is a gentleman, and you are not. Besides, if he bore about his person the disgusting mark which I see about you, I should, although I now esteem him highly, deem his addresses an insult as I now do yours. Again, I demand that you-withdraw." Maddened and almost crazed, the victim rushed from the house into a neighboring restaurant, where since his expulsion from his boarding house he had obtained his meals, and called for a glass of brandy. The bar-keeper handed him the decanter in a hesitating manner and with an equivocal look. The victim poured a glass half full and drank it at one draught, then laying down the change on the counter, he turned fiercely to the bar- keeper whose strange look was still upon him, and ex- claimed angrily, "Well, what do you see? Four times have I been here, and although I owe you nothing, you insult me ,with your impertinent looks. Is there any thing about me that does not betoken a gentleman? if there is, what     18     THE ATTIC AND THE MAIDEN. is it?" and without waiting for an answer, he flew like a wild man again into the street. As he hurried along, a large placard caught his atten- tion. It was headed, in immense letters, with the words, "MYSTERIES EXPLAINED," and set forth, in glow- ing language, that a celebrated magician in a certain street, was ready at all hours to reveal all secrets, past and future. A ray of hope fell on the soul of the victim, and a gleam of satisfaction shone in his eye as he turned his steps towards the indicated street.   CHAPTER IV. THE MAGIOIAN AND THE SOLUTION. IN a large and vaulted apartment sat the victim and the Magician. The beard of the latter, white as the driven snow, reached to a golden girdle at his waist, which confined around his person a flowing robe elabo- rately embroidered with cabalistical characters. A mir- ror, reaching from the floor to the ceiling, stood in the centre of the room, and strange to say, it gave back from its polished surface no reflection either of the furniture or the persons of the two occupants of the apartment. "You would have unfolded to you," said the Magi- cian, "the mystery and the secret of your late mishaps; you would know your fatal mark." "I would," answered his listener. "Then be silent, and behold." Placing a silver censer before the mirror, he dropped into it some herbs, then taking a wand from beneath his     20    THE MAGICIAN AND THE SOLUTION. robe, he drew a circle round mirror and censer. In a moment a volume of smoke ros up from the censer, spreading a fragrant perfume through all the room. The face of the mirror became agitated, white, vapory clouds passed over its surface, and the sound of soft and distant music fell upon the ear. The Magician now waved his wand, the clouds disap- peared from the face of the mirror, and disclosed a scene at night in front of an hotel, where a man was in the act of being thrust from its doors. Again the wand waved, and the same man was at the Park Fountain, with the hand of an officer on his shoulder; again, and he was before the Justice; again, and he was being borne out of the Theatre; again, and he was before a lady of dazzling beauty. Again-- "Enough!" cried the victim, jumping from his seat, where, with dilated eye-balls, he had watched the changes of the mirror, "Enough! I see it all, Magician'! 'here it is, fool, dolt, idiot that I am-it was this confounded, SH O-CKING    BAD   HAT. I had it on when all my misfortunes occurred--I had it in my hand when my love was spurned, and re- jected." "The mystery, then, is unfolded," answered the Magi- cian; "but, behold the remedy.? ' Again the wand was waved, and clouds overspread the face of the mirror: only to pass, away and disclose a spac ioCis store, surimointed on    ,   THE MAGICIAN AND THE SOLUTION.    21 its roof by the figure of a GOLDEN HAT, and bearing on its front the broad sign of THE NO. "PARK ROW, NEW YOREK. "No gentleman is perfect," continued the Magician, without a faultless hat. He may have money as you have, but he must have a faultless hat, which you have not, and THE HAT-FINISHERS' UNION is the only place to get, it. This Union is a combination of Journeymen Hatters, who have formed a company for the purpose of supplying to the public a hat of the best quality at the cheapest price, and at the same time securing to the mechanic a fair remuneration for his labor. It has been attended with such complete success, that certain individuals,- envious of its prosperity, have stolen its name, and thus sought- to impose on the com- munity; but the true original HAT-FINISHERS' UNION is at "PARK ROW, whither we will now descend." As the Magician spoke, his robe seemed to melt from his person, the. mirror dissolved in air, a mist spread through the apartment, and in the next moment, our hero, victim of the mysterious mark no longer, found himself standing in. a spacious store, lined on either side with     22    THE MAGICIAN AND THE SOLUTION. hats of every size, quality, and style, and in the presence of a gentlemanly man, who addressed him with, "This is the Hat-Finishers' Union, Sir. Shall I suit you with a faultless hat?" "That is exactly what I want," answered our hero, and in five minutes he walked out of the store, happy and joyful, with as perfect a model of a hat as ever came from the hatter's block. Before he reached his store, he met the porter of the hotel, the police officer, the Justice, his customer, the old gentleman, and lastly, the lady of his love. Each made him a low bow, and putting it all to the credit of the HAT-FINISHERS' UNION, he entered his store a new man.
