THE TABLES TURNED.
O~ evening, not long since, a number of oh
ship-masters chanced to meet at a social supper,
and after the cloth was removed we went in for
yarn spinning. And among our number was
Captain Richard Nuttei~ and a finer man or better
sailor, iiever trod a deck. At length it came his
turn to tell a story, or, what we preferred-and
what the rest of us ha(1 done-relate some mci-
flent of experience in his own life.
Well, boys," he said, as he rejected the
wine, which was at that moment passed to him
for the first time, "I will give you a bit of the
early part of my ocean life, and it is a very }m-
portant bit, too, for upon it I have built the whole
of my subsequent nianliood."
We l)repared to listen to Captain Nutter, with
the most profound attention, for he was not only
an old seaman, but one of the most successful
commanders in our mercantile marine. We lis-
tened, and his story was as follows:
"I wi~ very yonn~ when I tlr~t entered on ship-

self quite a sailor. When I was eighteen I wat
shipped Ofl board an East Indianian, for a long
voyage. There were six of us on board of about
the same age, and we had about the same duties
to perforq~. The ~hi-~ti~ pid Laqy l)unlftp-'
was a large one, and our crew was large in pro~
portion, there being Ilfty-tvrO, all told. We
'boys,' as we were called, messed together, and
In all o or respect were separate fr~xn the rest
of the cr~ , just as much as the officers were.
Our capteill was a noble~heartCd, honorable man.
kind and g nerotiS, but yet very strict. Of course
we young ers found plenty of occasion to find
fault with him. atid very often were his decisions
arraigned before our mess and decidedly con~
demited. In fact. we should have reversed many
of his judghlentS Ii' we had had the power; but as
he was t~he cotunnuidel',' and we only foremast
hands-aild boys at that-he had his own way,
and the luminous decisions we caine to were coa~
seqiiefltly of no avail, and lost to the world.
"Now, we boys had learned, in the course of our
tra~tels. to dritik our grog as well as any sailors.
We could toss oft' a glas~ of ruin aud water with
as much grace as any one, and we claimed the
right so to do. not only as a privilege, but as an
honor to which a life upon the ocean entitled us.
But even In this respect our captain pretended to
I differ from us. When we could get on shore, wo

4marning just as much as we had a mind to. The
pnth of the matter was, we five loved the idea of
being 'old salts.' better than we did anything else,
~nd we spent more time in watching for opportu-
nities to have a spree than we did in learning to
perfect ourselves in the profession we had chosen.
~.ft even got so at length, that Jack Small was
called upon to take the deck sometimes, when the
officers were busy, and he used to work out the
reckonings at noon as regularly as did the captain.
Yet Jack was in our mess, and he was a constant
eye-sore. We saw that he ~vas reaching rapidly
ahead of us in every useful particular, and yet we
would n't open our eyes. We were cuivious of his
good fortune. a~ive called It, and used to seIze
every opportunity to tease and run him. But he
never got angry in return. lie sometimes would
laugh at us, and at others lie would so feelingly
chide us that we would remain silent for awhile.
"At length the idea entered our lread~ that Jack
~honld drink with us. We talked the matter over
in the mess while Jack was absent, and ~ve mutu-
ally pledged each other that we would make him
Lb ink at the first opportunity. After tlii~ deter-
mination was taken, we treated Jack more kindly,
and he was happier than he. had been for some
time. Once more we laughed and joked with him
In the mess, and he in return helped us in out
navigation. We were on our homeward-bouE~

so. One 1)leasant morning we six youngsters re-

whole day; and accordingly we rigged up in our
best togs antI were carried to the landing.
Now was our chance, and we put our heads
t4)getlteI~ to see how it should be done. Jack's
very tir~t desire, as soon as he got ashore, was to
go Ill) :iiil examine the various things of interest
in the citi'. lie wanted to visit the churches and
sneh like places arid to please him we agreed to

eateit *we would have some light sweet wino
brought on. and that we would contrive to get
ruin ettoughi jitto what he drank to upset him, for
nothi big on earth could please us more than to get

shape, for thezi we fancied that the captain's

company, without the wine, and after the amount
had been s~atefl, he took out his purse to pay i~

leader. caught his arm.
"'N6-not so,' said Sam. 'You shall not pay
for It, for we will not eat at the expense of one
who will sneak out of a scrape in this way. We
want nothing more to do with you unless you take
a glass of wine with us.'
"'Very well,' said Jack; and as he spoke 1 could
see that his lip quivered, and that he dared not
speak more.

reached it Tim Black ran and caught him, at the
tame time exclaiming

length he calmed himself and stepping back to
his chair, he said:
Shipmates, will you listen to me for a mo.

"Silence gave consent, and in a moment; more
he resumed:
"'Since mattel's have come to this pass, I have
resolved to tell you what I had meant to keep
locked up in my bosona.'
"We had always thought from Jack's manner,
that there was something peculiar connected with
his early life. aud we were all attention in a mo-
uJ~nt.
My story is but a very short one,' he contin-
ne(l, 'and 1 can tell it Ii) a very few words. From
the time of my earliest childhood I never knew
what it was to have a happy home. My father
was a drunkard ! Onco he had been a good man.

niotber wept and groaned. She sank (lown upon
l~er knees and clasped the icy corpse to her bosom,
as though she would have given it life froar the
warmth of her own breast. She loved her hus.
band through all his errors, and her love was all
powerful now. The two men went away anti let~

to come and kneel by her side. I did so. My

this moment that promise has never been broken.
Ify father was buried, and some good kind neigh.
bors helped us through the winter. When the
next spring came I could work, and I earned
something for my mother. At length I found a
chance to ship and I did so. and every time I go
home I have somc money for my mother. Not
for the wealth of the whole world would I break
the pledge I gave my mother and my God on that
dark, cold morning. And even had I made no
such pledge. I would not touch the fatal cup, for I
know that I have a fond, doting mother who
would be made miserable by my dishonor, and I
would rather die than bring more sorrow upon
her head. Perhaps you have no mothers; and if
you have perhaps they do not look to you for~sup~
port, for I know you too well to believe that either
of you would ever bring down a loving mother's
gray hairs in sorrow to the grave. That is all,
shipmates. Let me go now, and you may enjoy
yourselves alone, for I do not believe that you will
again urge the win cup upon me
"As Jack thins spoke he turned toward the door,
but Tin) Black stopped him.
"'Hold on, Jack,' cried Tim, wiping his ey~
and starting up from his chair. "You shan't go
alone. I have got a mother and I love her as ~i elI
as you love yours, and your mother shall nei* bo

"I waited no more, but quickly starting from
my chair I joined the other two, and ere long the
whole live of us joined ~vith Jack Small in his no.
ble lire-plan. We called for pen, ink and l)al)er,
and made Jack draw up a pledge. He signed it
first and we followed him, and when the deed was
done I kno~v we were far happier than we had
beeu before for years. The wine upon the table
was untouched, and the liquor we had drank du-
ring the foreuoon was now all gone in its effect.
~'Toward evening we returned to the ship.
There was a frown upon the captain's brow as we
ume over the side, for he had never known us to
come off from a day's liberty sober. But when
we had all come over the sid~ and reported our-
