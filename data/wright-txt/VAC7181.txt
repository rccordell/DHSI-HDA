PREFACE.

There was no philosophical nor educated sense of
duty here, but only the pure human love, sown by
our Lord in the little heart, as He sowed the wild
flower in the field, and as et uncorrupted by this

Tii winter that ushered in the eighteenth century
was unusually turbulent; stormy and disastrous; a
foreshudder of nature; piophetio as it were of the
polital tempests and convulsions which were soon
to shake the world. All sorts of'calamities aftht4
the earth, and the broad seas, maddened by hurri-
canes, covered the shores with wrecks.
But commerce went steadily on in spite of every
natural obstacle, commerce cui robur et aa triplz
circa pectta est; which confronts the plague for the
sake of gold, which would, to use the Hollander's
famous expression, redden its sails in the flames of
Tophet, if it could hope to sell its pepper and its
cinnamon there. So then, in February, 1700, a
merchant ship of Havre, was seen braving a- furious
tempest on her return voyage from Lisbon. The
crew was staunch, the officers skilled and fearless,
but the Ihull had been shaken by more than one

The figure smiled with wondrous tenderness, and'
coming toward- her, placed in her hands the keys,
those very keys which,re she fled, she had laid at
the feet of Mary's image.
"Here," said. a voice of ineffable music, "here
are your keys. You gave them to me when you
left, and that none might know of your flight I have
filled your place, performed your duties, and person-
ated you. Your penitence has obtained your par-
don, and I know you will sin no more. Go then in
peace to your cell, resume the habit of thesister-
hood, and with it your duties in the chapel."
Then in a cloud of glory, our Lady, for she it
was, rose from the ground, and smiling pardon, dis-
appeared.

advice kept secret till her death. Then, according

He could no longer feel any of those 'inipulses
whidh lead to prayer; oni the contrary, if ever he
entered a church, he was seized' with a trembling
horror which drove him from" it; so that he never.
dared assist atany of the sacred offices. He bad
reckoned{onIfaking use of this year -toyreoneile
himself with  oil; but a bar of iron seemedtobe
fixed in his heart between remorse and repentance.
His: wife gave him fa little son just four months
before the anniversary of the fatal compact.
The knight, whose pride revolted at the idea}1
confessing from what source his riches came, ad
never revealed to any one his dreadful secret. IIt
was only at the moment of:fulfilling his engag
ment that he regretted he bad not etinsulted some
learned religious; but it was 'now todrlate. One
single hope'remained to hhn,--is young wife'so

abandon her in her need ?

ebasecrated to the 'blessed Virg i;ud4the-ady of
Champfleury, whose tender devotion to her gentle
patoness the knight well knew, begged his peris.
:ion to stop for; a few seconds in this oratory; for
she never'apassed a place dedicated to the blessed
Virgin without pausing there to offer up a short
prayer. Accordingly, he gave her his hand to dis-
mount, and xe nailed himself at the door while she
went in, holding 4he two horses. The lady remained

A LEGEND OrST. IAk A.
Tn.Consul Quintianus reclined in one of the
chambers of his palace, at Catana, at the foot of
Etna, in Sicily, in the company of his ugly favorite,
Lippus. The patrician "sipped his wine languidly,
and the spy stood obsequiously near.
"Lippis, this life in Sicily is a cursed bore. Here
the emperor sends me away from the delights of the
city, and instead of filling my coffers, as other pro-
consuls, I find the people so infernally peaceable,
that there is no chance for a single confiscation.
Decius is a good' enperor,-a jolly soul; but he
has given me. a hard lot. Tell me, Lippus, what
canI do?"
"Marry a fortune," answered the favorite, curtly.
"Marry a fortune? thou counselor of impossi-
bilities!  Where is a fortune, in Sicily ?"

clasping his hands.
"Gods, fool? there is no God but Agatha's!"
At that moment a cry arose. On the outer rail-.
ing of a balcony, which the flames almost licked,
stood a female form. The hands clasped a bloody
veil, and the lips moved in prayer. The cheeks
were unblanched, and the hands untrembling.
"It is Lucia," shrieked Aphrodisia, "with the
veil of Agatha !"*
The torrent seemed to have met a barrier. The
waves from the rear no longer urged on those in
front, but mounted above them, forming a wall of
fire, whence forked flames, like serpent's tongues,
darted toward the square which they could not
approach.
At length they began to recede. " The virgin
has saved the city !" shouted the people, " THE GoD
or AGATHA Is THE ONLY GoD."
* The Catanese tradition is, that the veil of Agatha
stopped the approach of the lava which threatened the
destruction of the city.
