BURIED ALIVE, OB THB     ' CON1FESSIONS OF A SUICIDE [THE following tragic account was found in a house in Philadelphia. short time since, at the time a coroner's inquest was held upon the body of one Henry Willing- whom the jury reported as having come to his end by self-destruction, in filling  himself in a room filled with the fumes of burning charcoal. It contains an awful moral lesson upon the terrors of a life of vice, and ito *vivid scenes will teach, with a fearful interest. the inexplicable suffering of a miind distractod with the dreadful sense of its own atrocities. Example being more powerful than precept, is the ground offered forthe publication of the strange ohronicles of crinie. and it is earnestly hoped that from a perusal of this work, the inexperienced may be warned of the appalling consequences attendant upon ungoverned passion. The writer speaks. us it were, from the verge of the grave, and such a monitor must be powerful and impressive. The EDITOR.] READER, I have a confession to make for a life of crime, for the burthen of being has become so intolerable to me, that death can but be a relief, and hell itself can add no sharper pang to my misery.  I feel that after I have made a disclosure of my dreadful deeds, it will be a burthen off my mind, though it cannot quiet the constant cries of remorse, which, like the hellish brood of -sin, creep within   me, and  gnaw  my vitals.  Oh I  memory, deathless memory, there is no drug or anodyne which can lull thee '   t sleep--as shadow follows substance, and echo succeeds sound, so does the burning and bitter recollection'of crime sear, like a glowing  iron, the guilty brain.  When I look at, the acts of  my life, I startle with horror, and can scarcely credit nm   senses to think that I could commit such a frightful catalogue. of crimes, and yet be permitted to live; it has made me doubt thie existence r of God, to se pure, honest, and religious persons afflicted'trith all the ills of sickness, nmisrortune, poverty, and wretchedness, while , such creatures as myself were permitted to enjoy health, affluence, riches, and luxury; but alas! that delusive dream did not last long; "O755 ,I   6       t, , BURIED ALIVEZ OR retribution, terrible beyond description, came, and one instant of that torture overbalanced all the feverish pleasures of years. :Bit to my narrative, which I shall make brief, as the thick crowding incidents of it, if told in detail, would fill volumes, although my span of life has probably run not more than half the allotted. period of nature. I have Bull before me the desperate re- solve of suildeW. Colton, in his book of Lacon, says: "When life is unbearable, death is desirable and suicide justifiable :" with these words written upon a scrap of paper left upon a table, that person blew his brains out,-then why-should I have any hesitation of meeting death? Horrors cannot crowd around me thicker than : they do at present; before me is a pot of charcoal; that, once light. ed, and this door closed, I shill soon cease to remember-sen. sation will, cease, and I shall at least escape temporarily from the fiend Remorse, who brings the panorama of the past so swiftly along before my mental vision, that the whole train of my wrongs comes crowding on thick, like the specters of the murdered victims before the sight of Ricehard the third in his disturbed dreams. I have long been striving to work my courage up to thiis pitth, fear. ing, as-Shakspeare says, the "Something after death, that undiscovered countur From whose bourne no traveler returns." But now, I -am resolved, no condition, however horrible, can ex. ceed my present dreadful situation of mind. I am not mad, though I am so often verging upon it, that I am almost bereft of my rea- son through fear. I try to pray; I hold, as it were, my heart in. my hand and try to pick the specks out of it! but it is all futile, this earth -has no Lethe; I have tried steeping my physical' beingt t'he very lips in dissipation;- I have turned Epicurean, and rioted in luxury, yea, reveled in riot and debauchery, and I have reversed my state of life, and secluded myself, like a hermit or anchorite, fasting and t6ortifying my body, but the secret seclu- sion had more terrors than even the dread -shadows which pursued me in the deepest dissipation. Silence and solitude have enabled me to see my soul's deformity, by quiet contemplation; and this has been s scene so hideous that I have shuddered with horror- to behold it, and 'have despaired of God's ev6r pardoning a creature f    5    CONFESSIONS OF A SVICIDE.        7 so crimson with the stain of crimes, as various and dretdful -in manner as they are manifold; But before I put a period to my existence, I will give a glancing outline of some-general incidents which have occurred in the course of my life, in the sincere h0pe. that it may oper/ate as a saltary r fuard to all persons to avoid the evils of vice and the retributive horrors consequent upon it.       :    : * :  I was born in Baltimore; my father had been a grocer, ani&afl made some money thereby, and was just comfortably fixing hIm- self to enjoy his ecarings, when he was suddenly taken ill apd died in a very rapid asnd mysterious manner; his funeral was hur- ried over, and my mother removed to another part of the town?, -'? where she buried herself, as it were, in hergrief, arid a kind gen. tleman, by the name of Richards, took upon hintself to Fend me to St. Mary's college, a Catholic institution in the adjoining county. After passing through the usual course of studies, I returned home and began to attend the medical, lectures in Baltimore; in this I continued for three entire sessions, boarding, at the suggestion of Mr. Richards, near the medical college, and visiting my mother about once a week. During this time I formed evil habits, which first broke the barrier of virtue which had- so far protected me against the temptations of vice. The students were many of them young men of fortune, from the south, whose object for attending the college was merely to acquire the title of a physician without caring whether they. were qualified to practice medicine or not. They were open-handed,; roystering young fellows, whose only envy was to .outvie each other in extravagance, which they called libMity. . He was the best fellow who could chew most tobacco,^ f$kelm'tt igars, and drink the greatest quantity of wine or liquotrsi witahoUf ibecoming beastly drunk; a thing which so grew upon me that I became al- most unwittingly a mere sot, with aeaving taste f{r strong drinks, which could not be satisfied short of insesiable intoxication. The joy of these nightly revels was new and exhilarathing to me, and created in me a vivacity of spirits in th earlier stages of my ine- briety, which made -me the prince of :foe sw :witth imyom panions-it grew at last to blunt all the finer feelings 'withiiit;et:   89   ., ,     BUPIRD ALIVE, OR and it became my pride to be known as the most reckless and dis solute of mvy class. .We did not confine our revels to mere intoxi catioi, but there was not a brothel upon Fell's point in which we were not well known from our habitual visits. Houses of assignation we also frequented; and at one of these one night an incident occurred to me, which I have felt blasted me for life. We had protracted our usual debauch at a coffee-house until after midnight, and half-a-dozen of us reeled tipsily off to- ward a house of assignation, which one of our party had recently discovered; he tapped upon the window-shutter, and an old woman cane to the door; he whispered something to the old crone, and we all staggered into a well-furnished parlor, which was well- lighted and had a large fire burning in it. We threw ourselves negligently around upon thE. sofas and rocking-chairs, when we heard the sounds of riotous revelry in the adjoining room, the clink of glasses, ringing shouts of laughter, blows upon the ta hf   everything jingle, and a general uproar. The old lady^ selinto the other room through the folding-doors, when a voice cried: "Bring 'em in-let the boys come-dam'd good el. lows-I know 'em." With this a large, corpulent, red-faced man, in a very drunken state, pushed the folding-doors apart, when a sight burst upon me which startled me to sobriety, drunk as I was. A large table occupied the center of the floor, and on it were the frag. ments of a feast of oysters, lobsters, fowls, and such things, and covered with. bottles of champagne, brandy, and like drinks, with and without necks, broken wineglasses and unbroken-and the. whole of the plates, glasses, and dishes in utter confusion. Around this table were half-a-dozen men holding in their embrace and upon their laps as many women, the forms of the females being half-naked,- their hair disheveled, and their bosoms bare and ex. posed, their arms clinging about the necks of the men in mpudlin fondness. Oh, God! how my gorge and disgust arnose to lehold there my guardian and protector, Richards, and in his arms, in lascivious, wanton nakedness, who?--My heart now sickens at the thouight--My mother!!! She "was drunk! Great God! how was I sicked and horrified. She, whom I had deemed an angel in virtuous purity, sunk to that low state of degradation! She did !    CONFESSIONS OF"A SUICIDE.     '  not know me, and I made my escape from the house completety sobered. The next day I drew from the bank 11 the money whib had' been deposited there for my use during the time ishould:s , attending the lectures, which amounted in ail to about four hundred dollars; with this small sum I embarked for, and arrived in, New York, purposing to pursue my studies in mndicine It that collegeR  here I changed my name, and adopted the one by which I have been known ever since; this was in some degree to hide a guilt mother's shame, and partly for my individual secrecy that I adopts ed the name of Henry Wiliing.  1 was soon installed as a student, and found a young gentleman by the name of Rufus Case; taking the matriculation ticket about the same time with him, I agreed to take lod1ings and board at*# small brick house, directly opposite the college-where he said there was a very pleasant, chatty widow who had a most beautifil girl living with her, as an adopted daughter. We went over and saw the widow, Mrs. Thompson, and concluded a bargain for the two front rooms up-stairs, in the house, which was a suiall one. When we came again down stairs I was introduced to the young lady it Miss Jane Thompson, her actual name being Clark. Heavenly powers! what a glorious creature she was. She was tall, elegantt and full in her figure, with a roupd, vel-developed bust and the carriage of a queen. iHer hair was like the raven's wing, or rather of that glossy purple-black which the ripe grape discloses; her complexion was very florid, and her eyes, shaded with their long, silken lashes of jet, were truly .      - "Deeply, darkly, beautifully blue;, ;' they were the blue of the moist morning-violet; and despite her stately bearing, there was the most tiiid, bashftlik modesty about her that I ever beheld. f is useless to say:I fell in love with her at a glance--can I call it love? It was idolatry-heart worship-- a day-dream that made earth Elysium to 'he. .How I labored at my studies, thinking it was for her! Months went on-my room. companion, Case, I found to :be a villain, full of vices of every character, and of a devitish, deceitful spirit. He made advain; to Jane, but I saw--his damnabte purpose to.-ruinher,.and I putl:- on her guard. Jane left Mrs& Thompson's house to spend a' feti   to0     ,  i -BURIJED ALIVE, OR ^'t'at Mrs. Thompson's sister-in-laaw's residence, in another part  f-the city. I' lhesr absence I was wretched, and Mrs. Thompson ', , fid Case frequently walked up there together, and would leave me ,' ,iilorinein the ho ue to my studies. At length one evening she re- - ired home:i almost wild with- anxiety. Jane could nowhere be iond, nothing could 'lbe heard of her in any direction; I hurried Wverally to, her few female acquaintances in the vicinity, hut no trace, of her could be had; night passed and day came again, with noa better esult.  Case pretended to Mrs. Thompson to be deeply distressed, but I could see a hidden demon in his eye that made me half suspect that- all was not right s Night and day passed again; and still no tidings; my solicitude became intense. Mrs. Thompson and I made search for her together; Mrs. Thompson, being almost crazy tih excitement, wandered about like a maniac, trying to find her, ealling upon every acquaintance she had in the town--but-no one had seen or heard of Jane. After hunting fruitlessly for several days, I went to:1the-,ollege one night under a mistake or misappre- hension respecting a meeting that was to have been held in the dissecting-room, to hear a lecture and see the practical application, by our demonstrator of anatomy. I had made an error, it was Tuesday evening and I thought it Wednesday. The night was a blustering one, and at 8 P. M. we were to assemble; I started for the college, the high wind drove the long, skimming clouds over tie moon, and mottled the pavements with the shadows; I descend- ed into the long hall beneath the college, all was dark as a dun- geon; I groped my way:back toward the dissecting-room, which was at the fartler end-of the building; I thought it strange that I could neither hiear-nor see any one; hollow and sepulchral came back the echoes^As I Baced the marble-paved subterranean hall, and then I trod upon the great iron cover or top which fitted over the vast vat or vault, where the dead flesh was thrown, after it had been dissected. I ' passed on, expecting in a minute to open the door, and see the clear lighted room, and the professor, with the students cracking their usual jests over the frail wrecks of mor- tality; but when I reached 'tie door, and opened the dead-latch, which closed only on the outside, not a soul was there, all was * . .  .   CONFEssIONS OF A -.SUICIDxE.  dark as the grave. I thought I must be too early and I ow: i, wait for the class. So I entered," and groped about, in the gloom?, to find a box of matches,. which I remembered as being upon thei: ': window-sill; I put out my hand -to reach them when it came uplt : .: the cold face of a man's head which lay there! I ishuddered with horror at the touch-it chilled me like ice-I- however, found the matches and struck a light, after which I lighted the candle and kindled the fire in the stove; at that moment a gust of wind from without bllew the door to, and I was closed in :. 1I haen; for the first time, looked up and about me. ' Great God! what a sight it presented-all around the walls of. the. room were, hung upon hooks, legs, arms, heads, hands, and feet) beside me a great tub ' of intestines, and on the-table lay fragments of livers and half a human heart!-while in the farther end of the room, to accumu- late the horrors, some twenty or thirty dead bodies were piled up. promiscuously upon each other--a livid and-decaying mass, from which, as soon as the fire began to burn;; a' intolerable stench arose, but I was compelled to submit to it, there was no means whereby I could open the dead-latch of the door. I waited anxiously for the class to come, but they came not. I tried to force the door, but the effort was futile; I tried the window-panels, but they'were solid wood. Without,' I could hear the wild wind slamming the shutters and creaking' the gates; within, was a combi- nation of horrors from which I recoiled. Then came the thought  upon me that they would not come; and then the idea'that if somed of the relatives of those who lay dead in this fetid charnel-house, should chance to come in search of their bodies"-ri find me alone with them, I should be torn to pieces. The like hadjust occurred ' in St. Louis, where a body had been found ithi coilege, and an infuriated'mob of citizens had torn' the houseiopen and destroyed the museum. In self defense, I took, out my case of instruments and dissected for some time, but I sickened at length, so I washed my bloody knives and put them up again, and paced back and forth across the room, while the'-ia'stly white and blue faces of the piled-up dead bodies seemedll'i1 t'iurned upotn me, and I could fancy Lhat I could see those horny, spectral eyes move ni'ntheir hollow  sockets, and pursue me with their stony gae' wherever I trod! t 4,'   J'4a        BURNeD ALIVT, OB eipard the great town-clock peal twelve, and the dead were alone ?fy comrnpanions;i it struck one two! and three but still I was atone. The long whistling moan of the wind swept round the iouse, and' tg noises of running carriages and hacks had ceased- pot one rntled by; the silence was awfully solemn, and in this frightful prison-house of mine, I was growing painfully nervous. I had no fear of ghosts, spirits, or apparitions, but there was somne- thing horrifying in the feeling of remaining as the companion of corpses. I sat like a ghoul in a sepulcher; at one time t nearly sank to the floor, as. I accidentally caught a glimpse of my own countenance in a looking-glass, which hung in one corner of the room.  I was appalled at the deathly pallor which this terrific vigil had spread over my visage, and I dropped into a chair and covered my eyes with both hands to exclude the frightful vision of the dead from my sight; but even with my eyes closed, I could see the glazed orbs of the dead sightlessly glaring upon me. While in this position I heard a footstep upon the pavement at the farther end of the hark hall; I listened breathlessly; the person approached the dissecting-room-but a moment I hesitated and then closed the door of, the stove and blew the stump of a candle out;, then stepping into one corner of --the room, I awaited, with a beating heart, the issue. The stranger came to the door and open- ed it, but all was dark as gloom could make it. The person stepped in, apparently dragging something, and then I heard a heavy sub- stance fa ll upon the floor with a peculiar kind of sound. Then all was silent; the next minute a scratch was heard, and I beheld a nlan lighting a match, and taking a candle from his pocket, he lit the same, placed it on the table, and I beheld the face and per- son of, Case! I moved," and was about to step toward him, when he discovered. me, and instantly drew a pistol, and cocking It, he pointed it at me- "Hold, Case!"I exclaimed, "do you not know me? It is I, Henry Willing!" 4"What, in hell's name, brought you here, this time of night?" said he, fiercely. ,I explained to,him whv I was in that situation, and then asked him what he had in that bag, which he had thrown upon the floor;   COWFES8sONs or *A rOICtg.       f  he told me, with a demoniac grin, which almost startledi me, fromnt its hideousness, into palsy-to "look!" I did open the bag and turned down the mouth of it, and beheld a sight whic;h appalletd me, curdled my blood in the veins, and seemed to make my werr marrow turn to ice! I started back aghast; cold drops of sweat in a second stood like beads upon my face, and I beheld, to my petrified amazenment, a colorless corpse; and, Oh, my Go! mjr God! it wore the heavenly countenance of Jane Clark I "In the name of heaven!" exclaimed 1, "who can have done this"' "Why, I!" said he, "' and utter a breath of what you now see, and shall hear, and I will blow you to hell in a minute.

She confessed itr tfie shallow fool'! and we reached the place where I hf:d made mf arrangements with an old gambler. who kept the small country. retreat on the  Harlem road. We stopled. and I called tor I couple of bottles of wine, and we strayed off to one of the amall summer-houses, in the large gardep, which was thikly emllowered with vines. Being thirsty, she drank freely of the cool, delicious: wine; ha! ha! ha! it ran through her warm veins like magic- again she drank, And once more I pressed her to t'.ke a mere drop.

From wirnt another small drinking-house I strolled until the sun had irty risen, when I returned to the' house of Mrs. Thompson; Here all was emotion, the body had been taken in, and a number of the neighbors were assembled offering various conjectures upon ite mysterious circumstance. I joined in the general astonish. rent, and was solicited to aid in attending to giving it a proper in.  rment.

Hosts of heaven! it was Jane! The knife was applied, the blood flowed red and fast-the professor ceased in astonishment.

I answered not, but lifting Jane in my arms, I bore her to the carriage, and the driver hurried to the place of destination; alight. ing he passed a small wicket-gate, and going in the back way, he soon appeared with an old woman, who opened the front door, She recei -,1 Jane and placed her upon a sofa-the coachman left and drove hastily away. The old lady prepared a small fire, placed pillows under Jane's head, and made all as comfortable as possible. In due time a letter came by mail, inclosing a draft from the professor upon the Merchants' and Mechanics' Bank for the round sum of one thousand dollars; this I soon cashed, and a favorable letter of introduction gained me a partnership in business with Dr, Honfleur, who was in high standing in Boston, to whiich place I had gone by the earliest opportunity, and where, in a few days after my arrival, I was united in the bonds of mmtrimony with Jane. Dr. Honfleur was a man past the prime of life, well versed in his profession, to which he was deeply devoted; he had a wife who was young, beautiful, and voluptuous, scarcely indeed beyond girlhood, and full of the passion-fires of youth-wholly unfit in every respect for the cold, staid habits of the doctor; I was not long in the house, with Jane, my wife, before I could perceive ad. vances upon the part of Mrs. Honfleur toward me, which were unequivocal. At first, the deep, pure, honest love I bore for Jane caused me to avoid, if not repel, the attentions which daily grew more apparent upon the part of the doctor's wife. I was aften compelled to attend parties and the theater with he r, when the pressure of the doctor's business precluded his going with her, My being her cavalier, so far from arousing any suspicions upon his part, seemed rather to endear ne to the doctor, as he looked, upon my familiarity as the result of gratitude for his uacoiOlli   tiff         BURIED ALIVE, OR kindness and his confidence upon my integrity scen-ed perfectly implicit. At length, after we had been practicing together some months, in which I made a very favorable impression as a young physician, the doctor had occasion to make -a professional visit as far'as the town of Andover, and left me in charge of all his busi- ness in Boston ann his household affairs. When he was gone, I went around regularly in his buggy visiting our patients, and upon one of these rounds I took Mrs. Honfleur with me. During this ride I became convinced of the correctness of my suspicions, for the amative propensities of the woman became strongly manifest; She turned the conversation adroitly upon the tyranny of a young Wife being married to an old husband, and sighed softly In my ear that it was a pity that her fate was not lipked with some young and ardent lover like myself. She grew romantically entht3iastic, and poured forth her passion for me in words of poesy, and then, as :if wishing to recall what she had said, continued, that she meant of course all to be purely Platonic; with this she laid her hand upon mine and looked affectionately into my eyes, and asked me if I could betray the rash confidence of love with which she had intrusted me. I clasped her hand, my arm stole round her waist, 'and I printed upon her young red, lips the kiss which, like a Judas, betrayed her, while with the same breath, I vowed con-. stancy in confidence. I went hone; the gentle, calm, dove-like demeanor of Jane no longer had a charm to my eyes, her conver- sation was cold and insipid compared with- the ardent enthusiasm of my new conquest. I now sought every opportunity of having an interview with Mrs. Honfleur, and became daily more and more fascinated with her; and although she was far inferior to Jane in point of beauty, I found, her charms growing upon me, which, heightened by her many blandishments and coquettish 'little arts, completely entangled me in a feverish and exciting state of passion. One evening Jane had retired early, and Mrs..Honfleur and my- self were left'alone in the parlor reading; she picked up Byron from the center-table and. came with it to the shfa, where I was half reclining with my book in hand; every now and then she Would 'laugh heartily over some passagewhich I insisted .upon seeing, which she resisted until I forned the book from her, aqd   CONFESSIONS OF A SUICIDE.       2.1 found it to be Dudu's dream in Don Juan. I'suggested that her own beauty had always reminded me rather of Donna Julia; she said she felt it to be too true-that she was alike in respect to hee lord, for that the doctor was even more unbearable than Don Al- phonso himself. We read alternate passages throughout the poem; at length, she pretended that the room was cold, so she arose and closed the door, and at the same time I marked that she had taken occasion to bolt it. She returned to the sofa, leaned herself back against my arm half carelessly, and began to talk of some indif- ferent subject; by this, my own coolness had worn off-all reserve which I had preserved melted away as the warm pressure of her  body came upon my arm. I thought of Jane for an instant, but again that the doctpl was old, and that everything would remain ' profound secret; but it was no time for reason -her soft warm cheek reclined upon my shoulder, and in the next instant my lips were upon that cheek and her rosy mouth, while she, partly yield- ing and partly withdrawing, rested her round figure against my form, wyhile, as I encircled her with my arm, I could feel her leap- ing heart beat rapidly beneath my hand. Why detail this treacherous intrigue farther? She was ruined, with her own full consent, and I, a villain, had wronged my own Jane, betrayed my best friend, and stolen the jewel of his wife a honlor. The unseen and irresistible chain of fate forever draws on all who pursue the path of vice; this villainous intrigue was now regularly carried on'between us, neither the doctor nor Jane sus. pecting Mrs. Honfleur of illicit intercourse with myself; and thus for months, we carried on our shameless communications, meeting abroad in the city by special assignations. One day we were. strolling in the farther end of the city from where we lived; Jane, 1 unknown to us, had begun to suspect treachery, and secretly fol- lorwed us until she was satisfied by her own sight of our criminal conduct. When I returned home at pight, I saw a change in her countenance, and she frankly told me what she had been a witness to, and that so directly'and unequivocally that I could hot dehy'it. To my astonishment, however, she did not express hersef. in ps.  sion,but calmly alid sorrowfully. The meek humility with"whiCoj ,   '*21         UftRibfIE AIV4ll, OR she mourned at having ouflived my love, cut me to the core, and the silent, uncomplaining tear, which coursed down her cheek, touched me more nearly than all the reproaches that could have been uttered. She said 'she knew that she was humble and poor, but that she had hoped, by fondness and fidelity, to have been worthy of my love, but that as it was gone from her, she herself would seek a home' in the broad, open otter-world, where we look for no sympathy, and are not disappointed if we meet unfeeling souls. , ' I begged her forgiveness, and swore upon my soul's hope of sal- vation, never again to deceive her, and not to desert her while life lasted. She meekly acquiesced, and said no more. Oh, villain hat I was-a week had scarce passed before my vow was violated!  The doctor was again absent, and once more our illicit amours began. ;Night after night had I quietly crept from the bed of my, own wife and stolen into the chamber of Mrs. Honfleur. One night my wife rose and proceeded stealthily out of our chamber into the wicked woman's apartment, who lay quietly waiting for me; Jane stole quietly up to the bedside and spoke gently to Mrs. Honfleur upon the matters between us, telling her that she had marked our intercours, and prayed her to unloose the toils which she had woven round my heart, and restore the husband to his wife's arms. She said this soft and sobbingly, with such a plain- five tone that tears started to my eyes, as I stood listening'at the door, snd Mrs. Honfleur, seeing that denial was useless, subtilely asked her forgiveness, and prayed that silence should seal all the past, promising that for the future she would never intervene be- tWeen Jane adndhbert'husband. For some time Mrs. Honfleur avoided me, and :iew beams of gladness sprang up in the eyes of my own dear Jane.-  It has been the curse of my existence to break every vow which b'have most ardently desired- to perform, and my firmest resolves ver seen the fist to fail. ': i What: ausidtid I now havegfor contentment! with a lucrative -practice, an excellent reputation in my profession, with health, good standing in society, anda, dear, devoted woman, as a wife, who almost worshiped me--whose existence seemed only bright        ,.    i                 o * , I r,  ,           .,4    in my presence, and whose sole study was;to give the object of her affection every means of pleasure which she could minister. Her . love grew daily deeper, and the fond fidelity of woman's gentle heart never displayed itself with more modest yet ardent'attach l ment; she anticipated my wishes and provided for thetn; she soothed my melancholy hours, and never murmured a -sigle sor row of her own. Oh, that heaven should have wasted the gift of soirich a treasure, so priceless a jewel, upon a wreteh like met Restless and exciting passion upon my part; lured by the syre. who had caught me with her crafty snares, led me again into temp- tation. Oh, the power of that beautiful passage in the only true prayer-"Lead us not into temptation!" My unsuspecting friend, Dr. Honfleur, was gone to attend the Medical Convention of Philadelphia, when the wiles of his wife wooed me again from my honest purposes. Jane discovered if. The hitherto restrained fires of her heart now burst their bound% and jealousy drove her to frenzy. It was long past midnight, and I had just come from thea armn of my mistress, with her hot kisses yet burning upon my lips, and. stealing like a thief into my wife's bed, I soonifell into a-sleelp Then Jane arose without disturbing me, andiifter procuring a dag. ger crept quietly into Mrs. Honfleur's room, and lifting up the light curtains of her bed, stabbed her as she slept Jane returned to my couch and said with a fierce but tremulous voice: "Henry Willing, the deed is accomplished-I have now pierced the heart which has broken mine-I forgive you! I forgive you, farewell! God bless you! farewell!"     . I sprang from my bed, and rushed to Mrs. Honfleurs room. 4 gory crimson flood stained over the whiteness of the sheets and the guilty but unfortunate creature was struggling to rise upon one arm; I aided her, and staunched the wound in her side with a pil- low. I called for the servant; but none came; I ran to look for my wife, but she had fled and could nowhlre be found. With a louder shout I roused a servant, who soo, Aalarmed the mieighbors, who came in, and by the first gray streaks of the dawning day' beheld the blanched face of Mrs. Honfieur and the bloody spots which dyed the bed. The commotion became intense, and in a short: ,i .    .  ': '.  ,; ' I , ;, ^ * sp *\   *24 , '       BULRID ALIV. E, OR period the house was filled with a dcrious and inqruisitive mob; search was instituted forthwith for Jane, but the whole day passed without any discovery of her whereabouts. In the meantime, physicians- examined the wounds in Mrs. Honfleur's body, arid found they wxere. not mortal althoughl very severe. In a day or two Doctor Honfleur returned and fourid his wife in this critical 'and. precarious condition' he for the first time now began to suspect me of being at the bottom of this dark act, and he divined at once that it could be no other passion than jealousy which could prompt the commission of such a crime. He forced from his wife,. who was in dreadful ..apprehension of death, a full confession of our ,criminal intercourse, which at once came full Arid convincingly upon him; whereupon the doctor without hesi- tation: rushed into his private medical library, and in another in- stant rushed back into the room where I sat with two or three gentlemen, and elevating a pistol to his eye, he deliberately fired at my head; the ball, however, took effect only in my left arm just below the shoulder, and was but a flesh wound; he then rushed at me with a huge bowie-knife, whereupon I hastily retreated to the fireplace where I. grasped the heavy iron poker, and as he came forward I anticipated his blow, struck the sharp weapon from his hand, and following up the stroke, I dealt him a terrific sweep with the ponderous iron upon the crown. To my horror I heard the skull crack, and saw the doctor sink a lifeless man upon the floor! My head reeled,-my brain became dark, I fainted, and fell also. For many days I knew not what my condition was; at length I came to myself, and found that I was being examined before the ipayor of the cityei: The persons, who had witnessed the doctors assault, came for'agrd and testified, and I was discharged upon the ground-of self-defense. In the meantime Mrs. Honfleur had be- come convalescent;. Jane had been found wandering upon the out.. skirts of the city, was arrested, imprisoned, and in a short time was brought to'trial before the court; but a small examination was necessary to convince every one of the painful fact that she was insane. Upon the. jury finding her in this state of mind, she was sent to the lunatic asylum, and its gloomy doors closed. upon my beautiful but unfortunate wife. I    , :   V VIa J Isr I U IN Is V r k, is U I *.1 V sM Ink* Gatlhering all the money which was due to me, and bidding adieu to Mrs. Honfleur, who was now fully recovered, I hastened to leave Boston, where I felt that I should be known and shunned. I proceeded to Albany, where I rented retired rooms in:a secluded  part of the town; here I gave myself up for some time to a hermit- like solitude, but its loneliness became unbearable, and I was com- pelled to mix with the outward world that its images might with- draw my mind from the terrors of its own inward fancies. One day as I was strolling, I saw Mrs. Honfleur in the streets of Albany, and I felt that she was in search of me. I used no delay, but instantly determined to avoid her, and shortly after started for this city of Philadelphia, where I again secreted myself in an out-of-the-way street, and flattered miyself that I had eluded my pursuer; but what was my astonishment to find that instead of escaping from her, she was scarcely a week finding out my locality. She came to me in tears, and besought me to have pity upon her, and allow her to remain with me; she pleaded that her character and friends were all gone in Boston, that she had. no one to whom she could turn on earth but myself; that but for me, she would never have been reduced to this strait, and a multitude of other matters. Notwithstanding the disgust which at first I felt for this woman, as the source of the greatest calamities of my life-the murder of her husband and the madness of my wife-yet such ap- peared the wretchedness of her situation, aiid such the irresistible fascination of her beauty, that I could but commiserate with her in her weakness, and at last yielded to her solicitations to let her become my mistress. It has ever been the case during my life, that one, erroneous step has ended in precipitating me into irremediable difficulties and trouble. The crushing nature of my crimes had, by their very terror, sobered my habits, but I now again rushed rapidly into a whirl- pool of dissipation, and as I went round and round, deeper and deeper in vice, I felt that resistance was uselessand gave way to it. As the sailor who in the storm, finding all hope is lost, seeks to drown his'senses in liquor before his frame is swallowed up in the waves, so I, in this desperate- condition of life, sought refuge s                 ,  ,      ;   26          bRVi ED ALTVE- OR from the bitter chidings of::conscience in the temporary delirium of intoxication, and in a short time I grew reckless of life; I plunged yet deeper in dissipation, and added to it the vice of gam- ing. In this matter fortune never favored me once, but still the hope of luck taking a turn or change induced me to continue; not this alone, but gaming afforded me a species of excitement which withdrew, as it were, my own soul from feeding on itself, and al. thpugh my means gradually decreased, my sensibility was too much blunted by drunkenness to have any prudence or caution respecting the preservation of my means.  Among my pot-companions was one who was a very handsome, dashily-dressed fellow, a gambler, to whom I, in my cups, had boastingly given a glowing description of Mrs. Honfleur, and in- vited hiil down to my rooms. He was possessed of accomplished and most insinuating manners, and frequently came down to take a cup of tea with us, or ai-oyster-supper-a gay, noisy Bacchanalian, who, to serve his purposes, had occasionally loaned me money at the gaining-tab!e. I went to the theater with him one night, and while we were sitting in' the box conversing, I observed an uncom- monly well-dressed, genteel young man sitting on the other side iof me; presently this elegant person slipped his hand into my coat pocket and extracted, with great adroitness, my pocket-book, containing all the money I was master of, being some two or three thousand dollars.' I detected the knave in his white kid gloves, and de- manded mye pocket-book; he appeared thunderstruck, but in an instant whisijingly implored me to spare him from public expo- sition, as his imily connections were of the highest character in. the city foiSespeCta:i Iity saying that sudden gaming losses had driven him to this desperate act, and begging me, for God's sake, simply to put my hand; in his pocket and take mny pocket-book back again, and say nothing about it. '1 here was such a look of piteous sincerity upon, his fine countenance, that I reached out my hand to recover, my property, Butv no sooner waS it in his pocket "than he seized tyarm, with a grasp of iron, and' held it, in spite of me, in his pocket, calling all the time for the officers, who arriving in the box, in a moment bore me forcibly off in defiance of all-my attempts at explanation, -hurrying me to jail, and leaving all my !l         4     ,    CONFEBSIONS 0'F 4 JU'OIDE.    S' money in, the, hands of the ingenious scoundrel whom I never saw afterward. The next day my friend, who had gone to the theater with me, came and bailed me out of prison, and when the trial came on, gave evidence of my innocence, and I was discharged- but my money was all gone, and in this dilemma I knew not what to do. There was no one to whom I could state my distresses but my friend and pot-companion, the handsome gambler, whose name, by the way, was Murphy. He rhade light of my misfortune and laughed it off as a very good joke, then kindly offered me any amount of money which I wished to borrow. I accepted some two hundred dollars. In a few days he called upon me, saying that he had a secret to comniunicate; so we went to a coffee-house, took a few oysters in a stall, and began to drink freely of brandyfi he then confessed to me that he had been engaged to the daughter of a poor but respectable mechanic citizen, had imposed upon her, 'confidence with a promise of marriage, and under this cloak had seduced her; that her father was not aware f'-it,but that the girl was far gone in pregnancy; that something must be done, and that immediately, as he could not think of marrying her as she had no money, and he had never indeed designed to, make her other than the victim of his passion. He promised me to cancel my indebt- edness to him, and furnish me a couple of hundred dollars in ad. dition to procure this abortion. I assented; the act wasjtformed; but not the death of the child alone was accomplished, for the potency of the drug given, and the severity of the operation proved fatal to the unfortunate girl. I felt this double m urde deeply, but it was too late, I could not retrace my steps. Each one of my crimes proved father to another. I now sought for my ftward, but my good friend, Murphy, had flown, and thus I was foiled of my blood-money. Under this disappointment I plunged deeper into dissipation than ever, notwithstanding my reduced circumstances. My mistress, Mrs.; Honfleur, t learned, had been playing me false with my pretended friend, Miarphy, and my being seized in  the theater and put in jail was ia'l^atrick of his oi to get me out : of the way, and his assumed friendship a disguisef: ateomnpliih,:;:;^ ing his intrigue with my mistress. This I learned fibrm a ,uiii i,: questionable source, and I doubted not that the woman whiid^ :-;  I , .  .^ ,' . . ** * *.    f28  '. '",  BURIED ALIVE, OR been false to her husband would be false to her paramour; but I was silent upon this subject, and suffered it to pass on as if nothing had occurred; and we lived together as before, I scarce conscious half the time of existence, from drunkenness; for day after day was one scene of debauch and beastlyinebriety. One night I was staggering home, long after midnight, so blindly intoxicated that I could scarce make my way, although there was a brilliant and beautiful moon-lit sky overhead; as I plunged along, first running against a tree-box, and then stumbling over a cellar-door, a woman in a cloak overtook me, and putting her arm around me, walked along, and steadied my course, or rather her. own, for I went more by her direction than any idea of mine. Slfe tlked continually, and although I could not comprehend what it V about, I fancied the voice was familiar. After walking a great'while, I insisted upon sitting down, as I was becoming tired, froin my walk, and stupidly sick, from my liquor. Suddenly the woman called me "I enry," with such ani accent as shot a light across my brain instantaneously, and printed upon my lips a kiss; she then exclaimed in the most incoherent rhapsody: "I knew they could not keep me! they had bolts, iron rings, chains, and locks. She died once. Yes, I killed her once. I saw the snow-white bed, wherein she lay, drenched with red blood-her heart's blood! She stole my Henry's heart, but, Oh, she broke mine! But they could not keep me. I saw her ghost; it mocked me, it mouthed at me, it squeaked and jabbered, but I outran itk and I have capught Henry; yes, this is he. Do you not know me?" .. With this I gazed upon the white face of the woman by the pallid blaze of: the moon, and the film of drunkenness fell from my eyes. The countenance was beautiful, but the expression terrific; the eyes were mad-wildly, fearfully, glaringly mad! She burst into a hollow, fiendish laugh - the laugh of the maniac! it rings in my ears at this instant-then suddenly wheel- ing, she flew with a speed like a bird from me, before it occurred to me to follow. The moment I recovered my thoughts, I found myself sitting upon the slab of a tomb in the, city churchyard, and saw her flying form passing by the white monuments of death.

At the end of this time I had protracted my walk one day until late at night, when returning, worn out with labor and almost hopeless, I heard the cry of "fire!" I walked on slowly round the corner, feeling I had no interest at stake, when suddenly I beheld through the darkness, that it was my own house. I forgot my weariness in an instant, and flew to the spot; I found the crimson tongues of flame licking out at every window, and a dense volume of inky smoke rolling in a fiery sheet around it. I made my way through an alley to the little back-yard, and essayed in vain to mount the small porch and reach the window of the chamber where Mrs. HonHeur usually slept; but the .heat was so intense I could not approach it. In front of the house, in the street, was heard the loud rattle of hee es the envoeiferous shouts of the firemen, and the roar and confiiion consequent upon conflagration.
