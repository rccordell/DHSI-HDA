It was upon one of the loveliest Sabbath' mornings-of early Summer, the delightful Climate of Delaware, and in oneof he t  [The remarkable and deeply affecting narrative which followdetls events which occurred only two years ago, 1852, in the beautiful little villag e of MMATTA , Delaware situated on a branch of the River Brandywin, in the finest and most romantic portion of that lite State,; and as the facts which stho had one itten y and eyeoitne of the prac ul and ip al cen and y Rid Ausco tmlihed of irlthe delightful state of Delaware,  and n one of th e mosart rmant his portions of the State, that the awful event occurred which forms tyears a hi posief subject of this narrative. Near the little villag'of MATTAWANivedth the . Charles toray of Great Brtain, which retired Clergyman,   a widower of advantage and of ample fortune,  a good man at heart one sond and one daerous thugh pteroud and beaughly accomplished ir about eighteen years of age, the pride and solae of his heart in his declining years. Mr. Worthington was an Englishman by birth, and was educated for the English Church, and held for many years a high position in that church in his native country. He had a ipe. University educa- tion, and had mixed much with the aristoracy of Great Britain, which sad given to his manner a  ght a very au isoghlty air But he was good man at. heart, Cuc a nd ind an generous, thaugh proud and haughty a n manners. Indeed, his pride had been somewhat humbled by events   which occurred in his family before he left England, which it is not neces. sary to relate, as they have no special connection with this story. Suffice it to say that Mr. Austin came to this country with a large fortune, when his daughter was only three years of age and theron an infant, and pur. chased a small but beautiful estate at the place above named. The little girl, who was christened MARY CAROLIN AVTIS, wa as. beautiful as a little fairy when a child, and as she advanced in years and budded into womanhood, manifested the most brilliant gifts ofrmind and the most dazzling charms:of person. At the period of which we write, she was in the very perfection of her loveliness. She was a girl of full medium stature, lively and spirited in her manners, and yet often of a dignified and queen-like air, which deeply impressed the spectator with a sense of passion and of power yet undeveloped. Her features were exquisitely regular and fine, and so plastic and expressive that you could see the very emotions of her heart pass across her face, as you often see shadows come and go upon a landscape on a changeable summer's day. Her hair was black and glossy and richly abundant; and her eyes were bright and black, and looked so laughing, so witty, and so deep and tender by turns, that you could not but look at them with the deepest interest. Miss Austin was educated by her father with the most watchful care, and with no regard to expense.' She was sent to the best academies at Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore, and she had private tutors at home, and her fater also devoted himself to the task of assisting and directing her education with the greatest earnestness, particularly in refer. ence to her moral and religious training. The young woman exhibited talents which well repaid all this cultivation; and long before the time when the twful scenes which we are about to describe took place, " Mary Carry," as she was familiarly called, was celebrated throughout the coun. try where she visited for her extreme beauty and her varied learning and accomplishments. She seemed to be a universal genius, and was equally famous for her skill in painting, music, singing, dancing, and other polite arts. She also wrote poetry, (published in the Wilmington papers,) which ws much admired, and was thought by many to be the production of the "Milford Bard," a celebrated poet in that State, now deceased'. But with all these attractions, the Rev. Mr. Austin observed in his daughter traits of character which made, him tremble for her happiness, She was tender ,and loving, but she was also fiery and pashionate at times, and fearfully violent. She was religious and devotel to the practice ox   every virtue, but shfe was so' imaginative and fond of poetry and ro- mances and novel-reading tiat the poor father found it i hard task to keep her strong and excitable mind from wandering in forbidden paths. She was in truth, at this dangerous period of life, a beautifiiland bril- liant girl, full of life And feeling and passion-; 'kind and loving, yet wild' and haughty and imperious; religious, yet wayward and thoughtless; the admiration, the wonder, and the fear of her friends. As the reader will readily suppose, so' beautiful a creature as" ,Mary Carry," and an heiress too, would not long escap' the attentions of young people of the other sex; aind such we indeed, and too unhappily, the case. Mary Austin had many lovers. Too early they began to pursue her, and earnestly did they keep up the pursuit.. Whenever she returned from school, some gay young fellow from the city was sure to appear in the village 'f Mattawan soon after, avowedly for the purpose of hunting or fishing in the neighborhood, but soon it would be found that he was - acquainted 'with the lovely 'inmate of the Parsonage, (as her father's house was called,) and the game, he eoughlwaa not that which abounds iv woods, and streams .     - , The young girl received all 'these attentions with the most perfect good nature, without coquetry and without disdain; she seemed to enjoy the life which had opened before her. with: the.-greatest zest, and often gave way to fits of, gushing-humor and laughing sport, which some construed into evidences of a loose and vicious character. To say the' truth, her father watched -her with a jealous eye, and was much alarmed by her  mixed and wayward nature. Rev. Mr.-Austin had very lofty and ambitious feelings himself, and he wished his daughter to form some great alliance. He was therefore' fear- ful that she might make some misstep in early life, or form an attachment for some one below her in rank and, fortune- He was therefore much disturbed when he found that 'his daughter appeared much pleased with the person and manners of a young man, the son of a neighboring far. mer, named EDGAR WORTHNGTON, who' had grown up along with Mary Austin, and had known her from early' childhoodand who, like the beau- tiful Mary,had been sent away to school, and -had now returned, after seeing something of life, a tall, handsomie fellow, with a figure like a graceful young Hercules, a brilliant complexion, bold, piercing eyes, splendid white teeth, a delicate silken moustache, and a hand and foot as beautiful as a woman's     But Edgar Worthington was the son of a common ,farmer-an honest, worthy man, it is true, but not distinguishedly birth, education or wealth. He had been educated partly by the aid of a kind old uncle in New' York, who took a fancy to the boy, and assisted his father to send him to college, which he left before, completing his education, and went into a, store in New York. He also left the store, for what reason was not known at home, and,by the aid of-money given him by his uncle was now living without employment. Often while at school and college, Edgar Worthington came home, during vacations, and afterwards yhile at New York, and always spent much of his time in the society of the lovely Mary, who, it was easy to see, favored his Attentions more decidedly than those of her more wealthy suitors. Edgar was a constant attendant at church, and en assistant in the Sabbath school, where he was sure to see the object of his desires; and after, as they walked home together towards her father's, the people could not help admiring the pair, and reflecting what a measureless de- gree of hope and love and poetry and passion there was in those two noble hearts, now throbbing so ardently, and yearning so fondly towards. each other, little dreaming what an awful fate awaited them. The good old father (good, though distorted as he was in his ideas of the world) saw the growing regard for young Worthington with anything but pleasure. He did not consider it a match, sufficiently elevated for his daughter, and he had a kind of fear that. there, was something secret and sinister in the character of the young man, concealed under that manly but somewhat too voluptuous form, that masculine gnd yet effeminate- face; and he urged- his daughter not to permit him to visit her, or wait upon her so freely. 'But he was too late with his precaution. The young people were already lovers; fond, devoted, passionate lovers; they had told their loves . hundred times they had embraced and sworn eternal constancy, and kissed thevery essence of their hearts out upon each other's lips-the "long, long kiss of youth and 'love"-that kiss which thrills -the human soul with ecstacy never to be exceeded in intensity of bliss by any other earthly sensation. Mary knew very well that her father disapproved of her, regard for young Worthington long ere he spoke to her on the Subject ; and knowing his proud and imperious character, she did not dare to tell him what had occurred between them. "Mary," said Mr. Austin, one 'day, some two or three months before   '9   AND EDGAR W'RTUHWtTON;           18 the opening of this 'narrative, "Mary, my dear, you are a good child; you have always kept your word with me, and I, wish to ask a promise of you. "What is it, father?" said the girl, going up to him, and parting his silver hair, while she turned red and pale by flashes,eidently excited by his, serious manner.      "You consider a solemn promise the most sacred of obligations, do you not? So I have taught you," continued he. "I do, indeed!" exclaimed the girl earnestly, no doubt thinking of her promises of love and devotion exchanged with her favorite Edgar. "Well,then," added Mr. Austin, " you- are soon to be your own mis- tress, and I shall lose my legal control- over you; but as you" are my only hope, I beg you to grant me one favor in returnrfor my years of devotion to your interests, and that. is, (and he looked at her with a piercing glance that seemed to penetrate-her very heart,) and that is,a promise that you! will never marry without my knowledge .or conaent-at least not (he added with trembling voice) while I live. Will you promise me this 1" - The poor girl, with all her spirit and daring, was stricken, as' it were, to the very earth by the suddenness of this appeal. She was not pre- pared for it. 'If he had asked' her if she loved Eidgar Worthington, she would have confessed the truth. If he had asked her to promise uot to. marry Edgar Worthington, she was too pure hearted to practise decep. tion, and she would have refused the promise.' But the question took her by surprise; it was ingeniously put, and the fatal promise was given. She answered--  "Yes, father, I promise it-!"  "Solemnly and with- God to witness your plighted word," he added. "'I do! I do 1" exclaimed the almost frantic girl, excited by the singu- larity of her father's conduct, and beginning-to fear that she had done wrong to give such a promise. The old man then raised his daughter from the floor, where she had fallen, and impressed a kiss upon 'her forehead (his lips were icy cold,.she noticed) and blessed her. No other words were spoken. A few days after this scene with her father, Mary Austin met her lover by accident, at 'the hlouse of a friend, and learned Xthat her father had called upon him in'a formal manner, and requested him'to abstain from' visiting his daughter, and informed him 'that he would never sanction a   12   MARY CAR6INF, AUSTIN    MARY CAROLINE AUSTIN   union between them, and-that his daughter was pledged by a sacred vow, never to marry without his consent. Mary," said he, "is this true? Have you given such a promise to your father?" "I have! O, fatal-error If exclaimed the fond, passionate girl, hiding her face against the broad chest of her lover, as if she wished to shut out some fearful vision from her sight. He embraced her tenderly and ardently, speechless A  trembling with indignation and strange fear of the future. From this hour the lovers hastened rapidly and madly to their-fate. The very impediment which had sprung up in their path, served but to excite the flame of love which burned in their bosoms. They met clan- destinely, and embraced each other-more passionately than ever. Miss Austin was' evidently in a  perfect  chaos of Iove, religion, poetry, filial affection, pride, passion, fear, and  almost revenge. Edgar was equally excited. That he loved the beautiful an'd accomplished girl, there can be no doubt, perhaps as truly as, any other man has ever loved, though some have suspected that the wealth of the   lovely heiress was by  no means lightly regarded   And now  that the  precious treasure of love, if not of gold, was  denied him, he became wrought up to a  pitch of feeling which seemed almost like insanity. e   could not sleep, he could hot content himself for an  hour during the day, but was  forever seeking, like a mier, to watch over his treasure, as if he feared some bold. and sudden' rob- bery.  He was the more excited by the presence in the village of some young' gentlemen from Baltimore, wh  o knew Miss Austin, and spent some days - there, calling upon hey frequently, and boasting of the favor with whch they were received by the "Old Parson," as her father was often styled.  Edgar resolved to suffer, this life of  agony no longer, but to bring mat- ters to a crisis, in  some way or  other, and  end the terrible heart-ache which all parties suffered. With this viewa he sent a note to Mary, and proposed to m eet her in a  little grove near her father's house on S abbath morning, before the hour for church. A portion of what follows we know only from the statement afterwards made by Edgar himself.   AND- EDGAR WORTHNGTON./   15   We now return to the opening of our narrative. u' It was that calm and beautiful Sabbath morning described in the first page of this melancholy history. The air was still and heavy with- the' odors of wild flowers and fragrant leaves and buds, and eloquent with the songs of happy birds. The music of the Sabbath bells, from bhurches far and near, fell gently and sweetly upon the ear, as if mellowed by the very stillness and richness of the atmosphere.  And- now stepped forth with hurried feet and beating heart, from that fine old Parsonage; the beautiful Mary Austin, dresse4 a11 in white like a bride; and swinging her bonnet in one hand. She walked rapidly'towards the grove where she had passed many a happy hour with her lover. Edgar Worthington was already at the grove, pacing back :and forth with hasty strides, and waiting the arrival of the ill-fated girl. They met. Edgar's wild looks and disordered apparel alarmed the young woman, but she soox began to ymipathise with his feelings, (so he after- wards said.) A piercing shriek-the wild cry of a female voice-'now rent the still air. The sound evidently proceeded from the grove where Mary and: Edgar met.,                      - Rev. Mr. Austin was aroused by this cry, and came to the door of his mansion. Hie saw a large number of persons who were passing along the road, on their way to church, leaving the public path and crossing his field to the grove. A fearful thought flashed upon his mind. - A crowd soon collected at the grove. O, horror' i what a spectacle was there! The lovely and accomplished Mary Austin, with her throat cUe and gashed, the blood bursting forth at every pulsation of the heart, over her long white robes, was lying upon the earth, loclked in the embrace of her lover, Edgar Worthington, whose throat was also cut, and who was bleeding profusely I The blood of the dying losers mingled ia one stream as it, flowed between them, and over the lips of each, which were Still glued together in passionate, bloody kisses! The Rev. Mr. Austin was among the first who reached the spot,.ati4 witl the rest fell back aghast far an instant befoire the awful sight. Then without saying a word, he reached forward, and with almost superhuman power seized the body of his daughter, and wrenching her from the grasp of the dying, man, raised her up and bord her off rapidly towards his house, crying. "Call a surgeon! Call a surgeon!"   i4     MARY CAROLINE AUSTIN Some of the imediate friends of the clergyman followed him, some ran for a surgeon, and others of the 'party remained with the bleeding Edgar, who by this'time was insensible. On anexiamination of the ground, two razors were found, only one of * them, however, bloody. The grass also, it was noticed, showed some evidence that a struggle had taken place, as it was much trampled and disordered. Miss Austin fainted while her father was bearing her home, but revived for a moment after she was placed upon a couch. It was evident that she would die. . The wound was a wide and ghastly one, and had so far pene- trated the great arteries that all hope of saving her life was vain. Her father saw this at a glance, and with admirable presence of mind ques- tioned her as to the manner in which she received the wound. "Tell me! - tell me! by some sign, if you can-nod or press my hand for yes,' or push my hand away for 'no '-dj Edgar Worthington do this deed V'  The poor dying girl, choking and gurgling with blood, and in the ago- nies of parting from  body, pushe body, pushed the hand of her father convulsively away, which the people interpreted into an answer, " no." "Was this your own act, my dearest daughter 7 was it? was it?" again inquired the agonized parent.     . The dying girl looked up with great. intelligence in her eyes, smiled sweetly upon the spectators, grasped her father's hand with an iron grasp which never again relaxed its- hold, nodded once for all-and died. A sensible man in the crowd which bent over the body of Edgar Wor- thington, made a compress with his handkerchief, and binding it upon the bleeding arteries and veins, checked the flow of blood until a shrgeon ar- rived, when it was found' that the wounds were not immediately fatal; and by skilful treatment the young. man was brought back from a state of seeming death unto life. He was much reducedin strength by the hemor- rhage, and lingered for many days in a very doubtful condition, but finally recovered.  It is no part of our design, in writing this narrative, to picture the va- rious scenes which followed the tragical death of Mary Austin-the heart- rending agony of the gray-haired father, strong as he was in mind at first, yet a child in feeling when d1i was over-the appalling gloom which spread over the little village of Mattawan-the alarm which pervaded the    AND EDGAR WORTHNGTON.           17 hearts of the village maidens; the awful sense of insecurity which filled the minds of parents who had sons and daughters brave and lovely, like those who had fallen; the various stories which were toldk about the de- parted fair one and her noble lover ; the dreadful notdei f preparation made by the officers of justice, -with a view to unravel the myitery of this extraordinary suicide or murdeir who could fathom it? As soon as Edgar recovered his s'nses' and, his ttrength' sfficiently to speak, he was questioned by the Coronerh ansd . Jus'ie t le Peace re- specting the awful tragedy. He declared most somemil, ihat it was a double suicide-that Mary and himself had agreed, ' they could not be happy in life, they would die together and seek anothel world; that she inflicted the wound upon her throat with her own hand, with 6One razor, and that he cut his throat with the other, and then they embraced and laid down to die together.  But it was observed that only one razor was bloodyi and Mary had a gash made by some sharp instrument on the back of heri iel, which she could not easily have made with her own hlnd. To this Edgar replied that he was not sure that they used different razsrs, though they had two' but that he might have seized the razor which she had' used after she had rdropped it, and that perhaps the cut on the neck was made by s6oe sharp stones as she fell. But no such stones *ere found-on the spot where she lay, and hence the idea of suicide on her art was received with much doubting by many persons.. Two strong parties, the friends of Rev. Mr. Austin and of Edgar Worthington, tow spOung up in the village, the first declaring that it- was a pure and undoubted murder inithe afist degree, and the other-that it was an attempted double suicide.. The last asserted firmly, that Mary Austin had declared, is plainly as he could' while dy- ing, that she came to her' death by her own act, aid not by the hands of Edgar Worthington; but the others denied this, and affirimd that' the poor girl was too far gone, When; questioneda upon the subject, to speak, or to make any reliable signs, even if she had her senses sufficiently clear to do so'. Among the party opposed to the idea of suicide,. Rev. Mr. Austin was' the most violent and vindictive, and sought the life of Edgar with. a degree of earnestness which it was painful to behold.  The Coroner's Jury held an inquest upon' &e dbody of the deceased. The remains of the beautiful girl were' laid tim p , a coarse table, in her blood-stained dress, just as she fell, with ler blo6%dy lips parted with a   MARY CFAROLINE AUSTIN   .' sweet yet awful expression, her eyes, as dark and brilliant as in life, open and starting,- her hair dishevelled and matted with clots of blood, and .her pure breast, so white and delicate, streaked and dabbled with the crimson current which had gushed from her fond and passionate heart. O it was a sight to make a pirate weep, to behold that lovely body thus rent and desecrated, and all for lose, the sweetest, dearest, noblest feeling of the human soul. And when the old man, her father, came in to give his testimony, and the body was carefully covered, out of respect to his feelings, he rushed forward, tore off the-covering, and falling upon the body, kissed her cold cheeks with terrible eagerness and wept tears almost bloody, and groaned as if his soul would burst its confines and leave this world of sorrow to join his daughter's spirit in another sphere of existence. The Jury, after a long consultation, returned a verdict, that in their opinion Mary Caroline Austin came to her death by the hands of Edgar Worthington-a result very generally anticipated., The evidence was then passed over to the Grand Juiy, an indictment was framed' and the accused was put in irons and securely held for trial. In the meantime the, remains of Mary Austin were consigned to the tomb. The ceremonies were deeply affecting, and were attended by a vast concourse of people from the neighboring towns? and villages. A fu- neral sermon was preached by a young clergyman from Baltimore, Rev. Francis Young; ao minister who had known the parties could summon t ourage to perform that painful duty. The sermon was extremely elo- quent and touching. After the discourse, a simple hymn was sung by the young ladies of the Sabbath, School where Mary had been a teacher. The singers were all dressbd in white, with a wreath of white flowers upon their heads. The hymn was a simple one, appropriate to the occa- sion, beginning--         . "Sister, thou wast mild and lovely, Gentle as the summer breeze." It was sung to a plaintive air, and drew tears from many eyes unused to weep. Rev. Mr. Austin seemed utterly broken-hearted, and went through the ceremonies as if almost unconscious of existence; and when the grave closed over the remains of his daughter, sunk down cold and insensible, and had to be-lifted into his carriage. His son, Richard Aus- tin, then about sixteen years of age, attended his father with watchful    AND EDGAR WORTHO-GTON.             19 care, and it was noticed that he indulged feelings even more vindictive and revengeful than his father, towards the person who caused his sister's death.  The trial of Edgar Worthington at lengthtook place and resulted ia 6 verdict of GUILTY OF MTUDER in the first degree, after much difficulty nla a general expectation that the Jury wouldst agree. T   e lim its of lhis work will not permit us to give a detailed acount of the tial, tose who desire to do so, can get a full report of the case, as published at the time, by order of the Court. Edgar conducted himself in a very modest and commendable manner during the trial, and his fine, frank, noble countenance and elegant manners won him many friends. He appeared deeply affected at times by the evidence, and the remarks of the counse1l, and set for hours with his face buried in his hands. He bore the verdict and the sentence like a man, with blanched face and qulvering lip, evi- denty struggling with deep emotloiibut still like' a man who could brave death. As soon as the trial-was over ana Edgarhad been condemned to deat the public feeling which had pursued him to this point began to relax, and then came a reaction. There was a doubt hanging over the question of murder. Edgar still protested his innoenceofthe rime, and it began to be felt that. ie had been persecuted. Rev. Mr. Austin and his eon Richard had been so violent that their conduct had excited some ill-feel- ing against them. Besides, Rev.'Mr. Austin was looked upon as an Eng- lish aristocrat with ill concealed feelings of dislike by many persons. -Edgar Worthington was a handsome, noble-heartedyoung American, and his father was an honest, worthy American farame. Nati6nal prejudies began to be'excited. Was not 'old 'Mr. Worthington as much an object of sympathy as Mr. Austin? This question was asked and answered in the affirmative by a large party.' ' A plan was soon formed, which it was suspeeted- the Sheriff of the county favored, to gain the pardon of the condemned young man, or a , commutation of his punishment from the Governor. Petitions were -cir- culated and numerouly signed, and taken to the Executive by able o0un- e ed and n um r.     ..   20          MARY CAROLINE AUSTIN sel. The people anxiously awaited the answer. It came at last. The petition was rejected-the young man mast die upon the scaffold, and that speedily. An awful atillness seemed to pervade the town the evening on which that answer was returned. Very few words were uttered, either of regret or revenge, but many strange glances were exchanged and secret whispers were breathed, and men were seqn busily moving to and fro in the village as if some great and appalling danger was near. At midnight, near the county prison, not far from Mattawan, might be seen d collcation of people silently moving towards the grim edifice.. The nigh'was dark, and the prison was wrapped in the deepest gloom. No sound was heard, save the light- tread of men, slowly and stealthily up- proaching the prison walls. Now, all at once, ladders were raised against the wall in different places, and the forms of men might be dimly seen scaling the enclosure. One after another they dropped down into the yard. The keepers of the prison were no doubt wrapped in sleep. Pre- sently a violent crash was heard inside the yard, as of a door suddenly burst open! At the'same instant the great gate was rent and forced asunder by a strong force outside, who had fastened a fire-hook to it, with a hundred men at the rope. The crowd outside now rushed in, with shouts; the keeper's house was open; the keepers were seized and held in durance by a strong guard of men, all. disguised; the prison keys were seized, the cell in which Edgar Wdrthington lay confined was opened, and he was brought forth by friendly hands, placed in a carriage and hurried rapidly away. It was thought by some that the keepers were in the plot and the sheriff too; but this was mere suspicion, though it was a little singular that they could never identify any one of the persons who com- mitted this daring deed. Edgar Worthington however was safely off, and no one knew whither he had. gone, or at any rate no one would tell. Great was the excitement in the village and neighborhood produced by this event, and loud the talk. As soon as it- was known to the Governor; he offered a large reward for the arrest of the fugitive, and several of the friends of Rev. Mr. Austin, with some officers, set off in pursuit. It was scarcely thirty days before news was reeeived that he had been taken prisoner. No one could believe it. It wasi thought impossible that an escape so well planned c6uld be frustrated after so long a starte ahad L.               AND EDGOAIR V lTHTNGTON.        ' 21.  of the officers. Bat so it was. - dgar was carried to an obscure place on the Allegheny Mountains, where it was designed to keep himn till the pur- su1it should be over, and then send him off to Europe in some vessel,: in disguise. It is supposed that the plot-leaked out, or some hint of it, from some of-the party 'concerned, or the. plan was guessed at. Sufficeit to say that he was followed to the place of concealment, discovered, avnd pounced upon by the officers. He fought bravely and resolutely, and again escaped, but was fired at by the officers and twice brought down by shot wounds in his legs, before he was finally recaptured. In heavy chains and handcuffs the .prisonor was conducted back to' prison, and a force of military was detailed by the authorities to prevent any further attempt at rescue on the part of his friends. The day appointed for the execution was rapidly drawing near. There. seemed to be no hope of escape. Edgar still maintained a stout heart, thoughl by no means defying death or dishonor, and protested his inno- cence of the crime of murder to all who conversed with him. -His father visited him and besought him -ot to go to the scaffold' with a lie upon his: lips if he was really guilty, but to confess the truth, and make his peace with Heaven ere it was too late. 'Edgar assured him that he was no mur- derer, and that he :should die with, courage, even the ignominious dea th before himi.  But the authorities feared that he would escape the, saffold in some way or other, If not by rescue at least by suicide. All weapons and means of self-destruction were therefore removed from his cell, and his clothing and bed were searched for hidden poison. He was. also so chained' that he could not suspend himself with a rope or blanket, and thus anticipate the' office of the gallows.      '. The friends of the unfortunate youth were, however, by no means idle. They-devised all sorts of plans to save his life, for the public sympathy in his behalf was great. It was doubtful if he had committeda murder, and he had been sufficiently punished for his indiscretions already, and deserved his life for his gallant conduct in this distressing affair. A young surgeon frpih New York, who had known Edgar in that city, came to Mattawan quite by accident, as he said, and hearing of the situ- ationi of his friend, asked permission of the Sheriff to visit him, which was granted. The interview was quite'private, and lasted for along time. The surgeon told the people that Edgar had desired him to rem nin near B ?    w5    22          IMARY CAROLINE AUSTIN him till the last awful scene was over, and to take charge of his body and see it properly disposed and interred, and this he had agreed to do. Under this arrangement the young surgeon was admitted daily to visit Edgar, and indeed became his chief counsellor and friend, and received all his commissions and last requests. Only one day now remained, and one night, before the execution must talre place. Edgar was still alive, contrary to the confident predictions of his enemies-for enemies he had, earnest and malignant, who longed to seehim'suspended between Heaven and earth. Such is human nature! But Edgar was still alive, brave in heart, and almost cheerful in aspect. Many wondered at this, and many condemned hip for his coldness and want of feeling, and said he was a hardened villain. Others charitably, attributed his calmness to a sense of innocence and christian resignation, and admired him and wept for him all the more. The women and the girls pronounced him an angel of goodness and a monster of iniquity by turns, half a dozen times a day, as the popular breezes seemed to blow. The fatal mornting dawned and found Edgar still firm and calm, though pale and serious, and ready for his awful fate. As he parted with his friends, he could scarcely speak, and the tears .would now and then .start into his eyes, but he-did not weep. His father was too much distressed to see him. His mother was not living, and he had no brothers or sisters at home.  Finally the last words were spoken, the last hand was grasped, and the Sheriff came into the cell to-lead forth the prisoner.' The young surgeon was still his faithful attendant, and remained near his person to the last. The gallows was erected in-the prison yard, an awful old la- chine which had lain idle for many years, and seemed almost/ unfit for The, military guarded the passage from the prison to the scaffoid, marching iii solid double columns on either side of the civil force. A limited number of persons were admitted into the yard, and the gate and grounds of the prison were watched by a force of special police, selected, for the occasion. It was noticed, however, that the policemen were nearly all Edgar's friends, and it was believed that the Sheriff favored his in. terests.   AND E-I)GAR WORTHNGTON.    .3 Edgar ascended the .scaffold with a firm step, but with an airofIlhe deepest dejection and distress. Religious ceremonies were then peformed in the usual manner, during which the prisoner exhibited the utmost calmness, and knelt down while the prayer was uttered, in the most rever- ential manner. -The Sheriff then asked the prisoner if he had 'anything to say before the last act of juatice was perfornmed. He replied that he had, and coming forward, addressed the people.

"Edgar Worthington, with a tremulous voice, said-7  "I feel it a duty which I owe to the many kind friends who have hon- ored me with their regard, to declare in this public manner my innocence of the crime for which I now stand condemned. I should feel myself unworthy of that regard, unworthy to live, unfit to die, if I had permitted myself to indulge in falsehood upon this point with my friends. -No, I have spoken truth, and I now speak truth in reference to this matter, when I say that I am innocent of the crime with which I am charged. I did not murder Mary Austin. With all the passion which burned in my soul, with all the madness which racked my brain, I was not mad or wicked enough to take that precious life with my own hands. The at- tempt to commit suicide was mutual-it was an agreement fairly entered into by both of us. It was talked over long before, and often, and the time was mutually decided upon. We met for that very purpose. O! would to Heaven we had been successful! The fatal act was committed by boeti at the same moment. Mary Austin screamed as she struck the blow, and failed to effect her purpose completely. I supposed that I had'done the deed for myself effectually. We both fell,-and Mary again applied the razor to her throat, and begged me to aid her. Frantic as I was, and wild with excitement, I seized her hand, what I did H know not, but I feel in my heart, absolved of the crime of murder. But I do not say I am guiltless of any offence. I now feel that'I was guilty of a fearful offence, when I permitted myself to indulge the idea of suicide, and more guilty, aye darkly and deeply guilty, when I united with her who has gone before me to the spirit land, to plan that awful death. But O, my friends, pardon me, as I hope Heaven has pardoned mfe in response to my prayers, for this dreadful deed. I was mad!. I was frantic! I was beside myself! I knew not what I did in those hours of suffering. , I was in love with an angel-a love so deep, so ardent, so absorbing, no words can de- scribe it. My love was returned, deeply, fondly, fully. Our hearts were united too firmly to be,separated while life should last. The consumma- tion of that love was denied by one who should have been a friend 'to both. Life seemed to us no longer desirable. To me all the world was a blank void. The sun no longer shone-the very heavens seemed hung     - '  AND EDOCAR VOBTHNGTON.           27 with black, Mary-my now sainted Mary-declared ;that to die would be a happiness. I sympathised with this feeling, and rashy agreed to seeli with her, relief from our woes in death. Her fatal vow, ,hich you know so, well, was the cause of all. I wish to utter no reproaches now. But O, you fathers, beware how you, in your cold-blooded age, seek to decide affairs of love for the warm and ardent'hearts of your children. Beware how you thwart their young affections, and seek to bind them with even chains of gold to your ambitious purposes. And O, you young men and you maidens, You now see one who is the victim of unregulated feel- iugs and unrestrained passion, though that passion was the sacred one of love: beware! O, beware, how you rashy indulge the idea of self-destruc- tion as a means of escaping from the ills of life i but rather seek, by wise control of your feelings and the aid of religion, to bear the illsayou have, instead of rushing upon greater ills, as I have. done, ending perhaps in a felon's death I But now I must meet my doom, and I wish to do so at peace with all the world and at peace with Heaven, whose forgiveness 'I have sought with a devout and penitent heart. "Those who have injured me, I freely and fully forgive, and of those whom I have injured I beg forgiveness. To those who have been kidcl and charitable towards me, I offer the heartfelt thanks of a dying man. I have but one request to make, whiph is, that when I am dead my body may not be laid in" a felon's grave, or given up to rude hands for dese- oration. O, I can brave death, but my soul shrinks with horror from the idea of having my remains made the subject of unfeeling----  (Here his utterance was choked by his rising emotions, and he bent his. 4ead and hastily wiped away his tears, while the tears of the spectators flowed freely in sympathy. - He then proceeded.)- I beg that no unknown 'or rude hands- may get possession of my remains. I b ge that my body may not be laid in a felon's grave. For O, I feel that I am no murderer-I am no felon. I am guilty--I am unfortunate--but I am no murderer. I call on Heaven to witness that I am not. I ask for no monuinent-I ask for no epitaph. I only ask permission for my body to lie quietly in the bosom of the earth, unmarked by signs of infamy. I ask that my friend Dr. Kelly may have possession of my body, and to his care I implicitly confide my remains. (The Sheriff here nodded assent.) With these words I now bid you all a long, an affectionate farewell." * The prisoner then shook hands with the Sheriff, Dr. Kelly, and other friends, his arms were tied behind him, the black cap was drawn over his   MARY CAROLINE AUSTIN face, the rope was adjusted upon his neck, the drop fell, and Edgar Wor- thington hung suspended by the neck, according to the,dread Sentence of the law, le struggled but little, and all seemed overof The spectators in the prisn yard, and the immense -oncourse of people who had climbed upon the prison walls and upon the buildings and house tops in the neighborhood, now began to disperse, many of them with tear- ful eyes, all with sad hearts and melancholy faces, the women clinging closer to their husbands and lovers, as if fearful that they too might meet with some awful fate ere they had got beyond the view of this dismal scene,  When the body had hung w the time required 1y law, it was cut down and passed intoathe hands of Dr. Kelly, who had it put into a carriage and removed to the house of a friend near by. Th next dy a quiet u neral was held, attended by the Sheriff and a few friends; and the body of the unfortunate young mn was buried by the village sexton, in the public burial ground, agreeably to the last wish of the deceased, and a watch was kept over -he grave for several weeks, by order of Dr. Kelly, to prevent any chance of disinterment.    ' The excitement which had so long existed in the neighborhood, i o- sequence of the appalling events herein narrated, began to die away, and quiet was once more restored to'the minds of the people. Now sprung up fresh and most unforeseen causes of excitement and wonder. Captain Karsoll, an old citizen of Mattawan, who had been in Oregon for several years, returned to his native town, and immediately on his arrival (having, heard just before he reached home of the trial and execution of Worthington) declared that he met the young man on the California route, just beyond St. Joseph. Missouri, as he was coming into that place. He said Worthington was evidently disguised, but the prac- ticed eye of the old hunter was not to be'deceived.  He had known 'hir I ryears, and recognised him at once, and spoke to him. Worthington  nicd. his name and all, knowledge of the Captain, but he was ready te ear he was not mistaken, and would swear to it now, although the peo   /      . AND EDGAR WORTHNGTON.           29 ple assured him that the young man was beyond all question executed and buried according to law. So positive was Captain Karsoll of the fact that he had seen Worthing- ton tn the plains, that the people finally induced the sexton to open the grave and examine the coffin. A great crowd assembled to witness the disinterment. The'grave had evidently not been disturbed since it was made. On reaching the bottom, the coffn was still there, and was as heavy as wheh lowered into' the earth; but on removing the lid, lo! there was no body in it, but instead, a log of wood, shrouded in grave clothes, with a masi of wax resembling the young man, having so much the ap- pearance of a real-body that many persons at first supposed it was the corpse itself!' There was material for a terrible excitement I How was all this done?' Who had done it?  Was' Worthington really executed, or was he not?' Was he still alive?, If so, by what miracle or what secret art had lie es- caped from death ' Who could tell Everybody said it was Dr. Kelly's ivork. No one else,could have done it. But how could he do it? There 'was the mystery. If Worthington was suffocated, how could he bring him to life? If his neck was broken, how could Dr. Kelly mend it? Or. did he- have an iron collar on, with braces going under his arms, so tlat he was not choked at all? This last idea was declared to be totally un- founded, for the Sheriff and half a dozen more persons saw his bare neck when the rope was adjusted, and there was no collar or other protection upon it. How then did he 'escape from death? 'Or had he escaped? Here wa's doubt and mystery enough to set the town wild with excitement. The more they tallied about it and the more. they reasoned, upon the whole. event, the more fully did the people become convinced ,thiat Wor. thington was still alive.  The next thing of consequence that was heard of'in connection with this matter, was, that Richard Austin, the brother of the deceased girl, had started for California with a party of friends who were going to that land of gold from New York. Mr. Austin had sanctioned his going and given him ample imeans for the journey. He said nothing of his designs before leaving, but from the sudden resolution which he had taken on hearing Captain Karsoll's story and seeing the disinterment of Worthington's coefin, the object of his journey was thought to be, not the desire for wealth or adventuie, but revenge, if, Worthington were really alive. Dick Austin, as he was called, was at this time quite a youth in age,   80    -      MARY CAROLINE AUSTIN but he was of large size for one of his years, and a fierce, high-spirited fellow, partaking largely of his father's character and feelings. He was notorious for his quarrels and fights, and was considered lrather a rough and headstrong boy. No one was surprised that he had gone off to Cali- fornia to seek the"' murderer of his sister,' as he invariably called the unfortunate Worthington.  Time passed on, and nearly a year had expired before anything of in- terest to the reader was heard from Richard Austin, who was still in Cal- ifornia, when at last a letter was received from him which sent a thrill of horror and astonishment through the hearts of the people of Mattawan as soon as its contents were made known. Rev. Mr. Austin could not conceal the satisfaction and pride which this letter gave him, and he showed it freely to his friends, and copies of it were taken and handed about, and a portion of it soon got into the newspapers and excited the greatest in- terest by the singular nature of its .details. The extract of Richard Austin's letter to his father, which was published, read as follows  "DEAR FATHER  I have a most extraordinary piece of intelligence to communicate to you. The story which Captain Karsoll told us about seeing Edgar Worthington. near St. Joseph, was true. He did 'escape from the gallows alive, and calue out to California. I could hear nothing of him here for many months; but three days ago I Tet him accidentally at the Clifton Diggins, from which I now write. He was in a drinking ailoon, and was much intoxicated and'delirious from the effects of liquor. I knew'him at once, although hemhad evidently sought to disguise himself with heavy whiskers and moustache, green spectacles, &c. - His face ex- hibited the most haggard and ghastly appearance, the effects no doubt of bardship, intemperance and disease. I knew him at a glance, but he did  not appear to recognize me. I then-spoke to him, saying, "H1ow are you, Edgar " 'The sound of my voice, calling that name, appeared to rouse him from his delirious condition, and he looked up, wild and -trembling, and exclaimed, "Who are you? Who are you talking to '! using foul       AND EDGAR WORTHNGTON.           38 and profane epithets, which I will not repeat. I replied coolly, "I am Richard Austin, whose sister you murdered, and you are Edgar Wor- thington, a fugitive from the gallows! There was a crowd of people in the saloon, and they all started back with surprise and fear at. this an- nouncement. Edgar sprung into an attitude of defence, uttering a wild, demoniac yell, pulled off his slouched hat and a wig of false hair, reveal. ing himself, more fully to my view, and drawing a long hunting knife, exclaimed, 'Yes; villain!- I' am Edgar Worthington! I did murder your sister, and I'll murder you for a song I' and he rushed fiercely towards me-; but ere he had moved two feet I discharged my revolver, which I had  drawn as soon as I saw him, and planted a bullet deeply in his chest. He fell, uttering the most horrible yells and imprecations; convulsions ens sued, then delirium, and finally he sunk insensible on the floor of the saloon.  "He was placed upon a bed, and lingered in a state of great suffering, with short intervals of ease, till this morning, when he expired; I sur- rendered myself to the dffieers, and after a-brief examination was released, on the ground that I had fired upon 'the maniac in self-defence, which was true, for if I had failed in my aim, he would have plunged his dagger to my heart, unless providentially prevented by the crowd in the saloon. "But the most singular tart of my story is yet to come. During the / intervals of quiet before hisideath, Edgar made p. confession of the man- ner in which he escaped from the-gallows, and also acknowledged that he was idore guilty of my sister's death than he had before confessed. Hle stid that he induced her to consent to a suicide,-provided the razors, annd brought them to the place of meeting without her knowledge, directed her hand after she had failed to do the deed, and was in fact as much her murderer as if he had done the whole work himself.. "The manner of his escape from the gallows was truly extraordinary. He said that Dr. Kelly, the surgeon, was sent for by his friends to aid his escape. Dr. Kelly told' him that if he could sd fall as not to dislocate his neck or spine, he oould save his life, and as Worthington Was a strong, muscular fellow, he thought he might do it. The neck, the surgeon said, was seldom-broken in athletic subjects by hanging,'but they died by suf. focation, by the air being shut out from the lungs' Dr. Kelly said that he had frequently opened the windpipe in cases of inflammation of the throat and in croup, and cases of suffocation by getting hard substances lodged in the air passage, and that the patient could easily live and   34          MARY CAROLINE AUSTIN breathe -through a tube inserted in the windpipe below the seat of the difficulty. He thought he could operate upon the windpipe of the pris- oner, and adjust-a tube to the aperture, below the place where the rope would choke him,so that he could continue to breathe after he had fallen, if his spine should not be broken, until he was cut down, especially if the rope did not happen to obstruct the circulation of the blood in the great arteries and veins on both sides of the neck, as it rarely ever does. .Dr. Kelly said he had studied this subject with great care, as one of the ouri-: osities-of science, and had tried many experiments on animals to see if the thing could be done, and he was satisfied, by his course of study and experiment, that it was perfectly feasible, and afforded a good chance of escape. Worthington said he consented to try the experiment, and the opera- tion was performed in the most skilful and ingenious manner. A small aperture was made in the windpipe, very far down,;below the upper line of the cravat, and a silver tube was introduced, so contrived that it could be covered, enabling him still to breathe through his mouth, or uncovered, and thus breathe through the tube alone. It was by no means a painful operation, and was worn with much ease and comfort. He said he had much more difficulty in removing it and healing the wound than he had while the tube remained there; and he exhibited the wound, which was not yet thoroughly healed. "Everything worked as Dr. Kelly had predicted: The rope pressed only upon the right arteries and veins, and left the circulation of the other side somewhat free, although he was rendered almost insensible by the pressure of blood upon the brain. His neck was not broken by the fall, which you will recollect was an unusually short one, and hesuffered very little injury from the attempt at execution. He was cut, down, by the kindness of the -Sheriff, before 'the usual time had elapsed, and passed into the custody of Dr. Kelly, who immediately removed the body, applied stimulants internally and externally, and inflated his lungs artificially, and used other means of relief, such as bleeding, galvanism, &c., &c., and in two hours he was nearly as well as ever. "A sham funeral was had, a watch set over the grave, and you know the rest. Worthington was got off in the night, and travelled by private carriage to Missouri, whence he started for California with a rough party and suffered all sorts of hardships, and much difficulty with his throat, having lot the dressings which Dr. Kelly had given him to heal it.   AND EDGAR WO RTBHNGTON.     '    35 "When he related these things he was very quiet and rational, and there is no doubt of the truth of the story. I have even the silver tube which was worn in his throat. He thanked me a thousand times for being the cause of his death in the way that I was, (in self-defence,) and thus saving. him from the guilt of another murder. He said he had often wished that he had died upon the scaffold, instead of taking so much pains to preserve a life which Was useless to him, worse than useless, a torture and an agony forever while he lived. He said he had tried to lose his life repeatedly, on the plains and mountains and in the diggings, by the most reckless adventure, but he could not succeed. He seemed fated to live,-which to him was the worst of all punishments. He hated life, but he could not summon courage to rid himself of the burthen by suicide, for the very idea of it conjured up such a crowd of images that he was too insane even to do it. He had sought relief from his horrible mental sufferings, he said, in the unlimited use of alcohol and of opium when he could get it, and the use of these deadly'poisons only increased his tor- tures when he was not completely under the influence of one or both. He said he had worked in the mines, but not to get gold for the sake of gold, but to get rum and opium, and he had indulged himself iu their use with- out restraint, with no hope; no desire, but to die. "( We were compelled to give him laucanum and liquor to keep his ner- vous system sufficiently quiet to obtain this confession, for it was only when he was. partially under the influence of opiates or spirits that he was-really in his senses. At other times, the pains in his chest and the delirium tremens rendered his condition truly horrible to behold,and none but the' boldest hearts could remain in the room and witness the awful spectacle which he presented, or listen to his ravings, without the most intense and painful feeling of terror and disgust.  "At last, however, he got more quiet, and died peacefully and rational with words of deep contrition and penitence upon his lips." Thus wrote Richard Austin. 'The letter created a deep- sensation in Mattawan, and indeed, throughout the country where the incidents were known. Richard Austin soon after returned from California, but he soon perceived that Mattawan would no longer be an agreeable residence for ' him, and he induced his father to sell their property and remoye to some other part of the country. Where they have settled we do not know.   30   MARY CAROLINE AUSTIN AND EDGA     I'0ORTSIINGTON.
